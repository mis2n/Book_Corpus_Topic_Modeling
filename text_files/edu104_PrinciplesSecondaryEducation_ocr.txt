PREFACE 
This volume has been compiled for use as a textbook in 
secondary education. The need for such a textbook has grown 
out of the impossibility of otherwise making accessible the best 
articles which have appeared in periodicals. In view of the 
fact that much of the best educational literature appears in maga- 
zines, the inability to employ this literature for instructional 
purposes has amounted to a severe handicap. 
This volume makes four distinct contributions: first, it presents 
an organized collection of superior readings in secondary educa- 
tion; second, it presents comprehensive lists of principles of 
secondary education based upon the best writings of the present 
time; third, it presents a sufficient variety of education literature 
to enable teachers, if they choose, to approach each chapter by 
the problem method; and, fourth, it presents supplementary dis- 
cussions which are designed to guide students successfully through 
a large body of professional reading. 
In the use of this textbook, the principles which are stated at 
the close of each chapter can be proposed to students as theses 
w challenges to be defended or criticized by any evidence which 
udents can adduce from the readings or from any other sources. 
1 the employment of the problem method, the organization of 
hapter I is suggestive of a suitable method to pursue in the 
cudy of the later chapters. At the close of each chapter are 
suggestions for study and discussion based largely upon the 
readings. These suggestions can of course be supplemented by 
the use of such subjects for topics as those catalogued at the 
close of the book. The bibliographies are intended for use in 
connection with this work. 
Deep gratitude is here expressed to the authors of this 
TUL

volume. It is a pleasure to record that not a single refusal to 
grant permission to quote articles or passages was encountered 
in the compilation of these readings. As many abridgments and 
adaptations have been made of certain articles, the compiler 
is responsible for any apparent ineffectiveness or unclearness in 
the passages. Gratitude is expressed to the editors of magazines 
who have been no less liberal than the original writers themselves. 
Appreciation is also acknowledged of the generosity and courtesy 
of publishing companies in permitting the reproduction of pas- 
sages selected from their books. 
Finally, the author acknowledges the material assistance ren- 
dered by his colleagues who read the manuscript as a whole or 
in part: to Professor A. S. Barr and Professor John Guy Fowlkes 
for their constructive criticisms of the manuscript as a whole, to 
Professor V. A. C. Henmon for his aid in the preparation of the 
chapters on the mental equipment of secondary school pupils, 
. and to Professor A. H. Edgerton for his suggestions in the prepara- 
tion of the chapter on the guidance of secondary school pupils. 
If the passages reproduced in this volume continue to be read 
with as great profit as they have been in their original settings, 
and are read by greater numbers of students than could otherwise 
have had access to them, the purposes of this book will have 
been achieved.

THE AMERICAN PLAN FOR SECONDARY 
EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
America ACCEPTS A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION; 
Is Her Task Too Great? 
The challenge which America has accepted in secondary 
education. In her provisions for secondary education, America 
is more liberal than any other nation. While other nations 
commonly exact a tuition fee for higher school privileges, 
America not only offers freedom of her schools but for certain 
pupils whose homes are remote from any high school even pro- 
vides transportation to her schools. For instance, certain states 
not only open the pathway to secondary education but also 
compel attendance beyond the elementary school by statutory 
provisions." 
This liberality in the provision of secondary education is the 
natural and necessary result of the acceptance of a clearly defined 
challenge. This challenge is a part of American popular philoso- 
phy. It lies in the assertion that all persons are entitled to an 
opportunity to develop themselves in the best manner that they 
and society together can devise. Advocacy of this educational 
policy can be found not only among the statements of dema- 
gogues but also in the writings of astute administrators. One 
hundred years ago advocacy of universal education seems to 
have referred to the universal provision of elementary-school 
facilities; today, it refers also to the universal provision of high- 
school facilities.

2 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
But this policy of generosity does not pass unchallenged. For 
example, one who frequents college halls during registration days 
is likely to be informed that both secondary and collegiate edu- 
cation are now attempted by too large a number of persons. This 
statement is often followed by the assertion that the high school 
is culpable in granting diplomas too freely. It is even maintained 
by certain of these critics that too many boys and girls attempt 
to obtain a high-school education. Occasionally, similar com- 
ments are made by high-school teachers who hold that the present 
high-school practice is incorrect in attempting to provide for the 
universal distribution of its benefits. All these critics unite in 
asserting that a school of high standards attended by a carefully 
selected body of students would yield a far more valuable total 
product than that of present-day institutions. These critics say 
also that present-day high schools are conducted for the purpose 
of giving all high-school students forms of training which are 
adapted only to the needs of mediocre and inferior students. The 
implication of these criticisms is that instead of providing for 
the masses and neglecting the leaders, America should provide for 
the leaders and allow instruments of selection to eliminate the 
hindmost. 
In addition to unqualified advocacy and adverse criticism of 
the policy of distributing widely the advantages of higher schools, 
there is a growing apprehension upon the part of certain critics. 
This apprehension arises from the belief that indefinite con- 
tinuance of present policies will lead to a depreciated mental 
product, if, indeed, it does not bankrupt our exchequers. Per- 
sons who hold this view believe that school patrons as well as 
school officers must be apprized of impending educational dan- 
gers. These critics generally advocate further development of 
the high school, but they favor intensive as well as extensive de- 
velopment, more frequent and more accurate stock-taking of our 
high-school policies, and the cultivation of greater seriousness of 
purpose in high-school students. They advocate not retrenchment

or checking; instead, they advocate rational guidance in the ad- 
ministration of high-school policies. 3 
The writings which follow indicate the magnitude of America’s 
task in secondary education by discussions (1) of American poli- 
cies; (2) of the lines of defense of America’s policies; and (3) of 
the need for earnestly studying these policies to find suitable 
answers to the question, Is America attempting too great a task 
in secondary education? 
THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT OF FREE HIGHER EDUCATION * 
By Cuartes H. Jupp 
The fact is that America has launched in its program of a 
tax-supported higher education an experiment of such magni- 
tude that there is some question as to our ability to see it through. 
This experiment was launched in a small way and without the 
slightest calculation on the part of communities as to the scope 
of the experiment. It has been running along for a period of 
years without encountering any serious obstacles. In recent 
years it has developed with tremendous rapidity. We have all 
been fascinated by this rapid growth of higher education, and 
we have applauded its expansion. Even today one can find no 
end of general enthusiasm for free high schools and state-sup- 
ported universities. It seems to be the rankest kind of heresy 
even to use the word experiment. Yet experiment is the only 
legitimate descriptive word to apply to this whole series of under- 
takings. 
Europeans have been more keenly aware than native Ameri- 
cans of the experimental character of our program. They have 
seen also the relation of our free high schools and higher institu- 
tions to our general social system. ‘This clearer insight of the 
Europeans is due to the fact that their institutions corresponding 
to our higher schools are all tuition schools. There is no tax- 
supported secondary school in Europe, or for that matter any 
other continent except North America. Europe has never ven- 
tured to consider paying for higher schools out of public taxation. 
The higher schools abroad are class schools designed to give 
training only to the upper ranks of society. The upper classes 
have kept for themselves and their children the right to superior 
schooling and have never thought of admitting the lower classes

to a liberal share in higher learning; much less have they thought 
of offering it freely to all comers. 
Europe has seen clearly in the contrast between American 
practices and her own the effort of a democracy to make intellec- 
tual opportunity as nearly universal as possible. Europe has 
also been very skeptical as to the success of this effort. Some- 
times this skepticism has expressed itself in economic terms, and 
doubt has been recorded as to the possibility of raising a whole 
people to a higher level without disrupting industrial society; 
but more commonly the doubt of Europe has been expressed in 
social terms. How is America to develop leaders if she spreads 
her higher training like a thin veneer over the whole population? 
We could afford to go on our way without heeding the skep- 
ticism of Europe if our experiment were meeting with unqualified 
success. Frankness with ourselves, however, compels us, in view 
of many recent happenings, seriously to ask whether the experi- 
ment is going on as we should like to have it. 
First, let us ask whether we are really able to afford high 
schools. A short time ago there came to the writer of this article 
a letter from a town in the northern part of North Dakota con- 
taining the following paragraphs: 
“Five successive crop failures in this part of the state 
have so reduced credit that the banks will no longer cash 
the teachers’ salary warrants. The school district does not 
know where it can obtain funds. Bonds sold within the 
state could not secure money for at least a year because 
the school funds of the state are loaned out and come in 
slowly and a great many schools already have their applica- 
tions for such funds on file. An attempt has been made 
to sell bonds but without success. 
“The schools will have to be closed if some definite relief 
cannot be guaranteed soon. The teachers, of course, will 
not stay under present conditions. The local school board 
is unable to solve the problem, but is very eager to find a 
way out. 
“The money stringency is general all over the country but 
is very much worse in the western part of North Dakota on 
account of low production for several years as stated above.” 
Perhaps someone will say this is not typical. Fortunately, it 
is not entirely typical, but unfortunately, on the other hand, 
it is the last stage of a journey on which many a larger and more
-P-A-G-E-17

opulent community is well launched. New York City has been 
arguing about next year’s budget, and the responsible officials of 
the city have repeatedly said that it is impossible to supply for 
the schools the funds said by the board of education to be in- 
dispensable. Chicago has a deficit in its school accounts of 
several millions of dollars and no sinking fund in sight with which 
to meet this deficit. Nor is this a temporary situation resulting 
from the war. The deficit is of long standing and has increased 
steadily for a number of years. 
The same story can be told of cities large and small all over 
the country. The post-war economic stress has greatly accel- 
erated the climax, but we have for some time been steadily ap- 
proaching the point where the people of this country cannot find 
in ordinary taxes adequate funds for schools. For about a gen- 
eration the schools have been steadily absorbing a larger fraction 
of the public revenue, and they have been increasing at an enor- 
mous rate their demands for equipment and support of every type. 
The school deficits of the present day are not attributable in 
equal degree to the lower and higher schools. The higher schools 
are the ones which have shown the largest proportionate increase, 
and they are more expensive than the lower schools in every 
respect. The Bureau of Education reports that there were in 
attendance in high schools, public and private, last year 2,000,000 
students. This is more than six times as many as there were 
in 1890. In the same interval the general population of the 
country has not quite doubled, and elementary schools have in- 
creased in a ratio only slightly more than the general population. 
Between the years 1909 and 1916 the number of teachers in 
public four-year high schools doubled, while the teachers in ele- 
mentary schools increased somewhat less than 18 per cent. In 
short, the most notable expansion in public schools has been in the 
upper levels of the educational system. 
The end is not yet. American communities have set for them- 
selves the goal of a high-school education for every boy and girl. 
That this idea is seriously entertained appears in the legislation 
adopted in many states providing for the payment of a student’s 
tuition when the district does not provide a high school of its 
own. It appears also in the rural high schools which one en- 
counters in traveling through many a sparsely settled rural dis- 
trict. It appears in the laws which are being passed in progressive 
states raising the age of compulsory schooling from fourteen to 
sixteen or eighteen.

Let us see what a universal high-school education would mean 
in the way of costs. The state of California has just adopted 
by popular vote a provision which compels the payment by the 
state of $30 per capita for every child in elementary school or 
high school. The same measure provides that the local community 
must raise by taxation a sum not less than $30 for each pupil in 
the elementary school and not less than $60 for each pupil in 
the high school. These figures, let it be noted, are minimum 
figures. To be sure, California has long been one of the most 
progressive states in the support of schools, but it is fair to 
assume that what California regards as a minimum must ultimately 
be thought of as not too high for an average for the country as 
a whole. If the time should come when all pupils up to eighteen 
years of age are in school, and if the California figures are 
assumed as the ultimate averages, the total cost of education in 
this country will be not what it was last year, namely, one billion 
dollars, but one and three-quarters billions per annum. The 
cities which are now unable to get on without a school deficit will 
have to find some way of greatly increasing their school revenues. 
Once more let it be repeated that the American people have 
entered on this enterprise of providing a free high-school educa- 
tion without any serious thought as to ultimate costs. They have 
passed through long years of fairly gratifying operation without 
being obliged to face the full bill of expenses which will attach 
to a completely organized system. It is only recently that the 
financial strain is beginning to tax the resources of communities. 
We are becoming aware of costs in a new way. There is some 
danger that we shall think of the whole problem of education as 
a matter of finance. It is true that financial support is essential 
and must be secured, but the real problem is a social problem. 
Are the American people really willing and able to carry their 
ambition for a universal free higher education to its consum- 
mation? 
The experiment of higher education is not in question merely 
because it involves knotty financial problems; it is in question 
because no adequate provision is attempted in this country for 
the training of teachers. The country has been informed during 
the last year or two of the serious shortage of teachers. With 
characteristic American optimism our schools have made good 
the shortage by dropping standards to the level of the supply and 
trusting providence to see to it that no harm is done to our in- 
stitutions and their students. There is practically no concern
-P-A-G-E-19
  
A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 7 
among the people at large about the grade of instruction which 
is tolerated in many of our high schools. Not long ago I heard a 
president of a normal school pointing out the desirability of ac- 
cepting normal-school certificates as credentials for high-school 
teaching because there is no possibility of securing an adequate 
number of graduates of colleges. Most collége graduates who go 
into teaching regard themselves as amply qualified without a 
day’s thought or study devoted to preparation for the technical 
task of managing pupils or imparting instruction. This was true 
before the present shortage of teachers appeared. In the higher 
schools of Europe no teacher secures a position without rigorous 
special training; but with us there is no thought of impeding 
the progress of universal higher education by difficult demands 
made on the teaching staff. Even the most highly trained mem- 
bers of academic communities think of high-school teaching as 
simple enough for any college graduate. 
All this gives a true friend of the high school serious pause. 
We are engaged in one of the greatest social experiments that 
the world has ever witnessed, the experiment of offering a free 
higher education to a whole people, and this difficult and delicate 
task is cheerfully turned over to novices. 
Is it any wonder that the quality of instruction in American 
high schools is, to say the least, uneven? Is it any wonder that 
students who have studied Latin for four years cannot read Latin, 
that there is a prodigious failure in mathematics, and that Eng- 
lish teachers frankly confess that there is only a meager mastery 
of the vernacular among their pupils? The quality of American 
higher education, as well as its democratic spread over all the 
population, will have to be considered when we are estimating 
the success of the American experiment of universal higher edu- 
cation. 
Finally, there must be a frank recognition of the fact that 
the vast experiment of higher education has in recent years been 
getting out of hand because of a lack on the part of many 
students of appreciation of what their opportunity means. 
American boys and girls have come to think of the high school 
as their right. That it is beginning to tax the community’s 
resources to the utmost, that its organization calls for skill which 
the country cannot afford to give, never enters the mind of the 
average student. He or she looks on the high school as a part 
of his or her natural inheritance. The girl often attends as a 
matter of social course, and the boy attends because he is not yet
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ready to take up work of a serious kind. The great influx of 
students has swept into the high schools some students who have 
no serious intellectual interests and who have no expectation of 
cultivating any literary or scientific proficiency. Once in the 
high school, this great body of students thinks not at all of con- 
serving public resources. 
The fact is that the ordinary American citizen has never realized 
that the high school is one of our most hazardous social experi- 
ments, and he has never taught his boy or girl to think of the 
high school as costly or as a privilege which no other civilization 
offers in like fashion to its youth. Recent years have made this 
ordinary citizen aware that something is impending, but he does 
not know what. He has been told that there is difficulty in se- 
curing teachers; he has heard much about costs; but all this 
discussion has seemed to him remote. It does not touch his boy 
or girl; it concerns a public institution with which he need not 
busy himself except when it annoys him. 
It is not to be wondered at that the ordinary citizen has 
been unaware of the real issues at stake because even professional 
educators have been discussing the symptoms of the case rather 
than its fundamental causes. Teachers have been talking about 
their salaries, and superintendents have been talking about the 
difficulties of staffing their schools. The public has come to be- 
lieve that a suffering class of citizens is in need of public succor 
and that if this rescue fund is not contributed in the form of a 
bonus or increase in salary, there may be a strike which will 
greatly inconvenience the city’s homes and possibly congest the 
streets with idle youth. 
What the American people need at this time is a new insight 
into the essentials of their democratic society. America has un- 
dertaken to set up a new social system. It has taken generations 
to bring about a partial disruption of European traditions. The 
traditions of that older form of society dictate that a part and 
only a part of the people shall have a higher education. The 
older civilization has bequeathed to us also an industrial system 
which calls for a certain number of people who are to do the 
hard work of the world. This industrial system makes its dis- 
tinctions among people in terms of leisure and wealth and con- 
sequent opportunity to take on a higher education. Our democ- 
racy still retains many of the older industrial institutions, but 
has said with regard to higher education, “This is a common 
good; this shall be made accessible to all.” This idea is begin-
-P-A-G-E-21
  
A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 9 
ning to penetrate the thinking of our new society. In recent 
years it has spread with astonishing celerity. Today we are 
forced to look at the consequences of our new theory. The high 
school is crowded with all kinds of pupils demanding their share 
in the new social order. The taxpayer finds that the industrial 
system is not ready to bear in its accustomed ways the cost of 
this new social order, and the public begins to be restless about 
an institution which it only vaguely understands. 
The cure for the present situation is not easy to secure. It 
may be too hopeful to believe that Americans can be convinced 
of the gravity of the matter, even if they are told in plain terms. 
Perhaps we shall have to wreck some more of our hopes and 
waste more human life before we work out the experiment which 
we are blindly carrying forward. Perhaps it is futile to ask high- 
school officers to undertake the responsibility of adding to their 
other duties an exposition of the true purpose of a system of 
free high schools. If so, there may be an escape from complete 
despair. The high school has survived thus far and on the whole 
has broadened its scope in spite of general ignorance of its full 
value to American life. Probably in the process of human evolu- 
tion a way will appear to save that which is good in this in- 
stitution, even if no one takes up the task of representing it. It 
is worth while trying, however, to make the effort to interest 
high-school teachers and principals in a new branch of education, 
namely, the training of communities to understand how unique 
the American higher education is. 
STATISTICS OF HIGH SCHOOLS*® 
By H. R. Bonner 
There are in the United States nearly 17,000 public high 
schools. The number of high schools has increased over 452 
per cent since 1890. Some concrete conception of this enormous 
increase may be gained by noting that every day of the last 28 
years has witnessed the establishment of a high school. In 1890, 
when statistics of public and private high schools were first 
treated separately, only 60.8 per cent of the high schools in 
the country were under public control while in 1918 over 87 per 
cent were so reported. During the same period the percentage 
of high school students enrolled in public schools rose from 68

Bulletin, 1920, No. 19. Adapted.

to 91. This indicates that the growth of private schools has just about kept pace with the increase of population, while the 
growth of public high schools has been almost ten and one-half 
times as rapid. 
The rapid progress of the high-school movement has brought 
forth many small schools which have not yet reached “maturity.” 
If the high schools in the United States are assembled in groups 
in such a manner that Group 1 includes all schools enrolling 1-25 
students; Group 2, those with 26-50 students; Group 3, the 
schools with 51-75 students, and so forth, it is found that almost 
one-fourth of the high schools in this country have fewer than 26 
students, and over one-fourth of them from 26 to 50 students. 
These facts are shown in Table I.

  A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION — 11 
The size of schools is of more than passing interest. Upon 
the size of schools depends the possibility of offering a narrow 
or a broad program of studies, for with the large high school 
comes a larger teaching staff and an opportunity to offer com- 
mercial, home economics, manual training, and trade work, while 
the smaller schools, with only two or three teachers, cannot hope 
to offer so great a variety of training and usually limit their ac- 
tivities to academics, or possibly a small amount of agriculture. 
The extra-curricular life of smaller schools is similarly restricted. 
Over 76 per cent of all high schools, however, offer a four-year 
course, and in these schools are enrolled over 95 per cent of the 
total number of students. It is highly significant that only 5 
per cent of the students attending high school do not have the 
advantage of attending a four-year high school. 
Less encouraging is the fact that the school year is often eight 
months or less in length. Eighteen per cent of all public high 
schools are open less than 160 days a year; 62 per cent from 
161 to 180 days; and 20 per cent for 180 or more. Altogether, 
9,186 pupils attend the 288 schools which are in session no more 
than 140 days. Sixty of these schools are in Indiana, 50 in 
North Carolina, 49 in Pennsylvania, and 63 in Texas. 
The total number of high-school students (including 90,448 
pupils in the elementary grades of junior high schools) enrolled 
in the 13,951 schools from which reports were received by the 
Bureau of Education in 1918 is 1,735,619. If these students were 
stationed at intervals of 3 feet, they would form a line of 983 
miles long, which would reach from Washington, D. C., to Kansas 
City. Of the 1,645,171 secondary students, 704,856 are boys; 
940,315 or 57.2 per cent are girls. This proportion of boys and 
girls is almost exactly the same as it was in 1890 when 57.7 per 
cent of the pupils were girls.** 
In 1890 only 3.2 persons in each 1,000 of the population were 
enrolled in public high schools; in 1918 the corresponding number 
was 15.6, or almost five times as great a proportion. In Cali- 
fornia 27 persons out of each 1,000 in the population are found 
in high schools; almost as high a proportion is found in the high 
schools of Kansas. Thus it is demonstrated that it is possible 
for as much as 2.7 per cent of the population to be enrolled in 
*Tn the year 1921-1922, there were 3,098,882 secondary school pupils in 
the United States. Of these, 225,873 were enrolled in private and parochial 
schools; the remainder were in public schools. United States Bureau of 
Education Bulletin, 1924, No. 31.

high schools. In South Carolina the corresponding number is 
only 0.53 per cent. Thus it is seen that California has over 
five times as great a proportion of its population getting a high- 
school education as has South Carolina. Similar percentages for 
Arkansas and Mississippi are less than one-fourth of those for 
California and Kansas. 
It is desirable to measure the cost of high-school education. 
To ascertain this average and the corresponding one for ele- 
mentary education is the purpose of these few paragraphs. Un- 
fortunately, the schedules used in gathering the data which have 
been summarized herein did not ask for a complete statement of 
high-school expenditures, it being thought that the high-school 
principal would not have at hand a complete statement of high- 
school finances, but would know his own salary and official ex- 
penses, the salary and expenses of his supervisors devoting all 
or part time to high-school subjects, the salary of his teachers, 
the cost of high-school textbooks, and the amount spent for sup- 
plies used in instruction. The functions of expense just enum- 
erated are technically known as “expenses of instruction.” The 
other general functions not mentioned are treated elaborately in 
the chapter on State school systems. It becomes necessary, 
therefore, to resort to the State report to supplement the informa- 
tion summarized in this report. The first of these functions, 
general control, can not be easily divided into elementary and 
secondary school costs. Neither can interest paid on indebted- 
ness. The others can. They are: First, operation of plant, 
including the wages of janitors, firemen, engineers, etc., and the 
cost of fuel, water, light, power, and janitor’s supplies; second, 
maintenance of plant, including all up-keep or repair costs; third, 
auxiliary agencies, including library, health, recreational, and 
other miscellaneous activities; fourth, fixed charges, including 
annual fixed expenditures, such as rent, insurance, contributions, 
etc.; and fifth, outlays, including cost of new buildings and of 
grounds and of new equipment. 
The following States made a fairly reliable separation of ex- 
penditures between elementary and secondary schools for the 
functions named above, except for general control and for inter- 
est on indebtedness: Arizona, California, Connecticut, District of 
Columbia, Louisiana, Maine, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. 
The expenditures in these States aggregate $76,940,194, or over 
Io per cent of the corresponding expenditures for the United 
States ($763,678,089). These States enroll in school almost 10 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 13 
per cent of all the pupils in the public schools of the country 
(2,031,878 out of 20,853,516). Our “sample,” therefore, repre- 
sents about one-tenth of the Nation. The average length of the 
school term in these nine States is 160.7 days, exactly the same 
as it is for the United States. The States are also located in 
the East, South, and West. The total per capita cost of educa- 
tion for the United States based on the total enrollment is 
$36.62; for these nine States, $37.86. The corresponding per 
capita for the United States for current expenses only (out- 
lays omitted) is $30.91, for these nine States, $32.56. In the 
State report it is shown that out of each $1 spent for education 
3-3 cents goes for general control, 58.2 cents for instruction, 15.5 
cents for outlays, and 23 cents for other miscellaneous purposes. 
In these nine States it is found that a school dollar is distributed 
as follows: For general control, 2.9 cents; for instruction, 62.6 
cents; for outlays, 14.1 cents; and for other purposes, 20.4 cents. 
As corresponding figures in each series of computations are prac- 
tically equivalent, our “sample” of States should be fairly de- 
pendable. 
Of the $76,940,194 spent for education in these nine States, 
$2,246,207 went for general control and $919,534 for interest on 
the school debt, neither of which can be reliably separated into 
elementary and secondary school costs. The per pupil cost for 
general control and interest in these States, therefore, is $1.56 
and is assumed to be the same for elementary and secondary 
school pupils. On the other functions of expense it was found 
necessary in only a few minor instances to prorate an amount 
between elementary and secondary. These nine States spent for 
instruction in the elementary schools $35,714,450 and in second- 
ary schools $12,467,234; for outlays in the elementary schools 
$7,330,484 and in the secondary schools $3,452,761 (the total 
‘amount spent was prorated in the ratio of 138 to 65); for opera- 
tion of the elementary school plant $7,069,241 and of the sec- 
ondary school plant $2,792,243; for maintenance of elementary 
schools $1,717,091 and of secondary schools $385,533; for auxili- 
ary agencies in the elementary schools $1,467,339 and in second- 
ary schools $529,726; and for fixed charges incident to elementary 
schools $639,870 and to secondary schools $208,481. Of the 
2,031,878 pupils enrolled in the schools of these States, 1,792,681 
were registered in elementary schools and 239,197 in secondary 
schools. 
From these data significant relationships may be computed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Excluding the cost of general control and interest on indebtedness 
the total amount spent on the 1,792,681 elementary school pupils 
was $53,938,475, or a per capita of $30.09. With the same exclu- 
sions the total amount spent on the 239,197 secondary school ° 
students was $19,835,978, or a per capita of $82.93. If the per 
pupil cost of general control and interest, viz, $1.56, is added 
to these per capitas, the average cost of elementary education is 
found to be $31.65 and of secondary education $84.49 per year. 
These aggregate per capitas include per pupil costs for outlays 
amounting to $4.09 and $14.43, respectively, which should be de- 
ducted if it is desired to secure an average expressing the per 
capita current expenses only. These remainders are $27.56 and 
$70.05, respectively. Thus it is shown that i costs annually 2.67 
times as much to keep a high-school student in school as it does 
an elementary-school pupil. It should be remembered, however, 
that the elementary-school year is not so long as the high-school 
year. Estimating for Vermont only (using the New Hampshire 
ratios), it is found that the average length of the elementary- 
school term in these 9 States is 158.7 days, while that of the 
high-school term is 176.2 days. The total per pupil cost per day 
in elementary schools is therefore 19.94 cents and in high schools 
47.95 cents, or only 2.40 times as much. 
Is America attempting too great a task in secondary educa- 
tion? The answer of the psychologist. At the present time 
many states enroll ‘efie-third or more of the population of high- 
school age in their high schools. For example, of about 202,000 
Wisconsin boys and girls whose ages range from fourteen to 
eighteen, about 75,000 are enrolled in the high schools of the state. 
Other States, as California and Kansas, enroll nearly fifty per 
cent more of their children of high-school age in high school, 
while the high schools of a few states, as South Carolina and 
Mississippi enroll only about one-third as high a proportion of 
their children of high-school age. For the United States as a 
whole, slightly téss than one-third of the pupils of fourteen to 
eighteen years of age attend high school. 
By combining these figures with the results of the application 
of the army psychological tests to high-school students, an 
answer to our question can be derived. The army tests were
-P-A-G-E-27
A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 15 
so constructed that the middle fifty per cent of the men in the 
army fell into the group designated as the C-group. The mid- 
point of the C-group represents, therefore, the mid-point of the 
intelligence of the random sampling of men examined—so far as 
that test can indicate that point. If intellectual abilities can be 
considered as being of different levels or strata, one may say 
that the upper half of the strata contains the most promising half 
of the abilities. 
Shortly after the close of the Great War, the same army test 
was applied to high-school students in many schools. The re- 
sults of these uses of the test show that only the upper fifty per 
cent of intellectual abilities is represented in the high school. 
That is, the number of pupils whose test records fell below that 
of the mid-point of the C-groups is negligible. If it is true that 
only persons of the upper fifty per cent or upper half of the 
intellectual strata are found in the high school, one may con- 
clude that an increase of high-school attendance to the point of in- 
cluding the entire upper fifty per cent can be effected without 
drawing into the school any pupils who are inferior to some who 
now attend the high school. 
This somewhat involved reasoning has led to the following 
conclusions: High schools now enroll nearly one-third of the 
pupils of high-school age. The army test shows that high schools 
go as low as the mid-point of intellectual strata for their students. 
Upon the basis of these two statements, it would be possible 
to increase high-school enrollments fifty per’ cent without going 
into the intellectual strata below those which are now reached. 
That is, so far as general intelligence is concerned, high schools 
could increase their enrollments fifty per cent without lowering 
their present admission standards. 
There are, however, several defects in the foregoing reasoning. 
In the first place, the army tests have not been applied to a 
representative number of persons of fourteen to eighteen years 
of age and selected at random; we are not certain, therefore, that 
the mid-point of the C-group is the mid-point of intellectual strata
-P-A-G-E-28

of persons of high-school age. Second, not all persons of the 
upper half of the intellectual strata desire to attend high school: 
an increase of fifty per cent in high school enrollment would prob- 
ably necessitate going below the assumed mid-point of intelligence 
for a portion of the additional pupils. Third, if the high school 
were to increase its enrollment fifty per cent, the largest additions 
would have to be made from the lower half of the upper fifty 
per cent; this would be necessary because the results of the use 
of the army test inhigh schools has shown that the proportion of 
pupils in the upper strata was larger than the normal expectancy. 
The psychologist’s answer as presented up to this point is re- 
duced to the following:*An increase in high-school enrollment 
will include all the strata now represented. An increase will 
include more from relatively low than from relatively high strata, 
and will, therefore, reduce the general average of high-school 
intelligence. As psychological tests can now be used in the classi- 
fying of pupils, and, as skillful teachers are able to individualize 
instruction within classes, an increase in high-school enrollment 
is not incompatible with the maintenance of present high-school 
standards or even with a raising of standards. If, however, a 
school increased markedly its enrollment without making provision 
for individual differences, the increased enrollment would probably 
lead to a lowering of standards. «& 
The psychologist has an answer also from the point of view of 
the conservation of talent. This aspect of the question is treated 
in the following quotation from Terman. 
THE CONSERVATION OF TALENT * 
By L. M. Terman 
Sir William Hamilton once said that the greatest thing in 
the world is man, and the greatest thing in man is mind. He 
might have added that except for character the greatest thing 
in the mind is intellect. Our instincts, our emotions, and our 
strivings have much in common with those of our infrahuman

1§2-154. 1923. Abridged.

cousins of the forest and jungle; in our ability to think is found 
the mark of our kinship with the gods. 
As a great psychologist once observed, civilization advances 
on two legs—invention and imitation. There are those who show 
the way and those who follow. Imitation is easy; but it takes 
the creative thinker to set new advances, whether in mechanics, 
science, commerce, literature, art, or religion. But for men and 
women of superior intelligence, society would be as helpless to 
advance as an automobile without 4 motor. A nation’s intel- 
lectual assets are therefore the most precious it will ever have, 
and the principle of conservation will here find its most useful 
application. 
Now there is reason for believing that a considerable part 
of the world’s talent fails of fruition. That “genius will out” 
is but a dangerous half-truth, or less. Cattell has shown that 
Massachusetts in proportion to population produces 84 times 
as many men of science as Mississippi. That scientific ability 
is 84 times as prevalent in the germ plasm of Massachusetts as 
in the germ plasm of Mississippi seems entirely unreasonable. 
We prefer to believe that educational opportunity has helped 
to determine the relative output. 
A research now in progress on the mental development of 300 
of the most eminent men and women of the last few centuries 
reveals the fact that many of these geniuses owed their greatest 
opportunities to happy chance. Newton could never have made 
his scientific and mathematical discoveries without a university 
education, yet he owed his opportunity to enter Cambridge to 
the chance visit of an uncle. Liebig, the founder of physiological 
chemistry, was early withdrawn from school and apprenticed to a 
pharmacist. There, in a shed behind the apothecary’s shop, he 
began the chemical experiments that later brought him his chance 
to enter a university. One wonders whether those experiments 
in chemistry would have been undertaken had he been appren- 
ticed to a shoemaker or tailor instead of to a man who dealt in 
chemicals. So many instances of this kind have been uncovered 
as to raise the question whether in the case of many potential 
geniuses the happy accident may not have failed to happen. 
The phrase “unsung Miltons” is more than a poetic figure. Cer- 
tainly it is true that children of superior ability are not always 
recognized in the schools. The defective child attracts attention 
by his inability to do the work and by his maladjustment to 
school discipline. The gifted child is likely to be submerged with
-P-A-G-E-30
18 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the masses because of his very adaptability to the school en- 
vironment. 
Another circumstance that has blocked the educational prog- 
ress of gifted children is the superstition, given currency by 
Lombroso and others, that intellectual precocity is pathological; 
that bright children are prone to die young, become insane, or 
develop post-adolescent stupidity. So thoroughly has this super- 
stition become imbedded in popular thought that even prominent 
educators are likely to assume that the child of high intelligence 
quotient must, ipso facto, be anemic, nervous, conceited, eccen- 
tric, non-social, and a stranger to play. 
So often have I seen this view expressed in perfectly good 
print that for a time I was myself inclined to suppose it must 
be true. Then followed a decade of experimental work in which 
I tested large numbers of children and studied their personal 
characteristics in the light of their intelligence quotients. It 
did not take long to discover that the facts were not in line with 
traditional theory. My subjects of high I. Q. simply did not 
answer to the book descriptions of typical Wunderkinder. As 
a rule they were physically well developed, active in play, normal 
in their social adjustments, and mentally well-balanced. 
The answer of the historian. One need not go far back 
into the history of education to find the trend in regard to the 
extension of the privileges of education. Even within the modern 
period, Luther found it necessary to argue vigorously with 
his contemporaries to obtain a few hours daily for elementary- 
school training. Two and one-half centuries later Englishmen 
had to contend against strong obstacles for educational rights 
which are today commonplace. Not only were there difficulties 
in obtaining educational privileges: the classes of population to 
whom educational opportunities were open in the eighteenth cen- 
tury were trained in an attitude which is at variance with that 
now held. Finally, in the quotation from Hart are summarized 
the development of the modern educational ideal and a clear state- 
ment of the historian’s answer to the question.

LETTER TO MAYORS AND ALDERMEN, 1524° 
By Martin Luror 
But, you say, “we can not bring all our children up to be 
students; we can not spare them; we need them at home to 
work for us.” I answer, “I do not ask for the establishment of 
such schools as we have had hitherto, where our young men have 
spent twenty or thirty years over Donatus or Alexander, and yet 
have not learned anything at all. We have now another world, 
and things are done after a different pattern. And I ask no 
more than this, namely, that boys shall attend upon such schools 
as I have in view, an hour or two a day, and none the less; spend 
the rest of their time at home, or in learning some trade, or 
doing whatever else you will; thus both these matters will be 
cared for together, while they are young and opportunities are 
favorable. For else, they would haply spend tenfold this time in 
gunning and ball-playing. So, too, your little girls may easily find 
time enough to go to school an hour a day, and yet do all 
their household duties; for they now devote more than that to 
over-much play, dancing, and sleep. 
It is very plain that all we need, is a cordial and earnest de- 
termination to train up our youth aright, and by this means 
furnish the world with wise and efficient men.f For the devil 
is better pleased with coarse block-heads and with folks who 
are useful to nobody; because where such characters abound, 
then things do not go on prosperously here on the earth. 
Hence, there is great need, not for the sake of the young 
alone, but also for the welfare and stability of all our institu- 
tions, temporal and spiritual alike, that we should begin at wie 
and in good earnest, to attend to this matter.

we find that one of the leading characteristics of the eighteenth 
century, and which preéminently distinguished it from all that 
preceded, was a craving after knowledge on the part of those 
classes from whom knowledge had hitherto been shut out. It 
was in that great age, that there were first established schools 
for the lower orders on the only day they had time to attend 
them, and newspapers on the only day they had time to read 
‘them. It was then that there were first seen, in our country, cir- 
culating libraries; and it was then, too, that the art of printing, 
instead of being almost confined to London, began to be generally 
practiced in country towns. It was also in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, that the earliest systematic efforts were made to popu- 
larize the sciences, and facilitate the acquisition of their general 
principles, by writing treatises on them in an easy and untechnical 
style; while, at the same time, the invention of encyclopedias 
enabled their results to be brought together, and digested in a 
form more accessible than any hitherto employed. Then, too, we 
first meet with literary periodical reviews; by means of which 
large bodies of practical men acquired information, scanty indeed, 
but in every way superior to their former ignorance. The forma- 
tion of societies for purchasing books now became general; and, 
before the close of the century, we hear of clubs instituted by 
reading men among the industrious classes; In every department, 
the same eager curiosity was shown. In the middle of the 
eighteenth century, debating societies sprung up among trades- 
men; and this was followed by a still bolder innovation, for, in 
1769, there was held the first public meeting ever assembled in 
England, the first in which it was attempted to enlighten English- 
men respecting their political rights. About the same time, the 
proceedings in our courts of law began to be studied by the people, 
and communicated to them through the medium of the daily 
press. Shortly before this, political newspapers arose, and a 
sharp struggle broke out between them and the two Houses of 
Parliament touching the right of publishing the debates; the end 
of which was, that both houses, though aided by the crown, 
were totally defeated; and, for the first time, the people were 
able to study the proceedings of the national legislature, and 
thus gain some acquaintance with the national affairs.

THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN EDUCATION‘ 
By Josepn K. Hart 
(One of the streams) of influence flowing from the work of 
the naturalists of the eighteenth century was predominantly 
social. Not infrequently the educational ideal has become con- 
sciously social, for example, in the doctrines of Montaigne; and 
always, back of the most intellectual ideal,/some more or less 
shadowy form of a social world can be seen, as, for example, 
in the “Heavenly Fatherland,” the “Patria,” of Thomas Aquinas. 
Scholasticism, even though working at intellectual tasks, felt it- 
self furthering the interests of a social sphere, even though in 
another world. Classical humanism, tied up in the grammar 
schools and newer colleges of the early modern period, was work- 
ing for the development of a real humanity. And the rising in- 
terest in elementary education in the last two centuries has 
grown out of, and back into, the modern world of commerce, 
industry, and democratic realization.” Of course all education 
everywhere, from the primitive folkway life down to the present, 
has been determined by some sort of a social ideal, unless, per- 
haps, some element of lingering tradition remains to make the 
system no longer intelligible to the new age. It must be true 
that all education is preparation for some sort of living in some 
sort of a social world. 4 
The Democratic Ideal in Education. But never before in his- 
tory has the task of education been so seriously considered as 
in the past century under the more complete realization of the 
meaning of all the revolutionary movements of‘the modern world. 
Religious revolution, from the Reformation down to the present, 
shows clearly that human life is moving on toward an ideal of 
freedom from the arbitrary dogmas and authorities of the past. 
Political revolution brings home to men continuously the fact that 
there is no halting-place short of the life of reason. Industrial 
changes are demonstrating that old distinctions between the edu- 
cated and uneducated classes can no longer be maintained along 
economic lines. And the intellectual revolution is simply gather- 
ing up, organizing, generalizing, and applying these great realiza- 
tions to the ever-widening spheres of living. Education must turn

them all to the uses of living and the preparation for more in- 
telligent living. The task of education has become inclusive. The 
ideal of education under these conditions of freed emotion, in- 
telligence, and actiop is really Auman in a sense never dreamed 
by the Humanists. { Economically, men must be free to work, to 
enjoy, and to share‘the values and meanings of life in a human 
way. Very well; let education take account of this aspect of the 
task. _Politicatly; men must be free to deliberate, to know, to 
decide, to choose, and thus to help determine their own destinies 
and the destinies of one another in a human way. Very well; 
let education take account of this fact. Religiously, men must 
be free to worship or to refuse to worship, to “reverence their 
conscience as their king” in a human sort of way. Very well; let 
education understand this fact. And intelligence must become big 
enough to comprehend these freedoms which the soul of the 
race is determined upon. The ideal of education in a democ- 
“ racy must be inclusive enough to maintain an actual aim of 
freedom, while at the same time making use of all the materials 
of the past and all the achievements of the present to realize 
and criticize and make effective that aim of freedom. 
The Machinery of the Democratic Ideal. Older ideals of edu- 
cation found their machinery in the traditional institutions of 
the community, especially the church. In large measure, schools 
have been handmaidens of the religious hopes of the race. To 
be sure, the governmental institutions have usually promoted 
educational enterprises of a more or less limited sort. But any 
sort of education less than a completely democratic type must 
find much of its support in special classes or groups. But with 
the coming of the free period in political life, and with the de- 
mand for the common education of the community, education 
has become more and more the_necessity of allpersons; and 
therefore it has become the task and responsibility of all 
persons, working through the state. The modern democratic 
program is a program of state promotion of public; education. ~ 
The state is the organized instrument for coUbeee aaa and 
education is the most thoroughgoing example of collective action. 
The state is therefore its proper instrument. Pestalozzi saw this. 
Headway in handling the destinies of the poor and ignorant de- 
pends upon making that problem a public responsibility. Horace 
Mann saw it, and decided that a school-house must be built 
within the reach of every boy and girl, without regard to eco- 
nomic considerations. Increasingly the modern world has seen

it, and laws have been passed making it compulsory for every 
child, within certain age-limits, to attend some sort of school. 
The task that proves too great for individual ir.tiative or for 
private philanthropy becomes surprisingly simple when made a 
distinctive part of the public will through governmental action. 
The perpetuity of the state, the stability of institutions, the 
conduct of affairs—all depend upon intelligence, or so it is 
assumed, and in this sense “the public school is the hope of the 
country.” 
The answer of the educational and social theorist. A de- 
cision regarding the question under discussion depends upon the 
nature of progress and the relation of education to progress. 
The suggestive excerpts from Todd and Wells provide a basis 
for forming conclusions upon both of these matters.® 
EDUCATION AND PROGRESS ?° 
By Arruur J. Topp 
To the idealist, as we have seen, this world’s issues are at 
bottom mental, and progress is a two-dimensional movement, 
the elevation of ideals and the extension of justice and right. 
Liberty and justice, then, rather than mere contentment or happi- 
ness are its touchstones. Both idealists and intellectualists agree 
that drift can be turned into mastery only by willing it; that is, 
by taking thought humanity can master its fate and captain its 
soul. But it is a costly process: mastery comes only by intense 
effort along the lines of enlarging the zone of positive knowledge, 
developing critical intelligence, overcoming fear, particularly the 
fear of thinking resolutely, and harmonizing sentiment and 
thought. These are the real “costs of progress.” Since progress 
can come only through the ministry of thought (some of it 
definitely applied to problems of human advance, the rest to 
doing each sort of work in the best possible way, hoping that it 
or its by-products may function progress-wards), and since human 
energy is limited in quantity, it follows that thought and energy

must not be diverted into wasteful or needless channels—warfare, 
manufacture cf extravagant luxuries, production for production’s 
sake. This dogs not mean any sort of taboo on art, however. 
Art is not a luxury; it is a spirit, an attitude. It is what makes 
life worth while. It is not things but a life to lead. It is the 
mark of a fine discrimination of values; hence is inseparable 
from the life of a progressive group. 
* The critics of this view of progress contend that mere endeavor 
to advance is not enough, because progress is largely the by- 
product of unintentionally beneficent moves. Leisure and good 
intention, they say, will produce audiences and buyers, but not 
artists. Knowledge would appear to be under some kind of 
control, but cannot insure mastery over fate because, in the first 
place, great advances in knowledge depend upon individual genius, 
which is wholly accidental and incalculable. Secondly, there are 
surely limits beyond which human knowledge cannot pass, and 
those limits are already in sight. Thirdly, the uses and results 
of ideas cannot be controlled: witness the evil by-products of 
invention. Fourth, it is idle to set ourselves definite goals, for 
the world with all its phenomena is absolutely purposeless. To 
the first objection we reply that education and improved means of 
dissemination put both the results and the tools of science at 
the disposal of a constantly increasing number of men; which 
means that latent stores of human ability are more easily unlocked 
and that the area from which genius may be recruited is con- 
stantly widening. The second objection is answered by the plain 
everyday fact that the higher science climbs the wider stretches its 
possible fields of conquest. Physical science, psychology, and 
the science of society are still in their veriest infancy. The 
burden of proving the existence of an early limit to their career 
rests upon the objectors: so far they have merely stated their 
feeling without producing the proofs. The third and fourth 
objections are more formidable. We may admit that absolute 
mastery of our course is a dream rather than a fact, since the 
world of Chance overtops the little province of Law. But it does 
not seem impossible to control the main direction of movement. 
Surprises like the judicial interpretation of the Fifteenth Amend- 
ment may occur, but in the long run they are neutralized. In 
any event man must make the effort to control. To do otherwise 
is to sit down fatalistically and invite destruction. Bear in mind, 
however, that by effort I do not mean mere random activity, or 
good will, or kindly intention: I mean resolute intent, informed  
-P-A-G-E-37

by science. If we perish in spite or because of that effort, we 
perish, that is all. But we shall have had the satisfaction of 
trying to eliminate blind luck and to reduce the-dimensions of 
“skittish fortune’s hall.” Meanwhile it is idle to trust to by- 
products of unintentionally beneficent moves. If they ultimate 
in progress it is always because somebody other than the im- 
mediate mover grasps the significance of the move and turns it 
to good account in terms of human value. 
From another angle is thrust the objection that growth in 
knowledge will not insure progress because man is only slightly 
rational: sentiments, emotions, instincts, habits, predominate over 
intellect. This we admitted. Yet with the proviso that instinct 
is no safe guide, being altogether too crude. And feeling, while 
undoubtedly the final arbiter of conscious behavior, is equally 
blind unless illuminated by knowledge. Ignorance and super- 
stition beget a nasty brood of sentiments. Imagination, likewise, 
needs feeding on fact. Moral perception is sheer relativity, and 
requires increasing knowledge to function at higher levels. Hence 
the office of education takes on a new significance. If it is to 
become an effective ally in social advance, it must add to its work 
of social control and passing on the mores the higher function of 
releasing mind and evoking intelligence. The educational system 
for a democracy should insure opportunity for mental output and 
social expression to all, It should spread the ideas of the fittest, 
the élite, the great minds, instead of coddling mediocrity and 
tradition. Social education, involves the twofold task of com- 
municating a sense of social responsibility and of challenging 
individual mental power: on the one hand the “practice of 
associated action,” the ability to subordinate oneself to a clearly 
perceived and worthy social purpose; on the other, the practice 
of independent thought even though it run into heresy, radical non- 
conformity, and deliberate rejection of petty canons of respecta- 
bility. This is the excuse of having devoted so much space to the 
analysis of human personality. For society is mental integration, 
an integration of selves. Consequently when we speak of willing 
progress we mean really rearranging certain elements in the 
human self, evangelizing it, in the widest sense. But this cannot 
come about merely by moral preaching. Social organization, in- 
cluding economic, political, domestic, and educational institutions, 
will need readjusting to make ethical appeals more than empty 
words. This is not by any means Utopian, but calls only for the 
broader application and utilizing of certain familiar natural dis- 
ce STATE COLL&Ut      PENNE IDDLE 1 E STATE COLL

positions in men. You will not need to stand men on their heads 
to force them into a “social point of view.” The impulse is there 
already and only needs encouragement, like prairie grass in April. 
This long analysis will hardly admit of compression into a 
single formula: truth balks at such narrow limits, and men have 
learned to suspect the aphorism as an insidious half-truth at best. 
But as nearly as I can state what to me is the end of human 
progress, it would be somewhat in this form: that the final goal 
of all things, if they have or can be made to have a goal, is not 
some merely static perfection for God, society, or the individual; 
it is the identification of personal interest with social interest to 
an increasing degree. You may paraphrase this as consecrated 
intelligence, or as reconciling freedom of individual will with 
evolution of society, or as the identification of man individualized 
and man socialized. Anybody who has ever tried it knows that 
such a harmony does not come at one swoop. To believe so 
is to revert to the age of fable. Neither can humanity dodge the 
final responsibility for its own fate. To call in the gods is to 
court disaster. However you conceive the end of all things, man,, 
was surely placed on this planet to work out his own salvation. 
I am not at all sure that the inevitable and automatic end of 
the social process is increasing installments of justice and greater 
and greater elevation and expansion of the great masses of men. 
But I believe that it can be made an end by steady, persistent, 
preoccupation with the problem, and by that alone. Moreover, 
I hold it to be neither sacrilege nor lesemajesty to believe that 
with applied sociology and an education leavened by it rests this 
problem of harmonizing more closely through enlightened will 
the facts of social achievement and progressive social welfare. 
THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY GREAT CITIZENS IN THE 
WORLD * 
By H. G. Wetts 
Unless we are to suppose that spontaneous outbreaks of super- 
men have occurred in the past, it is reasonable to conclude that 
the Athens of Pericles, the Florence of the Medici, Elizabethan 
England, the great deeds of Asoka, the Tang and Ming periods 
in art, are but samples of what a whole world of sustained se- 
curity would yield continuously and cumulatively. Without sup-

posing any change in human quality, but merely its release from 
the present system of inordinate waste, history justifies this 
expectation. 
We have seen how, since the liberation of human thought in 
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a comparatively few curious 
and intelligent men, chiefly in western Europe, have produced 
a vision of the world and a body of science that is now, on the 
material side, revolutionizing life. Mostly these men have worked 
against great discouragement, with insufficient funds and small 
help or support from the mass of mankind. It is impossible to 
believe that these men were the maximum intellectual harvest of 
their generation. England alone in the last three centuries must 
have produced scores of Newtons who never learnt to read, hun- 
dreds of Daltons, Darwins, Bacons, and Huxleys, who died 
stunted in hovels, or never got a chance of proving their quality. 
All the world over, there must have been myriads of potential 
first-class investigators, splendid artists, creative minds, who never 
caught a gleam of inspiration or opportunity, for every one of 
that kind who has left his mark upon the world. 
The answer of the social investigator. If, as Terman, Todd, 
and Wells assert, there is a direct relation between educational 
opportunity and the total human achievement, it should be pos- 
sible to demonstrate this relation in a tangible way. Odin’s in- 
vestigation, which is summarized by Howerth in the following 
pages, was conducted for the purpose of finding out whether 
tangible evidence could be found in the realm of literary achieve- 
ment in France. Clarke conducted a similar investigation in the 
United States and obtained similar results. Cattell has found an 
analogous relation between opportunity and achievement in 
science. 
UNIVERSAL EDUCATION AND THE INCREASE OF GENIUS” 
By Ira W. Howerto 
In his Farewell Address Washington enjoined the promotion 
of institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge for the 
reason, as he said, that “in proportion as the structure of Govern- 
ment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public 
opinion be enlightened.” Jefferson also and others of “the

fathers” emphasized the importance of general intelligence as a 
means of insuring the stability and safety of a free government. 
But the security of government is not the only or the chief 
reason why knowledge should be generally diffused. It is now 
established that the equalization of opportunity afforded by the 
general possession of extant knowledge is the primary and most 
effective means of promoting the progress and well-being of 
society. This was shown most conclusively, perhaps, by Pro- 
fessor Lester F. Ward in his book Applied Sociology, a book 
deserving a much wider reading than it has as yet received. 
In this book the author, basing his arguments chiefly on the 
statistical investigations of De Candolle, Ribot, Jacoby, and 
particularly M. Odin, professor in the University of Sophia, into 
the nature and cause of genius, arrives at conclusions so impor- 
tant, striking and scientifically solid, that they should be generally 
known. He shows that genius is latent in all classes, that the 
efficiency of society may be indefinitely increased by increasing 
the number of men and women of talent and genius, and that 
the most effective way of achieving this end is by a general dis- 
tribution of the extant knowledge of the world. 
The fundamental premise from which the argument of “the 
greatest American sociologist” proceeds is that the true agents 
of human progress are the men and women of achievement, that 
is, artists, inventors, scientists, littérateurs—those who break new 
paths, invent new methods, and add some increment to useful 
knowledge, or in some manner enlarge the powers and possibilities » 
of man. Such agents are relatively few, most people being en- 
gaged in merely copying or reproducing what they have done, 
that is, in performing the statical work of society. This will 
hardly be denied. As there can be no social advancement without 
achievement, the proposition would seem to be axiomatic. 
It should be noted that this doctrine is not the same as that 
of Carlyle who declared that “the history of the world is the 
biography of great men.” For the “great men” of Carlyle, the 
“heroes” of history, were men of action, military and industrial 
captains, the rulers and leaders of men. Ward holds that many 
of these men contributed nothing whatever to progress. They 
merely did what society wanted done. Even if they altered the 
map of the world, they may have left society no better than they 
found it. With him the real heroes, the promoters of progress, 
are the thinkers, many of whom have been maltreated or 
neglected.

Since men of talent and genius are the chief promoters of 
progress, the problem of artificially hastening the advancement 
of society is chiefly the problem of increasing the number of such 
men. Can this be done, and if so, how? To the first of these 
questions Ward gives an affirmative answer. Even if the amount 
of genius in society be a fixed quantity, he says, the number of 
effective geniuses may be increased by providing opportunities to 
make themselves known. Under present conditions full many a 
flower of genius is born to blush unseen. There are “mute, in- 
glorious” Miltons, village Hampdens, and Cromwells who never 
achieve distinction for lack of opportunity. 
This, of course, is contrary to the view of Sir Francis Galton, 
which is also the popular view, that genius creates its own oppor- 
tunities, that it is irrepressible, that anyone gifted with genius 
will not fail to rise to eminence. This, to say the least, is an 
extravagant doctrine. Carried to the extreme it is patently 
absurd. For a genius could not win distinction without life and 
some degree of health. And it is easily conceivable, and undoubt- 
edly often actual, that a genius is born under such unfavorable 
conditions that he is early deprived of both. To some extent, 
at least, manifestations of genius must be dependent upon condi- 
tions. Improved conditions necessarily promise increased mani- 
festations of genius, and these will certainly show an increase in 
their number. It is generally agreed that genius is intellect plus 
character, and that it may be inherited. Galton devoted atten- 
tion almost exclusively to the factor of heredity, and proposed 
a system of eugenics as a means of increasing the number of 
geniuses. This method, if it could be inaugurated, would be slow 
in its operation. It would have to be supplemented by improved 
conditions. No breeder has depended upon heredity alone to 
improve his stock. The working power of the genius must depend 
to some extent, at least, upon an opportunity to use his powers. 
Why not, then, attack the problem at this end? That is exactly 
what Ward has done. 
The environment, that is, opportunity, brings out genius. Now 
what particular factor of the environment is most influential in 
this respect? What is it that constitutes the opportunity neces- 
sary to the manifestation of genius? To answer this question 
Ward, or rather Odin, for Ward follows Odin, analyzes the en- 
vironment and studies the influence of the different kinds of 
environment—physical, ethnological, religious, local, economic, 
social, and educational, on the 6,382 great men of France who 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
30 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
lived in the five centuries preceding 1825. He subjects the lives 
of these men to a most searching analysis. The following are the 
conclusions reached: 
“t, That while it would be an exaggeration to conclude 
that the action of the physical or geographical environment 
has been nil or only insignificant, its rdle in the production 
of men of genius has never been preponderant. 
“2. That race differences have no appreciable influence 
in producing men of talent and genius, the civilized races, 
at least, being equally fertile in that respect. 
“3, That the religious environment exerts a perceptible 
influence, but that it is impossible to determine how much. 
“4. That density of population, while doubtless a potent 
influence in civilization, is not, in and of itself, the real 
factor, the great generator of men of genius. Cities, however, 
are more prolific of genius than rural communities. 
“5. That the economic, social, and educational factors 
are the real determinants of the amount of genius manifested. 
These are the main factors which provide opportunity, so 
that the general conclusion reached is: Genius is dependent 
upon economic, social, and educational opportunity.” 
Some of the specific results of the investigation are especially 
interesting and significant. It was found, for instance, with re- 
spect to the influence of cities in comparison with rural districts, 
that the number of French men of letters born in cities was 
thirteen times as many as those born in the country. In Paris 
it was thirty-five times as many. The popular belief that most 
great men come from the country districts is wholly without 
foundation. The material and social conditions of the city are 
needed to stimulate and bring out the genius of mankind. “It is 
impossible,” says Ward, “for a man of genius to attain eminence 
and remain all his life in the country.” 
As to the effect of the economic environment it was found that 
only nine per cent. of the eminent literary men of France were of 
limited means, while ninety-one per cent. were rich or well to do. 
“But as the poor form ninety per cent. of the population,” quoting 
Ward again, “it follows that three per cent. of the population 
produced ninety-one per cent. of the talent. This means that 
the chances of success of a rich_person-are-three_hundred_times —
-P-A-G-E-43
  A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 31 
as great as those of a poor person endowed with the same measure 
of native genius.” ; 
The social environment was found to be about equally effective. 
“Tn France during the modern period the upper classes— 
nobility, government officials, liberal professions, bourgeoisie 
—furnished ninety and two tenths per cent. of the eminent 
men of letters, while only nine and eight tenths per cent. 
were low born. But these latter constituted at least eighty 
per cent. of the population. It follows that the chances of 
success of a person belonging to the upper classes are nearly 
thirty-seven times as great as those of one of the same native 
ability belonging to the lower classes. But the nobility alone 
who constituted only about one per cent. of the population, 
furnished twenty-five and five tenths per cent. of modern 
French men of letters. The chances, therefore, are nearly 
two hundred times as great for a person belonging to the 
nobility, as for one belonging to the working class, all other 
things being equal.” 
Another popular belief that must be discarded is that genius 
is independent of educational opportunities. Of eight hundred 
and twenty-seven French men of letters whose educational oppor- 
tunities were investigated, eight hundred and eleven received a 
thorough education in their youth, while only sixteen were self- 
educated. For an educated man, then, other things being equal, 
the chances of success are nearly fifty times greater than for the 
man who is compelled to educate himself. ‘Everything forces 
us to admit,” says Odin, “that education plays a réle not only 
important but vital and decisive in the development of men of 
letters. It acts not only upon average natures, but also, and with 
quite as great intensity, on talent and genius.” 
Summing up the result of the whole inquiry Ward says: 
“About eighty per cent. of all distinguished persons are 
born in large cities, and nearly all go early to great intel- 
lectual centers; more than ninety per cent. of these belong to 
wealthy or well-to-do families and are exempt from all ma- 
terial concerns; nearly ninety per cent. of them belong to the 
higher social classes (nobility, public officials, liberal pro- 
fessions, business men); and ninety-eight per cent. of them 
receive a liberal education in their youth.”

But the stimulating associations of city life, easy material cir- 
cumstances (means for the purchase of books, for travel, etc., 
favorable family influences, social advantages, and instruction) 
are all educational—they all result in the acquisition of knowl- 
edge. Knowledge, then, generally diffused, is the essential means 
of increasing the number and products of genius, that is, of 
promoting social efficiency and enlarging the well-being of society. 
As things are, the fecundity of society is about two geniuses to 
the 100,000 of population. It can be made at least 200 to the 
100,000. 
Speaking of the resources of society, Ward says: “Only ten 
per cent. of these resources have been developed. Another ten 
per cent. are somewhat developed. There remain eighty per cent. 
as yet wholly undeveloped.” 
What, then, is the primary function of our schools, and of our 
entire educational system? It is to place before all the members 
of society the opportunity for development that knowledge affords. 
Schools are the social instruments for the general diffusion of 
knowledge, a knowledge of nature’s laws and principles, general- 
ized knowledge, such knowledge as will afford all, the poor as 
well as the rich, members of the working class as well as members 
of the leisure class, an opportunity to reveal the powers with 
which they are gifted by nature. 
The idea so often expressed in our academic circles that the 
purpose of our colleges and universities is to develop thinkers, 
the exceptional young people of the country—that only such per- 
sons can profit by college and university opportunities—is evi- 
dence that the oligocentric view of society still prevails. All should 
enjoy such opportunities, or at least should enjoy what our higher 
educational institutions should provide. It is now complained 
that some will not “take” an education. One thing is sure, and 
that is, that all members of society will profit by the general 
diffusion of useful knowledge, and this diffusion should be a 
conscious end of all educational effort. We still hear talk of the 
“inferior classes,” and many deplore the fact that society is 
recruited from the lower stratum’ But as Ward truly says, 
“So far as the native capacity, the petential quality, the ‘promise 
and potency’ of a higher life are concerned, those swarming, 
spawning millions, the bottom layers of society, the proletariat, 
the working classes, the ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water,’ 
nay, even the denizens of the slums . . . are by nature the peers 
of the boasted ‘aristocracy of brains’ that now dominate society

and look down upon them, are the equals in all but privilege of 
the most enlightened teachers of oe It is, therefore, a 
great mistake in higher education to focus~Attention.ona-few-of 
the youth of society and-ignore-allthe rest. 
~~But the significance of all this lies chiefly in its bearing upon 
the practical expediency of making an attempt in this country to 
bring to fruition our entire crop of genius, so far as we can do 
so by providing generally the requisite educational opportunities. 
As all know, in our different commonwealths, and often in the 
different parts of the same commonwealth, there are the greatest 
variations in the length of the school year, school buildings and 
equipment are widely different, library facilities are often entirely 
wanting, there are different requirements as to attendance, 
teachers are unequally prepared and unequally paid. In short, 
it depends upon where a genius is born and lives whether he 
becomes effective as a social force. There are many parts of the 
country in which the geniuses who happened to be born there 
have been lost to society, because 
“Knowledge to their eyes her ample page 
Rich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll.” 
A single genius discovered and developed through the develop- 
ment of a national educational system and the approximate equal- 
ization of educational opportunities that ought to result from it, 
might be worth more to the nation than the system would cost. 
But the probability, rather the certainty, is that such a system 
would bring out a multitude of geniuses and thus multiply the 
progressive forces of society many fold. 
The answer of the fiscal expert. If, as Professor Seligman 
maintains, the educational question has become primarily a fiscal 
question, the status of school support and prospects for additional 
school revenue is a matter with which no teacher or school officer 
can neglect to acquaint himself. Several aspects of the question 
of ability to support schools are presented in the following pages: 
adequate use of moneys which are provided for educational pur- 
poses, the rising cost of education, the importance of adequate 
financing of education, means for financing education, and a re- 
view of national assets in connection with a statement of educa- 
tional needs.

CAN THE NATION AFFORD AN ADEQUATE SCHOOL SYSTEM” 
The burden of school costs did not increase during the war 
decade. The percentage of the Nation’s income devoted to edu- 
cation in 1918 and 1920 was practically the same as that ex- 
pended in the years preceding our entrance into the World War. 
The figures in Table II give little support to the belief that there 
was a tendency for the relative burden of school costs to increase 
between 1910 and 1920.

It is true that school costs measured in dollars have increased 
in recent years. A dollar, however, no longer has its pre-war 
value. The inexorable effect of the depreciation of the dollar has 
not been felt by the school alone. The operating costs of com- 
mercial concerns have greatly increased as a result of the same 
factor. In order to command a day’s labor in 1920, $6.66 was 
necessary when $3.00 would have obtained the same amount of 
labor in 1914 according to a study by the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion. The cost of building material similarly increased and re- 
quires double the expenditure per unit of construction. 
The purchasing power of the money expended for schools 
was less in 1920 than in 1913. Public schools cost $521,546,375 
in 1913. In 1920 the public schools cost $514,604,834, stated 
in 1913 dollars. Public school officials when they went out into 
the open market to buy human services and the material equip- 
ment necessary to maintain schools were $6,941,541 poorer in 
1920 than in 1913.

The decrease in the purchasing power of the money appro- 
priated for the schools would have had a far less harmful effect 
if the purchasing power of the money available to other National 
groups had not increased. If the school superintendent, the manu- 
facturer and the merchant had all lost equally in their ability to 
buy, the schools relatively would have been as well off as ever. 
But when the money at the command of the schools loses in 
purchasing power while that at the command of other institu- 
tions increases, the results are that the best human material goes 
into other fields of work than teaching and other buildings than 
schools get first call on labor and building materials. 
THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION * 
By Epwin R. A. Sericman 
I 
Every civilized country is to be judged by the relative amounts 
expended for education. If we take a broad view of history, we 
find that there have been no less than four stages in the develop- 
ment of governmental functions. In the earliest stage we have 
only the repressive function of government. When disorder 
occurs, the community is called upon to suppress it: when disease 
and plague appear, the government does its utmost to combat it: 
when war breaks out, the government is concerned to bring it 
to an end as quickly as possible. In the second stage of develop- 
ment, we find the preventive_functions of government appear. 
Tt not so-much to fight the famine as to prevent it that we are 
now concerned: it is not to check the disease but to make its 
appearance impossible: instead of simply incarcerating the male- 
factor, we try the more modern method of preventing the appear- 
ance of the criminal. The preventive functions of government are 
more difficult and more costly. In the third stage of progress, 
we come to what may be called the period of ameliorative func- 
tions. The government is now concerned not so much with pre- 
venting evil things as it is with improving conditions and making 
them better than before. The government now not alone seeks 
to prevent famines, but tries to improve agricultural conditions: 
it not only prevents disease, but it endeavors in countless ways 
by its modern health department to make the sanitary conditions

ber, 1922. Abridged.

  36 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
better than they were before: it not alone seeks to prevent the 
criminal from appearing, but it endeavors to turn the criminal 
into a law-abiding and decent citizen. The ameliorative functions 
of government call for far more of sustained effort and financial 
outlay. Finally, we reach the fourth stage of government ac- 
tivity, at the very outset of which we find ourselves at present. 
This is the period of what might be called the constructive func- 
tions of government. We do not simply build upon the actually 
existing situation and improve it, but we now seek to create en- 
tirely new conditions and to make something exist which never 
existed before. Although illustrations may be found in almost 
every phase of government effort at present, the chief example 
is to be seen in the domain of education. The very word edu- 
cation means the drawing out, the leading out of something new, 
the elaboration of the individual and the group mind of. some- 
thing which did not exist before. But just because of this fact, 
education is the most definite of all governmental functions. 
I wonder how many have ever read the admirable book of Mr. 
G. D. H. Cole, the English Guild Socialist. With his economic 
views I do not find myself in harmony; but with his high and 
lofty conception of what education ought to mean, I fancy we 
can all agree. We have even now only a faint adumbration of 
what can really be accomplished by education. If this is true and 
if education is a manifestation of the highest stage of community 
effort, it is also true that it calls for the severest sacrifices. Per- 
haps the day will come when the greatness of the nation will be 
measured, not by the tens of millions spent for our battleships, but 
by the hundreds of millions spent for the schools. 
Ir 
Since then the needs of education are so pronounced, it is 
worth while to consider for a moment why the financial embar- 
rassments have grown. This is due, in the first place, to the fact 
that education, like so many other functions of government, has 
been slowly progressing from private to public auspices. At the 
beginning, education, like the high roads, like justice, like protec- 
tion, was entirely a private function. But while the streets, the 
army, and the courts have now become exclusively public in their 
nature, education has gone through only a partial development. 
We still find private schools, private colleges, private universities, 
and it is undoubtedly true that the impetus to modern educational
-P-A-G-E-49
A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 37 
reform has often come originally from private initiative. The 
kindergarten was for a long time private before it was adopted 
into the public system. The same is true with the yocational 
schools and with many other forms of pedagogical activity. The 
important point, however, is that with the passage of time, more 
and more phases of education have been taken over from private 
to public management. We find, moreover, continually greater 
manifestations of this public activity: Public textbooks, free 
dental and medical service and even free lunches have been added 
in not a few places. The net result has been an extraordinary 
rise in the expenditures for education. 
The next point is a consideration of the fiscal principle govern- 
ing these outlays. The educational activity of government has 
gone through the same phases as that of the other activities. The 
high roads, for instance, were originally run for a profit and only 
at a much later period was the practice introduced of just about 
covering cost, the so-called free principle. Finally, it is only in 
the most recent period that toll roads have been abolished and 
that the principle of gratuity has been established according to 
which no charge is made for the use of the roads, the expenses 
being defrayed out of the general revenue of government. In 
the same way justice, when taken over by the government, was 
originally a source of revenue to the early monarchs. At a 
much later period, the principle of fees was introduced: Even in 
the eighteenth century Adam Smith advocated the payment of 
judges’ salaries by fees in order to stimulate their activity. It 
is only in very recent times that the province of fees has been 
restricted and that the court expenses, especially the salaries of 
the judiciary, defrayed out of the general fund. 
The same is true of education. Even when education was as- 
sumed by government, it was for a long time run on the prin- 
ciple of profits. This was succeeded by the régime of fees, which 
is still the custom in the primary education of some of the 
European countries and in the higher education in some of the 
American states. The final principle of gratuitous service or free 
education was first introduced in the schools of Holland and in 
the public school system of some of the American colonies. Step 
by step the gratuitous principle has spread from one form of edu- 
cation to another, as a result of modern democracy. As a con- 
sequence, the expenditures have steadily mounted. 
In the third place, we have to consider the ways and means of 
covering this increased expenditure. Here again we notice an
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
interesting fiscal development. The sources of early revenue in 
every government were very different from those that exist today. 
At first, in fact, contributions to the support of government were 
entirely voluntary and it was not until the drain upon private 
benevolence and charity became too great that the voluntary 
contributions were converted into compulsory contribution. We 
know the exact date when the transition occurred in each of the 
American colonies, and when the system of appeals to those 
“whose heart is willing” fell upon such deaf ears that a change 
had to be made. But even then, and for a long time, most of 
the public revenues came from other sources. Almost down to 
the end of the eighteenth century the colonial revenues were 
derived from fees, from land and quit rents, from special assess- 
ments, and, above all, from lotteries. The latter was an es- 
pecially favorite method. Many a church and many a school 
was started and supported by public lotteries. The very institu- 
tion with which I am connected, Columbia University, was made 
possible, as King’s College, through a public lottery. Even when 
compulsory contributions were initiated they assumed the form, 
for a long time, of indirect payments, more or less in return for 
supposed government activities. Direct taxes upon the individual 
were sporadic and slight, and the burden was scarcely felt. 
In modern times, however, all this has changed. Lotteries have 
disappeared; the land revenues of government have become neg- 
ligible; the relative importance of fees has greatly diminished; the 
chief reliance of government today is upon taxation regularly 
levied upon the individual. 
/The four reasons, therefore, why expenditures for education 
ave become such an important fiscal problem are: First, the 
/ growth in the scope of education itself; second, the transition 
from private to public education; third, ‘the change in the fiscal 
| principle of profits or fees to the principle of gratuitous service; 
and fourth, the virtual disappearance of the earlier forms of 
revenue, with almost sole reliance upon taxation. 
TIL 
The above statement is, however, not entirely sufficient to ex- 
plain the present situation. For while the amount to be raised 
by taxes has indeed increased, the readiness of the average citizen 
to submit to public charges has also undergone a notable develop- 
ment. There is far more sense of public collective responsibility 
at the present time than in former generations: There ought ac-
-P-A-G-E-51
  
A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 39 
cordingly to be little difficulty in raising from each individual his 
share of the public expenses. While the expenditures for educa- 
tion have indeed increased, by leaps and bounds, the wealth of 
the community has also multiplied. In fact, at no time in the 
history of the world have there been such prodigious strides 
forward in the accumulation of wealth and in the progress of 
individual well-being. There must be some other explanation 
of the present situation. 
To the economist and the student of finance, the explanation 
is simple. The original form of direct taxation in the country 
was the general property tax. It was a system which responded 
fairly well to the needs of the day and to the demands of the 
government. In a more or less primitive community a man’s 
wealth is largely measured by his property. Today we yet say 
that a man is worth so many dollars; whereas in England we 
speak of a man being worth so many pounds a year. In those 
early days when there were neither very rich nor very poor, when 
everyone worked and when almost everyone possessed a modest 
competence, general property was the best indication of a man’s 
wealth and therefore the most creditable measure of his ability to 
pay taxes. Consequently, until almost the period of the Civil 
War the public revenues kept pace with the increase in property 
and there was no problem of educational finance. 
Beginning, however, shortly after the Civil War in our most 
advanced states, and thereafter slowly spreading to other parts 
of the country, a complete fiscal revolution became visible. This 
was a result and concomitant of the great economic change known 
as the industrial revolution, the transition of the economic system 
from that of a primitive agricultural community to that of a 
highly diversified industrial community. We now live under what 
is known as the factory system or the age of the machine, based 
on a revolution in chemical and mechanical methods. The new 
forms of business enterprise, moreover, have brought with them 
the appearance of the corporation and the development of cor- 
porate securities. 
As a consequence, the old general property tax no longer suf- 
ficed for more modern needs. While real estate indeed remained, 
personal property changed in its constituent elements. There 
was, relatively speaking, less and less tangible and visible per- 
sonality and more and more evidences of legal rights. Slowly but 
surely personal property accordingly slipped out of the assess- 
ment lists with a resulting increasing burden upon real estate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Not alone did the general property tax thus gradually lose its 
efficacy but the newer business conditions caused a transition in 
the criterion of wealth from property to profits or earnings or 
income. In modern times there are large classes of individuals 
who live upon their salaries or earnings and who spend most of 
what they earn, thus accumulating comparatively little property. 
A property tax would leave scot free the great lawyer or physician 
or architect or engineer or railway president who spends most of 
his earnings. Furthermore, under modern economic conditions, 
the prosperity of a business man is no longer judged by his prop- 
erty. The mutations of modern life and the variations in the 
turnover have caused even the business man to apply the yard- 
stick of earnings or income rather than of stock-in-trade. Other 
reasons, for which there is here no time, might be mentioned to 
explain why property has been supplanted by income or earn- 
ings. In order to realize this change, we have only to look at 
the financing of the recent war compared with that of former 
conflicts. In the Civil War the income tax was almost negligible 
in its contribution to the war expenses; in the War of 1812 it 
did not exist at all. In the recent war, however, the major part 
of our entire colossal outlay was derived from taxes on income 
and profits. 
It is easily seen, therefore, how the present educational em- 
barrassment has arisen. In all those states which still cling, as 
most of them do, to the general property tax, the increasing 
wealth of the community is no longer tapped by the revenue 
methods. With a base of taxation continually receding and 
diminishing, it is only too apparent that the burden of the general 
property tax has become unendurable. 
Iv 
What, then, are the remedies? I should say that they consist 
of two, economic and political. The economic remedy is to 
develop a fiscal system which will respond to modern needs, 
which will tap the resources of the community according to the 
relative ability of the individuals. If we look at the most ad- 
vanced states we find that this fiscal reform has assumed three 
forms: 
1. The taxation of individual incomes. 
2. The taxation of business. 
3. The taxation of inheritances.
-P-A-G-E-53
  A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION § 41 
In New York, for instance, the personal income tax yields, at a 
very low rate, from 35 to 40 millions a year. The new business 
tax, also based on a criterion of earnings for the most part, yields 
45 millions and the inheritance tax yields over 20 millions a year. 
What has been done in New York has also been accomplished in 
Massachusetts and even in some of the states of the middle West 
like Wisconsin. California, which stands at the head of educa- 
tional finance, has been able to accomplish a similar result by 
developing a modern system of business taxation. Even in Dela- 
ware the recent introduction of the income tax has been. due 
almost entirely to the needs of public education. 
While this economic and fiscal change is of the first importance, 
there is also a political reform that is needed. All expenditure 
was originally local; all revenue was originally local. It is quite 
natural that there should have sprung up the idea of home rule 
and the feeling that roads and the schools ought to be supported 
out of local revenues. The economic transition, however, has 
proved the falsity of this early method, just as in the federal and 
state government modern conditions have shown the shortcom- 
ings of that other shibboleth, the separation of governmental 
powers. Modern earnings and incomes can no longer be cabined 
and confined within local limits: For modern economic enterprise 
has become not alone state-wide, but also nation-wide and even 
world-wide in character. The consequence has been a great differ- 
entiation between localities. While some localities, like the great 
industrial centers, are teeming with wealth, others in the agricul- 
tural districts are woefully deficient. The state has been com- 
pelled to come to the aid of the localities in the construction of 
modern roads. While the state government is making indeed 
some contribution to the communities for education, the chief 
support is still derived from local sources. Thus we find that 
as individuals under the modern dispensation differ in wealth far 
more than in former times, so do our local communities. Just as 
there are many individuals who are unable to contribute to an 
income tax, so there are many local communities that are unable 
to maintain adequate school facilities. 
What is needed is a redistribution of governmental functions 
and of governmental revenues. The chief source of local revenue 
must always remain, for obvious reasons, real estate—the non- 
elastic element in public revenues. The elastic form of modern 
revenues is to be found in the state-wide system of income, busi- 
ness, and inheritance taxes. It is only proper that the locality
-P-A-G-E-54
42 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
where the needs are greatest should secure an increasing share 
of these state-wide revenues. If this is done, the day of the 
impoverished community in the small red schoolhouse will go 
and the distribution of state funds to localities will take place not 
on the antiquated basis of assessed valuation or population, but 
on the new and improved basis of educational needs which will 
vary from locality to locality. An educational system local in 
character and support is incompatible with an economic and fiscal 
system state-wide in its nature. 
We conclude, then, that what is needed above all is a realiza- 
tion of actual facts. Let us no longer, like the proverbial ostrich, 
put our head in the sand and refuse to look what stares us in the 
face. The wealth is here; the educational needs are here; all that 
is necessary is to bring about a correlation between the two. Let 
us determine no longer to live in a fool’s paradise of outworn 
theories and indefensible shibboleths. Let us grapple manfully 
with the real problem and realize that in modern times the edu- 
cational question has become primarily a fiscal question. 
Principles derived from a consideration of American edu- 
cational policies. America is experimenting with free secondary 
education for the masses. 
Up to the present time the high school has developed by a 
slow and often irrational evolutionary process. 
Equality of educational opportunity for all should be provided. 
Belief in the principle of equality of opportunity for everyone 
has led to a strong, though often irrational, interest in education. 
Diversity of education needs, talents, and interests requires 
diversity of educative opportunity. Otherwise, there is no 
equality. 
America’s founding of a new high school each day for twenty- 
eight years necessitates increased attention to administrative and 
fiscal aspects of education. 
The history of education provides a striking illustration of the 
extension of the privilege of education as governments have be- 
come more democratic. 
The desirability of extending educational privileges has been 
accepted as a general principle.

  A CHALLENGE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION 43 
The world’s issues are fundamentally mental. 
Progress depends upon increasing the depth and extension of 
thought to larger numbers of persons. 
Progress consists of an increasing identification of personal 
interests with social interests. Such a process of identification 
depends upon education which is universal in its benefits, ad- 
ministered by proper persons, and based upon suitable content. 
The great periods of human history provide samples of what 
might be made continuous if opportunity were offered to everyone. 
The production of geniuses is dependent upon educational con- 
ditions. The recognition and success of geniuses depend upon an 
intelligent citizenry. 
Financial solvency and educational sincerity demand that 
patrons and pupils understand the purposes and problems of the 
high school. 
y A civilized nation is judged by its expenditures for the con- 
structive training offered to its citizens and prospective citizens.» 
The growth and realization of educational needs and activities 
have made of the educational question mainly a fiscal question.

  CHAPTER II 
Tue DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES IN SECONDARY 
EDUCATION 
Types of American secondary schools. The history of sec- 
ondary education in America shows that there have been three 
periods of development, each of Which is characterized by a 
certain type of school. During the first of these periods, the 
colonial period, the Latin grammar school was the prevalent type 
of secondary school. During the latter half of the eighteenth 
century a second type of school, the academy, was developed. 
This became the most important secondary school during the first 
half of the nineteenth century. During the nineteenth century the 
third type of secondary school, the high school, was developed. 
The twentieth century is witnessing two extensions of secondary 
education; the one downward and known as the junior high 
school; the other upward and known as the junior college. 
The first of these types of schools, the Latin grammar school, 
was a part of America’s educational heritage from Europe. This 
school was a direct lineal descendant from the Renaissance. Such 
schools as that of Vittorino da Feltre in Mantua popularized this 
form of institution. In Germany it became, under the leadership 
of Johann Sturm, the classical Gymnasium in which boys were 
taught knowledge, eloquence, and piety by means of the writings 
of the Greeks and Romans, of the church fathers, and by means 
of the bible. Dean Colet was the pioneer, who, at about the 
same time, brought this form of secondary education to England. 
In England, as in Italy and Germany, the writings of the Greeks 
and the Romans together with certain religious writings became 
the course in secondary education. The English model, which was 
known as the Latin grammar school, accepted boys of various 
47
-P-A-G-E-60
er nen een eee teem 
48 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ages and with varying amounts of training and prepared them for 
the university. 
As colonial policies were shaped by Europeans, the schools, 
naturally, were organized so as to conform with European edu- 
cational institutions. Wherever English settlers established sec- 
ondary schools, they founded Latin grammar schools. As their 
name implies, these schools were conducted for the purpose of 
teaching Latin. Greek was also taught after Latin had been 
pursued for two or more years. The students of these schools 
were required not only to learn Latin but also to use it. For 
example, it is recorded that in the case of the New Haven school 
the boys who annoyed their teachers by speaking English were 
sent home. In private as well as in public, boys were enjoined 
against the use of English, except as special privileges were 
granted to them. In spite of the sturdy efforts to create a minia- 
ture Roman state in each school, it is also recorded that a dele- 
gation of Dutchmen from New Amsterdam once had great diffi- 
culty in finding in New England any grammar-school boys who 
could converse in Latin. If, however, the boys failed to master 
conversational Latin, their failure cannot be attributed to the lack 
of carefully wrought textbooks designed especially for the every- 
day needs of the student. Dictionaries had features similar to 
modern French-English dictionaries; these-books contained Latin 
words ranging from the dignified to the vulgar and included many 
idiomatic usages. Conversational drill books possessed simple 
content which may once have been suitable for strong pioneers; 
Garretson’s Exercises, a second-year textbook, attempted to make 
Latin easy and delightful by asking boys to translate such 
melodious phrases as the following: “My dear cousin offered me 
a kiss” and “The pretty boy sits between pretty girls.’ The 
main course consisted, however, of stronger potions which were 
found in Ezekiel Cheever’s famous grammar—Accidence—and in 
the classical works of Cesar, Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and 
King’s History of the Heathen Gods—a work which was some- 
times “made” into Latin by the boys.    
-P-A-G-E-61
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 49 
Such a course pursued for four or more years together with a 
liberal quantity of Greek prepared intelligent boys for their 
collegiate work in the literature of these languages. Some of the 
most brilliant succeeded so well in their academic pursuits that 
when they emerged from school, they were equipped somewhat as 
Cotton Mather was—they could write better Latin than English. 
Of course, many boys spent from two to four years in such 
studies, with little benefit. 
Many Latin grammar schools were very indefinite in their re- 
quirements for admission and the length of time for completion 
of courses. One of the best schools, the Boston Latin School, 
which was founded in 1635, had by the beginning of our national 
period, 1789, evolved such requirements as the following: All 
candidates for admission must be at least ten years of age, and 
must have had thorough training in English grammar; they shall 
attend the school not to exceed four years during which time they 
shall have become fully prepared for college work in Latin and 
Greek. The books catalogued for the four years of this school 
were exclusively Latin and Greek textbooks. 
The Latin grammar schools of America like those of England 
were fee schools and were for boys only. Girls and poor boys 
sometimes received elementary schooling, but secondary schools 
for girls were not established until the academy’s period. Boys 
whose parents were poor had to wait until the nineteenth century 
for the abolishment of the tuition fees. 
Colonial educational policies. The colonies developed three 
different educational policies. In the southern colonies the Jaissez- 
faire policy was predominant in the realm of secondary education; 
the adoption of this policy caused educational opportunity to 
depend upon economic status. In the central colonies the paro- 
chial-school plan was the most prominent; the adoption of this 
plan made the school subservient to the church and, when denomi- 
national divisions arose, Jed to a disastrous scattering of school 
funds for the support of weak church schools. In New England, 
a public school policy was followed; this policy led to public 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
control and, under the provisions of the Law of 1647, to the 
establishment of many precedents which still influence educational 
administration and support. None of these policies are, however, 
entirely distinct within the territorial limits assigned above to 
them. School practices throughout the colonial period varied so 
widely that typical policies and forms of procedure are hard to 
find. An attempt to fasten policies upon certain colonies and 
entirely detach them from all other colonies is likely to be mis- 
leading. For example, the church was not without influence in 
the formulating of the policies of New England, nor were the 
public officers of the middle colonies without power in parochial- 
school territory. The divisions suggested are, therefore, valuable 
only in emphasizing the predominant characteristics of three sec- 
tions of colonies. 
The readings in this section of the present chapter present evi- 
dence of the ways in which colonial education developed. Pro- 
fessor Jernegan’s article is valuable in this connection especially 
as an example of the use of caution in making historical interpre- 
tations and as an account of general educational conditions; the 
implications of this article are quite as valuable as the explicit 
statements contained in it. Professor Knight summarizes the 
effect of the Jaissez-faire policy. Professor Kilpatrick’s discus- 
sion of schools under the parochial-school plan calls attention to 
the many inter-relations of church and state in the conducting of 
schools. Even though the Massachusetts Law of 1647 was not 
enforced throughout the colony, it became a model for other New 
England legislation besides inaugurating a new attitude toward 
and plan for secondary education. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA? 
By Marcus W. JERNEGAN 
If one turns to the existing accounts of the history of American 
education in the colonial period of our history, he will observe 
that many writers assume that most of those persons who received 
*The School Review, XXVII, 405-425. June, 1919. Abridged.
-P-A-G-E-63
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 5r 
any instruction attended organized schools. That such an in- 
ference is entirely erroneous is easily realized by the performance 
of a simple arithmetical problem—namely, that of dividing the 
population at any given date by the number of schools known to 
have been in existence at that date. The percentage of persons 
receiving a part of their education in such institutions would be 
highest in the New England colonies, but even in this section 
it would surprise most students if they were aware of how many 
learned how to read or write through some other agency than 
organized schools. 
If we pass beyond New England to the middle and southern 
colonies, it is safe to say that a still smaller percentage of the 
total number who secured the rudiments of an education received 
it in an organized school. It is doubtless true that there were 
many private schools whose existence we shall never be able to 
prove, but, even allowing for this possibility, it is not believed that 
the point made above would be greatly modified. It is therefore 
important to stress the agencies other than schools if we are to 
gain a proper perspective of the evolution of American Education. 
The well-known tendency to read into the past the ideals, and 
even the institutions, of the present is responsible for a very 
common fallacy—that of mistaking the special for the general 
fact. Contemporary conditions, not later theories, govern and 
explain the development of institutions; and the general fact, the 
typical institution,. cannot vary widely from the general condi- 
tions, which must in the long run determine what is general and 
what exceptional. 
During the colonial period much the larger proportion of the 
people at any one time were living under frontier conditions. 
Wherever such conditions were the controlling factor, organized 
institutions, such as the church and school, were not general, 
except perhaps in portions of New England, notwithstanding the 
assertions of our enthusiastic and imaginative racial, sectarian, 
and other types of historians, who often assert the contrary but 
fail to produce the evidence. When a given area ceased to be 
governed by frontier conditions, then organized institutions grad- 
ually became the general rather than the special fact. Frontier 
conditions imply, among other things, a sparse population; ab- 
sorption of energies, time, and thought in satisfying material 
needs—shelter, subsistence, and protection; occupations largely 
connected with agriculture or extractive industries; lack of easy 
means of communication, and hence isolation, particularly in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
52 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| late fall, winter, and early spring months; and finally, conserva- 
| tion of labor, even of children, during those months of the year 
in which the farming operations are pressing. If we realize also 
the weak cultural ideals, inevitable and inherent in frontier 
groups, and the impossibility of locating organized schools so 
that any large proportion of those of school age could be reached, 
under such conditions, even supposing the desire to exist, we can 
easily see that a great many persons who learned how to read and 
write must have taken advantage of other agencies than schools. 
Two were of the greatest importance—namely, home instruction 
given by the parents, and the apprenticeship system, instruction 
given by the master or his agent. 
Both of these agencies were in common and voluntary use in 
every colony. Voluntary education through apprenticeship oc- 
curred when, through custom or agreement, an indenture was 
drawn so as to secure for the apprentice book or religious in- 
struction, with or without instruction in a trade, and his mainte- 
nance, the latter being one of the main purposes of the system 
in its historical development. No special law concerning the en- 
forcement of the indenture was needed in such cases, for in- 
dentures were almost universally looked upon as contracts, became 
a matter of public record, and hence were enforcible in the courts. 
In some of the colonies parental education was made compulsory 
through laws passed to this effect—as in New England. In this 
study we are concerned with the system of compulsory education 
in the southern colonies, Virginia in particular, as it was instituted 
by law through the agencies of parents, guardians, and overseers, 
and particularly through masters and mistresses in connection 
with the system of apprenticeship.   The problem then for Virginia, and for other colonies, was much 
the same as that which had confronted Old and New England, 
only it was a more serious and pressing one. That problem was 
first economic—how to protect the parish from the burden of 
maintaining poor children; how to provide for an artisan class 
skilled in trades and needed in the colony; how to reduce idle- 
ness and unemployment, and how to add rapidly to the wealth 
and property of all the people. The second aspect of the problem 
was educational. The natural conception of the relation of the 
state to education was largely laissez-faire, on the theory that 
this was a matter to be intrusted to private initiative or the
-P-A-G-E-65
  
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 53 
church. But the pressure of a rapidly growing class of poor 
children, and the consequent expense to the parish, coupled with 
the difficulty of obtaining the much-needed supply of artisans, 
forced the state to modify this conception. Poor parents could 
not educate their children, and some degree of book education 
was desirable for artisans in order that they might be efficient 
in their trades. Two influences also promoted this conception. 
The period from the Reformation to the great Civil War is 
marked, in England, by the stimulating effect of religion on edu- 
cation—especially the efforts of competing religious denomina- 
tions and their anxiety to increase their power through instruc- 
tion in the peculiar tenets of their creed and in their catechism. 
In states where there was union of Church and State—the Es- 
tablished Church in Virginia—this influence was strong. A 
second influence was the beginnings of the humanitarian move- 
ment, as exhibited in philanthropy, the desire to give poor 
children some opportunity for education, best illustrated in the 
work of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign 
Parts. 
All these forces led to the conception that the state was re- 
sponsible, to some extent at least, for the education of certain 
classes of children. From an economic, religious, and humani- 
tarian standpoint, it was undesirable that a large body of illiterate 
laborers, tradesmen, or farmers should be allowed to develop. 
From a purely selfish standpoint, the money cost, the state was 
compelled to take some action. As in the New England colonies, 
and perhaps influenced by their legislation, the system of ap- 
prenticeship seemed to be the most effective agency to gain the 
ends desired, with the least expense, loss of time from labor, and, 
in the case of the southern colonies, the least interference with 
their general attitude toward the relation of the state to education. 
It is apparent that Virginia not only recognized her respon- 
sibility for the compulsory education of the classes of children 
mentioned, but passed a series of notable acts designed to accom- 
plish the purpose. While they are not so elaborate as those of 
the New England colonies for the seventeenth century, they are 
in some respects above it. For example, the law required that 
/after 1751 all orphan and poor girls apprenticed should be taught 
/ to read and also to write. No New England colony, after 1710, 
\ required all girls apprenticed to be taught to read and write. 
(The acts cited show that we may fairly assert that Virginia es-
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  54 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tablished a compulsory system of education for these special 
classes of children. The laws are mandatory, indicate the ma- 
chinery for enforcement, name the responsible officers, provide 
penalties for negligence of parents, guardians, and masters— 
namely, removal of the child—and, in the case of negligent jus- 
tices, provide a money penalty, or its equivalent in tobacco. 
The central feature of the system was the county court, composed 
of the justices of the peace. It was entirely responsible for the 
workings of the laws respecting orphans. In the case of poor 
and illegitimate children‘the church wardens were about equally 
responsible with the justices. There is thus the same tendency 
as in New England, that of making special officers of local units 
the responsible persons for carrying out the law. There is also 
the same tendency to increase the amount of education required 
for boys and girls apprenticed, and to place less emphasis on re- 
ligious instruction in the eighteenth as compared with the seven- 
teenth century. We shall see from the evidence in court and 
parish records that these acts were enforced, to some extent at 
least, but how effectually or universally it is difficult to say. But 
this observation can be made quite as truly of the legislation of 
the New England colonies. 
COLONIAL EDUCATION IN NORTH CAROLINA? 
By E. W. Kyicur 
Although North Carolina developed before 1860 the most 
creditable system of public education to be found in any of the 
States which seceded from the Union, her intellectual and educa- 
tional growth was very slow during the colonial period. 
The need for schools and education was not keenly felt by 
those in authority. The educational philosophy of seventeenth- 
century England, “that the great body of the people were to obey 
and not to govern, and that the social status of unborn genera- 
tions was already fixed,” was now, as at a later time, widespread 
and persistent. This was the philosophy, not only for the 
colonies, but for the mother country as well. As late as the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century it was held by many that the 
surest way to serve the public welfare was by keeping great

numbers of the people “ignorant as well as poor. Knowledge 
both enlarges and multiplies our desire, and the fewer things man 
wishes for, the more easily his necessity may be supplied.” This 
is an argument which has been frequently used to defeat universal 
public education. 
MIXED SUPPORT AND CONTROL OF COLONIAL SECONDARY 
SCHOOLS: PAROCHIAL—PUBLIC—PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF 
NEW NETHERLANDS ‘* 
ApAPTED FRoM Witi1am H. Kivpatrick 
Of all colonies, those founded from commercial considerations 
show most nearly the identical transfer of the institutional life 
of the parent country. In no instance, probably, has this been 
ruer than in the case of New Netherland. No alienating perse- 
ution had brought the Dutch to the American shores. There 
as no cause for its settlers to criticize even a single custom of the 
loved “fatherland.” On the contrary, conscious pride in the de- 
erved glory of the United Netherlands—then at the zenith of 
thei prosperity—determined them to- transplant the old life as 
ittle changed as possible. 
Among the institutions carried thus to the New World, few, if 
any, had deeper roots in the life of the Dutch than church and 
school. Devotion to the principles of the reformed religion had 
been, in great degree, the secret of the long and stubborn op- 
position to Spanish oppression. That same devotion had been 
he greatest single force in creating the new commonwealth. As 
a most important means of fixing and preserving the reformed 
faith, the parochial school had become an indispensable part of 
the organization of the new church. Interwoven thus with the 
very life of the church was a school system in which the school- 
master was an officer in the church, and the curriculum of the 
school included conscious preparation for participation in the 
service of the public worship. 
This joint control, while differing in different times and places, 
ems on the whole to have been settled in such a way that in 
religious affairs the church had a determining voice, while in all 
ther matters the secular authorities controlled. The division 
f influence would thus differ according to the kind of school. 
n the Latin schools of the city the church saw to it that the

masters signed the creed, that the catechism was taught, that no 
bad books were used, and that the pupils attended the regular 
Sunday church service. But even here the minister and con- 
sistory could only use moral suasion; the enforcement of the laws 
lay finally with the secular body. 
The election and appointment of teachers varied greatly. The 
more important Latin schools were under the immediate control 
of the city burgomasters, and appointment seems to have been 
made directly by them without reference to the church, except 
that generally the requirement of creed subscription was enforced. 
The elementary schools might be so managed, but on the whole 
the church authorities had more voice in appointments to lower 
schools. The synods sought indeed to secure to the consistories 
the legal right of joint action with the magistracy on all appoint- 
ments, but in this they were never entirely successful. 
The remuneration of the teachers was partly by stipulated 
salary, partly by approved school fees, and oftentimes by sundry 
extras, as entrance (matriculation) fees, stipulated presents, and 
free lodging. The salaries of masters came sometimes from the 
town treasury, and sometimes from church funds which had 
(apparently) been sequestered from the church orders at the 
Reformation. 
Letters of instruction were given by an ecclesiastical com- 
mittee to schoolmasters upon their departure from the Nether- 
lands to the New World. Such a letter follows: 
June 7, 1636. 
INSTRUCTIONS AND LETTER OF CREDENTIAL FOR SCHOOL- 
MASTERS GOING TO THE East INDIES oR ELSEWHERE. 
“Whereas it is well understood by the Honorable Directors 
of the N. N. Company, that nothing is more important for 
the well-being of men, of whatever station, than that they 
should be taken care of from the very beginning, by keep- 
ing them under the eye and supervision of the schoolmaster, 
and in the exercises of the school, that they derive from such 
instruction the means necessary for their support, in all the 
stations and callings of life: and 
“Tnasmuch as, also, upon these exercises, both the glory 
of God and the salvation of men are not a little dependent; 
and such exercises are deemed expedient both for the wel- 
fare of their company, as well as for the individuals employed

therein; and also that their ships, besides the other officers, 
may also be provided with schoolmasters; and 
“Tnasmuch as the . . . by these, by the name of N. N. 
. . . has offered his services, in this capacity, to the com- 
mittee on ecclesiastical affairs of the said company, and 
which committee is especially charged therewith by the 
Classis of Amsterdam; and the said classis having previously 
inquired as to this individual, and by examination have as- 
certained his fitness and experience for such a position; that 
on the report rendered by the said classis, and with the 
approbation and consent of the said Honorable Directors, 
he has been appointed schoolmaster, and sent in such ca- 
pacity to N...... I bas with these specific instructions, 
to wit: 
“He is to instruct the youth, both on shipboard and on 
land, in reading, writing, ciphering, and arithmetic, with all 
zeal and diligence; he is also to implant the fundamental 
principles of the true Christian Religion and salvation, by 
means of catechizing; he is to teach them the customary 
forms of prayers, and also to accustom them to pray; he 
_ is to give heed to their manners, and bring these as far 
as possible to modesty and propriety; and to this end, he 
is to maintain good discipline and order, and further to do 
all that is required of a good, diligent, and faithful school- 
master. 
“And inasmuch as N...... ING iatsyecie is directed to con- 
duct himself in this office according to these instructions, 
and he, on his part, has promised so to do, as well as to 
set a good example before youth and others: Therefore, 
these open letters, both credentials and instructions, are 
given him upon his sailing, to serve him as may be found 
necessary. 
_ “Thus done in our classical assembly held in Amsterdam 
Ong.” 
  The part that the local church, through its consistory and 
church masters (kerke meesters), had in the control of the school 
nder consideration seems to have been slight. As to the New 
msterdam church masters, exactly two references have been 
oted which connect them with the school. Both refer to the 
choolhouse; so that we may conclude here that it was the duty 
f the church masters to see to the physical care of the church 
   
-P-A-G-E-70

property, including the schoolhouse, if such there were belonging 
to the church. As no schoolhouse was ever owned by the New 
Amsterdam church (i.e., during the Dutch days), and as after 
1653 the schoolhouse was provided exclusively by the munici- 
pality, the connection of the church wardens with the school, 
which was apparently never very active, ceased entirely, so far as 
appears, some ro years before the English occupation. It may 
be remarked that this connection of the church with the school 
through the church masters, was at all times more nominal than 
real, since the church masters were not chosen by the church, 
but by the civic authorities. No records appear prior to 1656, 
but after that time the burgomasters nominated a double number 
of church masters from whom the director general made a selec- 
tion of the proper number satisfactory to himself. There need 
be no doubt that some such plan obtained throughout the Dutch 
period. Even during the first English period (1664-1673) the 
town council elected the church masters. i 
The elementary school of New Amsterdam was the joint cont! E 
cern of church and state. The church entered as a copartner in 
the school in the fact that, among the Dutch, it was the uni- 
versally accepted duty of the schoolmaster to teach religion 
through the catechism and other church formularies. As theo- 
logical divergence was the worst of all errors, and as the influence 
of the school was now recognized as transcendently great, it had 
become the peculiar duty of the church to safeguard the chair 
of instruction. Accordingly, the Classis of Amsterdam—in spe- 
cial cases, the local minister and consistory—examined the pro- 
spective New Amsterdam masters as to their fitness, especially 
for their religious duties. A like supervision, the church exer- 
cised—in theory at least—over the actual teaching of the 
school. 
The civil authorities conceived their interests and responsibili- 
ties in a manner strikingly similar to what is common in America 
today. They chose the masters—frequently upon ecclesiastical 
recommendation—paid their salaries, furnished the schoolhouse, 
and gave the directions under which the masters taught. In the 
division of civic function, the States-General exercised only a 
broad oversight, serving more as a court of final appeal than as 
an executive or legislative agency. The Lords Directors from 
the general treasury of the company furnished the money for 
the salaries, directed the general affairs of the school, and besides 
held themselves free to control even its minutie. The director
-P-A-G-E-71
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 59 
general and council acted only as the agents of the company, 
but exercised much power in the service of their lords. The 
city authorities, but for decaying finances and an autocratic di- 
rector, would have furnished a sufficient support and the sale 
control of the city school. As it was, their financial support 
extended (apparently) only to furnishing the schoolhouse, while 
the control was always subject to Stuyvesant’s “advice.” In 
spite, however, of any thwarting of purpose, enough was done 
by the secular authorities to present a remarkable anticipation 
of the American public school. 
The support and control of the New Amsterdam Latin school 
was much the same as of the New Amsterdam elementary school, 
the main difference being that no ecclesiastical body is mentioned 
so much as once in connection with the selection or certification 
of either Latin master. Another difference was that while the 
city seemed not to give the elementary master any stipend other 
than house rent, . . . the burgomasters furnished a good portion 
of the salary. 
That the Dutch schools of America are properly called public 
seems unquestionable. They were open to all the children, were 
controlled by the duly constituted civil authorities, and were both 
housed and supported by the public moneys. It is true that 
direct tax levies for school support were not (as a rule) made, 
that tuition was regularly charged, and that the church had 
more or less voice in the management. There was, therefore, 
a failure in these results to reach the present conception of the 
American public schools; but neither one nor all of the defects 
can destroy their essential character as public schools. 
The question as to the influence of these schools on the develop- 
ment of the American public education would for a satisfactory 
answer carry us far beyond the scope of this work. Rather has 
this study been planned to supply information regarding the 
Dutch in America that can be used by others in the investigation 
of such questions. The attitude of the English in colonial New 
York was not of a nature to utilize the Dutch interest in educa- 
tion, nor did the Dutch seem disposed to seek a basis of help- 
ful codperation. Public education in New York City accordingly 
did not flourish during the century of English control. But 
with the Dutch villages the case was far otherwise. Apparently 
in each was maintained a genuine public school. It seems, there- 
fore, unthinkable that this deep interest in public education, which 
for over a century was extended through so much of the colony, 
 
-P-A-G-E-72

should have had no part in early committing New York to a 
strong policy of State public schools. 
THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW OF 1647* 
It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep 
men from the knowledge of the scriptures, as in former times by 
keeping them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times by 
persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the true 
sense and meaning of the original might be clouded by false 
glosses of saint-seeming deceivers, that learning may not be 
buried in the grave of our fathers in church and commonwealth, 
the Lord assisting our endeavors; it is therefore ordered that 
every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased 
them to the number of fifty householders, shall then forthwith 
appoint one within their town to teach all such children as shall 
resort to him to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either 
by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants 
in general, by way of supply, as the major part of those that 
order the prudentials of the town shall appoint; provided, those 
that send their children be not oppressed by paying much 
more than they can have them taught for in other towns; and 
it is further ordered, that where any town shall increase to the 
number of roo families or householders they shall set up a gram- 
mar school, the master thereof being able to instruct youth so 
far as they may be fitted for the university, provided that if any 
town neglect the performance hereof above one year, that every 
such town shall pay five pounds to the next school till they shall 
perform this order. 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EARLY MASSACHUSETTS 
LEGISLATION * 
By Grorce H. Martin 
An analysis of early colonial educational legislation in Massa- 
chusetts reveals the following principles upon which the school 
history of that commonwealth rests: 
1. The universal education of youth is essential to the well- 
being of the state. : 
*Records of Massachusetts, Vol. II, p. 203. 
*The Evolution of the Massachusetts Public School System. D., Appleton 
and Company, 1894, pp. 14-15.
-P-A-G-E-73
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 61 
2. The obligation to furnish this education rests primarily 
upon the parent. 
3. The state has a right to enforce this obligation. 
4. The state may fix a standard which shall determine the 
kind of education, and the minimum amount. 
5. Public money raised by general tax may be used to pro- 
vide such education as the state requires. The tax may be gen- 
eral, though the school attendance is not. 
6. Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by 
the state. Opportunity must be provided at public expense for 
youths who wish it to be fitted for the university. 
Although the Massachusetts Law of 1647 became a model for 
several other colonies, it did not absolve New England or even 
Massachusetts from educational difficulties. The experience of 
Massachusetts with this law was somewhat like that of England 
with the statute of laborers—the passage of the measure was com- 
paratively simple but it had frequently to be reénacted and 
bolstered up by enacting clauses. Even with such attempts to 
make the law effective certain towns which came within the law 
remained without secondary schools. Various reasons for failing 
to maintain grammar schools were set forth: one town could 
find no teacher, another could find no building, still another 
opened a school but found that the school could not be main- 
tained. : 
Notwithstanding these difficulties encountered in bringing 
knowledge to pioneer boys, the passage of this law possesses great 
significance. . 
~Peoples?”-seeondary—school in 1 colonial days. The sec- 
ondary schools of America have been twice impeached: once 
during the colonial period as a result of Benjamin Franklin’s 
proposal that secondary education provide training for the pro- 
spective business man and man of affairs, and once early in the 
national period just before the first high school was organized. 
Franklin himself professed to have found so little of value in 
the classics and so much of value in subjects not commonly 
offered in Latin Grammar schools that he urged not only the
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
founding of a new kind of school, but also the organization of a 
more liberal program of studies. Although Franklin did not 
realize in the academy which he fathered, the kind of attain- 
ments suggested in his proposals, the academy movement did 
tend toward liberalized secondary education, just as it had already 
done in England. 
In 1749 Benjamin Franklin wrote and published a pamphlet 
entitled, “Proposals Relative to the Education of Youth in Penn- 
sylvania.” Although this pamphlet expressed the personal views 
of Franklin, the generous support given to- the proposals show 
that it expressed also the sentiment of many other citizens of 
Philadelphia. These proposals which embodied the plan drawn 
up by Franklin in 1743 bear a striking similarity to present-day 
“proposals” for the establishment of junior colleges. 
FRANKLIN’S ACADEMY * 
By J. P. WickersHAM 
The pamphlet proposed that the house for the Academy should 
be located not far from a river, and have connected with it 
“a garden, orchard, meadow, and a field or two,” and be furnished 
with “a library, maps of all countries, globes, some mathematical 
instruments, an apparatus for experiments in natural philosophy 
and mechanics, prints of all kinds, prospects, building and ma- 
chines.” ‘ihe Rector among other qualifications was to be “a 
correct, pure speaker of the English tongue.” In order to keep 
-the pupils in health and to strengthen and render active their 
bodies, they were to be “frequently exercised in running, leaping, 
wrestling and swimming.” The study of drawing was recom- 
mended with “some of the first principles of perspective.” The 
English \anguage was to be taught by grammar and reading 
some of the best authors; the style of the pupils was to be 
formed “by writing letters to each other, making abstracts of 
what they read, or writing the same things in their own words,” 
and a good delivery acquired by “making declamations, repeat- 
ing speeches, and delivering orations.” Reading was to be made 
serviceable to useful knowledge by introducing the most valuable

facts and observations concerning History, Chronology, Ancient 
Customs, Morality, Religion and Politics. Discussions, oral and 
written, were suggested as well calculated to “warm the imagina- 
tion, whet the industry and strengthen the abilities” of the young. 
“Though all should not be compelled to learn Latin, Greek, or 
the modern foreign languages, yet none that have an ardent 
desire to learn them should be refused; their English, Arithmetic, 
and other studies absolutely necessary, not being neglected.” 
“With the history of men, times and nations should be read, 
at proper hours or days, some of the best histories of nature, 
which would not only be delightful to youth, and furnish them 
with matter for their letters, as well as other history, but would 
afterwards be of great use to them, whether they are merchants, 
handicrafts, or divines; enabling the first better to understand 
many commodities and drugs, the second to improve their trade 
or handicraft by new mixtures of materials, and the last to adorn 
their discourses by beautiful comparisons, and strengthen them 
by new proofs of Divine Providence.” And, “while the pupils 
are reading natural history, might not a little gardening, planting, 
grafting, and inoculating, be taught and practiced; and, now and 
then, excursions made to the neighboring plantations of the best 
farmers, their methods observed and reasoned upon for the 
information of youth, the improvement of agriculture being 
useful to all, and skill in it no disparagement to any?” The 
plan thus proposed, and especially that part of it which sub- 
ordinated classical to English studies, met with great favor and 
generous support. 
The result of the agitation thus begun, was the organization 
of a Board of Trustees to carry the design into effect. Of this 
Board, Franklin was chosen President. Vacancies in the Board 
were to be filled by the remaining members, and no member 
was allowed to receive either reward or compensation. The mem- 
bers of the Board raised among themselves £2000, and this sum 
was afterwards considerably increased by subscriptions among 
the citizens and in other ways. Application was made to the 
Common Council of the City of Philadelphia for aid; and the 
following, from a paper drawn up and presented to this body by 
Franklin, 1750, sets forth the broad and generous objects had 
in view: 
“The greatest part of the money paid and to be paid is 
subscribed by the trustees themselves, and advanced by 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

them, many of whom have no children of their own to edu- 
cate, but act with a view to the public good, without regard 
to sect or party. And they have engaged to open a Charity 
School within two years for the instruction of poor children, 
gratis, in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and the first prin- 
ciples of virtue and piety. The benefits expected from this 
institution are: 
“t, That the youth of Pennsylvania may have an oppor- 
tunity of receiving a good education at home, and be under 
no necessity of going abroad for it, whereby not only consid- 
erable expense may be saved to the country, but a stricter 
eye may be had over their morals by their friends and 
relations. 
“2, That a number of our natives will hereby be qualified 
to bear magistracies, and execute other public offices of trust, 
with reputation to themselves and country, there being at 
present great want of persons so qualified in the several 
counties of this Province; and this is the more necessary 
now to be provided for by the English here, as vast numbers 
of foreigners are yearly imported among us, totally ignorant 
of our laws, customs and language. 
“3, That a number of the poorer sort will hereby be quali- 
fied to act as schoolmasters in the country, to teach children 
reading, writing, arithmetic and the grammar of their mother 
tongue, and being of good morals and known character, may 
be recommended from the Academy to country schools for 
that purpose—the country suffering very much at present 
for want of good schoolmasters, and obliged frequently to 
employ in their schools vicious imported servants or con- 
cealed Papists, who by their bad examples and instructions 
often deprave the morals or corrupt the principles of the 
children under their care. 
“4. It is thought that a good Academy erected here in 
Philadelphia, a healthy place, where provisions are plenty, 
situated in the centre of the Colonies, may draw numbers of 
students from the neighboring Provinces, who must spend 
considerable sums among us yearly in payment for their 
lodging, diet, apparel, etc., which will be an advantage to our 
traders, artisans and owners of houses and lands.”   Extending the privilege of education by extending the 
academy. In 1751 the Philadelphia Academy was established in
-P-A-G-E-77

DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 65 
accordance with the general tenor of the “proposals.” The launch- 
ing of this school was a very significant step in secondary educa- 
tion, because it marks the beginning of the successful career of a 
new and important institution for America. 
The academies which were established during the later years 
of the eighteenth century as well as the original Franklin academy 
made a particularly strong bid for the patronage of the middle 
classes. Instead of going abroad for secondary education, boys 
might here receive training which was said by the friends of 
academies to be quite as good as the training given in England. 
An examination of the “proposals” shows that the Franklin 
academy was designed to depart considerably from the contem- 
porary requirements for college entrance—at least so far as 
variety of subjects offered was concerned. Although many of 
the academies became essentially college preparatory institutions, 
the curriculums of academies remained much broader than those 
of Latin grammar schools. The “great end and real business of 
living” was the objective of Exeter academy which was founded 
in 1778. According to the original constitution of this school, its 
objective was pursued by means of training in English, Latin, 
Greek, penmanship, mathematics, science, music, and other liberal 
courses as the trustees might direct. By the beginning of the nine- 
teenth century this school offered the following subjects: Latin, 
Greek, French, English, rhetoric, logic, moral philosophy, arith- 
metic, geometry, physics, geography, astronomy, and natural law. 
By 1818 there was a division of the program of studies into two 
curriculums, the classical and the English. The English curricu- 
lum contained the following additions to the program of 1800: 
ancient and modern history, forensics, surveying, navigation, 
together with an amplification of the offerings in English com- 
position. It is of especial importance to note that this expansion 
of the program of studies was made upon the initiative of 
academies and their patrons, and that these expanded programs 
greatly exceeded the demands of contemporary colleges. The 
additions were made partly as a result of demands of founders 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and patrons and partly as a result of increased available subject 
matter, as in science. The broadening curriculum of the acade- 
mies, the appeal to boys to receive their schooling in America, 
and the manner in which the teaching was conducted combined 
in such a way as to cause certain English friends of education 
some disquietude. One English writer candidly admitted that 
American scholarship was no longer what it had formerly been 
when the colonial boys were trained in Europe. 
The boys in academies were somewhat older than those in 
the earlier Latin grammar schools. Their elementary training 
was more extensive. Owing to this greater maturity, extra- 
curricular activities of broader scope were attempted. Student 
organizations such as debating clubs were formed, occasional 
plays and exhibitions were presented, and athletic activities were) 
increased. : 
In addition to expanding the program of studies, academies 
broadened the scope of purposes set up by earlier secondary 
schools. Many students who attended the academies remained 
as cadets or instructors for some time after completing their 
courses. Also, certain students pursued academy courses with 
the avowed purpose of becoming teachers. These conditions to- 
gether with another which was of far greater significance than 
either of the two foregoing matters led many academies to as- 
sume a fairly definite position as normal training institutions. 
The third direction assumed by the expanding academies was 
in the opening of their doors to girls. Up to the days of acade- 
mies, girls had generally been regarded as unfit for higher edu- 
cation or else higher education as unfit for girls. At any rate, 
girls had been allowed to go no further than the doorsteps in 
attendance at Latin grammar schools, although the story is told 
that a Massachusetts girl in her eagerness for wisdom did pro- 
ceed that far. Certain fortunate girls had received the benefits 
of private tutelage, but fear for national welfare, domestic tran- 
quillity, and the strong probability that girls would fail in rigorous 
academic tasks even if they were admitted to the schools, not
-P-A-G-E-79
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 67 
only preserved boys’ ‘schools from co-educational arrangements 
but even deterred a society governed by males from providing 
separate schools for girls. 
The secondary education of girls was promoted very slowly 
even after it was first proposed and begun. The “School of 
Misses” conducted by David McClure in 1773 was among the 
earliest schools which trained girls beyond the rudiments if in- 
deed that school did so. In his diary for December 1, 1773, 
McClure wrote: 7 
I opened the School consisting the first day of about 30 
Misses. Afterwards they increased to 70 and 80; so that I was 
obliged to divide the day between them; & one half came in the 
forenoon, and the other in the Afternoon. They were from 7 to 
20 years of age. Mr. Samuel Parker, afterwards settled in the 
ministry in Boston, was my predecessor in this school. I attended 
to them in reading, writing, arithmetic & geography principally. 
This is, I believe, the only female School, (supported by the 
town) in New England, it is a wise and useful institution. 
At the close of the Revolution, the spirit of independence and 
equality had proceeded so far as to warrant the opening of 
academies for girls in New Haven and Philadelphia. In 1785, 
a co-educational academy was opened at Greenfield Hill. A few 
other schools for either girls only or for both boys and girls were 
opened before 1800. During the first quarter of the nineteenth 
century a solid basis was given for the girls’ educational move- 
ment. Then it was that Mary Lyon, the founder of Mount 
Holyoke seminary, became fired with zeal for the education of 
girls. Then it was also that inspiration for the founding of 
two hundred seminaries for girls emanated directly from the 
famous Tory seminary. By 1837, America was definitely com- 
mitted to the offering of training beyond the elementary school 
to girls and women. By that time female seminaries and higher 
institutions as Mount Holyoke and Oberlin were giving women 
substantially the same quality of training as that offered to

men in the academies and colleges of the day. Co-education 
developed somewhat more tardily. It was prompted for two prin- 
cipal reasons: first, America was converted to the desirability 
of educating girls, and, second, the need for economical adminis- 
tering of education required that boys and girls be trained to- 
gether. The persistent cogency of both of these reasons has 
prevented and will prevent for years to come the serious consid- 
eration of separating the sexes in elementary, secondary, or col- 
legiate institutions. 
The early American high school. In spite of the advances 
made in the democratization of education by the academies, a 
spirit of unrest developed in certain centers about 1820. The 
following passages from the report of the Boston School Com- 
mittee in 1821 indicate some of the reasons for establishing a new 
kind of secondary school and the character of the proposed school. 
Although the name proposed, English Classical School, was 
adopted, the new school soon acquired the name, English High 
School.® 
“. , . The mode of education now adopted, and the branches 
of knowledge that are taught at our English grammar schools, 
are not sufficiently extensive nor otherwise calculated to bring 
the powers of the mind into operation nor to qualify a youth to 
fill usefully and respectably many of those stations, both public 
and private, in which he may be placed. A parent who wishes 
to give a child an education that shall fit him for active life, 
and shall serve as a foundation for eminence in his profession, 
whether Mercantile or Mechanical, is under the necessity of 
giving him a different education from any which our public 
schools can now furnish. Hence, many children are separated 
from their parents and sent to private academies in this vicinity, 
to acquire that instruction which cannot be obtained at the 
public seminaries. Thus, many parents, who contribute largely 
to the support of these institutions, are subjected to heavy 
expense for the same object, in other towns.

tions that might be offered, and in order to render the present 
system of public education more nearly perfect, are of the opinion 
that an additional School is required. They therefore, recom- 
mend the founding of a seminary which shall be called the Eng- 
lish Classical School, and submit the following as a general out- 
line of a plan for its organization and of the course of studies 
to be pursued. 
“rst. That the term of time for pursuing the course of studies 
proposed, be three years. 
“ondly. That the School be divided into three classes, and one 
year be assigned to the studies of each class. 
“3rdly, That the age of admission be not less than twelve 
years.

“sthly. That candidates for admission be proposed on a given 
day annually; but scholars with suitable qualifications may be 
admitted at any intermediate time to an advanced standing. 
“6thly. That candidates for admission shall be subject to a 
strict examination, in such manner as the School Committee may 
direct, to ascertain their qualifications according to these rules. 
“7thly. That it be required of every candidate, to qualify 
him for admission, that he be well acquainted with reading, writ- 
ing, English grammar in all its branches, and arithmetic as far 
as simple proportion. 
“8thly. That it be required of the Masters and Ushers, as 
a necessary qualification, that they shall have been regularly 
educated at some University. 
The program of studies for the three years of this school 
was as follows: 
First year—English, arithmetic, and geography. (English in- 
cluded reading, literature, composition, and declamation.) 
Second year—English, mathematics, history, and logic. (Eng- 
lish included the same branches as in the first year; mathematics 
included algebra, geometry, trigonometry and applied mathe- 
matics, as navigation and surveying; history included ancient and 
modern history and chronology.) 
Third year—English, mathematics, history, natural science, and 
philosophy. (English, mathematics, and history included the

same as for the preceding year; philosophy included logic and 
moral and political philosophy.) 
In May, 1821, a secondary school was opened in accordance 
with the foregoing plans. This school was not at first called 
a high school, although that name was applied to it in the records 
of the school committee in 1824. A high school for girls was 
opened in Boston in January 1826. Likewise, in New York a 
“High School for Boys”-was-opened in 1825 and a “Female High- 
School” in 1826. Other cities of Massachusetts, as Worcester, 
Plymouth, and Salem, established high schools soon after Boston 
opened the first high school. As these schools were established 
upon the initiative of individual cities, this development was 
satisfactory for towns and cities which took the necessary steps 
for founding such schools, but for other localities general legis- 
lation was needed. Such legislation was provided in 1827. 
The beginning of state legislation for high schools. The 
Massachusetts law of 1827 placed the high school upon a statutory 
basis. Although the mandatory character of this law was not 
followed immediately in the legislation of other states, a precedent 
for such laws was hereby established. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in 
General Court assembled and by the authority of the same. 
That each town or district within this Commonwealth, containing 
fifty families, or householders, shall be provided with a teacher 
or teachers, of good morals, to instruct children in orthography, 
reading, writing, English grammar, geography, arithmetic, and 
good behavior, for such term of time as shall be equivalent to six 
months for one school in each year; and every town or district 
containing one hundred families or householders, shall be pro- 
vided with such teacher or teachers, for such term of time as 
shall be equivalent to eighteen months, for one school in each 
year. And every city, town, or district, containing five hundred 
families, or householders, shall be provided with such teacher or 
teachers for such term of time as shall be equivalent to twenty- 
four months, for one school in each year, and shall also be pro- 
vided with a master of good morals, competent to instruct, in 
addition to the branches of learning aforesaid, the history of "the

United States, bookkeeping by single entry, geometry, surveying, 
algebra; and shall employ such master to instruct a school, in 
such city, town, or district, for the benefit of all the inhabitants 
thereof, at least ten months in each year, exclusive of vacations, 
in such convenient place, or alternately at such places in such 
city, town, or district, as the said inhabitants, at their meetings 
in March, or April, annually, shall determine; and in every 
city, or town, containing four thousand inhabitants, such master 
shall be competent in addition to all the foregoing branches, 
to instruct the Latin and Greek languages, history, rhetoric, and 
logic. 
The struggle for public secondary schools. The opening of 
a few high schools was not readily accepted as leading toward 
a solution of the problems of secondary education. Academies 
had become firmly established by 1830, and their traditions had 
taken deep root in the minds of many leaders. For more than 
a generation a severe battle raged between academies and high 
schools. On the side of the academies were their early start, 
independent financial support, traditions, and independence of 
demagogues. On the side of the high schools were public financial 
support, academic appeal to the masses of citizens, popular con- 
trol, and responsiveness to the desires of citizens in general. The 
following quotations entitled, Early High-School Propaganda, The 
Battle Between Academies and High Schools—the excerpt from 
the Reverend Gulliver’s address, The Relative Merits of Public 
High-Schools and Endowed Academies, and The High-School Sys- 
tem indicate the seriousness of the conflict between the two types 
of secondary schools. 
Early high-school propaganda. The following statement of 
the nature, object, and probable results of a public high school 
was first addressed to the citizens of Hartford, Connecticut, in 
1838. During the next four years it was repeated in public 
addresses in all cities of the state. In 1846, under the title, 
Considerations Respecting a High School,? it was reprinted as 
a tract to promote the establishment of a high school in Hartford.

The testimonials regarding high schools in other cities add weight 
to the argument in the main statement. 
By a Public or Common High School, is intended a public 
or common school for the older and more advanced scholars 
of the community in which the same is located, in a course of 
instruction adapted to their age, and intellectual and moral wants, 
and, to some extent, to their future pursuits in life. It is common 
or public in the same sense in which the district school, or any 
lower grade of school established and supported under a general 
law and for the public benefit, is common or public. It is open to 
all the children of the community to which the school belongs, 
under such regulations as to age, attainments, etc., as the good 
of the institution may require, or the community may adopt. 
A Public High School is not necessarily a free school. It may 
be supported by a fund, a public tax, or an assessment or rate 
of tuition per scholar, or by a combination of all, or any two of 
these modes. Much less is it a public or common school in the 
sense of being cheap, inferior, ordinary. To be truly a public 
school, a High School must embrace in its course of instruction 
studies which can be more profitably pursued there than in public 
schools of a lower grade, or which gather their pupils from a 
more circumscribed territory, and as profitably as in any private 
schools of the same pretensions. It must make a good education 
common in the highest and best sense of the word common— 
common because it is good enough for the best, and cheap enough 
for the poorest family in the community. It would be a mockery 
of the idea of such a school, to call it a Public High School, 
if the course of instruction pursued in it is not higher and better 
than can be got in public schools of a lower grade, or if it does 
not meet the wants of the wealthiest and best educated families, 
or, if the course of instruction is liberal and thorough, and at the 
same time the worthy and talented child of a poor family is 
shut out from its privileges by a high rate of tuition. The school, 
to be common practically, must be both cheap and good. To be 
cheap, its support must be provided for wholly or mainly out 
of a fund, or by public tax. And to justify the imposition of a 
public tax, the advantages of such a school must accrue to the 
whole community. It must be shown to be a common benefit, 
a common interest, which cannot be secured so well, or at all, ex- 
cept through the medium of taxation. What, then, are the ad- 
vantages which may reasonably be anticipated from the establish-
-P-A-G-E-85
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 13 
ment of a Public High School, properly organized, instructed, 
and supervised? 
First. Every thing which is now done in the several district 
schools, and schools of lower grade, can be better done, and in 
a shorter time, because the teachers will be relieved from the 
necessity of devoting the time and attention now required by 
few of the older and more advanced pupils, and can bestow 
all their time and attention upon the preparatory studies and 
younger children. These studies will be taught in methods suited 
to the age and attainments of the pupils. A right beginning can 
thus be made in the lower schools, in giving a thorough practical 
knowledge of elementary principles, and in the formation of 
correct mental and moral habits, which are indispensable to all 
sound education. All this will be done under the additional stim- 
ulus of being early and thoroughly fitted for the High School. 
Second. A High School will give completeness to the system 
of public instruction which may be in operation. It will make 
suitable provision for the older and more advanced pupils of both 
sexes, and will admit of the methods of instruction and discipline 
which cannot be profitably introduced into the schools below. 
The lower grade of schools—those which are established for young 
children—require a large use of oral and simultaneous methods, 
and a frequent change of place and position on the part of the 
pupils. The higher branches, especially all mathematical sub- 
jects, require patient application and habits of abstraction on the 
part of the older pupils, which can with difficulty, if at all, be 
attained by many pupils amid a multiplicity of distracting ex- 
ercises, movements, and sounds. The recitations of this class of 
pupils, to be profitable and satisfactory, must be conducted 
in a manner which requires time, discussion, and explanation, 
and the undivided attention both of pupils and teacher. The 
course of instruction provided in the High School will be equal 
in extent and value to that which may be given in any private 
school, academy, or female seminary in the place, and which is 
now virtually denied to the great mass of the children by the 
burdensome charge of tuition. 
Third. It will equalize the opportunities of a good education, 
and exert a happy, social influence throughout the whole com- 
munity from which it gathers its scholars. From the want of 
a public school of this character, the children of such families 
as rely exclusively on the district school are isolated, and are con- 
demned to an inferior education, both in quality and quantity;
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
they are cut off from the stimulus and sympathy which the 
mingling of children of the same age from different parts of the 
same community would impart. The benefits, direct and in- 
direct, which will result to the country districts, or poor families 
who live in the outskirts of the city, from the establishment of 
a school of this class, cannot easily be overestimated. The num- 
ber of young men and young women who will receive a thorough 
education, qualifying them for business, and to be teachers, will 
increase from year to year; and the number who will press 
up to the front ranks of scholarship in the school, bearing away 
the palm of excellence by the vigor of sound minds in sound 
bodies, of minds and bodies made vigorous by long walks and 
muscular labor in the open air, will be greater in proportion to 
their number than from the city districts. It will do both 
classes good, the children of the city, and the children of the 
country districts, to measure themselves intellectually in the same 
fields of study, and to subject the peculiarities of their respective 
manners, the roughness and awkwardness sometimes characteristic 
of the one, and the artificiality and flippancy of the other, to 
the harmonizing influence of reciprocal action and reaction. The 
isolation and estrangement which now divide and subdivide the 
community into country and city clans, which, if not hostile, are 
strangers to each other, will give place to the frequent inter- 
course and esteem of individual and family friendship, com- 
menced in the school-room, and on the play-ground of the school. 
The school will thus become a bond of union, a channel of sym- 
pathy, a spring-head of healthy influence, and stimulus to the 
whole community. 
Fourth, The privileges of a good school will be brought within 
the reach of all classes of the community, and will actually be 
enjoyed by children of the same age from families of the most 
diverse circumstances as to wealth, education, and occupation. 
Side by side in the same recitations, heart and hand in the same 
sports, pressing up together to the same high attainments in 
knowledge and character, will be found the children of the rich 
and poor, the more and the less favored in outward circumstances, 
without knowing or caring to know how far their families are 
separated by the arbitrary distinctions which divide and distract 
society. With nearly equal opportunities of education in child- 
hood and youth, the prizes of life, its best fields of usefulness, 
and sources of happiness will be open to all, whatever may have 
been their accidents of birth and fortune, From many obscure
-P-A-G-E-87
  
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 75 
and humble homes in the city and in the country, will be called 
forth and trained inventive talent, productive skill, intellectual 
taste, and God-like benevolence, which will add to the general 
wealth, multiply workshops, increase the value of farms, and carry 
forward every moral and religious enterprise which aims to bless, 
purify, and elevate society. 
Fifth. The influence which the annual or semi-annual examina- 
tion of candidates for admission into the High School has, will 
operate as a powerful and abiding stimulus to exertion throughout 
all the lower schools. The privileges of the High School will be 
held forth as the reward of exertion in the lower grade of schools; 
and promotion to it, based on the result of an impartial examina- 
tion, will form an unobjectional standard by which the relative 
standing of the different schools can be ascertained, and will 
also indicate the studies and departments of education Po which 
the teachers in particular schools should devote special attention. 
This influence upon the lower schools, upon scholars and 
teachers, upon those who reach, and those who do not reach the 
High School, will be worth more than all it costs, independent of 
the advantages received by its pupils. 
Sixth. While the expenses of public or common schools will 
necessarily be increased by the establishment of a school of this 
class, in addition to those already supported, the aggregate ex- 
penditures for education, including public and private schools, 
will be diminished. Private schools of the same relative standing 
will be discontinued for want of patronage, while those of a higher 
grade, if really called for by the educational wants of the com- 
munity, will be improved. A healthy competition will neces- 
sarily exist between the public and private schools of the highest 
grade, and the school or schools which do not come up to the 
highest mark, must go down in public estimation. Other things 
being equal, viz., school-houses, teachers, classification, and the 
means and appliances of instruction, the public school is always 
better than the private. From the uniform experience of those 
places where a High School has been established, it may be safely 
stated, that there will be an annual saving in the expenses of 
education to any community, equal to one half the amount paid 
for tuition in private schools, and, with this saving of expense, 
there will be a better state of education. 
Seventh. The successful establishment of a High School, by 
improving the whole system of common schools, and interesting 
a larger number of families in the prosperity of the schools, will
-P-A-G-E-88
Co Eee oe ee Pere ee em 
76 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
create a better public sentiment on the subject than has hereto- 
fore existed, and the schools will be regarded as the common 
property, the common glory, the common security of the whole 
community. The wealthy will feel that the small additional tax 
required to establish and sustain this school, if not saved to them 
in the diminished tuition for the education of their own children 
in private schools, at home and abroad, is returned to them a 
hundred fold in the enterprise which it will quicken, in the in- 
creased value given to property, and in the number of families 
which will resort to the place where it is located, as a desirable 
residence, because of the facilities employed for a good educa- 
tion. The poor will feel that, whatever may betide them, their 
children are born to an inheritance more valuable than lands or 
shops, in the free access to institutions where as good an educa- 
tion can be had as money can buy at home or abroad. The 
stranger will be invited to visit not only the institutions which 
public or individual benevolence has provided for the poor, the 
orphan, the deaf mute, and the criminal, but schools where the 
children and youth of the community are trained to inventive 
and creative habits of mind, to a practical knowledge of the 
fundamental principles of business, to sound moral habits, re- 
fined tastes, and respectful manners. And in what balance, it 
has well been asked in reference to the cost of good public schools, 
as compared with these advantages, shall we weigh the value of 
cultivated, intelligent, energetic, polished, and virtuous citizens? 
How much would a community be justified in paying for a physi- 
| cian who should discover or practice some mode of treatment 
through which many lives should be preserved? How much for 
a judge, who, in the able administration of the laws, should 
secure many fortunes, or rights more precious than fortunes, 
that might else be lost? How much for a minister of religion 
who should be the instrument of saving hundreds from vice and 
crime, and persuading them to the exertion of their best powers 
for the common good? How much for the ingenious inventor, 
who, proceeding from the first principles of science onward, 
should produce some improvement that should enlarge all the 
comforts of society, not to say a steam-engine or a magnetic 
telegraph? How much for the patriotic statesman, who, in diffi- 
cult times, becomes the savior of his country? How much for 
the well-instructed and enterprising merchant who should sug- 
gest and commence the branches of business that should bring 
in a vast accession of wealth and strength? One such person as 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 77 
any of these might repay what a High School would cost for 
centuries. Whether, in the course of centuries, every High School 
would produce one such person, it would be useless to prophesy. 
But it is certain that it would produce many intelligent citizens, 
intelligent men of business, intelligent servants of the state, 
intelligent teachers, intelligent wives and daughters, who, in their 
several spheres, would repay to any community much more than 
they and all their associates had received. The very taxes of a 
town, in twenty years, will be lessened by the existence of a 
school which will continually have sent forth those who were so 
educated as to become not burdens but benefactors. 
These results have been realized wherever a Public High School 
has been opened under circumstances favorable to the success 
of a private school of the same grade—wherever a good school- 
house, good regulations, (for admission, attendance, studies, and 
books,) good teachers, and good supervision have been provided. 
The Principal of the Latin High School of Boston, in a letter 
written 1846, says— 
“There is no institution so truly republican as such a school as 
this. While we, the present teachers, were under-graduates of 
the school, the rich sent their sons to the school because it was 
the best that could be found. They ascertained that it was not 
a source of contamination, but that their boys learned here to 
compare themselves with others, and to feel the necessity of 
something more than mere wealth to gain consideration. At that 
time, poor men sent their sons hither because they knew that they 
here would get that education which they could afford to give 
them in no other way. They gained too by intercourse with their 
wealthier mates a polish of exterior manners, and an intellectual 
turn of mind which their friends could appreciate and perceive, 
although they could not tell what it was that had been acquired. 
Oftentimes also the poor boy would take the lead of his more 
pampered classmate, and take the honors of the school. 
“Tn a class lately belonging to the school were two boys, one the 
son of a man of extreme wealth, whose property cannot be less 
than $500,000; and the other the son of an Irish laborer em- 
ployed by the city at a dollar a day to sweep the streets. The 
latter boy was the better scholar.”  
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The Principal of the English High School in a letter writes— 
“The school under my charge is principally composed of what 
are called the middling classes of our city. At present, about one 
third of my pupils are sons of merchants; the remaining two 
thirds are sons of professional men, mechanics and laborers. A 
few years ago, he who ranked, the last year of his course, as 
our third scholar, was the son of a lamplighter, and worked three 
nights per week, during his whole course, to save his father the 
expense of books, &c., while at school. This year my second 
(if not the first), scholar, is a cooper’s son. We have several 
sons of clergymen of distinction and lawyers of eminence. Indeed, 
the school is a perfect example of the poor and the rich, meeting 
on common ground and on terms quite democratic.” 
The Principal of the High School for girls in Newburyport, 
writes— 
“The Female High School was established by the town of 
Newburyport nearly three years since, under great opposition. 
It was the desire of its principal advocates to make it such a 
school, in respect to the course of instruction, and facilities for 
acquiring knowledge, and laying the foundation for usefulness, 
as should so successfully compete with our best private schools, 
as to supersede their necessity. 
“A few days after we were organized, a gentleman came into 
the schoolroom to make some inquiries respecting the classes of 
society most fully represented amongst us. I was totally unable 
to give him the desired information, and judging from the appear- 
ance of the individuals of my charge, I could form no idea as to 
who were the children of poor parents, or of those in better cir- 
cumstances. I mentioned the names of the parents of several, 
which I had just taken, and, amongst others, of two young ladies 
of seventeen or eighteen years of age, who, at that moment, it 
being recess, were walking down the room, with their arms closely 
entwined about each other’s necks. ‘The first of the two,’ said 
the gentleman, ‘is a daughter of one of our first merchants, the 
other has a father worse than none, who obtains a livelihood from 
one of the lowest and most questionable occupations, and is him- 
self most degraded.’ These two young ladies were classmates 
for more than two years, and very nearly equal in scholarship. 
The friendship they have formed, I am confident no circum- 
stances of station in life can ever impair.
-P-A-G-E-91
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 79 
“We have had in our number many from the best families, in 
all respects, in the place. They sit side by side, they recite, and 
they associate most freely with those of the humblest parentage, 
whose widowed mothers, perhaps, toil day after day, at a wash- 
tub, without fear of contamination, or, as I honestly believe, 
a thought of the differences which exist. I have, at present, both 
extremes under my charge—the child of affluence and the child 
of low parentage and deep poverty. As my arrangements of 
pupils in divisions, &c. are, most of them, alphabetical, it often 
happens that the two extremes are brought together. This never 
causes a murmur, or look of dislike.” 
THE BATTLE BETWEEN ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS” 
The struggle in America between high schools and academies 
is exemplified in the annals of Norwich, Connecticut. The en- 
dowment of a FREE ACADEMY in the town of Norwich, Con- 
necticut, by a few large-hearted men, as part of the system of 
public instruction, is a remarkable example of liberality to the 
cause of education and science, which we take pleasure in record- 
ing. The building erected for the accommodation of the school, 
the range of studies contemplated, the permanence and liberality 
of the endowment, and the history of the educational movement 
which ended in the present organization of the schools of Nor- 
wich, are matters of such general interest, that we have asked 
the privilege of publishing the Address of the Rev. J. P. Gulliver, 
with the other proceedings, at the recent inauguration of the 
institution. As an appropriate introduction, and summary of the 
whole movement we copy the following article from the Appendix 
to the Annual Report of the Superintendent of Common Schools 
in Connecticut for 1856. 
Movements were commenced about twenty years since, for a re- 
organization of the public schools of the Second School Society of 
Norwich. The usual opposition originated by a few narrow- 
minded tax-payers, and fanned into life by ambitious demagogues, 
was arrayed against the measure, and it was finally defeated. 
The whole community had, however, been agitated with the 
subject, and much good seed had been sown, which has since 
borne beautiful fruit. For ten years the citizens of Norwich made 
the best they could of a set of disjointed schools, thrown together 
with scarcely any attempt at gradation, governed by six inde- 
* Barnard’s American Journal of Education, Il, 665-670. 1856. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pendent districts, and some forty school officers, and supported 
entirely without taxation. Good men labored hard; but almost 
in vain, to secure for the people, under the existing system, good 
schools. 
An effort was then made, with still greater earnestness, to 
improve the schools, without any attempt at re-organization. 
They were regularly visited. A monthly meeting of the visitors 
was held, at which the condition of each school was minutely 
reported. Every possible effort was made to elevate the schools. 
The success was, however, but partial. After a trial of two 
years, the gentlemen, whose valuable time had been given to the 
effort, came unanimously to the conclusion, that without a con- 
solidation of at least the more central school districts, and the 
thorough grading of the schools, and the taxation of property 
for the support of schools, this labor would be thrown away. The 
board, accordingly laid before the school society a proposition for 
inaugurating such a change. This was the signal for a storm! 
A few (but only a few) of the heavy tax-payers were the first 
to smell treason. They passed the word to a set of men, who 
flourish in their own esteem, by exhibiting their powers to thwart- 
ing what others attempt to do. The usual cry was raised, “a 
school for the rich.” The prejudices of poor men were appealed 
to. This very class, who were to be most benefited by the 
change, were excited to oppose it. Men who had been paying 
rate bills for years, clamored against the proposition to support 
schools by taxing property. Parents, who had bitterly complained 
that their children could not be as well educated as those of 
the wealthy, refused to accept a plan which was to bring the 
highest order of schools within their reach, at a mere nominal 
expense. The intelligent portion of the community were, how- 
ever, thoroughly aroused. Meeting after meeting was held. 
Crowds attended and listened to the discussions. Light was 
rapidly diffused. The opposition became desperate. All manner 
of offensive personalities were made use of to intimidate those 
who were inclined to be champions of the good cause. Still, 
it was apparent, by incidental votes, that a large and an in- 
creasing majority were in favor of the proposed change. This 
majority, however, forbore to press the question to a decisive 
vote. They publicly avowed their intention to postpone final 
action, until the whole community should have fully examined 
the question, and arrived at an intelligent decision upon it. This 
concession was taken advantage of. At an adjourned meeting,
-P-A-G-E-93
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 81 
where it was generally understood no decisive action was to take 
place, the opposition collected a large force, very many of whom 
were not legal voters, and, in the absence of the great body of 
the ‘friends of the measure, voted the indefinite postponement of 
the whole subject. No sooner had this been accomplished, than 
a general regret was expressed at the result, even among those who 
had boisterously aided in the movement. Many declared that 
had they expected to succeed, they would not have opposed the 
measure. Their leaders, instead of receiving the coveted meed 
of applause from their followers, for the victory, were over- 
whelmed with reproaches. In these circumstances, the friends of 
reform judged it wise to cease all further agitation of the subject, 
and to leave the responsibility of the consequences upon those 
who had chosen to assume it. The administration of the schools 
was accordingly left in their hands. They appointed such officers 
as they chose, and no attempt was made in any form, for two 
years, to interfere with their wishes. During this time, the 
schools sunk to a lower level than ever. Even the most ignorant 
and prejudiced, could not fail to see and feel the evil. The 
attendance constantly diminished, until it was ascertained that 
only about one-third of the children, between the ages of four 
and sixteen, attended school at all. The feeling of the community 
on the subject was becoming intense. The attention of the 
people having been so thoroughly aroused by previous discussion, 
every defect was seen in a focal light. Those who had been dis- 
tinguished as the leaders in the effort to defeat the proposed 
reforms, found themselves in a most uncomfortable position. 
They were daily reproached as the authors of all the mischief. 
The first fruit of this ripened public sentiment, was a movement 
for the endowment of a free high school. Every attempt to im- 
prove the lower schools, had been met by the cry, “You want a 
high school! You want a school for the rich, and mean to tax 
the poor to pay for it!”” Some thirty-five individuals accordingly 
determined that they would unite and establish a high school and 
endow it, which should be open, free of all charge, to all classes. 
This effort was successful, some eighty-five thousand dollars 
having been subscribed for that purpose. It was generally under- 
stood that as soon as this subscription was complete, a new appeal 
was to be made to the school society to acknowledge this magnifi- 
cent donation, by re-organizing their lower schools on the plan 
previously rejected. Before this plan could be carried out, it was 
ascertained that the leaders in the former opposition were moving
-P-A-G-E-94
82 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in the same direction, and were about to propose the same thing! 
Most gladly the friends of reform left the business in their hands. 
The result was, that a consolidation of the two central districts 
of the city was effected, a vote was passed, unanimously, to pur- 
chase one of the most valuable lots in the city, and to erect the 
noble structure. Soon after, the provisions of the new school law 
were accepted, a Board of Education was appointed, the ablest 
teachers were engaged at liberal salaries, a perfect gradation of 
schools established, and every provision made for the institution 
of the very best system of public education. When the Free 
Academy shall go into operation, Norwich will undoubtedly be 
furnished with public schools, equal, if not superior, to those of 
any city in the land, not excepting Boston and its neighboring 
municipalities. This history shows what can be accomplished, 
in the face of the most powerful opposition, by determination, 
patience and perseverance. It especially shows that defeat is 
often essential to victory. The feeling excited, and the interest 
awakened by these repeated defeats, have secured these glorious 
ends. It should be added, that the citizens of Norwich are justly 
proud of their schools, and that the expenditure they occasion 
is most cheerfully borne, without the slightest show of opposition. 
As an important part of the history of this movement, we 
publish a Circular, addressed to a few of the wealthiest citizens 
of Norwich, which, seconded by the unwearied personal efforts 
of the author, the Rev. J. P. Gulliver, originated and gave direc- 
tion to the efforts which ended in the establishment and endow- 
ment of the Free Academy. After setting forth the condition 
of the schools and of education in Norwich, the author remarks: 
Such are some of the leading facts in the case. The inquiry 
now arises—In what way may these evils be most readily re- 
moved? 
Will you allow me to suggest, very briefly, some considera- 
tions which go to show that the establishment of a HIGH 
SCHOOL, on an independent basis and on a liberal scale, will 
more directly and surely effect the object in view than any other 
measure we can adopt. 
Such a school is of course necessary to secure instruction in 
the higher branches of study, for which we have almost no pro- 
vision now. 
It is necessary to introduce system and gradation into the 
lower schools. There must be a standard to grade by—a unit
-P-A-G-E-95
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 83 
to measure with. The qualifications required for entering the 
High School will furnish such a standard. Those who control the 
High School can raise the standard as rapidly as the improvement 
in the lower schools will allow. Thus gradually and almost in- 
sensibly all the schools in the city will be elevated. 
This inciting influence will be felt also by parents, committees, 
and districts. No district will be willing to be deprived of the 
privileges of the High School on account of the inferiority of its 
own schools. The reputation of grammar school teachers will 
depend on the number of scholars they get into the High School. 
This will raise the standard in the grammar school. The repu- 
tation of the Primary school teachers will depend on their suc- 
cess in qualifying their scholars for the improved grammar school. 
The committees in charge of each school will sympathize with the 
teachers and pupils. The parents will soon become interested. 
No district will wish to be left behind in the honorable competi- 
tion. A new life will thus be infused into all our schools. A new 
standard will gradually be adopted in all our districts. Interest 
and activity will take the place of apathy and indifference. 
This seems to my own mind the readiest and surest way of re- 
forming our whole school system. By means of a High School we 
can lead where we could never force. We can gently allure those 
upon whom our arguments and remonstrances will have no effect. 
A board of enlightened men in charge of a High School could in 
fact, without seeming to do so, control the schools of the whole 
city. Gradually, but surely we should see them elevated in their 
character, enlarged in their accommodations, deepening in in- 
terest, and extending on every side their benign and elevating 
influences. 
The next inquiry that claims our consideration is—How shall 
a Free High School be established and sustained? 
There are but two ways:— 
1. It may be established and controlled by the School Society. 
2. It may be endowed by private munificence and managed 
by a board of Trustees selected by the founders. 
The first is the ordinary method, and is in a good measure suc- 
cessful under the Massachusetts and Rhode Island laws, which 
authorize town and city governments to establish and control 
the schools, without recourse to a popular vote. But under the 
Connecticut law there are many difficulties. 
1. There is always great difficulty in getting a vote for the 
establishment of such institutions. There are in every community 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
84 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
many, whose passions and prejudice can be easily aroused on such 
a subject. They are suspicious of those whom they term the 
aristocracy. They fear that some cunning plan is on foot to 
trample upon the people. They think that in some way they are 
to be deprived of their hard earnings for the benefit of the rich. 
No one can have forgotten the scenes through which we have 
passed in this city in discussing this subject. It would be dif- 
ficult to tempt our citizens to engage in such a contest again. 
And even if they should, success would be very doubtful. What 
a noble vindication would the course now proposed furnish, of 
the disinterestedness and magnanimity of their motives in previous 
efforts! . 
2. To give to the mass of our voters any proper conception 
of the high character of such a school as we need, and to secure 
suitable appropriations for it, may safely be set down as an 
impossibility. We need a school that shall give to young ladies 
the best possible education in every department—an education 
that shall fit them for any station in life. We need a school that 
shall train our young men in classical, mathematical, and scien- 
tific study, so that they be fitted for college or any department 
of business life. We ought to remove the necessity of sending 
our children out of town in order to obtain an education. But 
who will undertake to make the men, that assemble in our Town 
Hall, comprehend or appreciate a plan like this? 
3. The management of the school must be, on this plan, in 
the hands of the School Society. 
What an opportunity would this furnish for the designing to 
ply their arts! 
What an opportunity for every passionate man whose feelings 
may have been disturbed by the administration of wholesome law, 
to work fatal injury to such a school! How many friends of 
rejected applicants for admission would yearly be added to the 
discontented mass! 
Besides, how little do large numbers of the voters in this city, 
or any other, know about the proper management of a High 
School? They have never attended one; they have never seen 
one in practical operation. Most of these men know more about 
a Bank, or an Insurance Company, or a Manufacturing Com- 
pany, than about a High School. But how much would the 
stock of such a company be worth if its concerns were left under 
the control of such an assembly as is collected in one of our 
School meetings?

DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 85 
The great danger would be that an institution, of the high 
order which we contemplate, would be so stinted in its commence- 
ment, or so mismanaged afterward as to prove a failure. 
The other method of establishing the school is by private en- 
dowment. The plan would be to raise a sufficient sum to pur- 
chase land, to erect the building and to establish a fund sufficient 
to keep the building in repair, purchase fuel, &c.; and also to 
raise a fund, the income of which shall be sufficient to secure 
the services of as able and accomplished a corps of teachers as the 
country affords. 
The advantages of this plan would be as follows: 
1. It would secure for the city through all time, a school of 
the highest character. No private school or “boarding school,” 
however expensive, could possibly give to our sons or daughters, 
advantages equal to those offered by an institution thus estab- 
lished and controlled. This proceeds on the supposition that 
it shall be liberally endowed. ‘Tens of thousands have often 
been almost thrown away in the half-endowment of institutions 
which have never, on that account, secured any important 
results. 
2. It would secure also a complete system of Grammar, 
Intermediate and Primary schools of a high order. This I trust 
has already been shown, and it appears to be one of the grandest 
results of the enterprise. 
3. It would place not only the High School, but all our 
schools under the actual control of a board of enlightened men, 
who in their responsible position would make the science of edu- 
cation a study, and thus direct the whole system on the best 
principles. 
4. It would secure for our children, at their home, an edu- 
cation of the highest order. If only a small portion of the money 
which has been spent by our citizens for twenty years past, or 
which must be spent for twenty years to come, for inferior ad- 
vantages in distant schools, were devoted to the endowment of 
this school, an ample sum would at once be secured. The plan 
we are now pursuing is the most uneconomical, as well as the 
most unsatisfactory, possible. 
5. It will secure our children, more effectually than any other 
plan, from contact with children of vulgar manners and vicious 
habits. This will seem to many a singular assertion in respect 
to a public free school. Yet this is the teaching of experience. 
Daniel Webster was in the habit of declaring very emphatically
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
his preference of well regulated public schools in this respect to 
‘ any private schools. The Principal of the High School in Wor- 
cester, after calling my attention to the remarkably gentlemanly 
and lady-like manners of the scholars, during the time of recess, 
remarked: “We find that the thorough education required of 
those who enter this school is the best guarantee of refinement of 
manners and delicacy of feeling.” I listened to a recitation in 
Virgil from two boys, one a son of one of the most distinguished 
men in Massachusetts, and the other the son of an Irish laborer 
in his employment. It was impossible to discover any difference 
in dress or demeanor, only that the Irish boy seemed rather the 
better scholar of the two. Vice and vulgarity are confined to no 
class in society. But education is always refining and purifying 
in its tendency. In a private school the vicious and the vulgar 
often can not be dealt with as they deserve. But an institution 
like this would be so independent and so strong, that it could 
expel at once any injurious character, before he could infect his 
fellows. 
6. This plan if carried out, will doubtless contribute greatly 
to the growth and prosperity of our city. 
I have letters from prominent gentlemen both in Hartford and 
Providence, stating it to be the general opinion of intelligent men, 
that the recent impulse given to business in those places and the 
great rise in real estate “is to be dated from,” says one, is “mainly 
to be ascribed to,” says another, “the establishment of an im- 
proved system of schools.” And this is the uniform testimony 
‘which comes from these cities. It is well known that a large 
number have left our city, and many have been deterred from 
coming here, on account of our defective system of schools. What 
enterprise could be more beneficent and at the same time more 
remunerative than the one now proposed? “There is that scat- 
tereth and yet increaseth, there is that withholdeth more than 
is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.” 
7. We have the testimony of experience in favor of this plan 
of private endowment. 
The Putnam Free School of Newburyport, Mass., was endowed 
by Oliver Putnam, Esq., of Newbury. The building and land 
cost $26,000. The fund for the support of teachers is $50,000. 
The object of the founder was to raise the standard, especially 
of Common School Education. I am informed that the effect has 
been truly wonderful. 
The plan then, which is now proposed, is the establishment,
-P-A-G-E-99
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 87 
by private endowment, of a Classical and English Free Academy 
of the highest order. (Here follows the plan since realized.) 
The plan now presented is designed to secure all the educa- 
tional facilities which are needed to meet the wants of this entire 
community for all time. It is designed to reach and benefit every 
class in society. It is designed to elevate and perfect schools of 
every grade. It is designed to accomplish by associated effort, 
what individuals can secure for themselves and their children, 
only by great pains-taking and expenditure. It proceeds on the 
principle that the true wealth of a nation is the cultivated talent 
of its citizens. It will seek out genius, whenever it is to be found, 
and will educate it for the common weal. If there be any here, 
in any of the walks of life, who are fitted to become the future 
Fultons, and Whitneys, and Websters, and Washingtons of our 
land—it will awaken and develop their dormant power. Franklin 
owed all he was, and his country owed all he did for her, to the 
public schools of Boston. There may be Franklins here, and even 
those greater than he. Is not a plan for comprehensive work more 
truly economical, than one half as costly, but fitted to secure only 
a tithe of its benefits? In asking you to lend an aid to this en- 
terprise, commensurate with the interests involved, the induce- 
ment can be decidedly held out that you will do a permanent 
work, a thorough work, a patriotic work, an economical work, 
a work which will be pecuniarily remunerative in its influence 
upon the prosperity of the city, a work for your children and for 
your children’s children, a work for all the generations that are 
to succeed each other upon this soil, a work for which each of 
these generations shall successively bless you, a work upon which 
God shall smile, and which will be a source of the purest satis- 
faction to your own mind through all your remaining years on 
earth. 
ADDRESS BY THE REVEREND JOHN P. GULLIVER AT THE 
DEDICATION OF THE NORWICH FREE ACADEMY * 
This was the soil into which the seed was cast from which 
grew the grand enterprise whose successful beginning we celebrate 
today. In the midst of the struggle, a gentleman, since a large 
donor to the institution, declared more in jest than in earnest, 
“These men talk about a High School! I would not take one 
for a gift if it is to be managed by such assemblages as we have

lately had at the Town Hall. I am in favor of an endowed school 
and would give $5,000 towards one.” This chance remark sug- 
gested the idea of this Institution, and led to a series of inquiries 
and investigations which were continued for two years. The first 
question was, Are public high schools, supported by taxation, in 
all respects successful? the second, Would endowed free schools 
remedy their defects? the third, On what plan should endowed 
schools be conducted in order to insure success? On these points 
either by correspondence or by personal interview, a large num- 
ber of the leading educators of the country were consulted. It 
was ascertained that in all quarters apprehension was beginning 
to be felt in regard to the working of our higher public schools. 
The lower schools up to the grade of the grammar school were 
well sustained. Men were to be found in all our communities who 
had been themselves educated up to that point, and understood 
practically the importance of such schools, in sufficient numbers 
to control popular sentiment, and secure for them ample appro- 
priations and a steady support. But the studies of the High 
School,—Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, 
Ancient History, Latin, Greek, French and German, were a 
perfect “terra incognita” to the great mass of the people. While 
the High School was a new thing and while a few enlightened 
citizens had the control of it, in numerous instances it was carried 
to a high state of perfection. But after a time the burden of 
taxation would begin to be felt. Men would discuss the high 
salaries paid to the accomplished teachers which such schools 
demand, and would ask, “To what purpose is this waste?” Dema- 
gogues, keen-scented as wolves, would snuff the prey. “What do 
we want of a High School to teach rich men’s children?” they 
would shout. “It is a shame to tax the poor to pay a man 
$1,800 a year for teaching children to make xs and pothooks and 
gabble parlez-vous.” The work would go bravely on; and on 
election day, amid great excitement, a new school committee 
would be chosen in favor of retrenchment and popular rights. 
In a single day the fruit of years of labor would be destroyed. 
Such occurrences it was ascertained, had already become suffi- 
ciently numerous to excite serious alarm among the most intelli- 
gent friends of education. Even in communities where the High 
School had been uniformly prosperous, it appeared that the same 
influences were at work and awakened constant apprehension. 
The proposal to establish an endowed High School was regarded 
by all the gentlemen consulted with great favor, and a uniform
-P-A-G-E-101

opinion was expressed that, properly managed, it would supply 
all the defects in the public High School. 
THE RELATIVE MERITS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS AND 
ENDOWED ACADEMIES ” 
By Georce S. BouTweEtt 
The distinguishing difference between the advocates of endowed 
schools and of free schools is this: those who advocate the system 
of endowed academies go back in their arguments to one founda- 
tion, which is, that in education of the higher grades the great 
mass of the people are not to be trusted. And those who advo- 
cate a system of free education in high schools put the matter 
where we have put the rights of property and liberty, where we 
put the institutions of law and religion—upon the public judg- 
ment. And we will stand there. If the public will not maintain 
institutions of learning, then, I say, let institutions of learning go 
down. If I belong to a state which cannot be moved from its 
extremities to its centre, and from its centre to its extremities, 
for the maintenance of a system of public instruction, then, in 
that respect, I disown that state; and if there be one state in this 
Union whose people cannot be aroused to maintain a system of 
public instruction, then they are false to the great leading idea 
of American principles, and of civil, political, and religious liberty. 
It is easy to enumerate the advantages of a system of public 
education, and the evils—I say evils—of endowed academies, 
whether free or charging payment for tuition. Endowed acade- 
mies are not, in all respects, under all circumstances, and every- 
where, to be condemned. In discussing this subject, it may be 
well for me to state the view that I have of the proper position of 
endowed academies. They have a place in the educational wants 
of this age. This is especially true of academies of the highest 
rank, which furnish an elevated and extended course of instruc- 
tion. To such I make no objection, but I would honor and en- 
courage them. Yet I regard private schools, which do the work 
usually done in public schools, as temporary, their necessity as 
ephemeral, and I think that under a proper public sentiment they 
will soon pass away. They cannot stand—such has been the 
experience in Massachusetts,—they cannot stand by the side of 
“Thoughts on Educational Topics and Institutions. Phillips, Sampson 
and Company, 1859. Pp. 152-163. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  go SECONDARY EDUCATION 
a good system of public education. Yet where the population is 
sparse, where there is not property sufficient to enable the people 
to establish a high school, then an endowed school may properly 
come in to make up the deficiency, to supply the means of edu- 
cation to which the public wealth, at the present moment, is un- 
equal. Endowed institutions very properly, also, give a pro- 
fessional education to the people. At this moment we cannot 
look to the public to give that education which is purely profes- 
sional. But what we do look to the public for is this: to furnish 
the means of education to the children of the whole people, with- 
out any reference to social, pecuniary, political, or religious dis- 
tinctions, so that every person may have a preliminary education 
sufficient for the ordinary business of life. 
It is said that the means of education are better in an endowed 
academy, or in an endowed free school, than they can be in a 
public school. What is meant by means of education? I under- 
stand that, first and chiefly, as extraneous means of education, 
we must look to a correct public sentiment, which shall animate 
and influence the teacher, which shall give direction to the school, 
which shall furnish the necessary public funds. An endowed free 
academy can have none of these things permanently. Take, for 
example, the free school established at Norwich by the liberality 
of thirty or forty gentlemen, who contributed ninety thousand 
dollars. What security is there that fifty years hence, when the 
educational wants of the people shall be changed, when the popu- 
lation of Norwich shall be double or treble what it is now, when 
science shall make greater demands, when these forty contributors 
shall have passed away, this institution will answer the wants of 
that generation? According to what we know of the history of 
this country, it will be entirely inadequate; and, though none of 
us may live to see the prediction fulfilled or falsified, I do not 
hesitate to say that the school will ultimately prove a failure, be- 
cause it is founded on a mistake. 
Then look and see what would have been the state of things 
if there had been public spirit invoked to establish a public high 
school, and if the means for its support had been raised by taxa- 
tion of all the people, so that the system of education would 
have expanded according to the growth of the city, and year by 
year would have accommodated itself to the public wants and 
public zeal in the cause. Though these means seem now to be 
ample, they will by and by be found too limited. The school 
at Norwich is encumbered with regulations; and so every en-
-P-A-G-E-103
    DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 91 
dowed institution is likely to be, because the right of a man to 
appropriate his property to a particular object carries with it, 
in the principles of common law, and in the administration of 
the law, in all free governments, the right to declare, to a certain 
extent, how that property shall be applied. Rules have been 
established—very proper and judicious rules for today. But who 
knows that a hundred years hence they will be proper or ac- 
ceptable at all? They have also established a board of trustees, 
ultimately to be reduced to twenty-five. These trustees have 
power to perpetuate themselves. Who does not see that you have 
severed this institution from the public sentiment of the city of 
Norwich, and that ultimately that city will seek for itself what 
it needs; and that, a hundred years hence, it will not consent to 
live, in the civilization of that time, under the regulations which 
forty men have now established, however wise the regulations may 
at the present moment be? 
One hundred and fifty years ago, Thomas Hollis, of London, 
made a bequest to the university at Cambridge, with a provision 
that on every Thursday a professor should sit in his chair to 
answer questions in polemic theology. All well enough then; but 
the public sentiment of to-day will not carry it out. 
So it may be with the school at Norwich a hundred years 
hence. The man or state that sacrifices the living public judg- 
ment to the opinion of a dead man, or a dead generation, makes 
a great mistake. We should never substitute, beyond the power 
of revisal, the opinion of a past generation for the opinion of a 
living generation. I trust to the living men of to-day as to what 
is necessary to meet our existing wants, rather than to the wisest 
men who lived in Greece or Rome. And, if I would not trust the 
wise men of Greece and Rome, I do not know why the people, 
a hundred years hence, should trust the wise men of our own time. 
The duty of the public is to provide means for the education 
of all. To do that, we need the political, social, and moral power 
of all, to sustain teachers and institutions of learning; and en- 
dowed or free schools, depending upon the contributions of in- 
dividuals, can never, in a free country, be raised to the character 
of a system. If you rob the public schools of the influence of 
our public-spirited men, if they take away a portion of their 
pupils from them, our system is impaired. It must stand as a 
whole, educating the entire people, and looking to all for support, 
or it cannot be permanently maintained.
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
THE HIGH-SCHOOL SYSTEM * 
By Georce S. BouTwEn 
How can the advantages of a high-school education be best 
secured? This question I propose to consider. First, the high 
school must be a public school. A public school I understand to 
be a school established by the public,—supported chiefly or en- 
tirely by the public, controlled by the public, and accessible to 
the public upon terms of equality, without special charge for 
tuition. 
Private schools may be established and controlled by an in- 
dividual, or by an association of individuals, who have no cor- 
porate rights under the government, but receive pupils upon term: 
agreed upon, subject to the ordinary laws of the land. 
Private schools may be founded also by one or more persons, 
and by them endowed with funds, for their partial or entire 
support. In such cases, the founder, through the money given, 
has the right to prescribe the rules by which the school shall be 
controlled, and also to provide for the appointment of its man- 
agers or trustees through all time. In such cases, corporate 
powers are usually granted by the government for the manage- 
ment of the business. But the chief rights of such an institution 
are derived from the founder, and the facilities for their easy 
exercise and quiet enjoyment are derived from the state. 
Such schools are sometimes, upon a superficial view, supposed 
to be public, because they receive pupils upon terms of equality, 
and no rule of exclusion exists which does not apply to all. These 
institutions are public in their use, but not in their foundation 
or control, and are therefore not public schools. The character 
of a school, as of any eleemosynary institution, is derived from the 
will of the founder; and when the beneficial founder is an indi- 
vidual, or a number of individuals less than the whole political 
organization of which the individuals are a part, the institution 
is private, whatever the rules for its enjoyment may be. To say 
that a school is a public school because it receives pupils free of 
charge for tuition, or because it receives them upon conditions 
that are applied alike to all, is to deny that there are any private 
schools, for all come within the definition thus laid down. 
I shall proceed to compare, with what brevity I can command,

DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 93 
the public high school with the free high school or academy upon 
a private foundation. My reasoning is general, and the argu- 
ment does not apply to all the circumstances of society. It is 
not everywhere possible to establish a public high school. In 
some cases the population may not be sufficient, in others there 
may not be adequate wealth, and in others there may not be an 
elevated public sentiment equal to the emergency. In such cir- 
cumstances, those who désire education must obtain it in the 
best manner possible; and academies, whether free or not, and 
private schools, whether endowed or not, should be thankfully 
accepted and encouraged. Nor will high schools meet all the 
wants of society. There must always be a place for classical 
schools, scientific schools, professional schools, which, in their re- 
spective courses of study, either anticipate or follow, in the career 
of the student, his four years of college life. With these condi- 
tions and limitations stated, the point I seek to establish is that a 
public high school can do the work usually done in such insti- 
tutions more faithfully, thoroughly, and economically, than it can 
be done anywhere else. 
ist. The supervision of the public school is more responsible, 
and consequently more perfect. In private schools, academies 
and free high schools which are endowed, there is a board of 
trustees, who perpetuate, as a corporation, their own existence. 
Each member is elected for life, and he is not only not responsible 
to the public, but he is not even responsible, except in extraor- 
dinary cases, to his associates. Responsibility is, in all govern- 
ments, the security taken for fidelity. The election of repre- 
sentatives, in the state or national legislature, for life, would be 
esteemed a great and dangerous innovation. 
It may be said that boards of trustees are usually better quali- 
fied to manage_a_schoo] than the committees elected by the re- 
spective cities and towns. Judged as individuals, this is prob- 
ably true; though upon this point I prefer to admit a claim 
rather than to express an opinion. But positively incompetent 
school committees are the exception in Massachusetts; usually 
the people make the selection from their best men. But in the 
public school you get the immediate, direct supervision of the 
public. Not merely in the election of committees, but in a daily 
interest and vigilance whose results are freely disclosed to the 
superintending committee, as every inhabitant feels that his con- 
tribution, as a tax-payer, gives him the right to judge the char- 
acter of the school, and makes it his duty to report its defects
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to those charged with its management. The real defects of a 
school, especially of a high school, will be first discovered by 
pupils; and they are likely to report these defects to their parents. 
In the case of the endowed private school, the parent feels that he 
buys whatever the trustees have to sell, or takes as a gift what- 
ever they have to offer free; and he does not, logically nor as a 
matter of fact, infer from either of these relations his right to par- 
ticipate in the government of the school. In one case you have 
the observation, the judgment, the supervision, of the whole com- 
munity; in the other case you have the learning and judgment of 
five, seven, ten, or twelve men. 
2dly. The faithfulness of the teacher is very much dependent 
upon the supervision to which he is subject. This is only saying 
that the teacher is human. In the public school there is no motive 
which can influence a reasonable man that would lead him to 
swerve in the least from his fidelity to the interest of the school 
as a whole. No partiality to a particular individual, no desire to 
promulgate a special idea, can ever stand in the place of that 
public support which is best secured by a just performance of 
his duties. In the ‘private school, with a self-perpetuating board 
of trustees, the temptation is strong to make the organization sub- 
servient to some opinion in politics, religion, or social life. This 
may not always be done, but in many cases it has been done, and 
there is no reason to expect different things in the future. 
Opposition to tax support for high schools. As a result of 
the cogency of the arguments for high schools and the hold which 
high schools gained upon their patrons, the battle between these 
types of secondary schools was fairly settled by 1860. By that 
time, it is now conceded, the high schools had gained a slight as- 
cendancy which has become greater with each succeeding decade. 
Difficulties arose, however, from time to time in the obtaining 
of tax funds for secondary school purposes. An early example 
of this difficulty is that of Hartford, Connecticut.

Revised School Law of 1841, or by a School of a higher grade 
than the District Schools for the more advanced pupils of the 
First School Society, as was provided for in the Act of 1798, 
modified in the Act of 1839 and stood in the first section of the 
Act concerning Schools in 1841, was unfortunate in its immediate 
influence on the general movement, and contributed to the repeal 
not only of the sections by which High Schools could be made 
part of the system of Society or District schools, but to the over- 
throw of the Board of Commissioners of Education. The same 
arch demagogue (John M. Niles), who dragged even the suggestion 
in 1838, which did not become part of the law, of paying for 
the services of School Visitors, always onerous, if faithfully per- 
formed, on a class of men the least able to bear it, into the party 
discussions of that year, and who attacked every year any State 
supervision of this great public interest, took a conspicuous part 
in opposing the union of the City Districts in 1841-2; and in cir-. 
culating a petition to the Legislature, drafted by himself, for a 
repeal not only of all the sections relating to a school which 
should teach any thing beyond reading, writing, arithmetic, Eng- 
lish grammar, and geography, but provided for an intelligent 
local administration as well as general legislation by a system 
of society and State reports on the actual condition of the schools. 
To this Petition he obtained the names of many persons, who 
habitually oppose every proposition of local improvement which 
involves taxation, of several political friends, who declared after- 
wards they did not know that they had signed any paper of this 
purport, and of a few excellent men, some of whom lived long 
enough to vote for the establishment of a Society High School, 
and enjoy the advantages of it in the education of their own 
children and grandchildren, and to thank the writer of this 
History for the part he took in the petition for its establishment. 
PETITION 
To the Honorable General Assembly of the State of Connecticut, 
now in Session at New Haven:— 
The memorial of the subscribers respectfully represents that, 
in their opinion, some evils exist in the present law entitled “An 
Act concerning Common Schools,” which require the interference 
of your honorable body.
-P-A-G-E-108
  96 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
1. The power given to divert a part of the School Fund Divi- 
dends to sustain High Schools to be established by School So- 
cieties or Union Districts, we think ought not to exist. The 
School Fund ought to be strictly confined to primary district 
schools, which are for the common benefit of all. 
2. Districts should not, in our opinion, have the power to cast 
the whole expense of common schools upon the grand list, but 
the common school should be supported as formerly, and the 
High School by those for whose benefit it is established; and all 
taxes ought, as we believe, to be laid as formerly, on the polls and 
ratable estates of the inhabitants of School Districts. The present 
mode, compelling a separate list for each District to be prepared 
every year, is attended with much trouble and expense, with little 
or no benefit. 
3. We doubt the utility of paying School Visitors for their 
services. We query whether the services will be as faithfully 
rendered as when gratuitously done, and we cannot but think that 
competent men can be found who will willingly make this little 
sacrifice to the cause of popular education. 
We therefore respectfully point out the last clause of the 8th, 
the oth, the 22nd to 27th inclusive, and the 38th and 39th sec- 
tions of the present law as requiring repeal or revision, and there- 
fore pray your Honors to devote to the foregoing suggestions 
such action as you in your wisdom shall deem necessary, and we 
as in duty bound, etc.

The Kalamazoo high school case. The Case of Charles E. 
Stuart e¢ al. vs. School District No. 1 of the village of Kalamazoo. 
As secondary education developed in the several states the right 
of taxation for the support of higher schools was challenged. 
Such a difficulty had arisen in several other states as exemplified 
by the foregoing passage. In 1874, the supreme court of Michi- 
gan settled the issue in the Kalamazoo case and thereby estab- 
lished a precedent for other states. The essential features of the
-P-A-G-E-109
ee re ae on eel 
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 97 
decision are included in the following passages from the opinion 
handed down by the court: 
The bill in this case is filed to restrain the collection of such 
portion of the school taxes assessed against complainants for the 
year 1872, as have been voted for the support of the high school 
in that village, and for the payment of the salary of the super- 
intendent. While, nominally, this is the end sought to be at- 
tained by the bill, the real purpose of the bill is wider and vastly 
more comprehensive than this brief statement would indicate, 
inasmuch as it seeks a judicial determination of the right of 
school authorities, in what are called union school districts of 
the state, to levy taxes upon the general public for the support 
of what in this state are known as high schools, and to make 
free by such taxation the instruction of children in other 
languages than the English. The bill is, consequently, of no 
small interest to all the people of the state; and to a large number 
of very flourishing schools, it is of the very highest interest, as 
their prosperity and usefulness, in a large degree, depend upon 
the method in which they are supported, so that a blow at this 
method seems a blow at the schools themselves. 
The more general question which the record presents we shall 
endeavor to state in our own language, but so as to make it stand 
out distinctly as a naked question of law, disconnected from all 
considerations of policy or expediency, in which light alone we are 
at liberty to consider it. It is, as we understand it, that there 
is no authority in this state to make the high schools free by 
taxation levied on the people at large. The argument is that 
while there may be no constitutional provision expressly prohibit- 
ing such taxation, the general course of legislation in the state 
and the general understanding of the people have been such as to 
require us to regard the instruction in the classics and in the 
living modern languages in these schools as in the nature not of 
practical and therefore necessary instruction for the benefit of the 
people at large, but rather as accomplishments for the few, to 
be sought after in the main by those best able to pay for them, 
and to be paid for by those who seek them, and not by general 
tax. And not only has this been the general state policy, but this 
higher learning of itself, when supplied by the state, is so far 
a matter of private concern to those who receive it that the courts 
ought to declare it incompetent to supply it wholly at the public  
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
expense. This is in substance, as we understand it, the position 
of the complainants in this suit. 
When this doctrine was broached to us, we must confess to no 
little surprise that the legislation and policy of our state were 
appealed to against the right of the state to furnish a liberal edu- 
cation to the youth of the state in schools brought within the reach 
of all classes. We supposed it had always been understood in 
this state that education, not merely in the rudiments, but in an 
enlarged sense, was regarded as an important practical advantage 
to be supplied at their option to rich and poor alike, and not as 
something pertaining merely to culture and accomplishment to be 
brought as such within the reach of those whose accumulated 
wealth enabled them to pay for it. As this, however, is now so 
seriously disputed, it may be necessary, perhaps, to take a brief 
survey of the legislation and general course, not only of the state, 
but of the antecedent territory, on the subject. 
In reviewing the educational history of Michigan, the court 
cites the provision for the English or colonial type of grammar 
school in the early laws of Michigan: 
It must suffice to say that the [Michigan] law of 1827, which 
provided for grammar schools as a grade of common schools, was 
adopted from laws which from a very early period had been in 
existence in Massachusetts, and which in like manner, under 
heavy penalties, compelled the support of these grammar ’ schools 
in every considerable town. 
The system adopted by the legislature, and which embraced 
a university and branches, and a common primary school in every 
school district of the state, was put into successful operation, and 
so continued, with one exception, until the adoption of the con- 
stitution of 1850. The exception relates to the branches of the 
university, which the funds of the university did not warrant 
keeping up, and which were consequently abandoned. Private 
schools to some extent took their place; but when the convention 
met to frame a constitution in 1850, there were already in ex- 
istence, in a number of the leading towns, schools belonging to 
the general public system, which were furnishing instruction which 
fitted young men for the university. These schools for the most 
part had been organized under special laws, which, while leaving 
the primary school laws in general applicable, gave the districts 
a larger board of officers and larger powers of taxation for build-
-P-A-G-E-111
  DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 99 
ings and the payment of teachers. As the establishment and sup- 
port of such schools were optional with the people, they encoun- 
tered in some localities considerable opposition, which, however, 
is believed to have been always overcome, and the authority of 
the districts to provide instruction in the languages in these union _ 
schools was not, so far as we are aware, seriously contested. The 
superintendent of public instruction devotes a considerable por- 
tion of his annual report for 1848 to these schools, and in that of 
1849 he says: “This class of institutions, which may be made to 
constitute a connecting link between the ordinary common school 
and the state university, is fast gaining upon the confidence of the 
public. Those already established have generally surpassed the 
expectations of their founders. Some of them have already at- 
tained a standing rarely equaled by the academical institutions 
of the older states. Large, commodious, and beautiful edifices 
have been erected in quite a number of villages for the accommo- 
dation of these schools. These school-houses frequently occupy 
the most eligible sites in the village where they are located. I am 
happy in being able to state in this connection that the late 
capitol of our state, having been fitted up at much expense, was, 
in June last, opened as a common school-house; and that in that 
house is maintained a free school which constitutes the pride and 
ornament of the city of the straits.” The common free school 
was a union school equivalent in its instruction to the ordinary 
high school in most matters, and the report furnishes very clear 
evidence that the superintendent believed schools of that grade 
to be entirely competent under the primary school law. 
It now becomes important to see whether the constitutional 
convention and the people, in 1850, did any thing to undo what 
previously had been accomplished towards furnishing high schools 
as a part of the primary school system. The convention certainly 
did nothing to that end. On the contrary, they demonstrated 
in the most unmistakable manner that they cherished no such 
desire or purpose. The article on education as originally reported, 
while providing for free schools to be kept in each district at least 
three months in every year, added that “the English language 
and no other small be taught in such schools.” Attention was 
called to this provision; and it was amended so as to read that 
instruction should be “conducted in the English language.” The 
reason for the change was fully given, that as it was reported it 
might be understood to prohibit the teaching of other languages 
than the English in the primary schools, a result that was not
-P-A-G-E-112
Too SECONDARY EDUCATION 
desired. Judge Whipple stated in the convention that, in the 
section from which he came, French and German were taught, 
and “it is a most valuable improvement of the common school 
system.” The late superintendent Pierce said that in some schools 
Latin was taught, and that he himself had taught Latin in a 
common school. He would not adopt any provision by which any 
knowledge would be excluded. “All that we ought to do is this: 
we should say the legislature shall establish primary schools.” 
This, in his opinion, would give full power, and the details could 
be left to legislation. 
The instrument submitted by the convention to the people 
and adopted by them provided for the establishment of free 
schools in every school district for at least three months in each 
year, and for the university. By the aid of these we have every 
reason to believe the people expected a complete collegiate edu- 
cation might be obtained. . . . The inference seems irresistible 
that the people expected the tendency towards the establishment 
of high schools in the primary-school districts would continue 
until every locality capable of supporting one was supplied. And 
this inference is strengthened by the fact that a considerable 
number of our union schools date their establishment from the 
year 1850 and the two or three years following. 
If these facts do not demonstrate clearly and conclusively a 
general state policy, beginning in 1817 and continuing until after 
the adoption of the present constitution, in the direction of free 
schools in which education, and at their option the elements of 
classical education, might be brought within the reach of all the 
children of the state, then, as it seems to us, nothing can demon- 
strate it. We might follow the subject further and show that the 
subsequent legislation has all concurred with this policy, but it 
would be a waste of time and labor. We content ourselves with 
the statement that neither in our state policy, in our constitution, 
or in our laws, do we find the primary school districts restricted 
in the branches of knowledge which their officers may cause to 
be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given, if their 
voters consent in regular form to bear the expense and raise the 
taxes for the purpose. (Justice Thomas M. Cooley. 30 Michi- 
gan 69.) 
ley The modern high school. During recent years several agen- 
’ cies whose purposes are to establish closer relations between sec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES Ior 
ondary schools and institutions of higher learning have arisen. 
Such an agency is the North Central Association, whose avowed 
aims are: 
First to bring about a better acquaintance, a keener sympathy 
and a heartier co-operation between the colleges and secondary 
schools of this territory; second, to consider common educational 
problems and to devise the best ways and means of solving them; 
and third, to promote the physical, intellectual and moral well 
being of students by urging proper sanitary conditions of school 
buildings, adequate library and laboratory facilities, and higher 
standards of scholarship and remuneration of teachers. 
The 1924 standards of the North Central Association are rep- 
resentative of what is expected of good high schools at the present 
time.?* 
A. BUILDINGS 
Standard 1. The location and construction of the buildings, 
the lighting, heating and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of 
the lavatories, corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, 
apparatus, and methods of cleaning shall be such as to insure 
hygienic conditions for both pupils and teachers. 
B. LIBRARY AND LABORATORIES 
Standard 2. The library and laboratory facilities must be ade- 
quate to meet the needs of instruction in all courses offered. The 
library should be classified and catalogued, and an annual in- 
ventory should be made of laboratory and shop equipment. 
C. RECORDS 
Standard 3. Accurate and complete records of attendance and 
scholarship must be kept in such form as to be conveniently used 
and safely preserved. 
D. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION 
Standard 4. No school shall be accredited which does not 
require fifteen units for graduation. The school year shall con- 
sist of a minimum of thirty-six weeks. The minimum length of 
* Proceedings of the North Central Association, XXIX, Part I, 33-35.
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
a recitation period shall be forty minutes, exclusive of all time 
used in changing of classes or teachers. 
A unit course of study in a secondary school is defined as a 
course covering an academic year that shall include in the ag- 
gregate not less than the equivalent of one hundred twenty 
sixty-minute hours of classroom work—two hours of shop or 
laboratory work being equivalent to one hour of prepared class- 
room work. 
E. INSTRUCTION AND SPIRIT 
Standard 5. The efficiency of instruction, the acquired habits 
of thought and study, the general intellectual and moral tone 
of a school are paramount factors, and therefore only schools 
that rank well in these particulars, as evidenced by rigid, thor- 
ough-going, sympathetic inspection, shall be considered eligible 
for the list. 
F. SALARIES 
Standard 6. No school shall hereafter be accredited whose 
salary schedule is not sufficient to command and retain teachers 
whose qualifications are such as required by this Association. 
The interpretation of this requirement shall be a matter of 
special responsibility for the state committee. 
G. PREPARATION OF TEACHERS 
Standard 7. All schools accredited by the Association shall 
maintain the following standards respecting teachers: 
(a) The minimum attainments of a teacher of any academic 
subject, and of the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall 
be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
Such requirements shall not be construed as retroactive while 
the teacher remains in the same city high school system. 
It is recommended that as far as possible, teachers be assigned 
according to their major subjects in collegiate preparation. 
(b) The minimum professional training of a teacher of any 
academic subject, and the supervisors of teachers of such sub- 
jects, shall be eleven semester hours in education. After Sep- 
tember 1, 1925, this requirement shall be fifteen semester hours 
in education. This additional requirement shall not be con- 
strued as retroactive.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 103 
The Association recommends the following types of courses 
as meeting the spirit of this standard: Educational psychology, 
principles of secondary education, theory of teaching, special 
methods in subject taught, observation and practice of teaching, 
history of education, educational sociology, and school adminis- 
tration and supervision. 
H. THE TEACHING LOAD 
Standard 8. Factors conditioning the efficiency of instruction 
are: (1) The pupil-teacher ratio, as shown by the average daily 
attendance; (2) the number of classes taught by the teachers; 
(3) the number of student hours per teacher; (4) the number 
of students in a class. The Association recommends the follow- 
ing as norms: (1) Pupil-teacher ratio, 25; (2) the number of 
classes taught by the teacher, 5 daily; (3) the number of 
student hours per teacher, 150 per day; (4) the number of 
students in a class, 25. 
An average attendance in excess of 30 pupils per teacher, or 
more than one hundred sixty pupil hours per teacher per day, or 
more than six periods per day for any teacher shall be consid- 
ered as a violation of this standard. 
For interpreting this standard in connection with laboratory 
work in science, and in connection with study room supervision, 
a double period may be counted as the equivalent of one class- 
room exercise for teachers of academic subjects, provided that no 
combination of such work amounting to more than thirty-five 
periods a week be required of any teacher. 
I. THE PUPIL LOAD 
Standard 9. Four unit courses or the equivalent as defined in 
Standard 4 shall be considered the normal amount of work to 
be carried for credit by the average or medium students. Only 
those students who have made passing grades in each subject 
studied during the preceding term, and who rank in the upper 
25% of their classes, may be allowed to take more than four 
units for credit. 
J. THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
Standard 10. The Association recommends that every accred- 
ited school offer units of work in mathematics, social sciences, 
languages (including English), natural science, the fine arts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
104 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and physical training. It further recommends the introduction 
of vocational subjects such as agriculture, manual training, 
household economics, and commercial subjects into schools 
where local conditions render such introduction feasible. The 
Association will hold that a sufficient number of qualified teach- 
ers must be provided to care adequately for all instruction of- 
fered. Not less than the equivalent of the full teaching time of 
three teachers may be given to academic subjects. 
Principles derived from discussions of the development of 
American secondary education. A close relation exists be- 
tween the dominant social tendencies of any period and the 
educational ideals and practices of the period. The operation 
of this principle has fostered moderate conservatism rather than 
either radical or reactionary tendencies. It is important to bear 
in mind that schools are dominated by many tendencies rather 
than by a single tendency. 
Six fundamental principles of secondary education grew out 
of the early educational legislation in Massachusetts: 
1. The universal education of youth is essential to the well- 
being of the state. 
2. The obligation to furnish this education rests primarily 
upon the parent. 
3. The state has a right to enforce this obligation. 
4. The state may fix a standard which shall determine the 
kind of education, and the minimum amount.» 
5. Public money raised by general tax may be used to pro- 
vide such education as the state requires. The tax may be 
general, though the school attendance is not. 
6. Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by 
the state. Opportunity must be provided at public expense for 
youths who wish it to be fitted for the university. 
In response to the changing needs of the times, secondary 
schools require to be reorganized from time to time. 
Failure of an educational institution to meet educational needs 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN POLICIES 105. 
will lead to its impeachment. In times past, however, a tendency 
to provide for past needs has often been as strong as to provide 
for present and future needs. The launching of the academy was 
an expression of revolt against the tendency of even public 
schools to remain narrow and to become stereotyped. 
Educational practice sometimes lags far behind the best educa- 
tional thought of a period. 
The extension of the privilege of secondary education has 
advanced sufficiently to require no more discussion of the de- 
sirability of secondary education for girls or for all social classes. 
The high-school movement represents an attempt to extend the 
privilege of education. 
The high school proceeds upon the principle that the true 
wealth of a nation is the cultivated talent of its citizens. ° 
Legislation is an aid in the development of secondary edu- 
cation. 
Vested interests, traditions, and early start are effective in 
educational development much as they are in commercial and 
industrial development. 
The issues of public financial support, popular academic ap- 
' peal, popular control, and responsiveness to popular demands 
place high schools in ascendancy over private secondary schools. 
The status of secondary education is directly proportional to 
its dependence upon public support and control. 
The popularization of an educational institution can be aided 
*by national appeals to the public. / Public institutions for sec- 
ondary education must be safe-guarded by rational leaders 
against demagogues who would discredit if not overthrow such 
institutions. 
Although privately controlled secondary education may have 
certain definite functions to perform, public secondary educa- 
tion is the more widely diffused and seeks out talent or genius 
wherever it is to be found. 
The general responsibility for public secondary education 
should be placed “where we have put the rights of property and 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
liberty, where we have put the institutions of law and liberty— 
upon the public judgment.” 
Secondary education has passed from private to public con- 
trol, support, and patronage. State policies, constitutions, and 
laws give officers of school districts the right to provide high 
schools “if their voters consent in regular form to bear the 
expense and raise taxes for the purpose.” 
A modern high school is one which is adequate in at least the 
ten following respects: 
Buildings 
Library and laboratories 
Records 
Requirements for graduation 
Instruction and spirit 
Salaries 
Preparation of teachers 
Teaching load 
Pupil load 
Program of studies 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. Evaluate colonial secondary education by showing that it was 
or was not well adapted to colonial needs. 
2. Education is sometimes said to. reflect social conditions. To 
what extent has secondary education in America reflected the social 
conditions of different times or places? 
3. What were the points of strength and of weakness of the differ-* 
ent colonial educational systems described in this chapter? Which 
of these conditions have continued to the présent day? 
4. State the leading points of the Massachusetts Law of 1647.

of secondary education ? 
7. In view of the fact that the academic work of girls is often 
superior to that of boys, how do you account for the long postpone- 
ment of secondary education for girls?

Boston School Committee in 1821.

  CHAPTER III 
Tue Prace oF SEcoNDARY EpucaTION IN AMERICA 
American secondary schools as social laboratories. The 
present generation has witnessed an attempt to carry out a 
definite purpose in respect to secondary education in a somewhat 
indefinite manner. School officers and school patrons have united 
in an attempt to develop a national policy in secondary educa- 
tion and at the same time to adapt high schools to individual 
localities. This attempt has probably been more pronounced in 
‘large, cosmopolitan schools than in very small schools, because 
a laxge school is likely to meet a variety of needs by its diversi- 
fied program, while a small school is likely to offer only a narrow 
range of curricula and thereby fail to satisfy the needs of even 
a small community. Many large schools have formulated cur- 
ricula’ which are especially designed for particular localities. 
This chapter is mainly a report upon laboratory practice. 
Certain social experiments are being conducted in our secondary 
schools. The accounts of first-hand observers of these experi- 
ments should facilitate an evaluation of the practices which are 
the subject of experimentation. Such accounts rather than 
theoretical discussions have been incorporated into this chapter 
for two reasons: first, there is not at present a satisfactory ac- 
count of the social phenomena of the modern high school, and sec- 
ond, it is necessary in discussing social problems to have concrete 
instances as a background. 
In addition to attempts to adjust curricula in individual com- 
munities, much has been said and in some places much has been 
done to adapt the school life to the community. Such adapta- 
tion, while local in its emphasis, is national in its benefits, 
tog
-P-A-G-E-122
  
110° SECONDARY EDUCATION 
because much of the training which is planned for a given com- 
munity has application in other localities, and because secondary 
school graduates are portable and are likely to migrate to distant 
parts of the country. That is, there have been attempts to 
make the school a community center to which both patrons and 
pupils of the school may come for various types of social gather- 
ings; no better training than this could be devised for certain 
aspects of national life. Not all such uses of the school for 
social gatherings are new. Earlier generations were familiar with 
the use of schools for religious and political gatherings and for 
occasional festivals. Leaders have more recently advocated the 
use of schools for less formal and more frequent gatherings— 
gatherings in which members of the community assume leading 
parts as in meetings for general discussions or gatherings to 
which all members of the community may come for entertain- 
ment, parties, and dances. 
The attention which is now devoted to athletics has also sbeen 
conducive to wider use of the school plant. The school gymna- 
sium thus becomes a center of interest throughout the winter 
months, when basketball for boys and girls becomes a leading 
feature of community entertainment for patrons of school. A 
school which possesses a tank adds to its features numerous 
swimming “events.” This utilization of the school building leads 
to a centralization of interest in an educational institution. Such 
concentration of interest is in contrast with the scattering of in- 
terest still represented in communities which allow their citizens 
to provide for all their amusements by private ventures. If such 
increase of interest can be associated with the improved physical 
welfare of high-school students, there is believed to be an im- 
mense gain. 
Similar general results are obtained when school buildings are 
used for school plays and musicales. The provision of an audi- 
torium in a school building has other far-reaching influences than 
simply the economizing of pupils’ money, when a school play is 
produced. Such provision encourages informal productions many

PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 111 
of which are merely interesting practice performances. Oppor- 
tunities to engage freely in these performances form one type of 
training for later leadership either in the community or else- 
where. 
A complaint which has often been made against the high 
school is that it trains for leadership in other communities than 
those in which the pupils attend school. In this way the high 
school, it has been alleged, becomes a trainer for other com- 
munities and at the same time, an aid in the depletion of its 
own community. By planning appropriate curricular and extra- 
curricular activities, high school officers have provided counter- 
acting agencies. This policy has caused a crowding out of many 
time-honored activities and the introduction of others which are 
probably as yet less well organized than ‘they should be. 
Americans now find themselves with modern high schools which 
have been planned by persons who have taken seriously the con- 
tinued advocacy of the “school for the community” policy. They 
find foreign language classes with only a handful of pupils, and 
commercial courses with a crowd. They find in many places 
biology. displaced by agriculture and general science. They find 
certain extra-curricular activities freely participated in by pupils 
many of whose parents looked askance upon participation in 
these activities in any place. With so many changes as have 
recently taken place, the American finds his school traditions 
broken on every hand. He is often led to wonder whether all 
idols needed to be destroyed in ordet to accomplish results which 
sometimes appear to be meager. 
The readings included in this chapter are drawn from standard 
educational sources and constitute representative reports upon 
America’s progress toward the solution of typical national and 
community problems. 
Training for national and community leadership in sec- 
ondary schools. Experiments in which the training of leaders 
is attempted are described in this section.

112 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
TRAINING GIRLS FOR LEADERSHIP? 
By Jzsste E. Grsson 
In any large group the few become leaders by virtue of per- 
sonality or circumstances, and the many remain more or less 
submerged, dissatisfied perhaps, but assuredly inert, and the 
valuable training in citizenship to be gained through proper par- 
ticipation in activities is lost. “When the Girls’ League was or- 
ganized (in Spokane) in the spring of 1918, there were but few 
girls in the school who had the initiative and the poise necessary 
for leadership. The girls generally distrusted themselves and 
were afraid to employ their own talents; most of them were shy 
and awkward in presiding over large or small groups, in leading 
movements of any sort in the school, and in accepting civic re- 
sponsibilities. Their viewpoint, too, was extremely personal, and 
they lacked the ability to work together and to lose sight of self 
in solving problems of the whole group. To correct this, and with 
the idea, too, of better co-ordinating the girls’ activities in the 
school, the Girls’ League was organized with its purpose ex- 
pressed as follows: “(a) to provide a medium through which the 
group of girls, as a unit, may learn to work for the common good, 
either as leaders or intelligent followers; (b) to crystallize the 
best opinion and highest standards of the girls of the school into 
definitely acknowledged standards for all; (c) to provide better 
co-ordination of necessary girls’ activities; (d) through depart- 
ments and committees to give each girl an opportunity for the 
development of initiative, responsibility, and originality.” 
The concrete accomplishments of the league in its four years 
of existence would make an imposing array and would alone per- 
haps justify it, but its real purpose is always the proper guidance 
of that enthusiasm and energy, that independence, and that 
wish to act for herself which make the modern girl a decided 
problem. In order that as many girls as possible may have an 
opportunity to develop their own ability and to gain civic and 
social experience, no girl is permitted to hold more than one 
office, and we usually have between 130 and 140 girls in various 
positions of responsibility. Girl officers preside over all league 
meetings, even when our entire membership of over 1,200 gathers 
to hear a speaker, sometimes a person of national prominence. 
Questions which concern the welfare of the girls, such as the 
care of the lavatories or the use of the locker rooms, are turned 
*The School Review, XXX, 613-620. October, 1922. Abridged.  
-P-A-G-E-125
  
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 113 
over to the proper committees for settlement. If an overdressed 
and overpainted girl enters school, she is taken in charge by a 
tactful “big sister” if she is a Freshman or by a “hostess” if 
she is above the Freshman class, and very often her appearance 
undergoes a great change in a short time. If a girl is a good 
student, she is asked to help some other girl who has been absent 
or has entered late. So it goes, and every girl is given an op- 
portunity to serve as her ability warrants. 
Three years ago the dress problem became acute, as it does 
in every high school, and after much discussion and many warm 
debates, the girls adopted dress regulations drawn up by them- 
selves and administered by a committee of eight, elected each 
semester. If a girl, for some good reason, finds violation of the 
regulations unavoidable, she may secure a permit from the girls’ 
adviser, otherwise the dress regulation committee is apt to ask 
for an explanation. Because these are their own regulations, ad- 
ministered by themselves, they are enthusiastically approved, and 
violations are comparatively few. 
Student conduct in convocations of girls is managed by a 
convocation committee; and in the library by a library board 
composed of members of the Girls’ League and the Boys’ Fed- 
eration. Perhaps these examples are sufficient to show the place 
which the league occupies in the school. We like to call it student 
co-operation rather than student government. 
A brief summary of our actual organization will probably show 
best just how we attempt to realize the fourfold purpose of the 
league. Every girl who enrols in the school automatically be- 
comes a member of the league and is asked to pay dues of ten 
cents a semester. The executive council, composed of the four 
general officers, the four girl department directors, the faculty 
adviser of each department, the girls’ adviser, the chairman of 
the dress regulation committee, and eight room representatives, 
meets every two weeks to transact all business except that which 
the council refers to the entire membership. Of the officers men- 
tioned the department directors are appointed; all others are 
elected. The girls of each first-hour class elect a room repre- 
sentative, who collects dues, makes announcements, and refers to 
the executive council any measure desired by her constituents. 
The fifty or sixty room representatives are under the supervision 
of the vice-president and elect eight of their number, two from 
each floor, to represent them in the council. 
The executive council of the league and the council from the
-P-A-G-E-126
    114 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Boys’ Federation form the Associated Student Councils. A meet- 
ing is held each week for the transaction of business of general 
school interest and for the study of parliamentary law. We find 
this more effective than a general student association. 
The detailed work of the league is done through four depart- 
ments, and each girl signs a blank at the beginning of each 
semester, indicating the department in which she wishes to work. 
She also makes first and second choice of committees and is as- 
signed as nearly as possible in accordance with her desire. The 
departments hold regular meetings once a month during school 
hours while the Boys’ Federation is holding its general convo- 
cation. 
The Social Service Department takes charge of all philan- 
thropic work, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas donations and 
drives of various sorts which have been so frequent since the war. 
This department has practically adopted an orphanage contain- 
ing from eighty to one hundred children and with the help of 
the whole school provides their Christmas gifts. It has also 
helped to furnish a playroom and nursery and sends two or three . 
girls each week to tell stories and carry on simple kindergarten 
work with the smaller ones. Contact of this sort educates in 
civic interest and brings to the attention of the students prevent- 
able causes of unfortunate conditions. The department assists 
the City Social Service Bureau in times of special need. In the 
school itself one committee has charge of the halls and lavatories; 
another provides “hostesses” for the new girls above the Fresh- 
man class and entertains them at an informal tea; another has 
charge of the big sisters for the Freshmen; another telephones, 
visits, writes, or sends flowers to girls who are absent or sick 
more than three days; another has charge of the girls’ locker- 
rooms, providing two clerks each period of the day; another 
co-operates with the faculty in the matter of convocation con- 
duct; still another has as its members only those recommended 
by the faculty for scholarship and tutors girls who need help in 
their studies for a time. That its work is valuable is shown by 
the fact that many teachers ask its help, and about 80 per cent 
of those aided pass in their subjects. 
The Vocational Department assigns one or two girls each 
period to take charge of the office of the girls’ adviser and to do 
filing, typing and errands. There is also a committee which is 
making a simple record of business opportunities for girls in the 
city, their requirements, wages, and chances for advancement.
-P-A-G-E-127
  PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 115 
Besides this, a card catalogue is being made, giving information 
as to the location, expenses, and entrance requirements of vari- 
ous colleges. These are not intended to be exhaustive but to 
make accessible the most necessary information. This depart- 
ment also furnishes guides for visitors; has charge, through two~ 
committees, of relations with’ the grade schools; and assists the 
vocational guide of the school whenever she asks it. _ 
The Entertainment Department has charge of all programs and 
is ready to furnish special numbers whenever asked. Various 
committees manage the all-girls’ party the first of each semester 
and the different class affairs from the Freshie Frolic with the 
big sisters present to the tea for Senior A girls and their mothers. 
One committee is making a real study of organized recreation and 
games and is doing some excellent work. Another furnishes pro- 
grams for various homes and orphanages in the city, which are 
enjoyed by the inmates and give the girls a thoughtful interest 
in civic and social problems. 
The Personal Efficiency Department, with the girls’ physical 
training teacher as adviser, has charge of all sports, interclass 
contests, hikes, and health programs. It has committees in charge 
of the point system, whereby girls may earn school emblems for 
certain physical and health attainments, and in charge of the gym- 
nasium lockers and the girls’ restroom. 
It must be confessed that, while nothing is done unless it has 
value in itself, many things have been added to our program 
in order to provide a wider range of opportunities for the great 
number of girls we have enrolled. Almost every girl covets a 
place on the Girls’ League Honor Roll more than any other 
honor in school. This is compiled at the end of each semester 
and its requirements are: (1) satisfactory service in some phase 
of league work, (2) a grade of not less than C (81-89) in each 
subject, (3) high ideals expressed in conduct, and (4) observance 
of dress regulations. The first, third, and fifth times, the girl’s 
name is simply inscribed on the honor roll; the second, fourth, 
and sixth times, she is presented in convocation with a bronze, 
silver, or gold pin in the form of the league emblem, bearing the 
league motto, “Honor, Service, Loyalty.” 
It will be seen that this is an honor not easily acquired and 
yet within the reach of any earnest girl. Four years ago when 
we formed our first honor roll, twenty names appeared; last 
semester over two hundred girls qualified. This shows in some 
measure the growth of the spirit of the league.

  116 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
TRAINING BOYS FOR LEADERSHIP? 
By Froyp S. Haypen 
It is the purpose of this article to explain the gradual develop- 
ment during the last seven years of a form of student-faculty 
co-operative government in Citrus Union High School. The 
school is located in a semirural community in the foothill Citrus 
belt east of Los Angeles. During the period with which this 
report is concerned, the enrolment of the school has grown from 
approximately one hundred to three hundred students, and junior- 
college, night-school, and various lines of vocational work have 
been added. 
The school originally had class and student-body organizations 
with no special objective in view. The interests of the several 
groups were at such variance that sometimes loyalty to the school 
was superseded by class or group loyalty. The first task of the 
school in creating a co-operative spirit among the different group 
organizations was to develop a kind of superloyalty to the inter- 
ests of the school as a whole. Athletic, debating, oratorical, and 
musical contests made a strong appeal to the students, and it 
was soon realized that in order to win in these contests a united 
school spirit must be maintained. With this end in view, a Wel- 
fare Committee was organized, consisting originally of the four 
class presidents, the student-body president, and the principal. 
The year before the committee began its work, class spirit had 
tun high, manifesting itself in class fights which frequently re- 
sulted in injury to school property. The High School Board 
joined in the co-operative plan of school improvement and 
through the Welfare Committee made announcement that if the 
classes would refrain from class fights and devote their energies 
to interclass and interschool athletic contests, the board would 
put $250 into athletic equipment, an amount equal to that spent 
the previous year in the repair of damaged school property. This 
met with unanimous approval on the part of the students, and 
the trustees purchased the equipment. Interest in school activi- 
ties increased, and the students found themselves beginning to 
work as a unit. 
Another situation which confronted the Welfare Committee 
was the established custom of ducking the entering Freshmen. 
The Sophomores were the active participants, but the upper-class 
*The School Review, XXX, 187-192. March, 1922. Abridged.
-P-A-G-E-129
    PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 117 
students spurred the younger students on. Even the High-School 
Board despaired of curbing the evil, which had several times re- 
sulted in personal injury to students. However, the Welfare 
Committee attacked the problem, and the second year the upper- 
class students placed certain limitations on the ducking which 
eliminated its more serious aspects. The third year the upper- 
class leaders met the Sophomore leaders and told them that they 
had taken a new view of the matter, namely, that the Freshmen 
were new citizens coming into their democracy and that it be- 
hooved them to welcome them with the same methods used by 
the best democracies. A committee of Sophomores waited on the 
principal in his office and asked his opinion. He told them that 
he himself had been a newcomer to their community a couple of 
years before and that, even though there was a convenient pool 
and fountain in front of the public library, he had not been 
ducked. On the contrary, he had been welcomed by a committee 
from the Chamber of Commerce and also a committee from the 
church and made to feel, by the citizens of the community, that 
he was one of them, entitled to all the enjoyments and privileges 
of their democratic community. The committee saw the matter 
in its broader light, and the Sophomore class of that year had the 
honor of freeing the school democracy from a custom that was 
working contrary to its best interests. 
The Welfare Committee had proved its worth. It had become 
the nucleus of a co-operative student-faculty government em- 
phasizing spirit more than form. The machinery of the com- 
mittee has been added to from time to time, but the spirit 
of our school democracy has ever been held as essential for the 
operation of any form of government. Edmund Burke tried to 
bring before the English Parliament the vision of a “true democ- 
racy growing out of the nature and condition of things.” We 
have tried to realize that we are living in a school surrounded 
by \real problems and that we as students and faculty are co- 
operatively responsible for the solution of these problems and 
the establishment of ideals in athletics, society, and scholarship. 
As the size of the Welfare Committee grew, the idea was to 
make it more representative of the entire student body and fac- 
ulty. First, the faculty representation was increased to five. Be- 
sides the principal, the girls’ adviser, the boys’ adviser, and two 
other teachers active in the social, athletic, or dramatic life of the 
school were included. The junior-college class president was 
then added to give representation to that body. The girls of 
 
-P-A-G-E-130

the school were as yet without direct representation, unless some 
class or the student body chose a girl for president. About three 
years ago, however, a girls’ league was organized in the school 
and the officers of the league, president, vice-president, secretary, 
and treasurer, were added to the Welfare Committee. This plan 
had one defect, however. The constitution of the girls’ league 
required the officers to be chosen from the two upper classes, and 
the Freshmen and Sophomore girls were still without direct rep- 
resentation. A plan was then adopted of electing four addi- 
tional members, one from each class, and in case the majority of 
representatives from a class were boys this represenative was to 
be a girl or vice versa. 
The name of the body was then changed from Welfare Com- 
mittee to Welfare Council. A brief constitution was adopted in 
order to keep before the students the objective of the welfare 
body.* It is not the purpose of this body to usurp any of the 
rights or privileges of the various classes, the athletic committee, 
the study clubs, or the student body. It is a council to consider 
problems vitally related to the welfare of the school. It aims to 
unify and harmonize the various departments of school life, to 
consider the moral and social problems of the school, to create and 
maintain scholastic and moral standards in the school, and, above 
all, to create a vital, wholesome school spirit, in the atmosphere 
of which every school activity can work with ease and freedom. 
Training for effective citizenship. In addition to formal 
courses in citizenship, training which appears to incorporate prac- 
tice in effective citizenship is now provided in many schools. 
Archer canvassed such training for citizenship and presents in 
the following article an account of the character of such train- 
ing and the problems to be solved in making the training effec- 
tive. A student’s reaction to this form of training for citizenship 
as conducted in the Radnor High School of Wayne, Pennsylvania, 
is given in the passage from Satchell’s article on student partici- 
pation in government.

SCHOOL GOVERNMENT AS AN EDUCATIVE AGENCY‘ 
By C. P. ARcHER 
The fact that most of our schools have not attempted self- 
government is no absolute indication that it should not be 
attempted. It has been tried in many schools and has been 
abandoned. In some cases the plan failed because the teachers 
were not thoroughly committed to it. In some cases the students 
were not prepared for self-government. In other cases the 
teachers thought that when the student-government plan was 
started they could go on a vacation as far as discipline and gen- 
eral administration were concerned. In spite of the fact that 
student government has failed, the principles of acquiring habits 
and attitudes through practice are so sound as to make the plan 
worthy of consideration at least. 
As shown by the large number of attempts resulting in a great 
variety of successes and failures, the matter of self-government or 
even partial participation in school control is merely in the ex- 
perimental stage. Consequently, it is not to be recommended 
that every administrator should accept it as a settled worthy in- 
stitution or that he should even give it a trial. On the contrary, 
only the trained administrator of exceptional personality and ex- 
perience should consider this plan of training for leadership, until 
it has been shown to be an assured success to a greater degree 
than at present. 
The administrator who has this personality and training can 
contribute much to the cause of education by demonstrating the 
feasibility of such a system. At the outset, he must realize that 
in order to make the plan a success, greater effort must be put 
forth than is required for the successful operation of our more 
common system of school control. The administrator must care- 
fully prepare the way for the participation of the students in 
school affairs by taking the students into his confidence and show- 
ing them the benefits to be derived from such a plan, the dan- 
gers to be avoided often due to rash moves or to lack of interest, 
the whole-hearted desire on the part of the faculty to co-operate, 
stimulate, sympathize, and aid in every way to make the plan a 
success. He must show them the possibilities for development 
in the plan as well as the responsibilities. He must fill them with 
a determination to overcome their selfish interests for the good of 
*The School Review, XXXI, 430-438. June, 1923. Abridged.
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 SECONDARY eee 
the entire student body. They must catch the enthusiasm of 
service to their schoolmates to make “our school” a better one 
for all concerned. 
The students must be brought to realize the importance of 
selecting the best officers and of demanding that each officer who 
accepts the honor should sacrifice for the good of the people whom 
he represents. In short, much time and effort must be spent in 
carefully preparing the soil for planting the seeds of a democratic 
government. Lack of preparation has been one of the chief 
causes of failure. 
The faculty must also be prepared for the inception of the plan, 
be thoroughly committed to it, and have faith in its success. 
Every teacher must realize the merits of the plan and the de- 
tails of operation and be willing to give time, attention, and pa- 
tience to stimulate and direct the pupils to exert their greatest 
efforts and to keep up the enthusiasm. No administrator can 
afford to attempt student government without the whole-hearted 
co-operation of every member, of the faculty—in fact, the en- 
thusiastic co-operation of every member. 
Being thoroughly confident of success, with the faculty fully 
committed to the plan and the students well prepared, the admin- 
istrator may then proceed with the organization. Students and 
faculty must participate in the organization. No plan prepared 
by higher authorities and handed out can be expected to have 
enthusiastic acceptance or to carry with it responsibility for suc- 
cess. With the object of organization in mind, representatives 
may be chosen to meet with the faculty representatives to draw 
up tentative plans for organization. The method of choosing 
these representatives will depend on the local school organization. 
A committee selected in some such manner, which we may call 
the preliminary committee, meets, and after careful consideration 
returns to a future assembly with a proposal for selecting repre- 
sentatives to a constitutional convention or some such committee 
which is to draft a plan for permanent organization. According 
to the plan adopted, representatives are chosen to form a con- 
stitutional committee. This committee should include faculty 
and students, selected fairly for all concerned. 
A permanent organization is then prepared, with a constitu- 
tion, if such seems best, which is usually the case, in order to 
guide the students in future activities. It is doubtful if any one 
constitution will be suitable for more than one school. It should 
be the outgrowth of the ideals and purposes of the local school.
-P-A-G-E-133
  PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 121 
A sample constitution may be secured from the Lincoln School of 
Teachers College, New York City. Others may be secured from 
other sources. A constitution should be drawn up to fit the 
needs, one that the group feels will best serve the purpose of the 
local school. This permanent plan should make provision for 
the name of the organization; the purpose of the organization; 
amendments; adoption of plan; legislation; administration; elec- 
tion, duties, and powers of officers; election, duties, and powers of 
representatives; committees needed for permanent work; regular 
meetings of council, if it be called such, etc. This permanent 
plan is then referred back to the assembly, to classes, or in some 
way so that the entire student body becomes familiar with the 
plan of the permanent organization. If not accepted for adop- 
tion, the committee may be asked to make such changes as are 
necessary and then submit it again. After all, the plan of or- 
ganization is not as important as the attitude, spirit, co-operation, 
enthusiasm, and the faith in the idea. With the right spirit of 
willingness to surrender self to the wishes of the majority and 
render the best service to the school, a poor plan will be revised 
to meet the needs or a new plan adopted, if necessary, in the light 
of past experience. 
After the organization is perfected and the scheme is initiated, 
one of the greatest dangers is to be confronted in making the 
organization serve the purpose for which it is intended; that is, 
it must be made to function. There must always be something 
to do, and the enthusiasm in the service must be kept up. This 
required the constant vigilance of principal, teachers, officers, and 
students to keep ever present a stimulus for activity. An in- 
active organization soon atrophies.

problems which in any way involve the students and which can 
in any way be solved by them. Our constitution says that the 
purpose of our Students’ Association is “to afford an effective 
means through which the student body may express itself.” 
Our government in its organization is closely modeled after 
that of our nation’s. We have at the head our president and 
vice-president—the association’s executives. Under them, simi- 
lar to the President’s cabinet, are our four directors—of law and 
order, of public and private property, of sanitation, and of pub- 
licity. 
The Executive Council is composed of two councillors from 
each form, and the House of Representatives is composed of one 
representative from each record section, 
The four departments together embrace practically every prob- 
lem that can possibly arise. The Department of Public and 
Private Property includes care of school supplies (books, etc.) 
in the hands of’ the students and also of lost and found articles. 
The Department of.Law and Order is in charge of all traffic 
problems, of all problems of general order in the school (in as- 
sembly and in classes), and, more specifically, of fire drills. The 
Department of Sanitation has under its jurisdiction the lunch- 
room, the lavatories, the classrooms, and the school at large in 
whatsoever way they are concerned with physical appearance and 
cleanliness. The Department of Publicity serves the other de- 
partments. It executes all plans of propaganda—whether it be 
publicity in the school paper, posters, or blackboard writing. 
Each director has under her some number of assistants, whose 
duty it is simply to co-operate with her in her work. Our legis- 
lative departments, are, of course, our Council and House of 
Representatives. 
At the top of it all, or, rather, side by side with it all, are 
our faculty sponsors, more formally called the Board of Direc- 
tors. The Board of Directors consists of six members of the 
faculty, appointed by our principal. We have also a faculty 
treasurer who takes complete charge of the association’s finances. 
The very first consideration in the election of a girl is that of 
her ability for the office. If she is capable of holding the office 
and discharging her duties efficiently, the next question is that 
of her standing in scholarship. No girl who has failed in any 
of her subjects during the preceding term can hold office of any 
kind under the Students’ Association. “Elect the girl who can 
best serve you!” That is the order repeated term after term, and
-P-A-G-E-135
  
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 123 
we girls, because we realize the importance of choosing capable 
officers, take the elections seriously and vote carefully. 
We nominate through petitions. At the close of every term we 
take out petitions for vice-president and councillors. Every pe- 
tition for vice-president, to be considered a nomination, must be 
signed by fifty or more students; every petition for council- 
lor, by twenty-five or more. These petitions are then turned 
into the Association, and the list of nominees drawn up accord- 
ingly. 
Very shortly afterwards, in assembly, we are introduced to our 
nominees for vice-president. (Every form votes for its council- 
lors only, but the whole school votes for vice-president. Our 
vice-president is elected from the seventh form, and automatically 
becomes president when she enters the eighth, at which time an- 
other election is held for a new vice-president.) It is customary 
for the nominees to give a very short and informal speech—very 
often extemporaneously. Everyone very simply and directly 
pledges herself, if elected, to carry on the work of her predeces- 
sors and to do all in her power to make ours a better school and 
promises to do her best in the interest of the school—elected or 
defeated. Their spirit is always most admirable. Following these 
campaign speeches, with the advice of our leaders to “choose 
wisely,” we vote, and the records of these individual record-room 
elections are later added together and the results announced in 
the assembly room. 
Our representatives and vice-representatives are elected at the 
beginning of the term in the respective record-rooms in which 
they are to serve. 
Our Students’ Association is undoubtedly a success. When one 
takes into consideration the short time it has been functioning, 
plus a number of difficulties which are present in our school in 
particular, one realizes even more clearly how really great an 
achievement is our present smoothly-running organization. 
The difficulties I am speaking of are the inherent qualities in 
so large a number of our students. Our school is composed of 
students of very different races and nationalities—mostly foreign- 
born. The first problem, of course, would be assimilation, be- 
fore these different types of girls can form into a unit association. 
The need of unity would, of course, not be nearly so great in 
curricular activities, where the object striven for is so very im- 
personal. But when it comes to working together for the purpose 
of organizing a government whereby all of us may be satisfac- 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| 
torily governed, then there is that very great need for thorough 
assimilation. | 
Second, to most of us foreigners, any form of self-government 
is extremely new. Most of our foreign-born parents never knew 
of any such thing as citizenship, or interest in government, or 
participation in it. They were governed—by force or otherwise, 
but of the making of that government they knew nothing. 
I say again—our student government is a great success in pur- 
pose, in practice, and in result in every sense of the word. 
The student assemblies are carried on entirely by the girls, and 
the president of the Students’ Association presides. 
All of the important things which have gone on in the Council 
and House of Representatives are presented to the girls. If there 
is anything which it has been decided the girls should discuss, 
it is presented to them in the form of an open forum. The opin- 
ions of the girls are, of course, helpful to the officers. Sometimes 
there are drives, especially for the Students! Association member- 
ship dues. These drives have always been very successful. 
The objects of these assemblies are to get the girls to talk 
frankly among themselves about the problems which confront 
the Students’ Association, to enlist them on the side of the right 
thing by convincing them that it is right, and to help teach them 
self-dependence. 
The Council consists of two girls from each form, making a 
total of sixteen members. When the Council assembles, which 
occurs every second and fourth Monday of the month, the 
meeting is presided over by the president of the Students’ Asso- 
ciation. 
One of the important movements connected with the Students’ 
Association is the senior guide plan. At the beginning of the 
term a special corps of guides is appointed, and these girls assign 
to each of the Seniors one or two Freshmen. The guides gener- 
sally become very friendly with the new girls and try to make 
them feel “at home” and happy. The Seniors explain the rules 
_and regulations of the school and try to help the Freshmen as 
much as they can. 
The study hall is run by the students. There is one study-hall 
teacher who does the organization work and the planning and 
also the follow-up work which is necessary to bring the desired 
results. The officers of the periods are chosen by the study-hall 
teachers from those who are held in respect by the students, not 
only for their scholastic standing, but for their personality and
-P-A-G-E-137
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 125 
for their character influence. Girls who are persistently dis- 
orderly are reported to the vocational guidance department, this 
disorder affecting their eligibility for recommendations to 
positions. 
The secondary school and recreation. Although certain 
schools may at times make undue recreational demands upon 
pupils, the fact remains that adolescents are greatly in need of 
training in desirable recreative activities. With regard to the 
training given in schools, many parents doubtless agree with the 
Philadelphian who wrote the letter from which the following ex- 
cerpt is taken to the editor of a magazine. 
“J am a plain man, and not much in the way of writing, except 
accounts or letters of business; but I think for all that I can 
make myself understood; and I have something to say which I 
should be very glad you would note. 
“T have been pretty lucky in trade. I have made money, and 
have a parcel of girls growing up. I subscribe to your magazine 
for the benefit of my daughters, having sent them all to Mr. J’s 
school. They can read very well, and they like reading too. But 
what’s the good of reading if they don’t learn something?—You 
see that what angers me is that people think, when they begin 
to get rich, that they must be in the fashion and spend their 
time doing nothing. My daughters want to make great parties, 
just as if they’d always been used to it, and have whips and 
jellies and sugar-houses and kisses and nonsense—not that I care 
for the money, sir! I’m sure the children are welcome to as 
much as they can eat; but I think they’d better be at work than 
turning the house upside down. Then they can’t stay in the 
house a single day, but walk up and down Chestnut Street, and 
“go out to Schuylkill to parade about the Basin, for exercise, 
forsooth! Their mother tells them that in her day. . .” 
The fact that the foregoing passage was written to the Port 
Folio in 1818 indicates only that our schools have faced certain 
problems for more than a century. While many of our elders 
still tell youth that in their day boys and girls were tractable, 
certain schools are providing recreational guidance in ways which 
appear to aid in the attempt to salvage humanity. Some of the

means thus employed for controlling environment in beneficial 
ways are described in the following passages. 
THE SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CENTER * 
By Epwarp J. Warp 
The public school is a socially supported institution but, in its 
use as simply an education place for children, it is individual- 
istic in the tendency of its training. The main lines of conscious 
obligation and responsibility do not run horizontally from child 
to child, but perpendicularly from teacher to each child. This is 
necessarily the case. As long as children are under a teacher, 
and as long as they are children they must be under a teacher, 
the chief feelings of the child are directed upward, whether they 
are love or fear or dislike, toward the teacher, rather than out- 
ward as social feeling. Moreover the whole spirit of child study 
is the consideration of each child as an individual and the main 
tendency of its training is to develop the child’s powers and ca- 
pacities, his self-reliance, and independence. And this is as it 
should be, for the period of independence is a necessary stage of 
the child’s development. Only by this training at this period can 
the later consciousness of interdependence be strong and free. Its 
service in social training the schoolhouse can render only as it is 
made a fraternal meeting place of adults. 
The public school has not failed so far as it is used. It has 
done and is doing its service to the community through the chil- 
dren. The citizens have failed to use this neighborhood building 
as political headquarters and have failed to provide for its use as 
a civic training place for young men and young women in 
addition to its use as a formal education place for children. 
With the one-third use to which it is now put, the influence 
of this institution is to breed that spirit of obedience which makes 
it easy for political and economic bosses to rule, and that spirit 
of reverence for things as they used to be when the teacher was 
young, which puts a drag on the progress of society and stifles 
spontaneity; and that spirit of self-centered individualism which 
chopped us up into a thousand and one little groups mutually 
exclusive, separated, suspicious of each other, with no develop- 
ment of community feeling, social consciousness or democratic 
sense.

The fact is that to-day the public school building is to the 
community what the house would be to the family, if it were 
used only as a nursery for the children. This use alone would 
not make a home. The neighborhood institution one-third used 
is parental and individualistic in its influence, just as the house- 
hold would be if it were used only as a place for children. For 
the family group the house is a home when it is, first of all, a 
place of democracy, of equal union, of free expression and group 
sense between adults; then a place of parental guidance of young 
children, restrained, and individualistic, then for those between 
these two, a place of training during the transition from childhood 
to maturity. 
When the neighborhood building is used first as a common 
democratic association place for adults, and by them made the 
center wherein young people (out of school) may find oppor- 
tunities of training for citizenship in the practice of self-govern- 
ment and for wholesome recreation, this institution in the center 
of the neighborhood becomes in its influence for the neighborhood 
group what the home is for the family group, each, of course, with 
its special functions, the one based upon the primary sex rela- 
tion, the other based upon the common interests of neighbors, 
but each including all of the people, old, middle-aged and young, 
within its circle. 
This then is the first matter of practical politics for a neigh- 
borhood organization of the adult citizenship to take up, the 
opening of the building, and the securing of the directing service 
which will make it a club house for the young men and for the 
young women of the community, and the securing of a combina- 
tion gymnasium and assembly hall which will equip it for their 
recreation, Here is use of the building for at least three eve- 
nings in the week, one for adults, one for young men, and one 
for young women. 
RECREATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE POINT OF 
VIEW OF THE DEAN OF GIRLS* 
By Harrret Hayes 
America has always believed that her safety depends on an 
educated citizenry. She would have her young men strong, well 
trained, resourceful. Her young women must be self-reliant, 
* Addresses and Proceedings of the National Education Association, LX, 
873-878. 1923.
-P-A-G-E-140
      128 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
wholesome, competent in whatever field of activity they enter. 
And she calls upon her schools to produce such young men and 
women. As educators we are expected not only to produce citi- 
zens who shall have mastered certain subjects, but to somehow 
train them so that they justify America’s pride in her youth, and 
contribute character and a trained intelligence toward the solving 
c her problems. 
Now all this is not set down formally in any curriculum. It is 
something that we feel rather than what we have been instructed 
to do. It comes to us with every parent who calls at the school 
to talk over the work and welfare of his child. And it is the 
pressure of this great desire that has brought into being what has 
been called the “social program,” or even the “social curriculum.” 
Teachers are becoming more and more social workers in the 
true sense of the word. A questionnaire filled out by teachers 
in charge of clubs and other outside activities in our high school 
revealed the fact that several of them spent an average of two 
hours daily on these activities—all of this work in addition, of 
course, to a full teaching program. There is no formal recognition 
of such work as this, and it is almost always voluntarily assumed. 
The service rendered is offered because all of us are conscious 
that America has made us responsible for the education of her 
children, and education is only partly a matter of books and sub- 
jects. It includes social contacts, an opportunity to play with 
one’s fellows as well as to study with them. Not the least val- 
uable lesson taught by the war was that people learn to work 
together by playing together. Petty social barriers give way be- 
fore larger, more truly social recreation projects. Subjects can 
be learned in correspondence courses and by tutoring, but the 
social contacts of the public high school give a preparation for 
citizenship that is incomparable. 
We are so often asked in one way or another to justify the 
social activities in our schools. Puzzled parents cannot under- 
stand why there should be such a multiplicity of clubs and plays 
and dances and athletic activities. They have not realized the 
value of these agencies in protecting their children. In a day 
when commercial amusement organizations are offering on every « 
hand the most alluring, easy, passive pleasures—when hotels, 
restaurants, and amusement parks offer springy, jazzy music, and 
insinuate with it an artificial and cheap sophistication, it is time 
that more wholesome pleasures, within the reach of all and 
without ulterior motive, be offered to our boys and girls.
-P-A-G-E-141
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 129 
It is idle to pretend that the American home takes care of 
the social life of its children. It does not. And money has noth- 
ing to do with it. The wealthy patrons of expensive private 
schools are as helpless before the problem of keeping in touch 
with their children as the humblest of our people. The auto- 
mobile, with all its sinister possibilities, has greatly complicated 
the problem. 
A freedom unimagined twenty-five years ago has come—the 
gift of the new century—and our problem as educators is not 
to attempt to dam it up with frail restriction and prohibitions; 
the only thing we can do is to train—train patiently, carefully, 
as skillfully as we may for a right use of freedom, for higher 
standards, for wiser choices. 
This work cannot be done in the classroom nor can it be left 
to chance. It must be accomplished by steady, purposeful social 
engineering. There is immense possibility of waste in this field, 
and feverish activity through a school is as bad as stagnation. 
A halting, hesitating program is almost worse than none at all, 
for situations so often get beyond control and work serious havoc. 
In this connection are those clubs started for some worthy pur- 
pose by an enthusiastic group of kindred spirits and which so 
often develop into exclusive little societies and undemocratic 
ideals. 
Clubs of this kind, once firmly entrenched, are among the 
most difficult of our problems. They are based on such a fun- 
damental human instinct. There are always people who can do 
their best work, and many who can work only, when associated 
with congenial people. They refuse to be drawn into large or 
miscellaneous groups and resent any obvious pressure to such an 
end. If the social program is carefully planned this tendency 
can be made use of in various legitimate ways, such as committee 
service. After all there is no reason why friends should not work 
together. Disagreeable tasks are not half so onerous if the labor 
is shared by people with whom one can work without irritation. 
It is only when snobbish exclusiveness manifests itself and tries 
to exert influence that it must be broken. 
Social cliques may and should be converted into helpful allies. 
When they show vicious anti-social tendencies they must some- 
how be combated and shorn of power. But I am convinced that 
the method used must be that of substitution and friendly rea- 
sonableness, never that of antagonistic sharpness. Whenever an 
administrative officer sets his (or her) jaw and announces, “It
-P-A-G-E-142
130 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
must be, because I say so,” he minimizes seriously his chance to 
work out an effective social program in his school. For social 
progress must rest upon hearty cooperation of the whole group. 
If individuals will not come into the work—or play—with the 
ideal spirit, let us take them on a compromise basis, and watch 
for a chance to improve their attitude. 
To be truly democratic and efficient, a social program must 
include everybody. No member of a properly organized school 
should be able to feel that he has no social responsibility. 
Whether or not an individual pupil has much time to give the 
various social activities, his interest and pride must be aroused, 
and that intangible thing called school spirit must be created. 
A good school newspaper will help in this, a magazine that prints 
the names (correctly spelled) of a// the students, and which pub- 
lishes lists of club memberships as well as of those taking part in 
various events—such small things as this give a very strong feel- 
ing of belonging. Those who have not already connected them- 
selves with some activity should be drawn in. Senior friends for 
Freshmen are valuable to both sides, and as much discriminating 
recognition as possible should be given those who offer service. 
Honor rolls for those who have attained distinction in various 
lines of work, honorable mention, recognition of good committee 
work—all those create better feeling and pride in worthy mem- 
bership in a worthy group. 
Whether a number of small clubs or similar units is desirable, 
or whether there should be a few large organizations with nu- 
merous branches will depend on the individual situation, and on 
the ability and interest to be found in the leaders. 
The mention of leaders brings us to another of the problems 
to be solved. In too many schools the burden of outside activi- 
ties is borne by only a small part of the faculty and students. 
There is no general plan for equalizing the load and preventing 
the overworking of a few enthusiastic souls. We have all seen 
the most able and conscientious members of a school go down 
under too great a strain. Some means must be devised for pre- 
venting such waste. Perhaps the most nearly adequate scheme 
yet worked out is the so-called “point system,” which undertakes 
to limit the outside activities which a student may carry. Under 
this plan, every kind of activity, including membership in clubs, 
etc., is given a certain value, expressed in points, and a record 
is kept of participation in activities by all students. The num- 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 131 
ber of points a pupil may carry is determined by his previous 
record in school. 
There is more or less machinery connected with this plan, and 
much bookkeeping on the part of the point system committee. 
There are in some places accompanying features such as an honor 
roll and gold pins for people who have made notable contributions 
to the social life of the school. But the chief value of the plan 
lies in the protection it affords to the over-zealous and the oppor- 
tunity it creates for the development of new leaders. 
No such plan has been devised to protect faculty members 
from sacrificing themselves on the altar of social service. It is 
only as the extent of their service becomes more apparent that 
they can hope for relief. The social leader in a school, however, 
should catalogue the faculty abilities carefully and see that the 
work is divided as fairly as possible. 
I have been using the term social in its larger, more general 
meaning. But the affairs which are social in the narrower sense 
are also among our most intricate problems. Parties and danc- 
ing are matters that require much attention on the part of the 
social director. 
Parties of the right sort are essential to the education of our 
boys and girls. Banquets to celebrate the close of some athletic 
season, luncheons in honor of some guest, teas for parents, out- 
door suppers or picnics—every one of these functions is full of 
possibilities for social education. There should be as many occa- 
sions of this nature as a sane and uncrowded social calendar 
will include. Most of them should be simple and informal, in- 
volving as diverse groups as possible; but several times during 
the year there should be functions as formal as can be managed, 
with toastmaster, speeches, and all the accompaniments of a real 
party. Comparatively little money need be spent on these. A 
surprisingly dignified banquet can be served with the aid and 
advice of the domestic science department at a cost of from fifty 
to seventy-five cents a person, and the burden should fall, not 
on the individual diners, but to a large extent on the school social 
fund. The practice of going to the local Waldorf Astoria or the 
Palace restaurant is abominable in its pretentiousness. It may 
take a vast amount of tact to persuade students to have an im- 
portant banquet at school, but it is worth any effort because of 
the opportunity it offers for training. People, especially high- 
school people, love to “get up things.’ There is never any 
difficulty in finding persons who are glad to do the work, except
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
possibly the clearing away after the party is over. Even here 
we find as a rule the leaders still leading. There is always some 
generous soul who will say, ‘Oh, put me on the clean-up com- 
mittee”—and if you give him a "few favorite friends the job is 
done. 
After every function if possible there should be a “post 
mortem” on the part of the committees in charge. This is essen- 
tial if the educational value of the affair is to be realized. The 
successful features and factors involved, the failures and the 
reasons for them, should be discussed. Things to be remem- 
bered for future use, pitfalls to be avoided, should all be noted 
and filed for reference. Individuals should be commended for 
especially efficient service. It takes some time, but it is time 
well spent. 
In connection with filing information for reference, I might 
speak of a blank which we have worked up for use in the Univer- 
sity High School, (Oakland California) entitled “Registration of 
Events.” When a special event is planned, those in charge come 
to the dean’s office for a blank and proceed to fill it out. All 
the details which must be thought of in planning a successful 
affair are provided for. The nature of the event, the date, time, 
and place, provisions for music, faculty sponsors, members of 
committees, plan of procedure, estimated expense and method of 
financing—all these are to be accounted for. When this much 
of the blank is filled out to the satisfaction of the dean, the 
affair is formally sanctioned. And after the event has taken 
place, the remaining items on the blank are filled in. These in- 
clude the record of gross and net proceeds, disposal of surplus 
funds, names of any who have rendered noteworthy service, and 
suggestions which may be of future use. When all this informa- 
tion has been set down, the blank is filed in the proper place, and 
used for guidance for the next similar affair. 
The formal dances, such as the senior class dances, offer an 
exceptional opportunity for training—one which I think is not 
often used to the full. The best handling of this situation that 
I know of was done by a very wise dean who instituted the prac- 
tice of going about before each Senior dance (the formal event 
of the term) and talking for a few minutes to the boys and girls 
separately. Questions of the customary dress, the position of the 
chaperons and how they should be treated, standards in general 
and why certain things are done and others not, how the success 
of the evening depends on the tone, which is given by the girls
-P-A-G-E-145
a 1g am al ls iar ci Na a Eg hi NE a a oN 
| PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 133 
(this to girls)—and how the success of the evening depends on 
the thoughful consideration of the boys, who must of course take 
the initiative (this for boys)—and how the dances have been 
growing better every term because standards have been raised 
each time—these topics are discussed. Such talks are invaluable, 
because they have been given with friendly impersonality, with 
the idea of making “this dance the best one ever given.” And 
the dances in that school have been conducted with a dignity and 
genuine courtesy that is remarkable. 
Dancing, I suppose, is one of the most complex matters to be 
dealt with in the social curriculum. While communities vary in 
their attitude toward dancing as a legitimate social pastime, gen- 
erally speaking, young people are going to dance. Whether we 
like it or not, it is so. And what are we going to do? Are we 
going to ban the activity altogether and dodge the responsibility? 
It is about as easy to do as for our government to keep out of 
European difficulties. I have heard of one school in a pious 
community which tried this plan with the result that its young 
people went elsewhere for their amusement—elsewhere being in 
this case a beach resort of unenviable reputation some miles 
away. Avoiding is not educating. Neither is permitting dancing 
to go on in a haphazard way educating. Students must be made 
to do some thinking on the subject and to make some thoughtful 
choices. We cannot hope to change the prevailing style in danc- 
ing, but we can help our boys and girls to see and do the right 
thing about it, and hope for success by appealing to their sense 
of right and their loyalty to the school. Regulations and rules 
and the weight of authority are futile. They may check and 
hold the situation in a superficial way, but they are worse than 
useless in any constructive program. The question must be 
placed squarely before the students themselves and responsible 
action required on their part. And if the whole subject is 
frankly and reasonably presented I have not a doubt in the world 
that the actions and attitude of the school will be sound and 
right. A student committee made up of popular and thoughtful 
members will be able to control the kind of dancing far more 
effectively than any amount of faculty watchfulness, and in addi- 
tion the student body will have the satisfaction of realizing that 
it has raised the standards of dancing a little above those required 
in public dance halls, and will feel proud accordingly. 
The whole structure rests on the basis of cooperation, as does 
our whole system of education. The day of birch rod is
-P-A-G-E-146
134 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| over; old fashioned parental authority seems also to be rapidly 
| declining. It is for the schools by means of a strong, conscious 
effort, to catch up the loosened reins of control and bind them 
firmly again in the lives of our pupils by insisting that they de- 
cide, and choose, and learn the great value of self-control. And 
I believe that a vigorous administration of a sane social program, 
one that will provide plenty of wholesome interest and amuse- 
ment for American boys and girls, is one of the most potent 
agencies for this purpose. 
  RECREATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE PUPIL’S POINT 
OF VIEW * 
By VormEr Sorenson 
Two important questions are these: For what should the high 
school building be used? In what activities should the high 
school participate? The rural high school should be a com- 
munity building, a center for the activities of both old and 
young members of the community. It is exactly this that our 
high school tried to be. How successful it has been, I am unable 
to say. 
In the first place, the school gymnasium was opened to school 
parties, class parties, and, at times, general community parties. 
Proper hours and faculty chaperons made these parties very 
orderly. All went well for a time and pupils soon regarded the 
building as a center for their amusement. A controversy soon 
arose, however, over the question, “Shall pupils be given the 
privilege of dancing in the school building?” Of course the 
school board had to decide this question, and the board looked 
with contempt on the matter of dancing. As no other satisfactory 
amusement was provided, the pupils gradually drifted to com- 
mercialized places of amusement—the public dances, pool halls 
(until forbidden by law), and other places. Thus the pupils 
passed from a communal type of recreation to a commercial type. 
The influences of the Great War, the changed attitudes which 
developed during and after the War, and the extended use of the 
automobile had much to do with the matter. The young minds 
were filled with ideas of good times away from home and other 
controlling agencies. At last our rural high school board awak- 
ened to the importance of the issue and decided to permit pupils 
*In an unpublished paper.  
-P-A-G-E-147
  
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 135 
to have their little dancing parties at the school. But modernism 
had robbed the pupils of the satisfactory feeling of staying in 
one place, and, until the community institutions can regain a 
foothold, they will not be centers of recreation. 
Another unfortunate decision of the board led to the purchase 
and installation of a motion picture machine and the opening of 
the movies to the public. The mistake lay in the harping on “edu- 
cational reels” that put the public to sleep, so that the town 
theatre got the people the next time. Of course things like this 
can be easily remedied, but it takes a long time to wake up. 
There are other activities not classed as sports that do tend to 
give a feeling of solidarity to high school pupils and to give the 
public faith and attentiveness to their school. These are debat- 
ing, oratory, glee club work, and orchestra work. All these ac- 
tivities tend to take much of the time of the students who par- 
ticipate, and thus keep down the undesirable tendencies. They 
give pupils a chance to get together and in doing so they make 
themselves and make the school. An institution is not a high 
school without these special activities and no one is a real teacher 
unless he promotes them. 
At our high school we had typewriting contests, speed contests, 
arithmetic contests, contests in ‘theme-writing—both local and 
interschool. Within the last few years the school fair was started 
which brought all the people together to see the year’s work. The 
manual training and home economics exhibits were outstanding. 
Many of the exhibits came from pupil-work, for which only one- 
fourth or one-eighth of the regular credit was given. Of these 
we may mention projects as—poultry, calf-raising, canning, rais- 
ing potatoes or corn, and general gardening. 
Of course, it must be admitted that sports are the greatest 
socializers that a high school has—but they usually promote them- 
selves. In most rural schools, basket-ball has been greatly over- 
done, and the real motive for school work has been set aside. 
Properly organized sports, however, together with such recrea- 
tions and projects as have been referred to in this paper aid 
immensely in making the school stand out as the main achieve- 
ment in a rural community.

High School of Montana. This institution has become a social 
center in a variety of ways. The following is a letter which 
has been sent out to the members of the community by the 
principal of the school. 
A HIGH SCHOOL AS A COMMUNITY CENTER?® 
The Fergus County High School is your institution. In it 
are trained the boys and girls of the county, and a large number 
of adults, both men and women, attend also. For those of you 
who cannot attend we want to call your attention to some of the 
assistance this institution offers to individuals, to schools, and 
to whole communities. 
The high school is a clearing-house for the needs of the com- 
munity. It will analyze ore, water, soil, and food. It will test 
milk for butter fat, seed for germination, soil for moisture, and 
cloth for adulteration; furnish instruction in cheese- and butter- 
making; identify weeds and poisonous plants; give information 
on crops and marketing, and help organize cooperative enter- 
prises; assist in vaccination of stock, planning of barns, and 
furnish information on all agricultural subjects. 
It will send out circulating libraries, bulletins of all kinds, lists 
of books, magazines, and advice on suitable reading material for 
the home on various subjects; help to plan programs, games of 
all kinds, pageants, and plays; furnish constitutions for com- 
munity-center organizations, and send out material for all these 
activities. 
It will help plan and furnish cost estimates for farm buildings 
and typical houses, furnish information on income tax, land, and 
bin and hay-stack measurements, compute interest, and help you 
with any mathematical calculation. 
It will figure sizes of pulleys, line shafts, pump jacks, emery 
wheels, and feed grinds, and assist you with your automobile and 
tractor troubles. 
It will plan labor and home-saving devices for you, furnish 
aid in farm and household accounting, public statements, make 
out balance sheets, and do multigraphing and typewriting work. 
It will help in planning the interior arrangement and decorating 
of the home, furnish recipes, menus, health suggestions, dress pat- 
terns, and will do hemstitching work. 
Your institution wants to be of service to the community.

Won’t you give us a chance? If we can be of assistance in any 
way write for further information. 
One can read between the lines of this invitation to apply 
for assistance many educational applications of the courses in the 
school in literature and mathematics, in agriculture, in science, 
and in home economics. One cannot help realizing also that the 
conception of education which is expressed in this letter is much 
broader than that which is in the minds of those who think of 
the high school as merely an academic institution intended to 
prepare a small group of students for advanced courses or for 
professions in the community. 
The survey as a basis for planning education. Among the 
rational bases for determining educational needs, none are more 
comprehensive and adequate than the local survey. Sometimes 
local surveys attempt to canvass the entire educational needs of 
localities—such a survey has been conducted in Elyria, Ohio.’° 
Other surveys canvass only certain aspects of educational needs— 
such a survey is that of Wilmington. The following list of topics

Summary of suggestions 
The opportunity fer secondary education depends upon the 
location of the school. The size of the service area of secondary 
schools depends upon the transportation facilities of the locality 
in which the school is situated. The extent of the service ren- 
dered by schools in rural and in urban localities is indicated by 
the excerpts from Hatch and Judd. One of the ways of ex- 
tending this service area is described by Dick. 
INACCESSIBILITY OF SCHOOLS LIMITS ATTENDANCE” 
By Eucene Merritr anp K. L. Hatce 
The value of any educational institution to the masses is 
directly proportional to its accessibility. . . . A study of the 
distribution of student attendance reveals the fact that distance 
from school, good roads, and other means of transportation are 
important factors in determining the attendance in educational 
institutions. A comparison of the maps showing distribution of

students attending (different types of high schools in representa- 
tive Wisconsin counties) appears to show that type of institution 
has little effect upon student attendance. . . . Similar studies 
made by others are corroborative of the conclusion that type of 
institutions is of far less importance in determining its radius of 
influence than is its accessibility. 
EFFECT OF LOCATION UPON CURRICULUM PURSUED” 
By Cuartes H. Jupp 
High schools in Cleveland, as in other cities, are largely local 
in their radius of influence. Every school gets a considerable 
portion of its students from homes situated near the school. If 
the city consistently follows a policy of establishing specialized 
high schools, it is entirely certain that a large number of its 
young people will receive specialized educations, the nature of 
which will be determined, not by considerations of individual 
tastes and abilities, but rather by considerations of the locations 
of the pupils’ homes. This is not sound educational policy. 
Cleveland ought not to establish a system of high school educa- 
tion which denies to a large part of the children valuable educa- 
tional opportunities, because it groups opportunities of one sort 
in one school, those of another sort in another school, and those 
of a third sort in a third school, and so on. 
SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION * 
By Gerorce S. Dick 
A completely consolidated school in terms of service is a cen- 
tralized school that brings together not only the children of school 
age, but also the people of this area. The building is not only 
a schoolhouse, it is also a community house in all that the two 
words school and community imply. 
As a school it aims to give a twelve years’ Course of Study— 
eight years of elementary work and four years of high school 
especially suited to the child and youth in a rural environment. 
This is enjoyed by them without breaking home ties while their 
real interest and help continues in the farm home.

140 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
As a community center it aims to give to the people the edu- 
cational, social, recreational, and economic needs of the community 
that it attempts to serve. The family is a unit responsible in the 
main for the education and training of its children. The school 
is an institution established to supplement the home and the 
church in this most important of human duties. It is clear that 
the school must in every way possible strengthen the home for 
this sacred duty—the planning for and carrying on its part in 
the child’s development toward noble, useful, effective manhood, 
or beautiful accomplished womanhood. This result is more nearly 
secured by taking the home with all its interests into the school 
and naturally the school with all its interests goes into the home. 
This is illustrated in the proper way of teaching especially the 
vocational subjects and is seen in all school activities. The con- 
solidated school has succeeded in rendering this service to a 
marked degree. 
There must be taxable property sufficient in the proposed dis- 
trict to support this kind of a school without over-burdening the 
people with taxation. 
There must be people and children enough to classify into this 
kind of a school, ever remembering the changing rural population. 
The larger district must be wisely selected, looking to the best 
interests, present and future, of the territory and people who are 
to be left out as well as the territory and people to be taken into 
the new organization. But little if any attention should be paid 
to county or township lines. Wise was the action of the state 
legislature of Nebraska when it ordered the entire state to be 
districted for consolidated schools. Such a law requires a broad 
forward planning that renders service to the whole state and 
prevents failure many times due to more narrow vision and selfish 
local interests. 
The Center, the place for building or buildings, should be as 
near the geographical center of the district as possible. Some- 
times the exact geographical center is not suitable. The lay of 
the land, hilly or level, lakes and streams, the present roads and 
the possibility for more and better highways, their direction, 
whether they are parallel or converging, must all be considered. 
The natural tendency of the people to be attracted by market, 
trade, business, post office, store, and boarding places for teachers 
has its advantages for school and community centers; many of 
the strongest and best schools have their centers in the open 
country. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 141 
The first consolidated school was organized over fifty years 
ago in the State of Massachusetts so it is not a new kind of 
school organization, but a kind that has been tested, tried and 
found efficient. It is most popular where it is best known. The 
Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C., two years ago stated 
that about 2,000,000 children were being transported from 65,000 
one room rural schools that had been closed, to 13,000 consolidated 
schools found in all parts of our country from Connecticut to 
California, from Northern Minnesota and Northern Michigan to 
Southern Mississippi and Alabama. 
It is difficult to decide which is the leading state in this kind 
of school service, but nearly if not all state school officials are as 
strong in its endorsement as is State Superintendent P. E. Mc- 
Clenahan, Des Moines, Iowa, in his statement July 17, 1922: 
“No consolidated school in Iowa that has been completely or- 
ganized has ever dissolved or gone back to the old system. The 
number of consolidated schools has almost doubled here in the 
last three years. Last year we hauled something over thirty-five 
thousand children and had a large number of busses and motor 
transportation. We have very few complaints, and some of the 
children are hauled as far as eight miles. There is no question 
but that the consolidated school has been a very wonderful 
success in Iowa. This is one of the greatest educational move- 
ments of the last quarter of a century, and possibly of this whole 
century.” They have had consolidated schools in Iowa for 25 
years. 
Some parts of Wisconsin are so sparsely settled and some of 
it on account of topography and low taxing value cannot now 
and perhaps never can have the advantages of consolidated 
schools. Three-fourths of the state with her abundant wealth, 
compact population, excellent roads, and favorable topography 
can very successfully give to her people and their children a 
much better public school service through more complete or- 
ganization. 
The interest is moving slowly but there are places of marked 
success. The largest project is at Institute, seven miles north 
of Sturgeon Bay in Door County, where after six one-room dis- 
tricts were consolidated a seventh district asked to be taken in. 
The request was granted making an organization including 53 
square miles, or sections, with about 400 children. The fine 
building now in process of construction at a cost of over $100,000  
-P-A-G-E-154

is to house kindergarten, grades, and a four year high school. It 
has every modern equipment found in our best village or city 
school buildings, and is expected to be ready for occupancy Sep- 
tember, 1923. The transportation will be carefully planned and 
that community far famed for its wonderful Door County cherries 
will be far famed for one of the most complete consolidated 
schools in the country although she has strong rivals in North 
Michigan on the east and North Minnesota on the west. 
Elk Mound, Dunn County, a complete consolidated school dis- 
trict of about 20 square miles or sections gives grades and four 
years of high school, runs seven busses and has been in operation 
two years. The past winter during cold weather, storms, and 
deep snow when many of the schools of that county were closed 
due to the inability of children and teachers to reach their school- 
houses, the Elk Mound seven busses arrived on time and that 
school had an average daily attendance of above 95% through 
the winter months. 
Organizing the community to support the school. In order 
to maintain the proper reciprocal relation between schools and 
communities, the members of the community must be informed 
about the school just as the administrators of the school. must 
be cognizant of the needs of the community. In the following 
article, Reavis outlines a plan which may be found useful in 
such a campaign as Judd suggests in Chapter I. 
ORGANIZED PUBLICITY IN SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS* 
By W. C. Reavis 
The problem of securing adequate financial support for public 
schools has become more and more acute with the increasing 
cost of public education and the enormous expense of financing 
the building programs required in our rapidly growing municipali- 
ties. If funds are to be secured to maintain the schools even 
at the present level of educational efficiency and to meet the 
conditions of normal growth, to say nothing about the expansions 
that should be made in the interests of greater efficiency, better 
methods of informing the people about their schools must be 
devised, and a more systematic attempt must be made to create

a more wholesome public opinion with regard to public education 
in the local communities where a large part of the school budget 
is raised. 
Outside of the publication of the annual, semi-annual, or oc- 
casional school report, which is seldom read by anyone in the 
community from which it comes, and news “squibs” which from 
time to time find their way to the columns of the local press, 
little effort has been put forth by school administrators until very 
recently consciously to direct the formation of educational opinion 
in regard to the support of schools. 
To leave this important matter largely to chance as has been 
the case in the past in most localities is a hazard which should 
no longer be risked. School administrators must seriously accept 
the responsibility for disseminating the proper educational in- 
formation and for guiding the development of public opinion 
along educational lines in the communities which they serve. 
This will require the mastery of the technique of using to the best 
advantage the various agencies through which public opinion is 
aroused. It will require organized and systematic publicity 
through bulletins, press, platform, and pictures. If these agencies 
are properly used, public opinion can be molded; but if neglected, 
a half-informed or mis-informed public opinion will likely result. 
Moreover, there must be a directing mind back of the publicity 
all the time if the desired ends are to be attained. 
The following account of an organized publicity campaign to 
create wholesome public opinion for better support of schools is 
given to illustrate a method by which a community can be quickly 
led to know and to serve its schools. 
The program referred to was carried out during the years 
1918-21 in the city of Alton, Illinois, a community of twenty-five 
thousand people. It became evident early in 1919 that the Board 
of Education would have to ask for more funds than they were 
legally empowered to raise by levy if the schools were to go for- 
ward in accordance with adopted plans. While it was quite 
certain from the outset that the necessary funds could be secured 
by a bare majority in a referendum vote, it was considered good 
policy to secure approval by the largest possible majority. In 
other words, it was desired that the educational program of the 
board should be thought to be so satisfactory by the community 
that the voters would voluntarily go to the polls and ratify the 
request for the desired financial support. 
A campaign was accordingly planned with the idea of fully 
 
-P-A-G-E-156

144 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
informing the people about their schools. Parent associations 
in all the school districts of the city were asked to hold public 
meetings at which the superintendent and members of the Board 
of Education discussed the educational program of the board 
and explained the need for greater financial support. Questions 
were invited, and an earnest attempt was made to arouse favor- 
able public opinion through a clear understanding and realization 
of the needs of the schools. A full account of each meeting ap- 
peared as a front-page news article in the daily press on the 
ensuing day. The matter was presented to civic organizations, 
lodges, and clubs, and endorsement was welcomed. The school 
children likewise were informed concerning school needs and were 
asked to discuss the question at home. As a result, the board’s 
request for increased school tax was ratified at a special election 
by a vote that was practically unanimous. 
As the building program of the board had been deferred dur- 
ing the war period and came up for urgent solution during the fol- 
lowing year, it was decided to organize a systematic publicity 
campaign in support of schools to continue throughout the year 
in order to inform the public fully about school-building needs 
and prepare the way for the approval of the necessary bond 
issues. 
There was plenty of evidence that the school report published 
annually was not widely read. It was thought that if this report 
could be brought before a greater number of citizens, it would 
contribute materially to the purposes of the campaign. It was, 
therefore, decided that, instead of a printed report, one prepared 
in graphic form that could be presented from the platform as an 
illustrated address, conveying the important facts that should be 
known by the community, would accomplish better results. 
The annual report of 1919-20 made use of sixty-five lantern 
slides and was organized under ten general headings:

The report was used by the superintendent as an illustrated 
address before local parent associations and church and civic 
organizations. News articles on the different sections were pre- 
pared during the summer of 1919 for the press, and important 
points were repeated in supplementary articles from time to timé 
during the year when reports of the address were given. A 
summary of the report was prepared in bulletin form and was 
given wide distribution after an interest in the content of the 
report had been aroused. 
It is estimated that from twelve to fifteen hundred people saw 
the slides and heard them discussed by the superintendent and 
that every reader of the daily press had many opportunities to 
grasp the important points of the report through the news articles 
that appeared systematically throughout the year. 
The success of the campaign can be judged by the fact that 
the community, by practically unanimous vote in each election, 
approved both a $200,000 bond issue for elementary schools and 
the organization of a community high-school district which car- 
ried with it increased taxation and plans for the erection of a 
modern high-school building to cost the district approximately 
one-half million dollars. 
In undertaking an organized campaign of the type described, 
”
-P-A-G-E-159
PLACE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA 147 
it should be clearly recognized and understood that the systematic 
dissemination of information regarding schools not only benefits 
the public for whom it is intended but also reacts on the super- 
intendent and the board of education by pointing out to them 
the defects in their own plans. The better and more systematic 
the publicity, the more critically does it test the correctness of the 
ideas advanced. Publicity thus becomes a test of the soundness 
of educational policy as well as the most useful means of 
realizing it. 
Principles of education derived from a study of national and 
community problems of secondary education. Until the Ameri- 
can secondary school has become more fully developed, many 
of its practices should be regarded as experiments. Many of 
these experiments are very instructive to teachers as well as to 
pupils. 
National educational needs are best met when education is 
planned to meet local needs. The survey is a valuable basis 
for such planning. 
The school should offer training in personal initiative and self- 
control. 
The school possesses facilities for providing extra-curricular 
training in social leadership. The organization of these facilities 
should be undertaken.: , 
Training for leadership in the community which supports a 
school as well as for leadership elsewhere is an important function 
of the school. 
A reciprocal relation should exist between school -and com- 
munity—the community supports the school; the school should 
aid the community. 
School teachers are social workers. 
Before denying certain privileges to pupils, the school should 
provide adequate desirable opportunities for pupils to satisfy 
their legitimate recreational needs. 
The secondary school—urban or rural—should bring together _ 
not only the school children but also the school patrons. 
The type of high school maintained is less important in de- 
termining its influence than its accessibility. 
The service area of the public secondary school is small. 
In attempting to “socialize” pupils for national and com-  
-P-A-G-E-160
  i 
148 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
munity life, the fact should not be overlooked that basic arts 
and sciences as well as recreation have values in. which pupils 
can and should be interested. Likewise, school patrons can be 
“socialized” by the arts and sciences as well as by special recrea- 
tional features. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. Obtain from a high-school pupil a list of the social-laboratory 
practices which his school has conducted during a single week, or, 
still better, during a month. Evaluate those practices by means of 
the principles of this chapter. 
2. Try to find out whether or not high-school pupils who partici- 
pate in such organizations as “girls’ leagues” and “high-school 
boards” maintain high scholastic standards. 
3. It is frequently asserted that various forms of pupil-government 
and pupil-leadership are impractical for the average school. Study 
the readings of this chapter and make a list of all the plans for 
activities which you think are practical for most schools and an- 
other list of plans or acts which you think are impractical. Defend 
your classification of plans and activities. 
4. What is meant by the term “training of leaders”? 
5. Name four population groups or types of occupations for 
which the training of leaders has been especially neglected. 
6. It is frequently alleged that the secondary school prepares 
pupils only to live in other communities than their own. To what 
extent is this allegation true? 
7. What dangers confront the teacher who aims at the training

THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
CHAPTER IV 
TracHiInG As A PROFESSION 
Members of the profession. The direct leadership of nearly 
three millions of America’s most promising youth is a part of the 
service for which America’s secondary school teachers enlist. The 
teachers who thus become the nation’s pilots are schooled, coun- 
seled, and experienced in the best institutions that America 
can provide. They enter the fascinating service of teaching with 
a clear recognition of certain responsibilities which loom greater 
and greater as the far-reaching consequences of the teacher’s 
irresistible influence are revealed. These clear-headed frontiers- 
men and frontierswomen of civilization are the members of the 
profession of which this chapter treats. 
The same leaders can be found in many enterprises in addi- 
tion to those which are avowedly educational. They participate 
in civic activities in which trained and zealous guidance are re- 
quired. They exert great power in the attaining of the highest 
objectives of their communities. They engage in and often direct 
the highest forms of social activities their cities can provide. 
It is of such trained professional men and women that this 
chapter treats, and not of the transients who often employ teach- 
ing as a stepping-stone to some occupation no more worthy than 
teaching, or of the parasites who sap the profession of teaching 
and stifle the enthusiasm and mental energy of the youth whom 
they essay to inspire and enlighten.

TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 153 
Professor Smith sets up criteria by means of which the degree 
of professionalism among individual teachers as well as among 
teachers as a whole can be judged. 
THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF TEACHING* 
By Watter R. Smita 
Ts teaching really a profession? How shall we know whether 
or not it is a profession? If it is not now a profession, how can 
it be made so? These and similar questions are continually re- 
curring and various discussions of them are accessible. Most of 
these discussions, however, are either inconclusive or unconvinc- 
ing. In some cases the analysis is incomplete, leaving too nar- 
row a basis for judgment, while in others the conclusions are too 
sweeping. Education is such a complex process, schools are so 
varied in type, and teaching personnel is so fluctuating that any 
wide generalization is misleading. 
Most efforts to distinguish the professions from other voca- 
tions fail because of a faulty approach to the subject. Professor 
Palmer’s delightful essay, “Trades and Professions,” errs because 
his basis of distinction is wholly psychological. According to 
his analysis professionalism is an attitude of mind. Thus the 
determination of whether or not one’s occupation is a trade or 
a profession depends.upon his attitude toward his work. Such 
an idea may be poetic and appealing, but it is neither scientific 
nor\.wholly true. No exaltation of mind can make the ditch 
digger, hardware merchant, or coal miner a professional man. 
Psychological elements must be taken into account, but, at bot- 
tom, the whole question is a sociological one. For purposes of 
differentiation of occupation, one’s attitude toward his own work 
is scarcely so important as the attitude of the public toward that 
work; and the attitude of the public is made up of tradition, 
popular usage of terms, and opinions based upon vague analyses 
of the distinctive nature of the services rendered. 
If society, rather than the individual, determines whether or 
not one’s occupation is a profession, our first task is to orient 
and clarify the standards of judgment it uses. A careful analysis, 
it seems to me, will indicate that the public expects an occupa- - 
tion to measure up to four requirements before it can be dig- 
nified by the title of profession. These are: 1. It must render 
*Educational Review, LXITII, 35-49.. January, 1922. 
+
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
a high and specialized type of social service. 2. Its personnel 
must have specialized and abundant training for its work and 
be comparatively permanent. 3. It must provide sufficient in- 
come to enable its members to maintain a cultural standard of 
living. 4. Its members must be dominated by a. professional 
spirit. Each of these requirements must be explained and 
applied before we can define the professional status of the 
teacher. 
In regard to the first it may be stated that every recognized 
profession renders a specialized service that is of a highly social 
nature. All useful work produces, in varying degrees, a social 
result. The railroad section hand, the carpenter, the farmer, the 
grocer, the manufacturer, each contributes to social welfare; but 
we ordinarily think of their contributions as less highly socialized 
and made to individual persons rather than to the community. 
A carpenter, for example, may build good houses; but a pro- 
» fessional architect may do more than design superior houses—he 
“may revolutionize the architectural taste of a community. The 
grocer may aid or injure the health of a neighborhood, but not 
to the same extent as the physician. The public expects the 
professional man to have a social outlook and places upon him a 
responsibility for community welfare not demanded of the trades- 
man or business man. 
The high social status of professional service is exemplified in 
a number of ways. Most patent of these is in the relation of the 
economic reward to the amount of services rendered. In the 
trades or business the amounts of service, or of commodities to 
be delivered, are fixed and calculable. They are therefore sub- 
ject to bargain and contrast, so much service or so many com- 
modities for a certain amount of money. In the professions, 
however, the services are largely qualitative. We do not stipu- 
late the amount of service a minister is to render for a fifteen 
hundred dollar salary or the physician for a five dollar visit. 
They are “called” with the hope that they will accomplish cer- 
tain results. If they fail, or accomplish more than expected, the 
pay remains the same, except for the esteem in which they are 
held, and the future relationships this may establish. The result 
of these differing methods of determining values is that while 
business services are limited quantitatively, professional services 
are unlimited except in quality, the professional man doing his 
best at all times whether the pay is much, or little, or even 
nothing.
-P-A-G-E-167
TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 155. 
Another feature of professional rewards is that they are very 
largely socially determined. Trade and business relationships 
are mainly individual; professional relationships generally have 
a public element in them. Physicians’ fees are largely standard- 
ized and pro-rated on a social basis. Ministers’ and teachers’ 
salaries are fixed by some sort of group action, and lawyers and 
engineers’ fees tend to become standardized. They thus crystal- 
lize into social tradition and any change becomes a matter of 
social concern. The result of fixing rewards through social ap- 
preciation is to make the professional man more socially minded. 
Being more nearly a public servant he accepts social responsi- 
bility and has a larger vocational interest in public welfare. This 
tends to stimulate a professional attitude, which requires all mem- 
bers of a profession to democratize their services by aiding the 
needy regardless of their social or economic standing. 
The second requirement of a profession is that its personnel 
must have specialized and abundant training and be compara- 
tively permanent. Throughout history professional services have 
been so highly differentiated that anyone offering them was ex- 
pected to have undergone a long period of training for his work, 
either individual, tutorial, or collegiate. In our present complex 
society most effective work is specialized; but, in non-professional 
occupations, the amount of skill is generally so limited, or the 
division of labor so minute, that the specialized training required 
may be abbreviated. A finished tradesman undergoes an ap- 
prenticeship and a business man needs experience; but during 
apprenticeship, or business training, the novice is doing regular 
work, for most of which he receives pay. The professional man, 
however, must undergo long periods of study~and expense in 
preparation for his’ initial practice. In the best established pro- 
fessions, such as law and medicine, the young practitioner must, 
in addition, pass through a “starving period” before he can expect 
any large financial réwards. 
This prolonged’ period of technical preparation tends to estab- 
lish a permanence of personnel in the professions. Intense special 
training lowers one’s adaptability, and, to some extent, unfits 
him for ready transfer of interest and skill. Since preparation 
for business and the trades is more general, the process of ad- 
justment to a new occupation is less difficult than it is for the 
more minutely trained professional man. Also the investment 
of time and money in professional preparation is so extensive 
that few will make it unless they are sure of themselves. Still
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
another element preventing change in professional work is the 
fact that the larger incomes only follow long experience in which 
special ability is demonstrated. 
The third requirement of a profession calls for but brief men- 
tion. No occupation that does not provide a sufficient income to 
enable its followers to maintain a respectable plane of living can 
hope to attain professional rating. A professional man is ex- 
pected to dress well, to live in comfortable quarters, to surround 
himself with such evidence of culture as books and magazines, 
and to contribute reasonably to social and civic enterprises. His 
family is also expected to have cultural advantages and to ex- 
emplify certain elements of taste and respectability. So insist- 
ently does public opinion demand these things that professional 
success is difficult to attain without them, and any profession 
permitting its standard of income to fall below a reasonable 
minimum will lose in dignity and popular esteem. 
The final test of a profession is whether or-not its members 
are dominated by what is generally known as a “professional 
spirit.” This spirit is compounded of a number of elements. 
Prominent among these is a prideful class consciousness. The 
genuine professional man is conscious of the superior value of 
his services and takes pride in his own work and that of his 
fellows. He is interested in maintaining high standards of pro- 
fessional attainment and is willing to organize to promote pro- 
fessional ideals. For this purpose he.is willing to submit to a 
certain amount»of class control and public regulations. Physi- 
cians, ministers, and lawyers have led in raising standards of 
professional education and eliminating quacks and fraudulent 
practices in their own fields where the intangible nature of the 
services rendered makes popular judgment uncertain. 
In this struggle each profession gradually builds up a class 
ethics. Some sort of occupational urge leads professional men 
to perform much service for which they do not expect pay. 
Blatant advertising is forbidden and competition is kept on a 
high plane. Definite efforts are being made by trade unions and 
many business vocations to develop class consciousness and an 
occupational ethics, but the professions remain preeminent in 
the success they have attained. The “professional spirit” is 
elusive and intangible, but it is a powerful force that the public 
vaguely, though universally, recognizes. 
Each of these four standards of judging professional standing 
presents difficulties in application. Every well established vo-
-P-A-G-E-169
DT ee ee EE re NE, RE oe SE oi ETS PL Re Te eee Ee ee ee ea 
TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 157 
cation shows some degree of advancement along one or more, 
or perhaps all, of these lines. As an economic society matures 
there is a tendency to different vocations so fully that many of 
them will approach a professional status. Under all circum- 
stances, however, there will be a quantitative grading and some 
qualitative differences. 
In our present American society medicine, law, and the min- 
istry are universally recognized as being fully professionalized. 
The higher realms of the fine arts—music, literature, painting, 
sculpture, architecture, and the drama—may also be said to have 
‘attained complete professionalization. Engineering, dentistry, 
and journalism are border line vocations rapidly approaching the 
above standards and securing public recognition. Even such 
businesses as that of the banker, broker, and economic adviser 
are meeting many of the tests and gaining in popular esteem. 
Likewise nurses, philanthropic and social workers, and personnel 
experts in the industries are specializing upon such a high social 
and cultural plan as to approach professional attitudes. 
Each of these border line vocations falls short in some particu- 
lar, however. Engineering provides abundant specialized training, 
but falls short in standardization of service, permanency of per- 
sonnel, and the professional spirit. Dentistry begins its train- 
ing on too low an educational plane, and, as generally practiced, 
depends too much upon artisanship rather than professional 
diagnosis to fully meet the standards of a critical public. Jour- 
nalism has not entirely changed from apprenticeship training 
into educational preparation, but is rapidly doing so and will 
then be ready for professional rating. The border line businesses, 
such as banking, still depend too much upon experience instead of 
intellectual training for promotions and fall short of a genuine 
professional attitude toward social welfare. Nurses, social 
workers, and personnel experts are deficient either in prelim- 
inary training or the standardization of their work. Thus we 
might go through the whole list of vocations and show where they 
fail to meet one or more of the standards outlined above as being 
necessary to gain professional rating. 
What, then, may we say of teaching? How fully does it meet 
the tests we have elaborated? For answer let us apply them in 
some detail. At the top of the scale come teachers of the uni- 
versity and college type. They probably meet each of the tests 
as well as any group of men, and have, for generations, been 
given professional rating along with ministers, lawyers, and phy-
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
sicians. A certain amount of justifiable criticism is leveled at 
them because so few of them take any preliminary training in 
the technical phases of teaching; but, since so large a share of 
their rating is traditionally and practically given because they 
are professional scholars, for which they receive unusually elab- 
orate training, their weakness in preparation for classroom teach- 
ing does not undermine their professional standing,/As schools 
of education are being established in all universities, this short- 
coming will be remedied, and as professional organization im- 
proves class consciousness and class ethics, they may be expected 
to head the whole list in professional respectability. 
The second rank of teachers is composed of educational ad- 
ministrators. As education is everywhere made more of a public 
concern, it tends to become the most important function of gov- 
ernment. Already much the largest local and state budgets are 
for education and more and more public opinion is likely to 
demand that school funds be administered by professionally 
trained men. This is evident in the rapidly rising salaries of 
state, county, and city superintendents, and of high school and 
grade principals. It is also evident in the differentiation of the 
curricula in schools of education. Teacher training is separated 
into departmental groups, in one of which administrators are given 
elaborate and specialized training. At the same time group or- 
ganizations of administrators are building up class consciousness 
and developing a professional ethics. A complete analysis would 
indicate that educational administration should be classified as a 
border line occupation rapidly becoming fully professionalized. 
The third teaching group is composed of the great body of high 
school and grade teachers in well organized school systems. They 
should probably be classed as lower border line professionals, 
ranking beneath the administrators and still far from meeting 
reasonable professional standards. In fact, they satisfy only the 
first of the four requirements. That they render a high type of 
social service is scarcely open to question. The pulpit, press, and 
platform resound with praises of their unselfish devotion to ideals 
and the constructive nature of their civic mission; but this praise 
sometimes approaches pure buncombe, when we analyze the 
psychic attitude dealers in such persiflage hold toward public 
school teachers as a class and the opposition they show to move- 
ments devised to elevate teaching standards. 
With reference to the second requirement, it may be stated 
that most teachers in the class under consideration have a cer-
-P-A-G-E-171
TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 159 
tain amount of technical training, but in many cases it is very 
limited. Moreover, their general education is not sufficient, as 
in the case of college and university teachers, to offset their weak- 
ness in technical preparation. Coffman, in his study of the teach- 
ing population made a decade ago, found that the typical teacher 
had had only four years of educative training above the elemen- 
tary school. While it is considerably more than that in the best 
school systems, it is still too low to permit serious claims to 
professional rating. Even more significant is the shifting per- 
sonnel of teaching. Coffman found that the median number of 
years in service was seven for men and four for women. Assum- 
ing that length of service is much greater in well organized 
systems, the continued dropping out of experienced teachers and 
the addition of novices to take their places undermines any sort 
of stability of vocational personnel. 
Not less important in the social rating of teachers is the plane 
of living their salaries enable them to maintain. In 1910-11, 
according to a survey by the United States Bureau of Education, 
the average salary was $542 for men and $420 for women. Such 
an income could scarcely be expected to provide the cultural sur- 
roundings, or the dignity, freedom, and vocational pride we de- 
mand of professional people. Since that time salaries have 
advanced, but not in proportion to the increase in the cost of 
living; in reality, war time unsettlement and inflation of com- 
modity values almost forced the teacher ‘below the poverty line. 
Until the economic rewards of the ordinary teacher are consid- 
erably increased, he will not rise above the contempt of the com- 
mercial classes or maintain the standard of living necessary to 
general social respect. 
Concerning the last requirement, that of a professional spirit, 
the rank and file of teachers are also wanting. Teaching is so 
easily entered and retired from, salaries increase so slowly, and 
public esteem is so grudgingly granted that few teachers begin 
their work with the idea of making it a lifetime occupation. 
Hence they are slow to organize, to cultivate fellow feeling, and 
to sacrifice personal preferences for group welfare. This makes 
class consciousness and a vocational ethics difficult to bring about. 
In our larger cities militant organizations are being perfected that 
are able to force teacher loyalty and public recognition; but the 
struggle to attain a professional spirit will be long and hard under 
the most favorable conditions, and our smaller cities and towns 
have scarcely started.
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
If the better class of public school teachers above considered 
fall short of professionalism at present, and may be expected 
to for some time to come, it may be questioned whether or not 
rural and village teachers will ever attain it. Progress in that 
direction at present is certainly slow, but there are evidences that 
it exists. The most patent direction of this progress is in raising 
the legal requirements for a certificate to teach. Many states now 
require four years of preliminary education above the elementary 
school and provide a special normal training course for those ex- 
pecting to teach. As these general requirements are advanced, 
the ranks of beginners will be thinned, increased wages will raise 
the standards of living, and more effective organization will im- 
prove the professional spirit. 
A general perspective of the vocational status of teaching will 
show that university and college teachers are now classed as 
professionals, superintendents and principals are on the upper 
border line fast gaining professional recognition, high school and 
grade teachers in our best public school systems are on the lower 
border line, slowly but surely advancing into professional ranks, 
and rural and village teachers are still far removed from any 
professional considerations. It now remains to point out some of 
the evidences of progress at hand and certain other steps nec- 
essary to be taken before public school teaching can be fully 
professionalized. 
With reference to the first professional requirement, that of 
rendering a high type of social service, public school teaching 
shows but one weakness. For those deliberately choosing to teach 
because they love it and are willing to accept its responsibilities, 
it stimulates the necessary social outlook and offers wide oppor- 
tunities of service; but there are at present, even in our best 
schools, too many floaters who invest little idealism in their work 
and get little inspiration from it. As long as teaching is allowed 
to be exploited by women to decorate ‘the portals of matrimony 
with superfluous finery, and by men to tide over a period of 
vocational indecision or get ready cash to pay for a more respect- 
able professional education, it will be difficult for teachers to 
convince a lethargic public of their professional zeal and com- 
munity interest. Until teachers can purge their rolls of these 
perfunctory time servers, they will not be able to maintain the 
high level of social service that should characterize a genuine 
profession. Means of doing this will be suggested later. 
Toward meeting the second requirement much progress is

everywhere visible. University and college schools of education 
are spreading. State normal schools are being multiplied, at- 
tendance is increasing, and the amount of training offered is being 
extended to include four full years of work. The larger cities 
are likewise supporting normal schools to train teachers to fill 
up their own ranks. Summer schools and extension work of 
various kinds are raising the educational standards of teachers in 
service. In addition, the high schools are in many states pro- 
viding specialized courses for training rural and village teachers. 
Reading circles, special supervisors, and institutes are adding a 
modicum of technical stimulus to those already at work. In many 
cities of very moderate size apprentice teaching is directed and 
required before the novice is given a regular position. Taken 
altogether, these and other agencies are rapidly guaranteeing that 
all teachers in our better school systems shall have a reasonable 
amount of both general education and technical preparation for 
their work and that rural and village teachers shall have an in- 
creasing amount of preliminary training. What is most needed 
to advance these agencies is an educated public opinion that will 
not countenance the employment of untrained teachers and more 
stringent state laws and local board regulations concerning the 
preparation required of applicants for positions. 
With reference to permanence of personnel the situation is less 
hopeful. If teaching continues to become more definitely fem- 
inized, our social mores concerning marriage and the employment 
of married women must change. So long as a large majority of 
women begin teaching with the idea of temporary service, the 
personnel of elementary teaching must remain fluctuating and 
peripatetic. What is true for a large proportion of women is just 
as true for that large majority of men who plan to teach for a 
short time only. In either case the average length of service can 
be increased by raising the entrance requirements, both in the 
amount and the technical nature of the education demanded, and 
by the establishment of salary schedules cutting down the amount 
of initial salary obtainable. Each of these movements is gain- 
ing rapid headway in the cities, but is moving more slowly in the 
smaller towns and rural districts. 
Another element leading to a fleeting personnel is the peculiar 
nature of teaching tenure. At present most ordinary teachers 
accept a one year contract, which automatically discharges them 
at the close of the year. They must then reapply or search else- 
where for a position. Such a method of tenure forces the. teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
162 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to assume the whole burden of terminating employment, which 
in business and well established professions is shared by the em- 
ployer. This keeps the teacher in unstable equilibrium with 
reference to his future, and prevents him from becoming a full- 
fledged member of the community. With such an insecure tenure, 
the teacher inevitably becomes oversensitive to public criticism 
and loses his birthright of independence in trying to satisfy the 
whims of patrons. Not until the present unfair type of contract, 
which is not merely temporary but often prescribes the sort of 
conduct the teacher is to exemplify, is eliminated in favor of the 
indefinite tenure now used in colleges and universities, can 
teachers hope to attain the dignity, independence, and perma- 
2* nence of employment necessary to professional self-respect. 
-——~ The third professional requirement, that of a cultural stand- 
ard of living, is closely allied to the second. So long as any 
drifting youth or unsettled maid with a little education is al- 
lowed to teach, and so long as initial salaries are comparatively 
high and increases for experience and advanced training are slight, 
the income from teaching must remain small. Competition is 
scarcely less dominant in professional than in business life, and, 
in the long run, salaries will be determined by the laws of supply 
and demand. An overabundance of commodities lowers prices 
and just as inevitably an overabundance of teachers lowers 
salaries. It is idle to talk.of raising the wage scale without cre- 
ating scarcity of qualified applicants for positions. The only 
hope of increasing the economic rewards of educational work to 
the point where they will permit the dignified plane of living 
necessary to the social respect due a profession, is to make it 
unprofitable for those who now exploit it. This desideratum may 
be approached in a number of ways. The first of these is by 
raising the entrance requirements. More careful selection of en- 
trants will come largely through legislative control of licenses to 
teach. Public sentiment must be educated to the point of in- 
sistence that the teachers of our youth shall be relatively mature 
men and women who are technically and abundantly prepared for 
their work. Certificates must be denied those who will not take 
adequate training or who are personally unfit. Teacher-training 
schools and state boards of education, who ought to be interested 
in advancing standards, cannot be altogether absolved from blame 
in certificating many that are known to be unworthy. By rea- 
son of personal sensitiveness, sympathy, and a certain lack of 
militancy that seems to characterize educational officers, even  
-P-A-G-E-175
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 163 
the mild legal requirements for certificates are not rigidly en- 
forced. An aggressive policy on the part of teachers’ organiza- 
tions might contribute much to bring about a more rigid selection 
of those entering the teaching vocation. 
Along with more stringent control of certification must come 
the general establishment of a novitiate, or “starving period,” for 
beginners comparable to that which lawyers and physicians must 
undergo. Viewed from the economic standpoint, it must be ad- 
mitted that the mounting cost of public education is somewhat 
alarming to the tax payer. School taxes are already high and 
they must increase immensely under the democratic demand of 
equal educational opportunities for all. For example, statistics 
indicate that, for the country as a whole, our present high school 
facilities must be multiplied by not less than six before we can 
get as large a proportion of our children through the high school 
as we now get through the elementary grades. Under the stress 
of meeting the enormous expenditure necessary for enlarging 
school plants, should we marvel that boards of education not 
infrequently pare down the salary fund in favor of the building 
fund? If the salary fund is kept low, however, someone must 
suffer. Economies will be effected either at the expense of be- 
ginners or of the confirmed and experienced teachers. If school- 
boards use business methods, as the public expects them to do, the 
_ only practicable method of substantially raising the salaries of 
permanent teachers is to eliminate competition on comparatively 
equal terms of the temporary teaching classes. A critical analysis 
will show that the income of the floater and time server is really 
taken from the later salaries of the professional teacher. 
It then becomes a matter of vital importance for teachers’ 
organizations and administrative officers to carry on an aggressive 
campaign for salary schedules that will favor the experienced 
teachers as against the beginner. Already salary schedules are 
being adopted in many cities requiring apprentice teaching and 
fixing low initial salaries, which are to be increased through a 
long series of years. Similar schedules should be worked out for 
rural counties and small towns. Where apprentice teaching is 
impossible, the first year’s salary should probably not exceed half 
that of the third year and should advance steadily thereafter. 
To avoid mere seniority promotion, which characterizes so many 
civil service agencies, and is not wholly unknown in city school 
systems, salary increases should be based upon special merit and 
advanced training, as well as length of service. War time and 
 
-P-A-G-E-176

reconstruction scarcity of teachers demonstrated what effect on 
salaries we may expect to follow the lowering of competitive 
pressure for positions. If, by raising standards and establishing 
scientific salary schedules, we can permanently equalize demand 
and supply, we may be assured of increasing the teacher’s in- 
come enough to enable him to maintain a respectable professional 
plane of living. 
Our final test of the vocational status of teachers is whether 
or not they possess what is known as a “professional spirit.” 
While this requirement is closely allied with the others, it implies 
something additional. The writer had a friend who taught school 
for a number of years, was then admitted to the bar, and became 
probate judge for a short time. He did not resume the practice 
of law, but it is significant that during the remainder of his life 
he proudly retained the title of “judge.” Neither he nor his 
neighbors referred with special pride to the fact that he had 
been a school teacher. Most readers can cite similar instances. 
The questions at stake are, do teachers possess a class conscious- 
ness that will lead them to sacrifice self-interests? Can they 
organize effectively? Have they developed a professional ethics? 
It is to be feared that, for the rank and file of public school 
teachers, these questions must be answered in the negative. Yet 
along each of these lines enough progress is visible to inspire 
confident hope. 
The greatest handicap to the growth of a professional spirit 
lies in the temporary nature of teaching tenure and personnel. 
As preliminary training is increased, however, and as apprentice 
teaching is extended and low initial salaries are fixed, the weed- 
ing out of vocational parasites will be more effective. This will 
leave only those who are permanerit enough to feel the need of 
cooperation. If one’s life plans are involved, a sacrificial and 
compromising spirit can be shown to be worth ‘while, Therefore, 
as continuity of service is established, a better foundation will 
exist on which to build a constructive program of professional 
advancement. 
Of prime importance in this program is the perfecting of virile 
teachers’ organizations. These organizations must be exclusive 
enough to keep out insincere time-servers and they must cultivate 
sufficient aggressiveness to make their influence felt by legisla- 
tures, boards of education, and the public. While avoiding 
vocational selfishness, they must insist upon fair treatment of 
individual teachers, scientific salary schedules, and organizational
-P-A-G-E-177
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 165 
respect, as well as carry on campaigns for higher teaching stand- 
ards and general educational welfare. Such organizations are 
being promoted among college professors and in our larger cities. 
They need to be extended into our smaller cities, towns, and 
villages as a basis for effective county, state, and national asso- 
ciations. 
If aggressive teachers’ organizations can be established, the 
development of a professional ethics will speedily follow. In re- 
cent years several committees have tentatively formulated the 
principles that ought to govern teachers in their relations to each 
other and to the public. Means are suggested for keeping com- 
petition on a higher plane, for improving the inequitable contract 
now so prevalent, and for the cultivation of a social attitude that 
will relieve the necessity of catering to the whims of patrons and 
the prejudices of boards of education. If these things can be ac- 
complished and an income obtained that will permit a higher 
plane of living, teachers will gain in self-respect and public esteem. 
A vocational pride, which is the essence of the professional spirit, 
will thus be engendered, and teachers will demand and receive 
the dignified social position that must characterize a true 
profession. 
Salaries and tenure. Improvident though the proverbial 
teacher may be, few questions have greater perennial cogency 
with teachers than questions relating to salaries and tenure of 
position. The following passages indicate present-day conditions 
and tendencies. 
SALARY OUTLOOK FOR HIGH-SCHOOL TEACHERS? 
By H. R. Bonner 
To choose a life-career intelligently three important factors 
about the vocation itself demand consideration—the prepara- 
tion required for admission, the remuneration granted to the inex- 
perienced, and future salary assurances. As two-thirds of all 
high-school teachers now hold degrees and since nearly all be- 
ginning high-school teachers are required to hold a baccalaureate 
degree, the first factor may be summarily disposed of as being 
known. This discussion deals with the analysis of the other two 
factors. 
*The School Review, XXX, 414-423. June, 1922. Abridged.

166 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
High-school teaching as a career. There is some doubt as 
to whether high-school teaching should be called a life-career. 
In Bulletin No. 50, 1921, of the Bureau of Education, it is shown 
that the “average” (median) high-school teacher has had 
only six years of experience. It does not follow, however, that 
teachers enter this branch of professional service for only six 
years. The rapid expansion of high-school enrolment, at the 
rate of 8 per cent per year, calls for an increasingly larger pro- 
portion of inexperienced teachers annually to care for the in- 
crease in attendance. If the enrolment remained constant, the 
average experience of high-school teachers would be about eleven 
years. A calling which holds its employees for so short a time can 
scarcely be called a life-career. With the advent of higher sal- 
aries the profession promises to become more attractive, and the 
period of service will undoubtedly be much longer. 
Entrance salary. .. . The average teacher now enters the pro- 
fession at an annual salary of $1,297 or a little more than $100 
per month the year round. The entrance salary for men aver- 
ages $1,572 and that for women, $1,184. Thus it is seen that 
beginning men teachers are paid $388 more than women. It 
should not be inferred that all beginners are equally paid. The 
entrance salaries vary considerably in the different states. For 
example, in Florida the beginner’s salary is only $960, whereas 
in California the corresponding average is $1,886, or about twice 
as much. The salaries of beginning men teachers range from 
$1,289 in Missouri to $2,154 in California, and the correspond- 
ing averages for women teachers vary from $835 in Virginia to 
$1,760 in California. With such inequalities as these, there is 
great danger that the states paying the higher salaries will at- 
tract the better college graduates, while the states paying the 
lower salaries will be obliged to employ teachers of inferior native 
ability and of more limited training. 
Outlook for the average teacher. The average salary of 
69,358 high-school teachers was found to be $1,678 in 1g2t. 
This average is only $381, or 29.4 per cent, more than the average 
salary for beginners. The salary outlook for the average teacher, 
therefore, is less than a 30 per cent increase. It should be borne 
in mind that the average outlook does not represent the salary 
assurance for every teacher in the profession. Men and women 
of unusual ability will excel this average even to the extent of 
being advanced to the more remunerative administrative posi- 
tions, while those of inferior ability may fall short of the aver- 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 167 
age expectation. The corresponding outlook for men teachers 
is 29.3 per cent and that for women teachers, 27.0 per cent. A 
profession that promises such a meager assurance is not far 
superior to a “blind-alley” job. The slightly higher percentage 
for men may be influenced by the reaction to check the decreas- 
ing proportion of men teachers. The fact that men are now paid 
$529 more per year than women undoubtedly shows that men’s 
services are at a premium. 
The salary outlook for the average teacher varies considerably 
in the different states. For instance, in Delaware the assurance 
is for an increase of only 7.8 per cent; in New York, 64.6 per 
cent. These extremes are unquestionably influenced by the 
longer period of service in New York than in Delaware. In the 
report referred to it is found that 64.3 per cent of the teachers 
in New York state have had over five years’ experience, whereas 
the corresponding proportion in Delaware with such experience 
is only 35.8 per cent. 
Outlook for teachers with over five years’ experience. As 
many high-school teachers drop out of the profession before the 
end of the fifth year, the salary outlook for those who remain is 
much larger than has been indicated. It is found that the out- 
look for the teacher who remains longer than five years is for 
an increase of $646, or 49.8 per cent above the entrance salary. 
The corresponding assurance for men is $676, or 43.0 per cent, 
and for women $571, or 48.2 per cent. The promise, therefore, 
for a long period of service is more favorable to the women than 
to the men. In other words, there is a greater initial induce- 
ment for men than for women to enter the profession, but a 
slightly greater percentage of increase is promised to women than 
to men for a long period of service. 
Premium paid to beginners. To induce young men and wo- 
men to enter the high-school teaching profession during the 
unusual period of the war it was thought necessary to increase 
the salaries of beginning teachers at a more rapid rate than the 
salaries of other teachers. Thus, the salaries of all teachers were 
increased only 52.6 per cent from 1918 to 1921, whereas the sal- 
aries of beginners were raised 60.9 per cent, or 15.8 per cent 
more. In short, beginners were at-a premium of 15.8 per cent. 
In ten states, however, beginners were at a discount; that is, 
their salaries were not raised at as rapid a rate as the salaries 
of other teachers. The premium on beginners reached a maximum 
of 87.8 per cent in Connecticut, and the discount was greatest 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in Delaware where the percentage of increase was 43.9 per cent 
less than that for all teachers combined. Undoubtedly, in states 
in which beginners were at a discount an unusual attempt was 
made to retain teachers already in the service. On the other 
hand, the premium probably indicates an inability to recruit 
teachers in sufficient numbers to maintain the necessary corps of 
instructors. 
This premium-and-discount theory has a direct bearing on the 
salary outlook for teachers. In states granting a premium to be- 
ginning teachers the salary outlook is not so favorable as it would 
have been had all salaries, regardless of experience, been increased 
at the same rate. On the other hand, in states showing a dis- 
count on beginners the figures indicating the salary expectation 
are relatively large. Thus the salary outlook for Connecticut 
of 27.8 per cent for all teachers is lower than it should be since 
the salaries of beginners were unusually increased in the three- 
year period (87.8 per cent over the average rate). At the other 
extreme, it must be inferred that the low salary outlook of 7.8 
per cent for Delaware is larger than it should be since the sal- 
aries of teachers in service were increased more rapidly than 
those of beginning teachers. In other words, Delaware probably 
has no adequate schedule, either specifically adopted or implied. 
The average premium paid for beginning high-school teachers 
above the average percentage of increase for teachers with over 
five years’ experience is even greater than the premium based on 
the average percentage of increase for all teachers. . . . In other 
words, beginning teachers were granted a percentage of in- 
crease 21 per cent greater than that given to teachers with over 
five years’ experience. This practice, as shown in the bulletin 
referred to, has resulted in a decrease of 2.5 per cent in the pro- 
portion of teachers with over five years’ experience from 1918 to 
1921. This exodus of experienced teachers from the profession 
indicates deterioration in our high-school teaching staff. Again, 
Connecticut and Delaware exhibit extreme conditions. In the 
former state beginning teachers received a percentage of increase 
119.1 per cent greater than that given to teachers with five years’ 
experience. In the latter state beginning teachers were awarded a 
percentage of increase 49.9 per cent less than that given to 
teachers with five years’ experience. Beginners in Delaware were 
at a discount of almost 50 per cent in 1921. 
Conclusions. On each count there is sufficient evidence to 
show that beginning teachers were much in demand in 1921 and
-P-A-G-E-181
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 169 
that more experienced teachers did not receive the consideration 
shown to inexperienced teachers. Boards of education probably 
found that it was easier to hold in the profession teachers who 
had already enlisted than to induce college graduates to enter it. 
The situation reveals an unfairness exercised toward experienced 
teachers. 
The report shows that an attempt seems to have been made to 
offset in part the increasing cost of living by adding a bonus to 
pre-war salaries—a tendency operating in favor of the beginning 
teacher. The average absolute increase for the United States 
from 1918 to 1921 was $578, varying from $315 in Florida to 
$729 in South Dakota. For beginners the bonus was $571 for 
men, $444 for women, and $491 for both. For teachers with over 
five years’ experience it was $725 for men, $611 for women, and 
$643 for both. These bonuses were not sufficient until May, 1921, 
to meet the increased cost of living and did not meet it until it 
began to drop. The inadequacy of these increments resulted 
in a loss of college graduates amounting to 9 per cent, an in- 
crease of 17 per cent in the proportion of normal-school graduates, 
and an increase of 37 per cent in the proportion of non-graduates. 
Thus it is seen that inadequate pay and promise-to-pay resulted 
in a deterioration which will require many years to counteract. 
If present salary schedules remain as they are, there will be little 
inducement for young men and women of ability to remain in 
the profession. The result will be an ever-shifting teaching staff, 
and higher educational institutions will be called upon to supply 
an extraordinary number of high-school teachers each year to 
take the place of those who discover that the profession offers 
little financial inducement. It would seem, therefore, in view of 
these disclosures, that high schools are called upon to adopt 
salary schedules that will recognize and reward meritorious serv- 
ice and experience in this branch of professional service. The 
salaries of experienced teachers will need to be increased. A vo- 
cation that promises no greater reward than 29.3 per cent for the 
average employee or 49.8 per cent for those who pass the 
five-year mark is not likely to result in a contented personnel and 
will probably not succeed in holding the services of its most 
capable employees.

TENURE OF HIGH-SCHOOL TEACHERS * 
By C. J. Anpzerson 
Some permanency of tenure is essential if a progressive policy 
in high-school instruction is to be realized. How long do the 
teachers in our high schools remain in the same community? The 
statistics show them to be an itinerant group. The size of the 
schools appears to make but little difference to them until they 
are employed in schools having over ten teachers. In these 
schools they are content to remain another year. 
In the two-teacher schools over one-half of the teachers are 
new each second year. Only 3.3 per cent of them have remained 
five years or over. None have remained in the same school more 
than six years. In the schools employing three teachers almost 
6o per cent of the teachers leave by the end of the second year. 
Only four teachers have taught in the same school for more than 
six years. The same story may be told for each group of schools 
with slight variations here and there. Taking the state as a 
whole, 5.4 per cent of the teachers are new to their present posi- 
tions; about 39 per cent have returned to their communities for 
the second consecutive year. The median for the state is three 
years, made possible by the greater degree of permanency of 
position in those schools employing more than ten teachers. The 
median for those schools employing less than ten teachers is two 
years. 
This is a situation that merits the serious attention of those 
who plan school policies. Teachers should be retained in the 
same communities for longer periods. Their restlessness is no 
doubt due in some measure to the fact that in any given school 
they reach the maximum of the salary schedule in a relatively 
short time. In fact they reach the maximum in salary much 
earlier than they reach the maximum in efficiency. Schedules 
should provide for smaller increases during the apprenticeship 
period and service and efficiency should be recognized in a mone- 
tary way. Statutes providing for permanency of tenure after 
a probationary period would assist in stabilizing these positions. 
This has followed in those cities which place their teachers under 
permanent tenure.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING TEACHER TENURE LAWS* 
With the growth of teacher organizations and the study by 
teachers of such professional questions as those of salary, pen- 
sions, and tenure, has come a more careful consideration of the 
underlying principles of all such legislation. There have been 
several recent studies of tenure principles. The following formu- 
lation, that of Ira Richardson, of the University of Oregon 
(slightly modified from the original) appears to represent with 
fair accuracy the conclusions of most of the recent studies of 
tenure: 
I. Principles which should be present and operative prior to 
the institution of tenure laws: 
1. Since education is a State function, a prerequisite training 
for teaching and a probationary period of service prior to perma- 
nent certification should be required by State law. 
2. The State should prescribe a minimum salary schedule 
accompanying stages of probationary service based on scholastic 
and professional training. 
3. Details of salary schedule, bases of promotion or demotion 
to or from grades or levels of salary schedule, ratings and mea- 
sures of professional improvement following probationary service 
may be left to local authorities. 
II. Principles which should control in the framing and opera- 
tion of tenure laws: 
1. All tenure laws should be associated with regulations gov- 
erning training, certification, remuneration, and annuities or 
pensions. 
2. Tenure laws should be devised and administered in the 
interest of better instruction for children and as a stimulus to 
better preparation and more efficient service on the part of 
teachers. 
3. Participation in the benefits of a tenure law should be 
based on— 
a. Evidence of a satisfactory preliminary training and service 
as shown by legal credentials of scholarship and professional 
training and of certification.

b. Evidence of ability as shown by ratings. 
c. Evidence of professional spirit as shown by professional 
activity and continued study. 
4. Dismissal from service should be based on clearly dem- 
onstrable causes. 
5. Suitable provision should be made for those already in 
service without preliminary qualifications. 
6. All groups and classes of public education workers should 
be provided for. 
Professional standards of teachers. Indications that teachers 
are taking their tasks seriously are found in the formulations 
which they themselves are making of teachers’ rights and duties. 
The passages which follow evidence a growth of class conscious- 
ness and also show the rise of a spirit of professionalism which 
is in harmony with the criteria already set up by Professor 
Smith. i 
ETHICAL STANDARDS OF THE TEACHER‘ 
By W. L. Errincer 
Is it not significant that recently we find bodies of teachers 
in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, and Mississippi dis- 
cussing and adopting codes of professional ethics? Such delib- 
erations and acts are indicative of the fact that the teaching 
profession is attaining a maturity—an adolescence, as it were— 
that inspires a reflective attitude which, in turn, leads to a discus- 
sion and formulation of standards of behavior consonant with 
the dignity of the service which teachers render the community. 
What are such codes of ethics? I presume we may define them 
as a formulation of the ideal relationships that should exist be- 
tween the teacher and the agencies and the persons with whom he 
comes in contact, such as the community, his fellow-teachers, his 
pupils, and those in parental or custodial relation to the pupils. 
Where, you may ask, should we look for the origin of such 
codes? In order to have vitality and significance, such codes 
must find their origin, their growth and their formulation in the 
teaching body and therefore should not be imposed upon teachers 
either from without or from above. They are meaningless, insofar 
* School and Society, XVIII, 568-572. 1923.
-P-A-G-E-185
  
TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 173 
as they are imposed upon teachers; they are vital and controlling 
insofar as they reflect a sensitive and enlightened professional 
conscience. 
When codes of ethics originate in the teaching body they are 
accepted by teachers as a guide to a type of professional attitude 
and behavior which commands the respect and admiration of all. 
Do not assume that either in a Pickwickian or a Pecksniffian 
sense I am about to impose a code upon you. I understand that 
a representative committee of the New York City Principals’ 
Association is engaged in studying and formulating a code and 
has already made a tentative report. I have no desire to enter 
into competition with such an admirable committee, but in re- 
sponse to your request I will sketch certain general considerations 
which appeal to me as ones that ought to constitute the minimum 
features of such a code. 
Relationship to the community. What obligation does the 
teacher owe to the community, using that term as one sufficiently 
elastic to include the city, the state and the nation? Surely we 
must concede that whether a teacher’s employment be the result 
of an expressed or an implied contractual relationship, there is 
a moral obligation to be loyal, patriotic, inspiring leaders, both 
in our community and in our classroom, whose service results in 
an increased understanding and appreciation of our institutional 
life. It is incumbent upon us to be the creators of an energized, 
critical public opinion, which leads to the reconstruction and to 
the betterment of our political and social life. You will note that 
I do not identify the teacher’s duty with either flag-waving jin- 
goism or reactionary conservatism. The successful solution of our 
city, state and national problems requires all the critical thinking 
we can initiate or inspire. But the obligation to develop such ; 
powers in our citizenship makes it imperative that teachers should 
not take advantage of the privacy of the classroom to assault 
the mentality of immature listeners by indulging in vicious propa~ 
ganda or exposing to ridicule either the ideals or the institutions 
of our people, in order to clear the way for the promotion and 
establishment of questionable ideals and alien modes of gov- 
ernment. 
I am sure I need not argue in such a gathering as this that no 
issue of freedom of speech or personal liberty is involved in such 
a statement of a teacher’s obligations. The cheap radicalism of 
a soap-box orator and the pernicious propaganda of the oblique- 
minded parlor socialist cannot be tolerated in the classroom.  
-P-A-G-E-186

Teachers should be glad to take and be bound by a solemn oath, 
similar to that administered to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impar- 
tially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me ac- 
cording to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably 
to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that I will 
support and defend the Constitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and 
allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely without 
any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I 
am about to enter. So help me, God.” 
Unionism. Perhaps no ethical question involving teachers has 
aroused more recent controversy in various parts of the country 
_ than the question of membership in unions. Frankness therefore 
demands that I refer briefly to the subject. 
~The aim of teacher-unionism, according to its advocates, is 
teacher-participation in school management and administration 
to a much greater degree than has been conceded hitherto. 
Unionism is the golden key, the long-postponed device by means 
of which the administration of education is to be democratizedj 
I am not opposed to teacher-unionism, but I do not believe that 
it is a panacea for ills pedagogical or administrative. The move- 
ment in a city like New York may easily fall into disrepute if 
controlled by unwise or intemperate leaders or if there be the 
\slightest suspicion that the movement has its origin in conten- 
tiousness, radicalism or disloyalty to our highest ideals of either 
our profession or our government. The answer to the question 
as to whether or not unionism is desirable must be found in the 
motives that prompt teachers to join any group, whether it be a 
union, a fraternity or a federation. To the extent that such 
groupings are prompted primarily by selfish interests, and are 
based upon class appeal and concepts of economic and national 
life that run counter to those for which our government stands, 
such groups, whether you call them by one name or another, are 
vicious and undemocratic. We can not ignore the bald fact that 
the schools of a democracy are the schools of the whole people, 
and not the schools of a particular class. Moreover, let me 
affirm with great emphasis that nothing can be more detrimental 
to our schools than the assumption that the classroom teachers 
constitute a laboring class, a sort of intellectual proletariat who 
differ both in kind and degree from supervisors and administra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 175 
tors who, by analogy, are classed as a sort of pedagogical capi- 
talistic class, constituting the sworn oppressors of the teachers 
with whom they live and labor day by day, and from whose ranks 
they are chosen. Any appeal to gross prejudice or to narrow class 
consciousness, whether labelled unionism or what not, contains 
the germs common to anarchism or bolshevism. A’ teacher’s 
     union and the general union movement among teachers are just 
as good.a st as evil as teachers make them. It is therefore 
  the*bounden duty of teachers in such organizations to be active 
to prevent the use of such groups for personal, political, or pro- 
fessional exploitation, and, above all, to maintain and promote 
those fine conceptions of service to our children and to our city 
which have always distinguished the teaching profession. 
Relationship to fellow-teachers. Need I state that teachers 
should display toward their superiors and their professional asso- 
ciates that fine regard and consideration for one’s professional 
reputation that is the boast of the legal and medical professions? 
The amenities of life and of professional relationships should 
be carefully observed. He whose services are marked by merit 
and distinction should receive the hearty appreciation of his 
fellows, unclouded by envy or captious criticism. With his supe- 
riors a teacher should work in a spirit of respectful, subordinated, 
harmonious cooperation. 
The real ethical problem arises when subserviency or acqui- 
escence in wrong are expected or demanded in place of 
courageous expression of conviction and the assertion and 
maintenance of rights. In a very real sense every one of us, 
from the Superintendent of Schools down to the most humble 
substitute, is a guardian of certain professional standards and 
legal rights. Therefore, no considerations of personal profit, 
comfort or advancement, no consideration of securing the good 
will and favor of those in either upper or lower ranks of the 
service, should prevent a courageous and outspoken assertion and 
sturdy maintenance of professional rights and obligations. 
In short, between the teacher and his professional colleagues 
as well as his statutory superiors there should exist the utmost 
respect, appreciation and cooperation, not inconsistent with the 
maintenance of professional service at the highest possible level 
of manly self-assertion, honest achievement and orderly adminis- 
tration in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law. 
Perhaps a word about professional associations other than 
unions is not inappropriate.
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
No one will deny the value of concerted action in the interests 
of worthy ends. 
We have numerous associations. As George Ade says, one 
can not throw a brick out of the window without hitting one of 
the brethren. We have a Teachers’ Council, which is composed 
of representatives of such associations; we have a Federation, 
which theoretically is made up of representatives of the numerous 
professional associations. Recently much progress has been made 
in the development of a city-wide organization, intended either 
to supplement or to supersede some of the existing ones. 
Wherever our sympathies lie, I think we should attempt to 
solve the problem of professional associations in an impersonal, 
impartial way, with an eye solely to the establishment of a rep- 
resentative organization which in moments of crisis or in relation 
to matters of grave importance, will register, not discordant and 
contradictory voices of a score of organizations, but will register 
with majesty and dignity the well-considered decision of a ma- 
jority of our vast army of teachers. : 
In like manner, I am strongly convinced that membership in 
our local organizations should be supplemented by membership 
in a national body. We should not fail to identify ourselves with 
our colleagues throughout the width and the breadth of the land. 
Education countrywide needs a well-equipped, strongly organized, 
adequately financed, far-visioned organization, such as the Na- 
tional Education Association, in order that the teachers rather 
than the Carnegie Foundation or the United States Chamber of 
Commerce shall decide far-reaching educational policies affecting 
not only the teachers but the children of our country. Let not 
a selfish complacency prevent us from shouldering a burden 
which is national in scope. 
Relation to Pupils. In relation to his pupils, a teacher should 
be an exemplar of physical, mental and moral growth. Note that 
I emphasize growth rather than complete achievement. If the 
teacher is to be a master-craftsman who discovers to the pupil 
his latent powers, who reveals to the pupil the golden nimbus 
that surrounds each head, he must be a skillful and sympathetic 
master to whom stupid rule of thumb procedure and bitter cyni- 
cism are unknown. 
The uaskillful, the unsympathetic, the cynical teacher is be- 
yond the pale and range of an ethical code. Day by day he does 
irreparable injury to child nature. He finds his own lack of 
skill, his own mental obtuseness, his own bitterness, objectified in
-P-A-G-E-189
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 177 
the lives of innocent, well-intentioned children. Let us work 
without ceasing to improve our weaker professional brother, but 
when he has failed to respond to long sustained remedial treat- 
ment, let us be the first, in the interests of childhood, to insist 
upon his ouster from the school system. 
Verily, the cultured, skillful, sympathetic teacher is a posses- 
sion beyond price, whose influence is found not merely in the 
present generation, but in our children’s children. 
Relations to parents. In a very real and in a legal sense the 
teacher stands im loco parentis to the pupil and therefore should 
seek to identify himself with the interests, the plans, and the am- 
bitions of the parent as regards his children. Churlishness, in- 
civility, lack of cooperation, disinclination to inform and advise 
should be characteristics foreign to any real teacher. 
Our typical failure to secure the cooperation of the children 
and their parents is due in large part to the teacher’s remoteness 
and detachment from the human relationships of the home. There 
is no better cure for such condition than for the teacher to come 
into close contact with the parent through visitation, either at 
the home or at the school, and through various other devices 
such as formal parents’ meetings or more sociable gatherings. 
In the eyes of the teacher, the pupil as one of a mass tends to 
lose his individuality, his identity, and it is only by making this 
human contact with the parent that the teacher will really see 
and understand the child in certain relationships that are the 
basis not only of individuality, but also of that teacher-insight 
which is the foundation of successful teaching. 
Conclusion. Perhaps the much desired aims of those who are 
striving to set up, in concise and almost catechetical form, the 
standards that appear to be peculiarly applicable to the teaching 
professional may not be attained through such formulation. In- 
deed, those who prepare and disseminate such codes may find 
that teachers fail to display any marked enthusiasm over the 
principles formulated. If we meet with such failure it will prob- 
ably be because we are over-emphasizing the letter rather than 
the spirit, of which such ethical code is but the literal expression. 
The spirit is all. We may, ourselves, be deceived as to the range 
of influence of such codes. But we should not be discouraged. 
The teaching profession to-day occupies higher levels of accom- 
plishment and inspiration than ever before. We are moving ever 
onward and upward. The ethical codes in question may find 
their analogue not in the turbulent waters that rush down the

glen and the valley, roaring in their course, but rather in the 
quiet underground waters, unseen and unheard, that moisten and 
make fertile the pleasant valleys. 
COULD I LIVE MY TEACHING LIFE OVER*® 
By I. G. Watson 
1. I would be loyal to my district, to my town, to the parents, 
to the pupils, to the superintendent. It pays in return with 
friendship, love, and dollars. 
2. I would be punctual at school, at meetings called by my 
superintendent, and at any function where my example might be 
followed. 
3. I would keep a question-book that I might consistently ask 
my superintendent concerning the things that had bothered me. 
Business people do this for exhausted supplies. 
4. I would take care of my own problems quietly when I could 
not conveniently consult my superintendent. 
5. I would hand in reports called for promptly and accurately. 
6. I would be professional—join local, State, and National 
Associations, and attend teachers’ gatherings. 
7. I would have the best certificate that I was able to earn, 
as early in life as it could be acquired.

need my services most. 
12. I would hesitate to send so-called bad boys to the prin- 
cipal or the superintendent. It would only weaken my own 
authority. 
13. I would remember that there is good in every child. 
14. I would make few rules. The fewer made, the fewer 
broken.

16. I would follow my program even if visitors were present. 
17. I would frequently talk of the pleasures of high school 
and college that my pupils might imbibe the spirit. 
18. I would watch for the growth of my pupils. 
19. I would visit the children occasionally in their homes and 
urge the parents to visit the children at school. 
20. I would be exceedingly careful about neighborhood gossip. 
21. I would visualize the children’s future. I would build 
cathedrals rather than outbuildings. 
22. I would place oil upon the troubled, grinding, rusty places 
where friction was evident. 
23. I would cultivate an optimism that would not permit 
self-pity. 
24. I would prepare carefully for a better field of service 
through progressiveness, education, health, and good fellowship. 
25. I would try to convince my patrons that education is an 
investment and that taxes can never be too high when the out- 
put shows worthy returns. 
Principles derived from discussions of the profession of 
teaching. Desirable professionalism among teachers depends 
upon (1) specialized training, (2) a keen sense of their special- 
ized service, (3) adequate income, (4) and socialized self-con- 
sciousness. 
Unless adequate salary scales exist, poor teachers will drive 
out good teachers. 
“All tenure laws should be associated with regulations govern- 
ing training, certification, remuneration, and annuities or 
pensions.” 
Participation in the benefits of a tenure law should be de- 
pendent upon professional activity and continued study as well 
as upon initial qualifications. 
Personal and social responsibilities require teachers to formu- 
late standards of their rights and their abilities. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. Professor Smith sets up criteria for determining whether or 
not the members of a school faculty are members of the teaching
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
profession. Compare these criteria with those which are usually 
applied to persons who practice law or medicine to determine the . 
professional status of such persons. 
2. Classify the members of the faculty of a secondary school 
with which you are familiar as members or non-members of the 
teaching profession. 
3. Select at least five professional magazines for teachers. Show 
in terms of Smith’s criteria the professional value of the latest 
issues of each of these magazines. 
4. Why should teachers become members of state or national 
teachers’ associations ? 
5. What unprofessional tendencies have you observed among 
teachers ? 
6. What activities of teachers indicate the presence of profes- 
sionalism among them? 
7. To what extent do the conditions which Bonner describes 
interfere with the development of worthy professionalism among 
teachers? 
8. What is a salary scale? 
9. What relation has a salary scale to professionalism among 
teachers. 
1o. What relation has tenure of position to professionalism among 
teachers ? 
11. How can such formulations of ethical standards as those of 
Ettinger and Wilson be made vital to teachers? 
12. Test the principles at the end of this chapter in the light of 
the readings.

  CHAPTER V 
Tue EQUIPMENT OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
The personal characteristics of teachers. One way of dis- 
covering the desirable and undesirable characteristics of teachers 
consists of obtaining their pupils’ opinions about them. This 
method has been followed by several investigators. The North 
Central Association employed this method in obtaining the data 
shown in Tables III and IV. 
“To the request, List three of the elements of strength pos- 
sessed by your best teacher, 13,825 replies were made: to a 
similar request for the three outstanding elements of weakness 
possessed by your poorest teacher only 9,454 answers were given. 
These facts would seem to argue that fewer pupils are sensitive 
to faults than are conscious of virtues; or that there are so many 
more excellent teachers than weak teachers that many pupils do 
not even know the qualities that constitute notable weakness.” * 
The value of such judgments when obtained with care is shown 
by Knight ? who compared pupils’ general estimates of the rela- 
tive merits of teachers with supervisors’ ratings of the same 
teachers. He obtained such estimates of 39 teachers from 240 
carefully selected pupils of high-school grades. When these 
estimates were compared with supervisors’ ratings, a correlation 
of .743—a “high” correlation—was found. 
Another way of discovering the desirable qualities of teachers

consists of asking supervisors to name the causes of failure and 
success among teachers. By employing this method, several in- 
| vestigators ° have found that superintendents regard the following 
characteristics as danger signals: 
Poor discipline Failure to cooperate 
Weak personality Disloyalty 
Lack of judgment Poor methods of instruction 
Unprofessional attitude 
In the same way the following qualities have been found to 
accompany successful teaching.® 
Kindness Sincerity Ability to discipline 
Patience Strength of personality Fairness 
Enthusiasm Dignity Loyalty 
There are, of course, constant sources of error in the estimates 
of the success of teachers by their supervisors. Supervisors often 
know too little of their teachers to judge them accurately; be- 
sides, supervisors’ judgments are probably fallible even when 
they know intimately the work of their teachers. 
Great difficulty is encountered when an attempt is made to 
discover precisely the relation between the presence of certain 
characteristics and successful high-school teaching. Investiga- 
tions conducted for this purpose by Knight,’ Whitney,® and 
Bliss ® deal mainly with elementary school teachers. All three 
employed intelligence tests to measure the keenness and alertness

of the teachers included in their investigations. As compared 
with his correlations between success in teaching and such quali- 
ties as grades in professional courses and in student-teaching, 
Whitney’s correlations between success in teaching and intelli- 
gence test scores are very low. While this does not indicate that 
persons of little wit ordinarily become superior teachers, it does 
indicate that within the range of abilities of the 1,200 teachers 
investigated there were found qualities which are more important 
than those differences in sheer intellect. Pliss, however, con- 
cluded that the chances for intellectually superior individuals 
becoming superior teachers are about twice as great as for average 
individuals, and about four-and-one-half times as great as for 
mentally inferior normal-school students. Knight who investi- 
gated both elementary and high-school teachers found a closer 
relation between intelligence and successful teaching in the case 
of the thirty-eight high-school teachers whom he investigated 
than in the case of the one-hundred twenty-eight elementary 
school teachers’ records which he also investigated. Professional 
equipment as measured either by courses pursued or by a test of 
professional knowledge seems to possess a close relation to suc- 
cessful teaching. Whitney found standings in professional 
courses and tests to be more reliable as indices of success in 
teaching than standings in academic courses. A partial cor- 
roboration of this result is found in the records of 119 University 
of Wisconsin graduates of whom 31 had pursued an unusually 
large number of professional courses. The degrees of success 
achieved in teaching by all the 119 graduates as judged by their 
supervisors, were considerably higher than faculty ratings led 
one to expect. The faculty tendency to under-rate the grad- 
uates who had pursued professional courses most extensively 
was, however, twenty-one per cent greater than the tendency 
to under-rate the other graduates. Another quality which is 
closely related to successful teaching is interest in teaching. 
Although Knight did not attempt to measure interest directly, 
he concludes that vital, substantial interest probably prompts 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
certain persons to master the difficulties of teaching and thus 
become successful teachers, 
The conclusions of these investigators are that intelligence as 
measured by tests, interest in teaching, professional equipment 
as indicated by scholarship in courses pursued and tests of pro- 
fessional knowledge, and the quality of academic preparation 
are among the most important, if, indeed, they are not the most 
important guaranties of success in teaching. 
For the benefit of the large army of young men and women 
who desire to begin teaching each year, several additional ob- 
servations can be made. First, within the limits of ages and 
amounts of experience of high-school teachers who have taught 
two or more years, there is only a slight positive correlation 
between either age or experience and success in teaching. Some 
of the reasons for this condition appear in the following passage 
entitled, “Old and Young Teachers.” Second, a significant cor- 
relation exists between success in teaching and professional study 
after beginning to teach. Third, legibility of handwriting is no 
index of success in teaching. With regard to the last comforting 
observation, there should be added, however, Dr. Knight’s state- 
ment that nearly all the teachers were “Palmer handwriting cer- 
tificate holders.” Finally, it should be observed that any person 
who is intelligent enough to teach in a high school can improve 
himself in practically all the desirable personal qualities which 
have been mentioned or are yet to be catalogued in the Landsittel 
rating card.

children or young people? 
VI. Nature provides that parents of 25-35 more easily adjust 
to younger children than those of 40-50 years. Can older 
teachers fit more readily the nature and needs of older children, 
and vice versa, irrespective of increased mental attainment? 
VII. Mere age and years bring a unique psychic develop- 
ment apart from increase in learning. Does this tend to qualify 
or disqualify schoolwork with any age or grade of childhood, or 
is there a “teaching age”? 
VIII. Describe as fully as you can a typical male or female 
teacher of mature years who has steadily grown in knowledge 
and power. 
IX. Describe a typical teacher of mature age who has long 
since ceased to grow, but has become stereotyped in opinion and 
method, prejudiced, and neophobiac, and illustrate the bad effect 
of teaching. 
X. List a few suggestions to aid teachers in conserving the 
period of rapid growth and in avoiding the evil of monotony, 
repetition, routine and mechanism. 
The returns were carefully tabulated by Miss Louise Gulick, 
a fact which has largely made this paper possible. One normal 
school furnished a great part of the replies—about eighty papers 
—to questions I, VIII, and IX. 
Two hundred thirty-one answers were received to question 
number I, “State characteristic differences between very young 
and very old teachers of any grade from kindergarten to uni- 
versity.” The positive arid negative qualities mentioned may 
be tabulated as shown in Table V.

  EQUIPMENT OF TEACHERS 189 
In spite of the admittedly incomplete data in connection with 
some of the questions, the opinions of the people who replied to 
the questionnaire have certain rather significant trends which 
can be summarized thus: 
I. The most striking differences between very young and 
very old teachers are seen in the predominance of setness of 
method, fixedness of opinion, and resentment of suggestions for 
improvement on the part of the very old teachers. The charac- 
teristic strength of the very young teachers lies in dispositional 
qualities, and the weakness in mental traits, while the very old 
teachers’ positive qualities are mental, and the negative ones are 
dispositional. 
II. There should be age-limits for teachers. Eighteen or 
twenty years is the lower limit, and sixty years the favorite 
upper limit, if any. 
III. The health and the temper suffer more from continuous 
teaching in the case of women than of men, but, both are about 
equally liable to lose elasticity and open-mindedness. 
IV. Negative psychic idiosyncrasies, especially, tend to a de- 
cided increase with age, mental and dispositional traits being 
about on a par; there is also a marked increase of negative phy- 
sical qualities. Old teachers are not invested with so 
preponderantly many negative qualities as are old people in 
general. 
V. Older teachers tend to lose contact and sympathy with chil- 
dren and young people, but fit more readily the nature and needs 
of older children. 
VI. Teachers who grow in power and knowledge with con- 
tinuous service are endowed with or acquire positive dispositional 
qualities, while those who cease to grow possess a superabundance 
of negative dispositional qualities. 
VII. Positive dispositional traits—especially of a social kind 
—are an even greater factor in the conservation of the period 
of most rapid growth of the teacher than are professional inter- 
ests and activities outside of the classroom, which are rated, 
however, as very important. 
VIII. In general, dispositional qualities—both good and bad 
—are much more impressive than any other traits in a teacher. 
The emphasis on dispositional qualities in the foregoing data 
would seem to imply that by virtue of his overwhelmingly nega-. 
tive dispositional qualities the very old teacher should be dis-
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pensed with; but Book** made a finding which is pertinent 
here. He writes: 
“Again, the favorite teacher was described as enthusiastic, 
energetic, young. . . . In fact most pupils think that only 
young teachers are capable of understanding them... . 
Old teachers are, as a rule, disliked. 
“This qualification was emphasized in still another way. 
Many pupils suggesting improvements for the High School 
strongly urged the getting rid of all old teachers and re- 
placing them by young teachers who were strictly up-to-date, 
interested in their work, and thoroughly in sympathy with 
their pupils. 
“It should be stated, however, that the pupils did not 
mean by old and young a mere age distinction in the or- 
dinary sense. According to them some teachers have never 
been young, others never get old. Being young, in the 
students’ own words, means to be enthusiastic, full of life, 
up-to-date, thoroughly in sympathy with young people and 
their ways. . . . To be old is to be cranky, pedantic, old- 
maidish, behind the times, out of touch with the young, 
impatient, cross, to become indifferent, suspicious, didactic, 
set in one’s ways; more and more the creature of habit, and 
the slave to one’s yesterdays, to lose interest in one’s work, 
and finally to reach a sort of static condition where one 
ceases to grow, and gets fat. The teacher who was described 
as quite an old lady, but at heart as young as any girl in 
her class, who was up-to-date in her teaching and knew just 
how a girl studies her lessons, her ideas about clothes and 
all her likes and dislikes, was young in the sense the pupils 
used the word, although she had taught in that school for 
over thirty years.” 
Thus the very old teacher who has the positive qualities men- 
tioned would never be accused of being old. The spirit, not the 
years seems to be the measure of age. 
The fundamental point for pedagogy, then, is that age in dis- 
position is what counts for the teacher. Just so long as he 
retains certain dispositional qualities, the older teacher is the 
superior of the younger teacher, by virtue of his wider experi-

THE TRAINING REQUIRED OF SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS 
IN AMERICA”

Pennsylvania 
State requirements. The prospective teacher of mathe- 
matics ina high school of this state must obtain either 
a “college provisional certificate” or a “college permanent 
certificate.” The first of these certificates entitles the holder 
to teach for three years the subjects prescribed for a 
public high school of the third class or to teach in any pub- 
lic high school of the commonwealth the subjects indicated on its 
face. The applicant for this certificate must be a graduate of 
an approved college or university and must have successfully 
completed at least 200 hours of work of college grade in educa- 
tion. Each subject mentioned on the face of the certificate is 
one in which the candidate has had in college at least twelve 
semester hours including professional training in the teaching of 
the subject. An applicant for a “permanent college certificate” 
must not only have met the same scholastic requirements as 
above, but also must have taught successfully for three years 
in the public schools of Pennsylvania. Evidence of successful ex- 
perience includes reports on: (a) Personality (appearance, voice, 
power, character, cooperation); (b) preparation (command of 
English, specific knowledge, general scholarship, professional 
equipment); (c) technique (room conditions, selection and or- 
ganization of subject matter, resourcefulness, motivation, con- 
clusiveness); and (d) pupil reaction (efficient functioning of 
habits and skills, command of subject matter, thinking ability, 
expression, tastes, appreciations and ideals). 
After September 1, 1927, no person may be employed in any 
school in the state who does not show graduation from an ap- 
proved college or university, or an approved state normal school, 
or who does not furnish evidence of equivalent education. (Pro- 
“Jn 1923 The National Committee on Mathematical Requirements sub- 
mitted a comprehensive report upon certification requirements of high school 
teachers. The following account is an abridgment of that report, pages

vision was made, in 1921, for summer courses of nine weeks each 
in the thirteen state normal schools and in twelve of the colleges 
and universities of the state to enable those now in the service to 
obtain such further education and training as may be required 
to meet the standards set for 1927.) 
In Philadelphia, a candidate as teacher of mathematics in a 
high school must pass examinations as follows: (a) Oral; (b) on 
methods of teaching and management; (c) on algebra, plane and 
solid geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, analytic 
geometry, and calculus. The names of those who receive an aver- 
age of 70 per cent or over are placed on the eligible list. To 
have been admitted to the examinations, the candidate must have 
presented proof of graduation from an approved college, or of 
equivalent education.1* 
Cambridge, Mass, 
To be eligible for examination and to be rated in experi- 
ence, an applicant for a high school certificate must 
have: (a) A degree from an approved college or university, with 
evidence of professional training, or conclusive evidence of spe- 
cial fitness; and (b) three years of successful experience, for 
non-residents, in teaching high school studies; two years, for 
residents. 
The Board of Examiners holds examinations annually. Appli- 
cants for teachers’ certificates are rated by the Board under three 
heads: scholarship, experience, and personal fitness. In order 
to secure a certificate an applicant must be rated 75 per cent or 
higher in each of these. A rating in scholarship is obtained in one 
of the following ways: (a) By averaging the marks if the appli- 
cant is required to take a written examination; (b) in case the 
applicant is not required to take a written examination, by aver- 
aging the marks received at college, university, certified techni- 
cal high school, state normal school or Boston normal school, or 
the marks given in a teacher’s certificate granted by the Board 
of Examiners of any city or any state in the United States and 
which may be accepted by the Board of Examiners of Cambridge. 
Rating in personal fitness is determined after an oral examination 
of the applicant and the consideration of the evidence relative

State requirements. Official documents state that every 
teacher (including the principal) in a recognized high school 
ought to have an educational preparation equivalent to: (a) Com- 
pletion of a four-year high school course; and (b) completion of 
at least two years beyond a high school course in a higher insti- 
tution of learning (normal school, or college, or university). The 
principal of any recognized high school must hold either a high 
school certificate, or a supervisory certificate, or a first grade 
certificate endorsed for high school work by the county superin- 
tendent. Second grade elementary certificates when endorsed by 
the county superintendent are made valid by the law for teaching 
in the ninth and tenth grades, but such a certificate is not deemed 
suitable for a teacher in a recognized high school. 
A county supervisory certificate, valid for three years for teach- 
ing and supervising, cannot be granted without an examination in 
English, educational psychology, history of education, and school 
administration. Two classes of applicants may be admitted to 
this examination: (a) Those who have completed the two-year 
course of a recognized normal school and have taught or super- 
vised successfully for two years; (b) those who have completed 
two years of work in a recognized higher institution, one of which 
is in a normal school or an equivalent preparation, and who have 
taught or supervised successfully for two years. 
A state four-year supervisory certificate is valid for teaching 
and supervising in all grades of the state. The requirements of 
this certificate are: (a) Graduation from a recognized high school 
and from a recognized normal school, or an equivalent prepara- 
tion; (b) three years of successful supervision, two of which 
shall have been in the state of Illinois on a county supervisory 
certificate; (c) a successful examination in English, educational 
psychology, sociology, history of education, and school manage- 
ment, administration and supervision; (d) the preparation of a 
thesis on one or more problems of school administration, the sub- 
ject or subjects of which shall be selected from a list prescribed 
by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

194 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
To be admitted to the examination for a county high school 
certificate, valid for three years, an applicant must present cre- 
dentials showing the completion of two years of successful work 
in a recognized higher institution with the following credits: 
English (6 semester hours), educational psychology (3 hours), 
principles and methods of teaching—pedagogy (3 hours), and 
electives (48 hours). The applicant must pass an examination 
in English and pedagogy, and in six high school subjects, three 
majors and three minors, chosen as follows—one subject from 
each of the groups: (i) mathematics; (ii) history; (iii) science; 
(iv) language or literature; and two other subjects chosen from 
the list of high school subjects. This county certificate is granted 
without examination to those who have presented the following 
certificates: (a) Graduation from a recognized college; (b) fac- 
ulty recommendation of ability to teach in the high school; 
(c) credits for English (8 semester hours), Education (6 hours), 
three majors of not less than 16 semester hours each in three 
high school subjects or group of related subjects; (d) Electives 
sufficient to make up the remaining number of 120 semester hours 
required for graduation. 
The requirements for the state four year high school certificate, 
valid for teaching and supervising in any high school, and in the 
seventh and eighth grades of any district in the state, are: 
(a) Graduation from a recognized college or university, or the 
completion of an equivalent preparation; (b) three years of suc- 
cessful teaching, two of which shall have been in the state on a 
first grade, a high school or a supervisory county certificate; 
(c) a successful examination in English, educational psychology, 
and the principles and methods of teaching; and (d) the prep- 
aration of a thesis on one or more secondary school problems, 
the subject or subjects of which shall be selected from a list 
prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
To be admitted to the examination for a first grade county 
certificate the applicant must present evidence of graduation from 
a recognized four year high school, or equivalent preparation, and 
six months of successful teaching. The examination is in: Orthog- 
raphy (including spelling), civics, Illinois history, physiology, 
arithmetic, pedagogy, English, algebra, general history, and any 
three of the following natural sciences: botany, zoology, physics, 
chemistry, and physiography. A general average of 80%, 
with a minimum of 60% is required in the examinations. 
The certificate is also issued to a graduate of a recognized normal

school, or of an institution offering an equivalent preparation, 
provided the applicant has had one year of successful practice 
teaching and applies for the certificate within three years after 
graduation. The equivalent of graduation from a recognized 
normal school is attendance of two years in a recognized 
higher institution in which the following credits have been earned: 
English (6 semester hours), mathematics or natural science (6 
hours—educational psychology, history of education, school ad- 
ministration or principles and methods of teaching), practice 
teaching (6 hours), and electives (30 hours). The practice teach- 
ing must be in a training school under competent and close super- 
vision. 
A four-year state elementary school certificate is valid for 
teaching and supervising in the elementary schools and in the 
first and second years of the high school of any district in the 
state. The requirements for the certificate are: (a) Graduation 
from a recognized high school and from a recognized normal 
school, or an equivalent preparation, (b) three years of success- 
ful teaching, two of which shall have been in the state on a first 
grade county certificate; (c) a successful examination in English, 
educational psychology, and the principles and methods of teach- 
ing; (d) the preparation of a thesis on one or more elementary 
school problems, the subject or subjects of which shall be selected 
from a prescribed list. 
For the second grade elementary certificate (county), the appli- 
cant must present evidence of graduation from a recognized 
two-year high school or an equivalent preparation. The appli- 
cant for this certificate is examined in: Orthography, civics, 
Illinois history, physiology, penmanship, reading, grammar, geog- 
raphy, United States history, arithmetic, general science, ped- 
agogy, and the principles and methods of the state course of 
study. A general average of 75%, with a minimum of 60%, 
is required. The second grade certificate may be granted without 
examination to those who have completed the equivalent of the 
first (junior) year’s work in a recognized normal school. The 
equivalent of this work is attendance in a recognized higher in- 
stitution in which the following credits have been earned: Eng- 
lish (6 semester hours), mathematics or natural science (6 hours 
—educational psychology, history of education, school adminis- 
tration, or principles and methods of teaching), and electives 
(6 hours). 
Chicago requirements. There is only one city of over 100,000

inhabitants in the state, namely, Chicago (population 2,701,705). 
No certificate to teach an academic subject in a high school is 
issued to a candidate who has not passed the examinations of the 
Board of Education, conducted with special reference to the 
position sought. The examination in any subject may include 
questions in methods of teaching and may be, in part, oral; if so 
divided the oral examination does not exceed more than 20% 
of the total points required for passing the written examination. 
To be admitted to the examination the candidate must present 
credentials showing: 1 (a) Graduation from an accredited col- 
lege (having a four-year course beyond the regular four-year high 
school course) and (b) two years of successful experience in 
graded schools; or 2 (a) Graduation from an accredited college, 
and (b) completion of the required work in The Chicago Normal 
College, +* and (c) one year of successful experience in graded 
schools. The examination is in one major and three minors. 
When the major is mathematics the minors are English, a pro- 
fessional study, and any language or science minor. When 
physics or chemistry is a major, mathematics or a science may be 
a minor. A general average of 80% must be obtained and no 
subject below 50%; the major subject must count as two-fifths 
in the examination. A general knowledge of the subjects such 
as shall indicate sufficient familiarity to enable the candidate 
to teach them is expected in all minor subjects. In major sub- 
jects it is assumed that the candidate has made a speciality of 
the one selected and a more special and exhaustive test is made. 
The usual college courses, with their expository lectures, added 
to what may be presumed from the candidate’s years of experi- 
ence as an instructor, indicate the ground that may be covered 
in an examination. 
Cleveland, O. A candidate as teacher of mathematics in a 
senior high school must, in general, have had ‘“‘four-years of ap- 
proved education beyond a four-year high school course, or the 
equivalent of a full standard college course.” In making a selec- 
tion among several possible candidates, consideration of compar- 
ative fitness to render the best service shall determine each case 
of first appointment. The first three years of service are strictly 
probationary. Reappointment is based not only on success al- 
ready achieved, but also on evidence of growth warranting the

expectation of service commensurate with any automatic increases 
in salary provided by the schedule. 
Detroit, Mich. Every candidate as teacher of an academic 
subject in a high school must have had: (a) The equivalent of 
a bachelor’s course, with a good record, in a four-year college 
or university; (b) rz semester hours in education; (c) one year 
of successful experience in teaching. No attempt has been made 
yet to designate the distribution of the eleven hours of education. 
Some members of the Board of Education believe that these 
hours should be spread over: Educational psychology, tests and 
measurements, philosophy, history and administration of edu- 
cation. 
Kansas City, Mo. According to printed regulations, high 
school certificates may be granted on the basis of approved cre- 
dentials, or examinations. In the latter case the prospective 
teacher of mathematics must pass in the following subjects, and 
also in one science as a minor: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, 
and analytics. Approved credentials call for graduation from a 
college or university approved by the Superintendent as having 
courses required for graduation equivalent to those in the Uni- 
versity of Missouri, and satisfactory evidence of two years of 
successful teaching experience under approved conditions. In 
the absence of courses especially fitting the candidate for the 
work for which he applies, or in case these courses seem inade- 
quate, he must write a thesis upon, or take an examination on, 
any subject special or general, that may be required by the 
superintendent of the examining board. 
Minneapolis, Minn. In order that a candidate be eligible as 
a senior high school teacher he must be a graduate of a four- 
year collegiate course of the grade furnished by the University 
of Minnesota, and have made special and adequate study of the 
subject or subjects to be taught. Further the candidate must 
have had two years of successful experience in teaching under 
approved conditions. Such experience must have been gained 
either in the Minneapolis public schools or in schools of a grade 
corresponding to that of the Minneapolis high schools. Excess 
of one type of qualification—whether of education or of experi- 
ence—beyond the minimum requirement, will not be accepted 
as a substitute for the lack of the minimum qualification of the 
other type. 
Omaha, Nebraska. The prospective teacher of mathematics in 
a high school must be a college graduate who specialized in

mathematics at least to the extent of taking courses through a 
course in analytic geometry, and preferably through a course in 
calculus also. The teacher must also have had some training in 
the pedagogy of mathematics. Omaha does not require state 
certification of its candidates as teachers.

(Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia) 
Of these states the District of Columbia has been selected as 
exhibiting the highest standards of the Division in connection with 
the appointment of its high school teachers of mathematics. To 
indicate another standard, notes on certification in Virginia are 
culled from a recent survey report. Of the six cities in the di- 
vision, with more than 100,000 inhabitants, it seemed desirable to 
give a brief sketch of the organization in Atlanta, Ga., in addi-

made by The Johns Hopkins University, by the University of 
North Carolina, and by the University of West Virginia, are

District of Gobet requirements. The city of Washington 
is coterminous with the District of Columbia. According to reg- 
ulations of 1906, no person without a degree from an accredited 
college, or a peretion certificate from an accredited normal 
school, such normal school graduate having had at least five 
years of experience as a teacher in a high school, is allowed to 
teach any academic subject in a high school. No such teacher is 
appointed until he has passed an examination prescribed by the 
Board of Examiners. This examination is both written and oral. 
The written examination for the prospective teacher in mathema- 
tics is on mathematics as a major and on two minors. For the 
major the ‘lebr, is in the following subjects: Elementary   
  and college algebra, plane and solid geometry, plane trigonometry, 
elements of conic sections, elements of differential and integral 
calculus. The prescribed minors are in: (a) English; and 
(b) psychology and pedagogy (which includes (i) history of edu- 
cation, (ii) principles of education, and (iii) practical methods of 
application of these principles). The purpose of the English 
minor is to test the applicant’s ability to use the English language, 
and includes a Tv of about three hundred words to be writ-

ten in good, clear idiomatic English on a subject to be designated 
by the Board of Examiners at the time of the examination. 
The oral examination is prescribed to enable the examiners to 
estimate the applicant’s general personal fitness for the position 
as a teacher, and involves considerations of knowledge, culture, 
education, experience, resourcefulness, record as a student and 
teacher, etc. 
The entire examination must be taken at one time. Of a total 
roo credits, 60 and 4o are respectively assigned to the written 
and oral examinations. The oral examination of a candidate is 
not held unless he makes at least 70% in his major and at 
least 40 out of the 60 credits in his written examination. The 
examination in its entirety is not considered unless the applicant 
makes at least 70% in: (a) Written and oral English; (b) rec- 
ord as a teacher; (c) personality. The names of those who 
attain to a final total of at least 70% are placed on an eligible 
list, arranged according to rank, from which appointments are 
made in order of their rank as vacancies occur in the position 
for which the candidates have respectively qualified. Any name 
placed upon the eligible list remains on the list without further 
examination for a period of two years. 
Licenses to teach are issued for a period of two years. No 
one is licensed unless he passes a physical examination conducted 
by a physician authorized by the health officer of the District 
of Columbia. 
Certification in Virginia 
Virginia issued thirty-six separate varieties of certificates to 
teachers before 1918, when the number was reduced to seven. 1° 
Three of these have interest for us: (a) Collegiate Professional 
Certificate; (b) Collegiate Certificate; and (c) Normal Profes- 
sional Certificate. 
The collegiate professional certificate is the highest grade of 
certificate provided, and is issued to graduates of a standard 
four-year college, university, or normal school, whose college 
work has included fifteen per cent, or nine session hours, devoted 
to purely professional study and practice teaching. It is a

no requirement for professional study and practice. Its holder

five years instead of ten, and renewable for ten if, in the mean- 
time, the holder has met the requirement for professional study 
and practice teaching. 
The normal professional certificate is issued to graduates of 
the two-year professional course in a standard normal school 
based on the completion of a standard four-year high school 
course. It qualifies the holder to teach any grade or grades in 
the elementary school, and, if a graduate of the two-year course 
offered at Virginia state normal schools for the special training 
of high school teachers, the holder may receive a special certifi- 
cate permitting him to teach any or all subjects in the first two 
years of the high school course. The normal professional certifi- 
cate is valid for ten years and renewable for a similar period 
from time to time. 
A “local permit” may also be issued by a division superintend- 
ent on his written request to employ a person who does not hold a 
state teacher’s certificate. It may be terminated at the pleasure 
of the division superintendent, and in no case is it valid for a pe- 
riod lasting longer than the last day of June following its date 
of issue. 
Atlanta, Ga. 
According to Rules of the Board of Education in 
1920, high school teachers are here grouped as: (1) Principal, 
(2) Assistant principal, (3) Heads of departments, (4) Honor 
group of associates, (5) Associates. To qualify as an associate a 
candidate must have: (a) A baccalaureate degree from a stand- 
ard college; (b) equivalent of 11 semester hours in education; 
(c) three years of successful experience in junior or senior high 
schools. Those in the honor group of associates must have: (a) A 
superior degree from a standard university; or (b) six summers 
of certified work in at least two subjects per summer in a stand- 
ard school; or (c) unusual skill, activity, and power in teaching 
as shown by marked and notable results. This type of teacher 
without the qualification of (a) or (b) would not be considered 
   
-P-A-G-E-213
  EQUIPMENT OF TEACHERS 201 
for the honor group until the end of the third year in the Atlanta 
system. Excellent teaching must be an accompaniment of (a) 
and (b). Heads of departments are recommended by the prin- 
cipal and chosen if possible from the honor group of associates. 
Principals must have: (a) Master’s degree from a standard col- 
lege; or (b) long service proving special aptitude for the work 
of principal; (c) special training in supervision and adminis- 
tration. 
SOUTH CENTRAL DIVISION 
(Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Okla- 
homa, Tennessee, Texas) 
In this Division we have selected the state of Kentucky for \ 
special consideration. While here as in other states of the Di- 
vision, the state law requires of its high school teachers only two i 
years of college work after graduation from a four-year high K 
school, the facilities provided for amplifying such training, in the 
case of the prospective teacher of mathematics, seem more highly 
organized. Outside of this state the cities of Birmingham, Ala., 
and Dallas, Texas, appear to have standards as high as those of 
any of the seven other cities in the Division with not less than 
100,000 inhabitants each. 
Kentucky 
State requirements. The candidate as teacher in a high school 
must give satisfactory evidence of scholarship equivalent to gradu- 
ation from a four-year standard high school and, in addition 
thereto, the equivalent of two years’ work in college or normal 
school, a part of which should be in professional or pedagogic 
subjects. Exceptions to this requirement may be made with those 
who teach and supervise in second and third class high schools *° 
when one year in college or normal school in addition to high 
school graduation may be accepted as satisfactory, temporarily. 
A candidate may also become a teacher in a high school on 
the basis of a special high school certificate obtained by ex- 
amination in English, mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, and 
geometry), United States history, civil government, and pedagogy. 
*°Second class high schools are those maintaining a three-year course; 
third-class, those maintaining a two-year course.

202 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Many school boards (including those of nearly all the classi- 
fied cities and towns of the state) require that the candidate as 
teacher in a high school shall have graduated from a college or 
university requiring a four-year high school course for entrance, 
and offering a four-year course for graduation, and a certain 
amount of theoretical professional training. Such a candidate 
must hold one of the following four certificates entitling him, 
without examination, to teach in any public school of the state: 
(i) Elementary Teacher's Certificate (good for two years); 
(ii) Intermediate Certificate (good for four years); (iii) Ad- 
vanced Certificate (good for three years); and (iv) Life Certifi- 
cate. It is stated that the holder of each of these certificates must 
have been a graduate of a college or university, as indicated 
above.17 The first of these certificates, which may be granted on 
the completion of one year of study in the department of educa- 
tion of the state university, for example, calls for courses equiva- 
lent to not less than three year-hours in extent and including 
instruction in history of education, principles of education, prin- 
ciples of pedagogy, and special study of secondary education. 
The second certificate, granted after two years of study in a de- 
partment of education, requires the student to have taken an 
equivalent of not less than six year-hours in educational subjects 
including special study of secondary education, educational 
psychology, history of education, methods in education, and high 
school administration. One-fourth of this work may be offered in 
practice teaching under the direction of an experienced super- 
visor. The third certificate is granted after three years of work 
in professional and pedagogic subjects equivalent to twelve year- 
hours (one-third for principles of education, one-third for his- 
tory of education, and one-third for secondary education). At 
the end of three years a Life Certificate may be substituted for 
an Advanced Certificate, on the presentation of satisfactory evi- 
dence of his teaching ability and moral character. 
A candidate as teacher of mathematics in high schools of 
Louisville must have at least an A.B. degree, and one year of 
successful teaching experience—not necessarily in mathematics. 
Further, the candidate must have had mathematics as either a 
major or a minor subject while taking the A.B. course. 
* This statement is on the authority of Kentucky Department of Educa- 
tion, Rules and Regulations, June, 1916, p. 1. It seems to be contradicted 
by state normal school catalogues (see later).

Birmingham, Ala. 
An applicant for a position as head of a department 
of mathematics in a high school must be qualified as follows: 
(a) He must be a graduate of a standard college or university, 
“which requires for admission the equivalent of a good high school 
course”; (b) he must present evidence that he has had two years 
of graduate work in a university, with mathematics as a major 
topic. In lieu of graduate work, experience of not Jess than three 
years in teaching the subject, together with summer work at 
a university, may be accepted. 
To qualify for the position of Instructor in a mathematics de- 
partment the applicant must be a graduate of a standard college 
or university with two years of teaching experience subsequent to 
graduation. 
Dallas, Texas 
A candidate as teacher of mathematics in a high school is 
required to be a “graduate of a standard college, and to 
have had two years of successful experience as a teacher.”’ There 
is no fixed requirement as to the amount or kind of previous 
mathematical study or professional training. 
WESTERN DIVISION 
(Arizona, California, Colorado, Idako, Montana, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Utah, Washington, Wyoming) 
In this Division we select for consideration the state of Cali- 
fornia, which is, on the whole, notably higher in its standards for 
the preparation of teachers for high schools than any other 
state of the Division. Outside of this state the city of Portland, 
Oregon, seems to have standards as high as those of any of the 
four cities of not less than 100,000 inhabitants. 
California 
State requirements. A candidate for a certificate to teach in 
a high school (a) must have received 1* a bachelor’s degree from a 
standard college requiring not less than eight years of high school 
and college training; (b) must have submitted evidence that in

204 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
addition to the academic and professional courses required for 
the bachelor’s degree, he has completed at least one year of 
graduate study, 26 units (semester hours), doing full regular 
work, though not necessarily a candidate for a degree, in an 
approved teacher training institution. Such graduate study shall 
include at least one full year course of advanced or graduate work 
in at least one of the subjects taught in the high school. (c) He 
must also submit evidence that he has completed in undergradu- 
ate or graduate standing, or the two combined, not less than 
fifteen units of work, in courses listed in the department of edu- 
cation in the institution in which the graduate work is completed, 
or courses in other departments of that or other institutions 
accepted as preparation for teaching by the department of edu- 
cation. 
The required fifteen units of work in the department of 
education must include the following courses: (i) School and 
classroom management, or equivalent work (1 unit, minimum); 
(ii) work in actual practice teaching, with conferences (4 units, 
minimum); (iii) a teacher’s course in at least one subject in 
which the candidate expects to be recommended for certifica- 
tion, if such course be given in the institution and be accepted 
as or listed under, the work in education (3 units, maximum, for 
all such courses); (iv) a course in secondary education, present- 
ing particularly the purpose and attainable goals of high school 
work (2 units, minimum); (v) such other courses relating to the 
theory, function and administration of education, as are nec- 
essary to complete the required 15 units. 
It is required that the practice teaching shall be done under 
the general supervision of the department of education of the 
college or university in which the year of graduate work is taken, 
and may be done in schools of elementary or secondary grade, 
although preferably in secondary school work of the kind the 
candidate is preparing to teach, and under the direction of com- 
petent instructors in such work. The work in practice teaching 
may also be done in connection with the training school of any 
California state normal school, of which there are six (at Chico, 
Fresno, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Santa Barbara). 
When the graduate work required for the recommendation for 
the high school certificate is completed to the satisfaction of the 
department of education of the institution in which such work 
is done, the accredited school or college or department of edu- 
cation prepares a formal recommendation to county, or city and
-P-A-G-E-217
EQUIPMENT OF TEACHERS 205 
county, boards of education, stating that the candidate has satis- 
factorily completed all the requirements established by the State 
Board of Education for recommendations for the high school 
certificate in California, and that, in the judgment of the school 
or college or department of education issuing the recommenda- 
tion, the candidate is worthy to receive a high school certificate 
in any county, or city and county, of the state. 
Each recommendation states on its face the major and minor 
subjects which the holder thereof has taken in the institution 
or the kind of work the candidate is qualified to do. 
In connection with the above statement of what at first may 
seem to be very high standards, it should be borne in mind that 
the law does not require that the teacher shall teach either his 
major or his minor subjects. This is entirely a matter for local 
authorities to determine. At present there is in the state an 
insufficient supply of well-trained teachers. 
Portland, Oregon 
In Oregon, one-year state certificates may be issued upon ap- 
plication, to any graduate of a standard college or university 
(that is, such as is standardized by the Bureau of Education, 
Washington, D. C.). The holder of a one-year state certificate 
may, after six months of successful teaching experience in the 
state, and upon recommendation of the county superintendent 
of the county in which the applicant last taught, receive a five- 
year state certificate. The holder of a five-year state certificate 
may, after thirty months of successful teaching experience in this 
state and upon the recommendation of the county superintendent 
of the county in which the applicant last taught, receive a state 
life certificate. Each of these certificates entitles the holder to 
teach in any high school of the state. Into the question of others 
who may also teach in high schools, we shall not enter. 
In Portland all applicants for positions in the high schools are 
required to have at least two years of teaching experience. The 
teachers are not appointed on the competitive examination plan 
employed by many cities; they are elected by the Board of Edu- 
cation upon the recommendation of the Board of Superintendents. 
Prospective teachers of mathematics are not required to present 
credentials differing from those of prospective teachers in other 
subjects. The following “good rule of action” recommended by
-P-A-G-E-218

Professor Cubberley ** is thus disregarded: candidates as teachers 
in city high schools should be graduates from a college or uni- 
versity of standing, and furnish evidence of special preparation 
for the particular work done. 
A typical secondary school teacher. During the school year 
Ig21-1922, Professor Davis conducted an investigation of the 
training, experience, salaries, and educational judgments of the 
high-school teachers of the North Central high schools.2° In sum- 
marizing the portion of the report which pertains to academic 
teachers, Davis says: 
The typical academic teacher of the North Central accredited 
high schools is represented thus: He (or she) is an unmarried 
individual, between twenty-six and forty years of age, who began 
teaching shortly after reaching the twentieth birthday, and who 
expects to continue permanently in the teaching profession. This 
individual was educated in the public elementary schools, then 
spent four years in a public high school which enrolled about 100 
pupils, graduated from the classical curriculum of that school, 
spent four years either in a State University or a denominational 
or endowed university or college, where he pursued (among other 
studies) one major and two minor subjects. To both the major 
and the first minor subjects he devoted over 25 semester hours 
and to the second minor subject in excess of ten semester hours. 
While in college this typical individual also pursued a teachers’ 
course offered in the department of his major or minor interest, 
carried approximately 15 semester hours in the theoretical and 
practical courses in Education, had in the neighborhood of 20 
supervised class observations of expert teaching in elementary or 
high school subjects, and observed work in two or three depart-

tion Teachers. Proceedings of the North Central Association, XXVII, 
Part I, 24-54. 1922. In this investigation 15,881 teachers responded to 
questionnaires distributed and collected by their own principals. Of these 
teachers, 5,203 were men.

ments of instruction given by three or more teachers. No practice 
teaching, however, was afforded this mythical individual. He has, 
however, within the last three years pursued post-graduate courses 
in the university or college, either during the regular year or in 
the summer school. 
Furthermore, this typical individual has been teaching in the 
public schools for something over five years, although he has oc- 
cupied his present position for only about three years. He has 
already had at least three removes, and has taught in at least 
two (and probably three) high schools. He is teaching in but 
a single department of work, and that is the one for which he 
specifically prepared himself in college. He has five class reci- 
tation periods per day, instructs from 100 to 125 pupils per day, 
and draws public money by virtue of the fact that he holds a 
university or college teacher’s certificate valid for life. 
The present salary of the typical individual, if a man, is be- 
tween $2,001 or $2,500, and if a women, between $1,501 and 
$2,000. On this salary the individual is enabled to meet all 
legitimate expenses and to place in a saving account from ro per 
cent to 20 per cent of what he receives. During the past two 
years, he has added to his salary a sum considerably larger than 
$200, and, if he were teaching in 1914-15, his present salary as 
compared with what he then received is larger by from 75 per 
cent to considerably more than 100 per cent. 
This typical individual as he looks back over his work in 
Education in college has a very high regard for the courses in 
Principles or Methods of Teaching and for Educational Psy- 
chology. He holds a tempered view with respect to work in 
Principles of Education, Educational Sociology, and Educational 
Administration. For courses in the History of Education, Tests 
and Measurements, and Vocational and Industrial Education he 
has a mild contempt, accepting them but not being very 
enthusiastic about them. 
On the other hand, this typical North Central teacher appears 
to believe that teacher’s training schools may very wisely give 
more attention to courses dealing with Practice Teaching, Obser- 
vation of superior teaching, and more practical Methods Courses. 
He also regrets that he did not secure a broader cultural educa- 
tion, did not delve more deeply in his field of specialization, and 
did not have more work relating to public speaking and com- 
munity life. 
Furthermore, this typical teacher believes that the quickest and
-P-A-G-E-220
    208 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
best road to great improvement while in service is by means of 
- Summer Schools, Private Reading, Travel, Better Supervision, 
Teachers’ Meetings, and particularly by lightening the teacher’s 
loads and paying sufficiently large salaries to permit teachers to 
take advantage of opportunities for self-development.

Current principles regarding equipment of secondary school 
teachers. Pupils and supervisors agree fairly closely upon the 
personal characteristics of weak and strong teachers. 
Neither excellent personal equipment nor excellent academic 
equipment is a guaranty of success in teaching. Teaching power 
is both native and acquired and must be applied in order to 
attain success. 
Academic and professional equipment constitute a more re- 
liable index of success in teaching than does personal equipment. 
Superior high-school teachers have a high rating in intelligence, 
personal characteristics, and academic and professional equip- 
ment. 
Any person who is intelligent enough to teach can improve 
himself in practically all the desirable characteristics of superior 
teachers.
-P-A-G-E-223
EQUIPMENT OF TEACHERS 211 
The characteristic strength of very young teachers is in dis- 
positional traits, while the characteristic strength of very old 
teachers is mental. 
The spirit, not the years, is the measure of a teacher’s age. 
So long as he retains certain dispositional qualities, the older 
teacher is the superior of the younger teacher, provided the older 
teacher keeps abreast of the times in academic and professional 
matters. Discussions of age-limits of teachers should recognize 
these considerations. 
Certification regulations are now based upon the personal, 
academic, and professional equipment of candidates. Such regu- 
lations are enforced in cities and states whose supply of candi- 
dates is great enough to admit of discrimination between the 
candidates. The typical teacher in a representative group of good 
schools such as those of the North Central Association conforms 
with these requirements.

SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS 
CHAPTER VI 
° 
Tue Sociat AND Economic CoMPoSITION OF THE 
SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The extent of the popularization of secondary education in 
America. The ideal of universal education has long been cher- 
ished by the American people. As late as the early national 
period, however, certain states. regarded the rudiments of 
elementary subjects as satisfying this ideal and looked forward to 
a dim future when such rudimentary training might be provided.* 
More recent years have pressed the ideal forward so that it now 
signifies to many persons school facilities commensurate with 
mental capacities. At present, therefore, the ideal embraces high- 
school training designed to meet the curricular needs of all 
comers. 
The extent to which the popularizatiorhof this ideal has taken 
place has been indicated in part by the statistics of high-school 
growth in Chapter I. Those statistics show that during the last 
generation, high-school attendance imcreased ten times faster 
than the general population of the country. This enormous in- 
crease does not prove, however, that there is now universality of 
secondary education. So long as only about 50 per cent of Amer- 
ica’s children complete the eighth grade'and only about 12 per 
cent complete the twelfth, much remains to be done before second-

ary education can be said to be universal. The data which are 
assembled in this chapter indicate certain directions in which 
high-school enrollment must increase in order to show a complete 
popularization of secondary education. 
Occupational representation in central western high schools. 
During the year 1923-24 a request was made to Wisconsin 
high-school pupils for certain data including sex, the number of 
semesters already spent in high school, and the occupation of 
parent or guardian. The number and sex of the pupils from 
whom responses were received are shown in Table VI, together 
with the number and sizes of schools attended by these pupils. 
These schools were carefully selected as representative of both 
the geographical and the occupational divisions of Wisconsin. 
Approximately one-fourth of the high-school pupils of the state 
responded to the questionnaire.

cupations, home service was added in order to include cases in 
which only mothers’ home occupation was mentioned. Table VII 
shows the occupational classification of pupils in the high schools 
of Wisconsin together with the corresponding data from Counts’s 
investigation. Discrepancies between the percentages of the two 
investigations can be attributed in part to the fact that Counts’s 
study was based upon the records of pupils from only four cities, 
while the present study is based upon reports from over 100 
schools of both urban and rural localities.

The greater percentage of Wisconsin pupils whose fathers are 
common laborers probably indicates the most significant differ- 
ence between the selective character of schools in the different 
localities represented. Even greater differences exist between 
the percentages of parents engaged in agricultural service. The 
high percentage of agricultural pupils in Wisconsin high schools
-P-A-G-E-229
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 217 
is, of course, due to the fact that many of the smaller schools 
are in localities in which nearly every adult is a farmer. Table 
VIII shows the differences in agricultural representation among 
Wisconsin schools of different sizes. This table indicates also 
certain differences between the representation in high schools of 
the following five groups: proprietor, professional, managerial, 
commercial, and clerical. In small schools, for example, all 
these groups are relatively small except the proprietors. In the 
large schools, however, there is fairly close agreement between the 
percentages for these groups in the Wisconsin schools and in the 
schools investigated by Counts.

Table IX which shows the percentages of pupils in freshman 
and senior years from each parental occupation indicates that 
few large changes take place in Wisconsin high schools as a re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
218 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
sult of the early elimination from high school of pupils of certain 
groups. The changes which take place are, however, in the same 
direction as those reported by Counts and Gaiser.* As Table X 
shows, the percentages for the trades and common labor groups 
decline slightly from Grade IX to Grade XII, while those for the 
group comprising proprietors, etc. increase slightly during the 
same period. In all cases Counts’s data show greater differences 
than the corresponding data for Wisconsin and Washington 
schools. 
Even though certain population groups may send a smaller 
proportion of their children to high schools than others do, the 
data here presented show that a wide range of population groups 
is represented in high schools. In other words, the high school 
appears to draw from practically all social and economic strata. 
Schools in which more than one-half of the pupils are drawn from 
agricultural, trades, and common labor groups cannot be said to 
be schools for the so-called non-labor groups. So far, however, 
the data show only that many occupational groups send many 
pupils to high school; Counts’s discussion of his data will show 
in the next section of this chapter the relation between the num- 
ber of pupils from each population group and the number of men 
engaged in each of those occupations. By showing this ratio, 
Counts is able to show the extent of occupational selection in the 
high school.

cation that goes beyond the period of childhood. Whether of 
birth or of talent, the bar has always been raised. | 
It is true that in the development of secondary education in 
our own country a theoretical departure from this principle has 
| been made or at least attempted. Our succession of secondary 
schools has certainly witnessed a tendency toward democratiza- 
tion. As we have passed from the Latin grammar school through 
| the academy to the free public high school, the curriculum has 
) been broadened, and the number of students in attendance has 
increased. This is particularly true of the high school which, 
for half a century, has been expanding in a manner quite without 
precedent in the history of educational institutions. From 1890 
to 1918, while the total population was increasing from 62,622,- 
250 to approximately 105,253,000, the number of young people 
enrolled in the public high school increased from 202,963 to 
1,645,171. 
This remarkable development has caused some to jump to the 
conclusion that we have abandoned the selective principle in prac- 
tice—that in the United States the public high school is patron- 
ized by all classes without distinction. Thus, in a statement 
issued by the teachers of the Washington Irving High School for 
Girls in New York City in 1911, we find these words: “A public 
high school differs from an elementary school chiefly in the age 
of its children.” Such a statement assumes a -practical aban-   
 
-P-A-G-E-233
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 221 
donment of the selective principle and marks a new era in the 
history of secondary education. 
It is evident, however, after a moment’s reflection, that this 
view completely disregards the facts. At the present time there 
are probably not more than 2,000,000 students enrolled in those 
four years of our educational organization which constitute the 
conventional secondary school. Yet there are approximately 
8,300,000 children of high-school age in the nation. This means 
that only about 25 per cent of the children of high-school age 
are in high school, in spite of the unprecedented growth of sec- 
ondary education in recent years. 
For the purpose of discovering the sources from which the 
high-school population is drawn and the extent to which sec- 
ondary education in the United States is still selective in char- 
acter, the writer during the past two years has been engaged in 
a rather careful study of the high-school population in four cities 
—Bridgeport, Connecticut; Mount Vernon, New York; St. Louis, 
Missouri, and Seattle, Washington. It is the object of this article 
to present the more important findings of this investigation. 
Method of the investigation. In attacking this problem it was 
decided to take a relatively complete census of the high-school 
population in each of several typical American cities. Obviously, 
returns from a single high school drawing its students from a 
single quarter of one of our large cities would not be satisfactory 
because of the well-known tendency of populations of similar so- 
cial and economic standing to gravitate to the same section of 
the city. It was thought desirable to study a community suffi- 
ciently complex to present all the more important groups (ex- 
cept the agricultural) found in modern society, and sufficiently 
large to provide representation of each of the groups adequate 
for statistical purposes. For these reasons, an entire city was 
studied in each case. 
With a few exceptions, a uniform procedure was followed 
throughout in getting the data. All students in attendance on a 
certain day were required to fill out a card on which were ques- 
tions asking for various educational and sociological information, 
the character of which will become clear in the course of this 
presentation. In order to avoid confusion, a set of instructions, 
along with a card filled out for a hypothetical case, was sent to 
each teacher in charge of a home room, by whom the cards were 
to be distributed to the students. In most cases the name of the 
student was not asked for. While a detailed statement and criti-  
-P-A-G-E-234
222 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cism of the method are not possible here, it should be said that, 
in the main, the cards were filled out with care and that there is 
no reason for believing that there was sufficient bias to prejudice 
the results of the study. 
Classification of occupations. Occupation is the central fact 
in the life of the ordinary person. It determines in considerable 
degree his place of residence, his friends and acquaintances, what 
he does and what he thinks, his social and economic status, and 
his outlook on life. The occupation of the father of the high- 
school student has therefore received very large emphasis in 
this investigation. Four or five questions, depending on the city, 
were asked each student concerning the occupation of his father. 
From the returns to those questions it was possible to get a 
relatively reliable and accurate idea of the father’s occupation, 
even though he was not living or not working at the time this 
census was taken. In a few cases information was given for the 
guardian instead of the father, but the facts for the latter were 
used wherever available. 
The first task encountered as soon as the tabulation of the 
data commenced was a classification of occupations significant 
for the purposes of this study. Since no existing classification 
was satisfactory, after some experimentation the following system 
was evolved, recognizing sixteen occupational divisions: 
1. Proprietors—Bankers, druggists, hotel-owners, landlords, 
laundry-owners, lumbermen, manufacturers, merchants, mine- 
owners, publishers, shopkeepers, etc. 
2. Professional service—Architects, artists, clergymen, dentists, 
engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, physicians, surgeons, teachers, 
etc. 
3- Managerial service—Contractors, foremen, managers, offi- 
cials and inspectors (private and public), superintendents, etc. 
4. Commercial service—Agents (real estate and insurance), 
buyers, clerks in stores, commercial travelers, salesmen, etc. 
5. Clerical service—Accountants, bookkeepers, canvassers, 
cashiers, clerks (except in stores), collectors, etc. 
6. Agricultural service—Dairymen, farmers, gardeners, ranch- 
men, etc. 
7. Artisan-proprietors—All artisans who own the shops in 
which they work, including bakers, barbers, blacksmiths, cleaners 
and dyers, cobblers, machinists, milliners, plumbers, printers, 
tailors, tinners, etc,
-P-A-G-E-235
  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 223 
8. Building and related trades—Carpenters, electricians, 
lathers, masons, plasterers, plumbers, etc. 
9. Machine and related trades—Blacksmiths, draftsmen, en- 
gineers (stationary), founders, machinists, molders, pattern- 
makers, tool-makers, etc. 
10. Printing trades—Bookbinders, compositors, electrotypers, 
engravers, linotypers, pressmen, typesetters, etc. 
11. Miscellaneous trades in manufacturing and mechanical in- 
dustries—Bakers, brewers, cobblers, cigar-makers, cutlers, dyers, 
glass-blowers, milliners, platers, tailors, tanners, weavers, etc., 
and machine operatives. 
12. Transportation service—Baggagemen, brakemen, chauf- 
feurs, conductors, engineers (locomotive and marine), longshore- 
men, motormen, sailors, switchmen, etc. 
13. Public service—Detectives, firemen (fire department), 
guards, policemen, sailors, soldiers, watchmen, etc.

Parental occupation and the high-school population. On the 
basis of the foregoing classification of occupations, the students 
in all four years of the high schools in these four cities were 
classified according to the occupation of the father or guardian. 
The gross results of this tabulation are presented in Table XI 
in which appear the number and percentage of students from 
each occupational group. It will be observed that of the 17,265 
cases studied, 3,427, or 19.8 per cent, were classed as proprietors, 
1,629, or 9.4 per cent, as professional workers, etc. There was 
a small number of students in each high school who did not give 
sufficient data to make an occupational classification possible. 
These were all placed in a seventeenth category labeled “occu- 
pation unknown,” and constitute but 3.2 per cent of the total. 
An examination of the table shows that there are very wide 
differences in the representation of the various groups in the high 
school. Some of them, such as the miners, lumber-workers, and 
fishermen, the printing trades, common labor, personal service, 
and public service, are practically without representation. On 
the other hand, as has already been noted, the fathers of almost 
one-fifth of these high-school students are engaged as proprietors. 
Following the proprietors are three other non-labor groups ar- 
ranged in the following order: managerial service, commercial 
service, and professional service. Only two of the labor groups 
may be said to be fairly well represented, the building and machine 
trades. 
But this table by itself is of little significance, for it throws 
practically no light on the question we have raised regarding the 
selective principle in secondary education. Do these percentages 
indicate selection or not? Assuming no selection, should the 
printing trades, common labor, personal service, and public serv- 
ice constitute a larger or smaller proportion of the total high- 
school enrolment? This is a question we are unable to answer 
without knowing something about the representation of these 
different occupations in the general population. 
Comparison with the adult population. In getting occupa- 
tional data for the populations of these four cities it was nec- 
essary to rely on the federal census for 1910, since the last census
-P-A-G-E-237
  
  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 225 
is not yet available. Here we find all persons over ten years of 
age gainfully employed classified according to occupation. But 
it would obviously be fallacious to make a comparison between 
the number of high-school students whose fathers are engaged 
in a particular occupation and the number of persons over ten 
years of age in the general population engaged in that occupa- 
tion because of the well-known fact that certain occupations, 
such as clerical service, are recruited very largely from youthful 
workers. Such occupations will be represented by a compara- 
tively small proportion of men old enough to be fathers of high- 
school students. Since it has been found that the median age 
of such fathers is around forty-eight years, it was decided to 
base the comparison altogether on the number of men over forty- 
five years of age engaged in each occupation in the four cities. 
This was found to be possible by a series of simple calculations, 
starting with the classification of workers according to age in 
certain occupations. The writer would have preferred taking 
forty instead of forty-five years as the lower age limit, since 
there is a large number of fathers of high-school students be- 
tween these two ages, but the census data did not permit it. 
We find for each occupational group the number of children in 
high school for each 1,000 males over forty-five years of age. 
Thus for each 1,000 men over forty-five years of age engaged in 
managerial service in the four cities in 1910, there were 400 stu- 
dents in high school, when this investigation was made, whose 
fathers or guardians were engaged in this group of occupations. 
The very wide range of representation is at once apparent. At 
the upper extreme is the managerial service, just referred to, with 
a record of 400, while at the lower extreme is common labor with a 
record of but 17. The order of the various occupational groups 
is of interest. We have already noted the extremes. Following 
the managerial service are three great non-labor groups—profes- 
sional service, proprietors, and commercial service. Then come 
the printing trades, which have a low absolute representation in 
the high-school population as shown in Table XI, because of the 
small number of persons engaged in these trades in any ordinary 
city population. The proportional representation of this group 
is the highest of all the labor groups and slightly higher than 
one of the non-iabor groups, clerical service. This record is prob- 
ably to be explained in terms of the superior educational qualifi- 
cations required in the printing trades, the associations commonly 
formed in the occupation, and the stability of employment. Pub-  
-P-A-G-E-238
ee re eer nee 
226 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
lic service also is well represented, probably because of the some- 
what careful selection of the workers, the nature of the work, 
and the stability of employment. At the other end of the series 
are the lower and less respectable forms of labor, such as com- 
mon labor, personal service, miners, lumber-workers and fisher- 
men, and the miscellaneous trades. It should be recalled that 
this last group includes machine operatives and many semi- 
skilled workers. 
The reader has perhaps observed that two of the occupational 
divisions recognized in the classification are not included in this 
discussion: the agricultural service and the artisan-proprietors. 
The reason for the exclusion of the first of these groups is obvious. 
There is no natural relation between the number of children in 
the high schools of a particular city whose fathers are engaged in 
agricultural service and the number of adults so engaged living 
in that city, because many of the students in this group are either | 
not living at home or are commuting from outside the city. This 
group is extraneous to urban life. The exclusion of the artisan- 
proprietors was necessary because they are not given distinct rec- 
ognition in the federal census. There they are classed either as 
proprietors or as artisans, depending on the preponderance of 
function in each case. Consequently in this study they were 
allotted to the appropriate divisions. 
Some criticism may be made of the order in which the occupa- 
tions occur. In the light of other findings of this investigation 
that cannot be presented in this article, managerial service cer- 
tainly should not be at the top, but rather should be in fourth 
place. This group occupies first place here probably because of 
certain difficulties encountered in translating the occupational 
classification of the census into the classification used here. In 
the census, managers are not always separated from proprietors, 
with the consequence that the number of managers in the returns 
is reduced somewhat below their actual number in the popula- 
tion. It also seems probable that some persons occupying man- 
agerial positions in the field of commerce are returned in the 
census as commercial workers. With this single shift, the order 
should stand about as it is, except perhaps that the clerical service 
should be above the printing trades. 
It is probable, for two reasons, that the proportion of children 
in high school from the laboring groups is somewhat smaller than 
this figure suggests. In the first place, the acceptance of the num- 
ber of men over forty-five in each occupation as the basis for   
 
-P-A-G-E-239
    SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 227 
comparison gives a certain advantage to those occupations in 
which the proportion of such men is relatively small, because 
over 30 per cent of the fathers of high-school students are under 
forty-five. As a consequence, the occupations engaging few men 
beyond this age are not given a representation in the general 
population proportionate to the actual number of fathers of high- 
school students to be found in them. Since, on the average, the 
laboring classes are recruited less from the older men than are 
the other groups, it is apparent that the procedure followed here 
favors them. Among the non-labor groups it is true that the 
clerical and commercial workers are likewise favored. In the 
second place, the average number of children per family among 
the manual laborers is somewhat larger than it is among the 
other classes of the population. This is especially true of the 
lower grades of labor. Therefore, if the children from these ele- 
ments in the population were enrolled in the high school in pro- 
portionate numbers, their ratio to the number of adults of the 
parental age in the same population groups should be larger than 
that for children from other classes with a lower birth rate. Both 
of these considerations should incline us, therefore, toward a re- 
vision of percentages in the direction of larger rather than smaller 
differences between the two extremes. 
It may be said that, in the light of this investigation of the 
entire high-school populations in four cities, public secondary 
education in the United States has not by any means abandoned 
the selective principle in practice. The public high school is 
patronized very largely by the more fortunate social and economic 
classes, and the lower grades of labor have as yet hardly begun to 
think in terms of secondary education. 
Not only do the various occupational classes exhibit different 
degrees of representation in the high school at the beginning of 
the course, but those very groups that are under-represented in 
the Freshman year have the smallest ratio of Seniors to Fresh- 
men. In fact, the representation of an occupation in the first 
year of the high school is at the same time a fairly accurate mea- 
sure of its tendency to persist through the fourth year. Con- 
sequently, the differences among the groups become more and 
more pronounced as we pass through the school. The school 
population gradually becomes more and more homogeneous as the 
source from which it is drawn becomes more narrow, until, by the 
time the Senior year of the high school is reached, the student 
body exhibits a distinctly class character. Here the representa-

tives of the laboring classes are few indeed in proportion to their 
number in the general population, and the lower grades of labor 
have practically disappeared. This is brought out in striking 
fashion by the data from Mount Vernon in which the sixth grade 
is contrasted with the last year of the high school. 
The influence of economic and social status. Dr. Holley’s 
discussion of the influence of the economic and cultural status 
upon high-school attendance supplements in an important way the 
foregoing discussions. It will be noted that certain conditions in- 
vestigated by Holley seem to influence school attendance while 
other conditions seem only to accompany attendance.® 
THE INFLUENCE OF FAMILY INCOME AND OTHER FACTORS 
ON HIGH-SCHOOL ATTENDANCE * 
. By C. E. Horrey 
Two years ago Dr. J. K. Van Denburg published the results 
of an interesting investigation ® conducted in the New York City 
high schools. This investigation aimed, among other things, to 
determine the relation between the financial status of parents and 
the attendance, progress, and persistence of their children in the 
high schools. It would, of course, be difficult to obtain trust- 
worthy data regarding the actual income of the parents; but Dr. 
Van Denburg believed that he could make valid comparisons if 
he used as an index of income the amount paid for rent (or, in 
case the homes were owned by the parents, the rental value of 
the property). These data were secured without much difficulty. 
From material thus obtained, the following conclusion was drawn: 
“On the whole, the economic status of these pupils (so far as 
is shown by monthly rental) seems to be only a slight factor in

the determination of length of stay in the high school. * * * The 
general lack of evidence that poverty is the main cause of elimi- 
nation, or perhaps a cause of any appreciable magnitude, is of 
course of the utmost importance.” 
Dr. Van Denburg was careful to limit this conclusion to the 
community from which he obtained his data; but some speakers 
and writers who have quoted the results of his study have not 
been so mindful of the dangers of wide generalization, and have 
made the sweeping assertion that there is no relation between the 
financial status of the parents and the education which their 
children receive. 
The present writer has recently had an opportunity to test the 
validity of this generalization as applied to one specific commu- 
nity. While making a social study of the pupils in the Decatur, 
Illinois, high school, it was found that, in many cases, pupils 
then enrolled in the high school could be compared with older 
brothers and sisters, some of whom had graduated from high 
school, some of whom had attended but not graduated, and some 
of whom had not entered high school. In all, there were 198 
families that could be studied from this point of view. These 
families were divided into three groups: 
Group I. Those from which all of the older children had 
completed the high school course. 
Group II. Those from which none of the older children had. 
completed the high school course. 
Group III. Those in which some of the older children had 
graduated from high school while some had not graduated. 
We shall confine our discussion to the first two groups. Group 
I contained seventy-eight families, and furnished 72 per cent 
of the 334 children who had secured a high school education. 
Group II contained fifty-nine families and furnished 57 per cent 
of the 308 who had not finished high school. This distribution 
suggested that it might be possible to discover the characteristic 
home conditions of the two family types, and thus determine in 
some measure the home conditions which were favorable to high 
school education. A blank was accordingly prepared asking for 
the following data: 
(a) The occupation of the father. 
(b) The education of the father and mother in terms of 
years of schooling. 
(c) The family income. 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
230 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
(d) The monthly rent of the home. (Where the home was 
owned, the rent was estimated.) 
(e) Church affiliations of father and mother. 
(f) The newspapers and magazines taken by the home. 
(g) The number of books in the home library. 
(h) The clubs or organizations attended by the father 
and mother. 
These blanks were filled out by the pupils in conference with 
the teachers or principal. The results were later checked up by 
the principal and reports containing obvious errors were elimi- 
nated. This method of collecting data involves characteristic 
errors, but the results indicate that as a rule the errors coun- 
terbalanced one another. 
Results of the Investigation 
The differences between the two groups of homes are striking, 
as one would naturally expect: 
(a) Occupations. The fathers of Group I (the families that 
give their children a high school education) are chiefly engaged in 
professional and commercial occupations. The fathers of Group 
II (the families that do not generally provide high school edu- 
cation for their children) are chiefly engaged in the artisan trades, 
in the semi-skilled occupations, and in the unskilled occupations. 
(b) Schooling. The median number of years of schooling re- 
ceived by the parents of Group I is twelve; by the parents of 
Group II, eight. In Group I, 60 per cent of the fathers and 61 
per cent of the mothers have had the equivalent of a high school 
education, while more than gi per cent of the fathers and moth- 
ers of Group II have had less than a full four-years’ high school 
course. Indeed, 74 per cent of the fathers and 71 per cent of 
the mothers in Group II did not go beyond the eighth grade. 
(c) Income. As would be readily inferred from the state- 
ments just made, the yearly incomes and the monthly rentals 
‘are higher with those who sent their children to the high school 
than with the other groups. The median yearly income of 
Group I is $2,000; of Group II, $1,350. Each family included in 
this study contains at least three children, and the average num- 
ber of children is five or six. Thus it seems that the problem 
of furnishing the necessities of life is a serious one for many 
   
-P-A-G-E-243
  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 231 
families of Group II. The median monthly rental paid by 
families of Group I is $27.50; by families of Group II, $20. 
(d) Home Culture. The variation in reading matter found in 
the two classes of homes is also striking. Magazines of the better 
class were found in the homes represented by Group I, but were 
very infrequently found in the homes of Group II. The median 
library in Group I was 271 volumes; in Group II, eighty-three 
volumes. Ninety-seven per cent of the homes of Group II had 
smaller libraries than the average of Group I. (It is, of course, 
unsafe to place much reliance on the absolute numbers here re- 
ported; but assuming that the same tendencies to error operated 
in both cases, it is safe to make comparisons. ) 
(e) Clubs and Organizations. The number of clubs and or- 
ganizations attended by fathers is larger for the first group than 
for the second, and the variety is also greater. Among the moth- 
ers, the only important difference to be noted is that the mothers 
of Group I are more frequently enrolled as members of women’s 
clubs; and the mothers of Group II are largely limited to the 
mothers’ clubs of the public schools. 
(£) Religious Affiliations. No important conclusions are to 
be drawn from the data collected under this head. 
Children from the Two Groups Show but Slight Differences in 
Scholarship. While it is clear that economic status is an im- 
portant factor in determining whether, in the community that we 
studied, a child shall or shall not receive a high school education, 
it does not follow that economic status is directly correlated with 
intellectual ability. In so far as mental ability is measured by 
standing in school subjects, the differences in ability between 
children of the two groups are insignificant. The average 
semester’s grade for children of Group I was 85.1 per cent; for 
children of Group II, 84 per cent. A difference so slight as this 
could justify only the conclusion that, measured by this stan- 
dard, the two groups are of approximately equal ability. 
The conclusions drawn from this study, then, are somewhat 
inconsistent with those drawn by Dr. Van Denburg. In Decatur, 
the parents who are well educated and economically well-to-do, 
are more likely to send their children through high school than 
parents who are neither so well educated nor so well circum- 
stanced.

cation of the character of the social and economic make-up of 
schools. The results of the investigation by Thorndike and 
| Symonds together with their summaries of other investigations 
| give the best available answer to the question, What are the occu- 
pations of high-school graduates? 
THE OCCUPATIONS OF HIGH-SCHOOL GRADUATES AND 
NON-GRADUATES * 
By E. L. Tuornpike anp P. M. Symonps 
High-school graduates make their life-careers in occupations 
that are among the more intellectual and more refined. Any ob- 
serving high-school principal or teacher knows that his pupils 
very rarely become farm laborers, factory hands, cabmen, do- 
mestic servants, or salesgirls. Just how they are distributed, 
however, is not known for the country at large or for even any 
large geographical unit or large city. 
Investigations have been made by Shallies (1913), Mitchell 
(1914), Counts (1915), Inglis (1915), Koons (1917), and in 
connection with the Elyria Survey (1918) with the following 
results. 
Shallies reports that of 734 students graduating from seventy- 
five high schools in New York state in June, 1908, 33.6 per cent 
went to college, 16.6 per cent to normal school, 5.4 per cent to 
professional school; 16.0 per cent were engaged in teaching, 11.7 
per cent in business, 8.5 per cent in trade; 5.6 per cent were at 
home, and 2.6 per cent were unknown as to their careers. 
The letter of inquiry which secured these facts was sent in 
March, 1911, to the principals of certain high schools, one or 
more of whose graduates in 1908 had graduated from a normal 
school in 1910. This procedure served to select high-school grad- 
uates who went on into normal schools in excess of the repre- 
sentation in the state in general. How many of the principals 
who were asked to report the facts did so is not stated. Prob- 
ably not all reported, and those who did probably represented 
schools somewhat above the average in the dignity of their 
graduates’ careers. 
Mitchell reports the distribution of 845 graduates from forty- 
eight high schools in Iowa in 1908 as shown in Table XII.

    The primary data used by Counts were voluntary returns sent 
in by the principals of 1,000 high schools during the first half 
of the school year 1913-14. They were asked to report the num- 
ber of the boys and girls in the previous year’s graduating class

belonging in each of the following groups: college, commercial 
school, trades, farming, normal school, business, at home, other 
occupations, medicine, dentistry, engineering, pharmacy, law, 
domestic economy, agriculture, and unknown. This request is 
somewhat ambiguous, and, oddly enough, omits teaching, the 
one occupation most widely undertaken by high-school girls in the 
year following graduation. Counts interprets medicine, dentistry, 
etc., as professions, but they may oftener mean students pre- 
paring for these professions. 
Inglis computes, from the data of the United States Bureau of 
Education for 1912, that the central tendency by states is: for 
a trifle over one-half of the high-school graduates to continue 
in colleges, normal schools, or other institutions of high education. 
Koons studied the graduates of a single high school (Murphys- 
boro, Illinois) which was established in r901. Up to January, 
1916, there were 269 graduates, 117 boys and 152 girls. The 
occupations of these are reported by Koons as shown in Table 
XIII. For comparison similar facts are given for 117 boys and 
152 girls selected at random from those who left school before 
graduation. The entries are expressed in percentages.

These studies are valuable in helping to define our knowledge 
of the sort of life-work in which high-school students will en- 
gage, but they are limited in two important ways. They do not 
keep track of the individuals long enough for us to establish 
their eventual status; and the classifications employed (agricul- . 
ture, business, industries) are too general. Agriculture may mean 
that a person operates a farm worth $50,000 and employs ten 
NS
-P-A-G-E-248
236 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
men or that he is a farm laborer; business may mean an errand 
boy or a bank president. 
An attempt has been made to overcome these limitations by 
searching for representative high schools which have published or 
unpublished lists of their alumni for many years back and which 
report occupations in detail. Information from the following in- 
stitutions seemed especially suited to our purpose: The Ottawa 
Township High School, Ottawa, Illinois; data for the classes 
from 1878 to 1914. The Labette County High School, Altamont, 
Kansas; data for the classes from 1896 to 1915. The Atchison 
County High School, Effingham, Kansas; data for the classes 
from 1892 to 1916. The Pontiac Township High School, Pontiac, 
Illinois; data for the classes from 1895 to 1916. The Gouverneur 
Schools, Gouverneur, New York; data for the classes from 1888 
to 1915. The Auburn Academic High School, Auburn, New 
York; data for the classes from 1868 to 1906. 
We have collated the facts for graduates from 1892 to 1901 
(1895 to 1901 for Pontiac and 1896 to 1901 for Labette County) 
and also for graduates from 1902 to 1911 (1902 to 1906 for 
Auburn). The former group represents graduates most of whom 
had more than ten years after graduation in which to establish 
themselves in life and deserves special attention. 
The occupations mentioned are. given in full, partly because 
these details give a concrete sense of the work of high-school 
graduates and partly to permit the reader to classify them as he 
wishes. They are also classified into groups. The detailed lists 
presented in Tables XVII and XVIII show that the high-school 
graduates of 1892 to 1901 engaged in the main in the top quarter 
of the country’s work as rated on the basis of desirability and 
importance. In Table XVII the ninety-nine cases labeled “busi- 
ness” are all from two schools, Ottawa and Auburn; and the more 
detailed records of the other four schools show that only a very 
small percentage of these ninety-nine are engaged as porters, 
drivers, and the like. Even if we regard the “unknowns” as much 
inferior to the “knowns,” and estimate the number of “farmers” 
who are really farm laborers very generously, we have out of 
466 males, only 41 who may be doing work below the level of

*The numbers after each occupation are the actual occurrences when all 
women are included, the first being for the decade 1892 to 1901, the second 
for the decade 1902 to r911. The totals are: all women, 1892 to 1901, 859; 
1902-1911, 1,048; unmarried women, 1892 to 1901, 421; 1902 to 1911, 631. 
Let the reader arrange the occupations of the 1892 to 1901 
male graduates along a scale of seven units in which one repre- 
sents an unskilled day laborer; four, a blacksmith, carpenter, 
mason, or plumber; seven, a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or operator 
of an industrial or commercial plant with an income of $3,500 
or more. Two and three represent equal steps between one and 
four. Five and six represent equal steps between four and seven. a ENT Men mi er on T Te TN ee Te peepee mente NEI Tree ca oer ee

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 239 
Distribute the “farmers,” “unknowns,” and other doubtful cases 
as seems just. It will probably be found that more than one-half 
of the male high-school graduates will be placed in the two high- 
est compartments, and more than four-fifths of them in the three 
highest. The occupations of the women may be similarly distrib- 
uted by using a scale in which one represents an unskilled laborer, 
a dish washer ‘or factory hand of low grade; four, a clerk or 
typist; seven, a teacher in high school or an operator of a store 
or shop with an income of $2,000 or more. This procedure will 
probably result in placing nearly three-fifths of the unmarried 
women graduates in the two highest compartments and nearly 
nine-tenths of them in the three highest. 
High-school graduates (male) have over ten times their quota 
in the professions. According to the census of 1900, in the gen- 
eral male population twenty-five to thirty-four years of age there 
were just about as many draymen, hackmen, and teamsters as 
there were in the four professions plus journalism and dentistry; 
but among the high-school graduates there were possibly one- 
sixtieth as many. Among women in general of the ages twenty- 
five to thirty-four, dressmakers and milliners outnumber teachers 
considerably, but among the high-school graduates teachers are 
about fifty times as numerous as milliners and dressmakers 
together. 
The life-careers of non-graduates cannot be pictured with 
surety. We have been unable to find records save those quoted 
from Koons and the Elyria Survey and those given in Table III 
comparing graduates and non-graduates of the Northeast High 
School of Philadelphia, a school of rather special nature and his- 
tory. The one fact which is certain is that the non-graduate 
takes, in respect to occupation, a position intermediate between 
the graduate and the person who has not attended high school. 
From both the details and the grouped results shown in Table 
XIX," it is obvious that, with any reasonable distribution of 
the “unknowns,” and the non-graduates will be relatively less 
frequent than the graduates in the more dignified and important 
occupations and more frequent in those less dignified and impor- 
tant. This is shown also by the data quoted from Koons and the 
Elyria Survey. 
“These facts are compiled from the Catalog of the Northeast High 
School, Philadelphia, 1912-13, and the Handbook of the Alumni Association 
of the Northeast Manual Training High School, Philadelphia, 1913.

We have shown elsewhere ** that from 1890 to 1918 the per- 
centage of children reaching a given age who go to high school 
has trebled and that the percentage of children reaching a given 
age who graduate from high school has increased even more. 
It seems unlikely that the enviable status shown for graduates 
in 1892 to 1901 in respect to occupations can be fully main- 
tained now and in the future. To maintain it would require that 
the favored occupations be practically closed to all but high- 
“The first number after each occupation is the percentage of living gradu- 
ates; the second, the percentage of living non-graduates.

  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MAKE-UP OF SCHOOLS 242 
school graduates. This may perhaps be taking place. The supply 2” 
of high-school graduates is increasing so fast that any profession 
or reputable semiprofession may demand such. Even if it is not 
fully maintained—indeed, even if there is a considerable move- 
ment downward—the high-school graduates will still have a 
notably high occupational status; the correlation between amount 
of education and dignity of occupation will still be close. 
Principles Derived from Discussions of the Social and Eco- 
nomic Make-up of the Secondary School. The social make-up 
of American secondary schools requires that the schools provide 
for the needs of pupils ranging as to population groups from 
common labor to professional service. 
The selective principle still dominates secondary education. 
The high school should make a stronger appeal to population 
groups which are now only beginning to think in terms of sec- 
ondary education. 
Sociological conditions warrant the planning of courses so that 
they will be of maximum value to pupils who pursue them for 
either short or long periods. The school can no longer afford to 
neglect the population groups which are less and less well rep- 
resented each succeeding year of school. 
Unfavorable economic conditions often restrict high-school 
attendance. This principle is supported indirectly by the studies 
of occupational representation in high school and by Holley’s 
study of the relation between economic conditions and persistence 
in school. It is to be understood that certain pupils of the lowest 
economic strata sometimes overcome the handicap of poverty. 
A heightening of parental education and an improvement of 
home conditions lead to a lengthening of children’s stay in school. 
The longer pupils go to school the “higher” the occupation 
which they will enter. High-school graduates enter relatively 
“high” occupations while non-graduates enter occupations which 
are intermediate between those entered by graduates and those 
who have not attended high school at all.

    CHAPTER VII 
THE MENTAL EQUIPMENT oF SECONDARY ScHOOL PupPpits 
Measuring mental equipment by academic success or failure. 
The mental equipment of secondary school pupils can be dis- 
cussed readily in connection with their academic records and 
their scores on intelligence tests. Academic records have been the 
property of teachers from time immemorial, while standard in- 
dices of intelligence are among the most recent additions to their 
information about pupils. At the present time, therefore, certain 
teachers, owing to their conservatism, lack of familiarity with 
intelligence testing, or to a sincere belief that adequate testing 
of intelligence is impossible, hold that attempts to measure in- 
telligence are productive of nothing save misleading data. Such 
a point of view has, however, become less and less tenable as de- 
vices for intelligence testing have become more and more highly 
refined. : 
Problems which have driven members of the teaching profes- 
sion to the use of intelligence tests are raised in such articles as 
those which follow by Bliss, Rugg, and Brooks. For example, 
questions as to teachers’ standards raise issues which demand ob- 
jective measurements of both the general or native intelligence 
of pupils and their attainments in subject matter. Also, the 
perennial question as to the rate of mental development of school 
children is one which calls for standardized measurement of 
intelligence. 
This chapter draws, therefore, upon accounts of the successes 
244

and failures of pupils; the practical and theoretical issues involved 
in the grading of pupils’ work; and the gradual development of 
mental powers; while Chapter VIII deals with the available 
means of appraising mental powers and the utilization of the 
results of mental measurement. 
HIGH SCHOOL FAILURES * 
By Don C. Buss 
The extent of non-promotion in the elementary school has 
occupied such a prominent place in educational literature during 
the past few years that school superintendents have to all intents 
and purposes reduced their practice to a standard. A study of 
annual reports indicates that the rate of non-promotion which 
commonly prevails in the elementary grades varies from 8 per 
cent. to 12 per cent. No such uniform standard is found in the 
high schools. Not only is there a wide divergence between dif- 
ferent school systems but within the same high school even, de- 
partments are practically a law unto themselves. One depart- 
ment may report no failures while another.in the same school may 
fail 50 per cent. of the pupils. taking the subject. One or two 
studies of this question have been made which indicate clearly 
the necessity of establishing with-some definiteness what consti- 
tutes a reasonable percentage of failure in high school classes. 
In North Jersey a group of superintendents and principals who 
had formed an association for the study of educational questions 
selected this one as the subject for a recent meeting. Fourteen 
superintendents agreed to furnish duplicates of the promotion 
sheets of all classes for June 1915. These returns were tabulated 
by a seminar group in Teachers’ College and the results charted 
in the office of the Superintendent at Montclair. By this plan 
all marks were reduced to a uniform basis and discrepancies 
eliminated so far as possible. The conviction of any individual 
as to a reasonable number of failures in mathematics could not be 
maintained in the face of the median failures for mathematics in 
all of the schools represented in the study. The returns were 
reduced to per cents., the basis each time being the number of 
marks given by the various teachers in the especial subject or 
* Educational Administration and Supervision, III, 125-138. March, 1917.

subjects under consideration. The total number of marks tab- 
ulated was as follows:

In the judgment of those making the study this group of: six 
subjects involving over 24,000 marks was broad enough to estab- 
lish any conclusion that might be reached with respect to the 
prevailing practice in any high school. The grouping was en- 
tirely arbitrary and was made in this form in order to reduce the 
labor of the necessary computations and the construction of 
charts. “Mathematics” includes algebra and geometry, while 
“business subjects” covers stenography, typewriting, bookkeep- 
ing, and others commonly grouped under this caption. Only 
those pupils who were members of the class in June were included. 
Those who had dropped from the classes during the year were 
not taken into consideration, this factor being left for a future 
study. 
In making the tables each school system was represented by 
a key letter, A, B, C, etc., while the teachers were represented 
by numbers. When a letter had been assigned to a school, or a 
number to a teacher, the same letters and numbers were retained 
in all tables. 
After the returns had been tabulated and reduced to a per- 
centage basis, six sets of tables were made: 
1. The total percentage of failure in all subjects, for each school. 
2. The failures for each year of the high school course. 
3. The failures for the fourteen high schools in each of the 
six departments. 
4. The failures for the teachers in each department. 
5. The distribution of marks in mathematics for each school, 
showing the percentage of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and failures. 
6. The comparative distribution of marks between two selected 
subjects, for several schools. 
7. Percentage of total failures, failing in one or more subjects. 
The general conditions with respect to high school failure are 
clearly reflected in this table: when the work in any school is

so catried on that 27 per cent of the total marks given indicate 
failure, no argument is needed to prove the necessity of a careful 
study of the situation. If it is the direct result pf an attempt 
to maintain a standard of scholarship which a large proportion 
of the students are unable to reath this standard should be ad- 
justed to their capacity. It is more than probable that the aver- 
age ability in one school system is practically the same as in 
every other high school, hence the indicated variation cannot be 
accounted for on the score of unequal mentality. Individuals 
may show a radical variation in capacity but the average of 
schools must be practically constant. 
It is, of course, entirely possible that the fluctuation is pro- 
duced by a difference in the quality of actual‘teaching in the 
classrooms or by the lack of motivation of the subject matter. 
The real cause can be ascertained only by a careful study of the 
existing conditions. 
It may be charged, on the other hand, that the school showing 
8 per cent. of failure is operating under a standard so low that 
the product is of inferior quality. While it may be true that 
the school suffers less from this policy than from the attempt to 
maintain an unreasonably high standard, the inevitable result 
is a lowering of its reputation. Parents have a right to expect 
that students are fully qualified to measure up to the demands 
which current opinion makes of high school graduates. The 
graduation certificate should represent a certain degree of at- 
tainment. Pupils who are certified as prepared for college work 
should be able to maintain a creditable position in the college 
which they enter. The reports made by college deans to the 
school afford incontrovertible evidence of i#ts success or failure. 
If business men who employ graduates of the commercial course 
are satisfied with the proficiency of the boys and girls whom they 
take on the recommendation of the school, no arguments of 
would-be critics are worth a moment’s consideration. It is a

In this table the outstanding fact is the steady decrease in 
percentage of failure from the freshman to the senior year. This 
large proportion of freshman failure is equally marked in all of 
the schools examined, and its universality indicates that it is 
probably unavoidable. It is only reasonable to suppose that 
some pupils will attempt the high school work even though nature 
has failed to endow them with the proper mentality to undertake 
it successfully. Students of this character soon realize their limi- 
tations, become discouraged, and drop out. The remainder, with 
a better mentality, are able to measure up to the demands of 
the school and complete the requirements. This conviction of 
the lack of ability to meet an arbitrary standard should not 
operate to prevent the high-school principal from using every 
effort to arouse such pupils to a realizing sense of their oppor- 
tunities. Many of them can be saved to the school by allowing 
them to take special courses. Another reason for the diminution 
of failure as pupils progress through the school may be that 
teachers of the advanced classes are influenced, perhaps uncon- 
sciously, by a feeling that they are in duty bound to prevent the 
excessive mortality which prevails in the freshman class. The 
extent to which this factor operates cannot be determined by a 
study of this characte. 
Even though the same general tendency appears in all of the 
high schools, those who made the worst record in the first table 
are again the worst offenders. School system D, which according 
to Table XX failed 20 per cent. as a whole, fails in the freshman °

year 34 per cent., while in the senior year but 11 per cent. fail, 
a net decrease of 23 per cent. School system K, making an ex- 
cellent record as a whole, shows a variation of but 6 per cent. 
between the freshman and senior years. ‘It is impossible to 
escape the conclusion that some high schools permit a greater va- 
riation than is necessary. A careful study of the whole situation, 
followed by a definite campaign to improve conditions would 
undoubtedly result in a lessened mortality.

The wide variation within a school in the number of failures for 
the different subjects indicates a radical difference in the arbi- 
trary standard of attainment demanded. Why a school like C 
should set up a standard in German that results in 29 per cent. 
of failure and should at the same time follow a practice in history 
that results in only 5 per cent. of failure is difficult to understand. 
It is impossible to escape the conclusion that either the standard 
in German is too high or that the requirement in history is too 
low. It is of course entirely possible that the teachers in the his- 
tory department have succeeded in motivating the work to an 
extent not realized by the German teachers. Whatever the cause 
it seems clear that some reorganization in practice is demanded. 
When we consider the record in a single subject in the different 
high schools a like variability appears. The maximum percentage 
of failure in English is found in School I amounting to 24 per 
cent. and the minimum in School K with 3 per cent. The ex- 
tremes are equally pronounced in history, varying from a maxi- 
mum of 30 per cent. to a minimum of 5 per cent. Mathematics, 
as an exact science, ought to show a more uniform practice but 
even here the extremes are too great, ranging from 36 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to 9 per cent. These variations cannot be accounted for by 
assuming a like difference in the abilities of the pupils represented. 
The average of the ability of all students in one school is prac- 
tically identical with the average of the ability of those in an- 
other school, and if the methods of teaching and ideals of 
attainment are equal in the two systems the percentage of failures 
must be approximately equal. 
A consideration of subject failure leads naturally to an analysis 
of each department to determine whether the different teachers 
concerned follow the same general policy. 
The surface indications might lead to the supposition that a 
department was entirely satisfactory when as an actual fact the 
conditions were radically wrong. An abnormal number of failures 
in a single section might be entirely concealed by unusual effi- 
ciency on the part of the other teachers in that: department. The 
German in school system F is an illustration of this situation. 
The department as a whole does not show enough failures to 
attract any particular attention, but when they are assigned to 
the different teachers the 45 per cent. of failure charged to one 
of them becomes conspicuous at once.

In contrast to this situation H shows a uniform tendency that 
is most commendable. The system is large, requiring three 
teachers to meet the demand for German. A variation of 3 per 
cent. is no more than might be expected as a result of the unequal 
abilities of the pupils who make up the siteteat sections. The 
variability in some schools is too large to be explained away by 
any such supposition and we are forced to conclude that in many
-P-A-G-E-263
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 251 
instances there should be a larger amount of directive influence 
from the department head, supplemented by occasional confer- 
ences of the teachers in the group. 
Individuality of the members of the teaching force should be 
respected, but it ought not to be encouraged to such an extent 
that an impossible ideal of attainment is set up. If it is clear 
that the measure of attainment of the students in a given group 
warrants such a step it would seem to be a wiser policy to modify 
the requirements of the course of study sufficiently to enable more 
than 65 per cent. of the class to meet them. In doing this it may 
be necessary to increase the time allowance for the subject 
enough to prevent the standard of excellence demanded by the 
schoo] from being undermined. In any event, it is impossible to 
justify a policy which gives forty or fifty per cent. of failures. 
Of the eight school systems furnishing these data only one, J, 
distributes its marks in a scientific manner. In this high school 
the distribution curve is nearly ideal: the 14 per cent. of failure 
is balanced by 13 per cent. of A’s. The maximum number falls 
at the central group C with the two groups on either side approxi- 
mately equal. School C, on the other hand, has ten times as many 
failures as A’s. 
It is evident that the general policy of high schools is to guard 
the entrance to the A grade with jealous care probably because 
of the desire to restrict the college certificate privilege to a select 
group of students. It would be interesting to know whether the 
13 per cent of A students in school J is representing the school 
worthily in higher institutions. If this large percentage in the 
A group has not resulted in lowering the standard to an unreason- 
able degree, it represents a condition tending to strengthen the 
school with the community. Justly or unjustly there is a strong 
tendency on the part of school patrons to estimate the efficiency 
of the high school on the basis of the marks given the students. 
The parents of the pupil who received an A grade invariably be- 
lieve in the excellence of the high school. Conversely, parents 
of the boy who is marked a failure tend to place the blame upon 
the school. Consequently it is a politic thing for any school to 
award as many of the higher grades as it can without risking 
failure on the part of the student in his subsequent work. This 
is a policy that can readily be overdone as no temporary gain in 
local prestige will make up for a reputation of maintaining a low 
standard of efficiency. Truckling to patrons for the sake of their 
support is always unwise and such practices tend to defeat the

very ends they are supposed to serve, but there is no good reason 
for following a policy which harms the school simply for the 
sake of asserting independence. 
It is important for the high school principal to know the fail- 
ures in any given subject but it is equally important to know how 
serious the failure is. A pupil may fail in one instance but his 
success in other lines of work may enable him to go on with his 
class. Should he fail in several subjects he may be so handi- 
capped as to make an additional year in the school necessary. 
An inspection of Table XXIV shows that the majority of 
failures are in but a single subject. In school system H. for in- 
stance, 69 per cent of the total failures are below standard in 
a single subject only. School I has 53 per cent. below standard in 
one subject while 11 per cent. have failed in what must be their 
entire work. 
Such a study as this is defective at a vital point: it fails to take 
into consideration any unusual condition which might account 
for the facts disclosed. Particularly is this true with respect to 
those data showing the percentage of failure by teacher. It is 
perfectly possible that the group under the instruction of a certain 
teacher during the particular year considered is so constituted 
that a high percentage of failure is inevitable. Given a more 
select group the very same teacher might have made an entirely 
creditable showing. This criticism is not equally valid for 
total failure or failure by subject: here the conditions are more 
constant and the facts disclosed are due to the fundamental 
policy pursued by the school. Presumably the same condition 
would have appeared had any other year been selected for the

MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 253 
study. Before any final conclusion with respect to individual 
teachers can be reached a similar study for one or two other 
years would need to be made. If such studies should show the 
same tendency year after year, the inference with respect to 
teachers would be as conclusive as it is now with respect to 
school systems. 
TEACHERS’ MARKS AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE 
MARKING SYSTEM? 
By Harotp O. Ruce 
During the past ten years it has been increasingly evident to 
school men that one of the contributory causes of “failure” in 
the public schools has been a bad administration of the marking 
system. By and large in this country we fail 20 per cent of 
our student population. Furthermore it is relatively common, 
in many of our high schools at least, for teachers to fail upward 
of 30 per cent of their students. Recognizing that some of the 
difficulty may be traced to the inability of the pupil, that some 
of it clearly may be ascribed to a badly adjusted course of study 
and some of it to inefficient teaching, nevertheless there remains 
for the careful consideration of administrators and teachers the 
reconstruction and better administration of the marking system. 
For just about ten years there has been much agitation in the 
educational press over the standardization of school marks. 
More than sixty articles have appeared in our various journals 
discussing the many phases of this problem. In 1915 the writer 
summarized the literature, finding at that time 39 references 
which dealt rather directly with the problem of the standardi- 
zation of teachers’ marks.* Since that time no systematic sum- 
mary has appeared which presented the essence of educational 
thought on this question or which reviewed the literature. It 
seems clear, therefore, that there is a need for a complete state- 
ment of present scientific thought on the matter and for the 
setting forth of a thoroughgoing program for the reconstruction 
of the marking system in our public school. This article, there- 
fore, is written with these three aims in view: to summarize the 
results of recent investigations, to present complete bibiographic

material, and to present systematically the essence of current 
thinking on the problem. 
I. The marking system needs to be reconstructed. Out of 
the discussion of the last fifteen years we find one point of abso- 
lute agreement, namely, that we should overhaul thoroughly the 
methods by which we measure the outcome of instruction in the 
public schools. There are three very apparent reasons for this 
statement: (1) the striking variability in teachers’ marks; (2) the 
unreliability, the lack of consistency, with which teachers mark; 
(3) the inconsistency in the way in which teachers distribute their 
marks. 
1. The variability of teachers’ marks. Of the 23 articles 
which have appeared in the past three years nearly every one 
presents evidence showing the striking variability in the marking 
of teachers. Various investigations have been reported showing 
the percentages of A’s, B’s, C’s, etc., given by teachers in differ- 
ent systems of schools, within the same system, and within the 
same department. Investigations reported by Chapman and 
Hills + are distinctly to the point in this connection. They show, 
for example, in their study of the distribution of college grades 
the very wide variability with which instructors even within the 
same department assigned the various marks of the marking 
scale. One instructor, for example, in several years of marking 
gave 400 per cent more E’s than another instructor. 
2. The unreliability of teachers’ marks. In the same way it 
has become apparent to school men that teachers unaided by any 
objective scale will vary greatly in their judgments of the same 
student work. There are many investigations which establish this 
point clearly. Inglis,® for example, in a recent article shows. that 
of 122 high-school teachers marking an examination paper of 10 
questions in plane geometry 20 per cent gave an equal value 
(ro per cent) to each question. Of the others the range in the 
value assigned to the various questions was from o per cent to 
25 per cent and the average deviation was 2.4 per cent. Inglis 
also shows, by having the question answered by pupils who had -

MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 255 
completed plane geometry four months before, that the relative 
difficulty of the 10 questions ranged from 10 to 298 points. 
Likewise in testing students on an algebra examination certain 
questions which had been marked as of equal value as others 
were found to be 15 and 16 times as easy as the others when 
worked by students. Furthermore as one studies the marks given 
by a teacher to the same piece of student work presented at 
successive times he finds even here distinct evidence of unrelia- 
bility of marking. Studies referred to in the writer’s previous 
article show clearly the following: 
Under such individualistic marking systems as are in use today 
teachers’ marks do vary widely—there are large individual dif- 
ferences in teachers’ marks of the same students in the same sub- 
jects, on the same examination papers and the same drawings and 
lettering samples. The mean variations in many instances tested 
run as high as 15 per cent. They practically never are less than 
5 per cent. Steele found the mean variation of eight markers 
on the same examination replies to vary from 2.5 per cent to 8.1 
per cent. Starch found mean variation among instructors in the 
same department marking English papers to be 5.4 per cent. 
According to Starch and Elliott the probable error (almost the 
same as the mean variation in these cases) of 142 high-school 
teachers marking the same English paper was 4.5 per cent; the 
same geometry paper, 7.5 per cent; the same history paper, 7.7 
per cent; 50 per cent of the marks were separated by more than 
9 per cent. The present writer (1914) found a mean variation 
for teachers of lettering marking the same 20 samples of 8.6 per 
cent, and among students trained in lettering of 11.4 per cent, 
both groups never having seen an objective scale in lettering. 
Starch and the present writer each found the variation in 
marking to be as large within any one department as that among 
‘departments and schools. Starch established a mean variation 
of 2.2 per cent in any one teacher’s marking of the same paper. 
He attempts to determine the relative amounts contributed to 
the total variability by the various factors affecting it. He con- 
cludes that the total difference in marking is due to differences 
in standards among schools, among teachers, in the same school 
or department, to inability to distinguish small differences in 
quality of school product, and to the change in an instructor’s 
own standards. 
The minimum size of the marking unit. From the results of 
three of the four investigations bearing on this question of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
size of the marking unit we may conclude that teachers, marking 
without an objective scale, cannot be expected to mark student 
work in any subject—mathematics, history, composition, let- 
tering, etc—within an interval of roughly 8 per cent. 
3. Inconsistency in the way in which teachers distribute their 
marks. A third type of evidence may be exhibited in showing 
the need for reconstructing the marking system. Not only do 
teachers’ marks vary between themselves and within the same 
department, not only are they inconsistent as measures of the 
same student work, but also when they are distributed along the 
scale of ability we find that the shape of the distributions for 
different systems, for different schools, for different departments, 
and for different teachers is distinctly inconsistent. One teacher 
or school fails 30 per cent and the marks may be piled up at the 
low end of the marking scale. Another teacher or school gives 30 
per cent of the student body marks of “excellent,” or go, etc., 
thereby humping up the marks at the high end of the scale. 
From detailed study of hundreds of mark curves it may be said 
that it is possible to find all forms of distribution of marks, from 
the form in which the marks are heavily “skewed” to the high 
end of the scale to the form in which the marks are piled up at 
the low end of the scale. There is, however, enough evidence 
that teachers’ marks tend to be “skewed” to the high end of the 
scale. In the writer’s previous article were presented typical dis- 
tribution-curves covering more than 171,400 teachers’ marks col- 
lected from 7 colleges and universities and from 39 high schools. 
These data certainly typify the actual condition of marking 
throughout the country, and conclusions made from them ought 
to hold for teachers at large. We may summarize the conclusions 
of the previous report thus: 
Regardless of subjects. of study, the typical distribution of 
teachers’ marks results in a form or curve which may be described 
as skewed to the high end of the percentile scale, i.e., the 
peaks of the curve will lie considerably above the mean of the 
base line upon which the curve is plotted and above the theo- 
retical mean of the normal frequency-curve plotted on that base. 
Less than ro per cent of the several hundred mark curves, 
representing an aggregate of over 171,400 marks, may be de- 
scribed as perfectly symmetrical, and not more than two or three 
in a hundred of all those examined have been found to be ap- 
proximately “normal.” 
The mark curves of students of advanced high-school classes
-P-A-G-E-269
    
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 257 
are skewed much farther to the high end of the percentile scale 
than are the mark curves of students in corresponding elementary 
classes. 
There is evidence that another potent cause of the skewing 
is the presence of institutional “critical points” in the marking 
scale, e.g., ‘the “passing” and “exemption” grades are almost 
always found to play an important rdle in shaping the mark 
curve. 
II. Why are teachers’ marks variable and inconsistent? To 
answer this question we proceed at once to the crux of our prob- 
lem. Teachers’ marks are variable and inconsistent primarily 
because teachers in marking pupils do not measure the same trait, 
secondarily because teachers do not have a common scale for the 
evaluation of definite amounts of the traits measured; i.e., their 
marks are distributed on a purely subjective basis and their stand- 
ards are not uniform. It is not possible to secure from a group 
of twenty-five school people from twelve to fifteen different 
statements as to what is measured by school marks. It is im- 
possible, furthermore, to establish exactly the same connotation 
in the word-statements of any two teachers. Camp ° found, for 
example, in canvassing this situation with his teachers that 
teachers said that they—mark “improvement,” “ability,” “seri- 
ousness,” “purpose,” “moral qualities,” “interest in work,” 
“equipment.” The English department, for example, marks “con- 
scientious work,” “improvement and ability,” while the commer- 
cial department marks “accuracy,” “neatness and promptness,” 
“honesty,” “courtesy,” and “seriousness.” The history depart- 
ment marks “endeavor and improvement.” 
III. What is measured by teachers’ marks? To provide a 
foundation for a clear discussion of this problem we shall do 
well to distinguish three different traits in our student popula- 
tion. Let us call them for convenience inherited capacity, ability- 
to-do, and specific performance. The writer has canvassed the 
more than sixty articles which have appeared during the past 
fifteen years and found these three traits apparently fairly dis- 
tinguishable among the score or more that are in the minds of 
teachers. With the recent development of the measuring move- 
ment, of which standardization of teachers’ marks is merely a 
*Camp, Frederick. “Some ‘Marks’: An Administrative Problem,” School 
Review, XXV (December, 1917), 697.
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
phase, there has. come a general acceptance of the distinction be- 
tween these three traits. 
It is helpful to think of pupils as we meet them in public-school 
classes as being distributed over three different kinds of scale: 
one a scale which represents varying degrees of inherited capac- 
ity, another a scale which represents varying degrees of ability, 
and a third a scale which represents varying degrees of efficiency 
in specific performance. 
Now the term inherited capacity practically defines itself. By 
it we mean the “start in life’; the sum total of nervous possi- 
bilities which the infant has at birth and to which, therefore, 
nothing that the individual himself can do will contribute in any 
way whatsoever. No one fact that has come from the study of 
heredity is of more importance to teachers than this fact that 
the capacity of an individual is determined by the “third and 
fourth generations” and not by anything that he himself can do. 
An important corollary to this statement is that an individual 
has a given place on the capacity scale and that only a combina- 
tion of the most favorable conditions of training and work can 
operate to bring him to a point equally high on the ability scale. 
Obviously, since capacity has to do with the “start in life,” in 
the public schools we do not measure capacity. 
Now educational conditions (as found in the home, in the 
neighborhood, in the kindergarten, on the playground, in the 
“gang,” in church, in the Sunday school, etc.) operating on “ca- 
pacity” develop what we shall call “present-ability,” the “ability- 
to-do,” which is present at any given time. If the educational 
conditions are favorable, then the position of an individual on 
the ability scale will approximate his true position on the inherited- 
capacity scale. Courtis has defined capacity as “‘potential-ability.” 
To express more clearly what we mean by ability let us 
discuss specific performance. If an individual’s presentability is 
his ability-to-do, then by an individual’s performance we mean 
what he does, i.e., his specific performance at work. We mean, 
for example, the recitations that he makes, the examination papers 
that he writes, the machine part that he constructs, the theme 
that he writes, the problems that he solves, etc. Jt is these spe- 
cific performances of children that we measure in school practice. 
It is these that school marks ought to measure. And it is from 
the sum total of these that we estimate ability-to-do. To reiter- 
ate an important fact, we do not measure ability, we estimate it 
from mere performances. An illustration will make this fact still 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 259 
clearer. If we give a test to measure skill in a particular school 
activity (such as, for example, the removal of parentheses in 
algebra) to a pupil five times in succession, on successive days, 
his specific performances may be as indicated herewith. On one 
day, for instance, he works in one minute 18 examples, on an- 
other day 11, on another 24, on another 19, and on a fifth 16. 
There are two important characteristics apparent in the per- 
formances of school children. The first shows us that specific 
performance is unstable and that any one test does not enable 
us to estimate accurately the ability of a given pupil. The vari- 
ation of this particular pupil from 11 to 24 problems a minute 
illustrates the variability or instability of pupils’ specific per- 
formances. Furthermore it determines our attitude toward the 
use of performance as guides for formulating judgments on their 
ability-to-do. Now the second important characteristic of a 
pupil’s performance, and one which bears upon our question still 
more intimately, is that the average of successive performances 
is relatively stable. For example, jn the illustrations given the 
average of the first two performances is 14.5, the average of the 
first three is 17.67, of the first four 18.0, and of the first five per- 
formances 17.60. In other words, the averages of three or more 
successive performances are practically stable or constant, al- 
though the individual performances vary greatly in amount. Thus 
it is clear that just as capacity is potential-ability, so ability-to-do 
may be helpfully described as the average of a few successive per- 
formances. Furthermore it is helpful for teachers to recall that 
experimentation is showing that but a very few successive per- 
formances, say three, or four, need to be measured on an 
individual pupil to permit a close estimate of his ability. 
We may sum up this discussion, therefore, by pointing out that 
if an adequate method of measuring the specific performances 
of pupils can be devised then the chaotic condition which is ap- 
parent in our marking terminology can easily be cleared up. 
Interest and effort, moral qualities, attitude, etc—all these in- 
tangible qualities contribute to the specific performance of the 
pupil and result in making possible an estimate of his total ability- 
to-do. Thus, in résumé, teachers’ marks ought to measure ability- 
to-do, this in turn having been estimated from the specific 
performances of the pupils. We shall point out later that this 
estimate will be valid as we substitute objective methods for our 
present subjective methods of measuring ability.

IV. How does ability distribute in the general population? . 
Teachers’ marks, if they are adequate Siete of ability, 
ought to distribute over the ability scale in approximate conform- 
ity at least to what is known about the distribution of ability, in 
the general population. Hence the very evident need for making 
use of a theoretical distribution of teachers’ marks against which 
to check our judgment on ability as it is represented in our school 
classes. An extensive literature has developed concerning the 
form of the distribution of human traits. It has been referred to 
by many writers on teachers’ marks and? has been presented in 
summary fashion in a number of sources. For this reason and 
because the writer is distinctly limited in space in the publication 
of this article our statement here will be very brief and seem- 
ingly dogmatic. The evidence for the statement, however, has 
been set forth in other writings. 
The types of fact made use of by those who would standardize 
the marking system through the use of theoretical distribution- 
curves include the following: both physical and mental traits 
(and it is believed likewise moral traits) are found to fit rea- 
sonably well for purposes of practical application in education a 
mathematical curve known most commonly as the normal 
probability-curve. The arguments and the evidence adduced in 
the investigations of the past ten years lead us to believe that such 
a distribution-curve is reasonably adapted to either an elementary- 
or a secondary-school population. Granting, therefore, that we 
need to refer our judgment of scholastic ability to some theoretical 
distribution-curve and accepting this particular normal curve as 
a satisfactory type, we have three subordinate problems before 
us: (1) the determination of the number of divisions on the mark- 
ing scale, (2) certain statistical points involved in the determina- 
tion of the length of the scale, and (3) the determination of the 
number in individuals that ought to fall in the various divisions 
of the marking scale. 
V. Number of divisions used in the marking system. In the 
previous article of the writer the recommendations of 9 inves- 
tigators were shown with the proposed percentages for each of 
the divisions of the scale. At that time it was shown that all 
™For example, the reader will find a detailed statement of the statistical 
methods underlying the use of curves representing the distribution of human 
traits in the writer’s Statistical Methods Applied to Education, chap. viii.

MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 261 
but one of these investigators recommended a five-division mark- 
ing scale with the use of letters A, B, C, D, E; of words such as 
“excellent,” ‘superior,’ “medium,” “inferior,” and “poor”; and 
in many cases of parallel percentile limits on the marking scale. 
Nicolson has recently collected the practices of 64 colleges 
approved by the Carnegie Foundation. He finds that 36 of these 
colleges use a five-division marking scale and that among the 
others there is almost no central tendency. Some colleges use as 
few as 3 groups and others as many as 12 and 15. A large 
number generally accompany the use of A, B, C, D, etc., with 
the use of plus and minus signs. Furthermore it is shown that 
it is relatively common at the present time in the administration 
of college marking systems to translate letter marks into per- 
centile limits on a numerical scale. For example, A=go-100, 
B=8o-90, etc. We may sum up the situation for our colleges 
and high schools by pointing out that there is a fair agreement 
upon a five-division marking scale. We have already quoted the 
various suggestions made in the previous article concerning the 
minimum size of the unit in the marking scale. This confirms 
our judgment that five divisions can be handled accurately by 
teachers. 
VI. Percentage of individuals theoretically falling in each 
division. Dividing up the marking scale, therefore, into five 
parts we are concerned to know what proportion of human beings 
should be found in each of the various divisions of the scale. 
Without introducing a technical discussion of the statistics of 
the probability-curve let us say that one can obtain these facts 
from tables which have been constructed showing the percentages 
of the total area of the curve which fall between various points 
on the base line. A complete discussion of this matter can be 
found in the reference previously given. To apply the normal 
probability-curve rigidly to our problem would lead to a state- 
ment that if we use a five-division marking scale the percentages 
of pupils that ought normally to be expected in each of the 
groups would be either 7, 24, 38, 24, 7, Or 3.5, 24, 45, 24, 3.5, 
depending upon whether one breaks off the base line of the nor- 
mal curve at 2% or 3 times the standard deviation (the latter 
being used merely as a unit with which to divide the base line of 
the curve). It is clear, however, that a sane recommendation 
concerning the use of a theoretical curve will lead to the statement 
that a percentile distribution of pupils in five divisions ought to  
-P-A-G-E-274
ee ee ee eee ee eRe : | ' 
262 SECONDARY EDUCATION _ 
approximate, but not necessarily to follow rigidly, any specific 
set of percentages. In other words, the writer would prefer to 
say that one would expect to find from 5 to 10 per cent A’s, 20 
to 25 per cent B’s, 35 to 4o per cent C’s, 20 to 25 per cent D’s, 
and 5 to ro per cent E’s in each reasonably large group of our 
public-school pupils (say 100 or more). Furthermore that this 
device ought to be used merely as a rough check upon the total 
distribution of marks in various divisions of the scale for large 
numbers of our students and not for single classes. After assign- 
ing one’s marks in a given semester the use of such a device is 
very helpful in making one critical of the accuracy with which he 
has distributed his marks. 
VII. The recent use of the normal curve in distributing marks 
in schools and colleges. The literature of the past three years 
has revealed a number of active attempts by school and college 
administrators to standardize the marking system through the 
use of a theoretical distribution. The aim in general is to cut 
down the variability with which teachers mark, so as to make 
their marks consistent in form of distribution with the abilities 
which they are supposed to measure. Superintendents are be- 
ginning to report systematic endeavors to get teachers to distribute 
their marks in rough accordance with the normal curve. A num- 
ber of these attempts have made use of a five-division scheme 
which shows the following percentages: 5, 20, 50, 25. An article 
reported by Superintendent Walls, of Kent, Ohio, presents data 
illustrative of the success attained by school administrators 
in changing the distribution of teachers’ marks from the badly 
“skewed” form which we commented on earlier in the article to 
one more closely approximating symmetry. To illustrate con- 
cretely the results of such adjustments in administration we quote 
from one of his tables which gives the percentile distribution 
of marks for five successive semesters under both his old system 
and his new one. 
VIII. The need for clear word-descriptions of ability” in our 
marking system. ‘These proposed reforms have to do with the 
general adequacy, with the general validity, of the teacher’s meas- 
urement of pupil-ability. Thus far the workers in this field 
have proposed the standardization of the marking system pri- 
marily through the use of theoretical distribution-curves which are 
believed to represent the distribution of ability in the general

population. What we have done in the movement up to date is 
to translate our desire for scale measurement in marking pupils 
‘into a system of numbers, or into a system of letters, without 
defining clearly what the letter or number represents. Now in 
the practical adaptation of a marking scale either letter or nu- 
merical, an important consideration faces the administrator: how 
shall various degrees of ability-to-do in school children be defined? 
It seems quite clear that neither the number nor the letter has 
carried a common meaning to the student, to the teacher, and to 
the administrator alike. We must not forget that these three 
groups, students, teachers, and administrators, have to “think 
together” concerning school marks, and our aim is to build a 
marking system simple and economical to administer, and yet one 
which will enable these three sets of minds to agree on the marks 
to be put on the results of instruction. Now the common avenue 
of communication is words. We think together only when we 
use words in communicating, about whose connotation there is 
no doubt. Hence in our’ practice of using letters and numbers 
we have forsaken a worded system of measures or marks and 
have made use of a set of letters, or, worse still, a set of numbers 
whose meaning has not been interpreted in commonly used words. 
Hence the differences in interpretation; hence the bickering about 
79, 78, 81, 80, etc.; hence the ridiculous, yes, criminal practice 
of failing children at 69 or 68 when the passing mark is 70! of 
If this is one of the chief causes of our marking difficulties the

ultimate remedy stands out clearly: substitute Saat word-state- 
ments for abstruse literal and numerical symbolism. First, the 
marking system for each subject of study should consist of a set 
of word-descriptions of “ability” for various grades of students; 
secondly, these statements, these standards, should be expressed 
in words common to the thinking of pupil, teacher, and adminis- 
trator; thirdly, they should be brought to the attention of each 
group constantly enough to result in thorough acquaintance with 
the marking standards and in relatively accurate use of them. 
That is, they should be printed, charted, and placed before 
teacher and pupil constantly. If not in the textbook, then in 
charts on the walls of the classroom, in printed statements to be 
pasted into the textbook, in printed folders to be sent home to 
parents. Instead of being told that John’s mark is 79 in mathe- 
matics or 92 in English, pupils and parents alike should be told 
that John’s mark represents the ability to do such and such 
things, to write equal to 60 on the Ayres scale, to spell success- 
fully a given proportion of the eighth-grade words in such and 
such a list, etc. Definiteness of understanding on the part of 
all concerned should be the outcome of the setting up of such 
standards. It is a difficult thing to do, this writing out of word- 
statements of degrees of ability. It is, however, one of the most 
important co-operative tasks of teacher and administration. 
IX. The importance of “ranking” pupils in order of ability. 
There are two possible approaches to the problem of recon- 
structing our marking practice. One involves the use of an abso- 
lute definition of ability, the other the use of measurement by 
relative position. Teachers and administrators can and ought to 
make use of the helpful practice of marking pupils by ranking 
them first in order of ability, following up the ranks thus obtained 
by approximate assignment to the various letter or number 
groups of the marking scale. This in turn should be checked 
up by distributing pupils to different groups by the use of some 
such percentile allotment of the normal distribution as 5 to 10, 
20 to 25, 35 to 40, 20 to 25, and 5 to 10 for successive fifths 
of the scale. Lacking an approximate statement of absolute abil- 
ities such as would be represented by a detailed word-statement 
of various grades of ability the teacher can rank pupils in order 
of ability, at least in descending groups of ability, and thereby 
measure them by their relative position in the total groups. This 
relative position can, closely enough for practical puposes and
-P-A-G-E-277
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 265 
also fairly easily, be turned into definite marks by assigning cer- 
tain approximate percentages of the entire pupil population to 
various groups, deciding the “border-line” cases perhaps on sub- 
jective judgment. 
The placing of the passing mark. If we assume the normal 
curve as the foundation of our distribution of ability and then 
divide the marking scale into a given number of parts we auto- 
matically establish either one of two important facts, (1) the 
value of the passing mark and (2) the proportion of pupils who 
ought to fall in the various divisions of the scale. If we make 
use of the whole roo per cent scale, assume the normal curve 
as representing the distribution of ability, assume the proportion 
of our group of pupils above which we shall not permit ourselves 
to fail students, then we find our passing mark locating itself 
somewhere in the region of 15 to 20 on the scale. That is to say, 
instead of setting up an arbitrary number, such as 70 or 75, which 
has no direct meaning in terms of pupil-ability, we now set up 
an upper numerical limit concerning the number of pupils who 
evidently are unable to master the essentials of our courses of 
study. If we take as this upper limit, say, 5 to 10 per cent, per- 
haps 7 or 8, then examination of the area of the probability-curve 
shows us that if we go over, say, 20 points on the base line from 
the o point at the left we have included roughly ro per cent of 
the area of the curve. If our “limit” of failure is smaller, then 
our “passing mark” will be lower. Furthermore the specific loca- 
tion of the position of any pupil on this scale of ability may be 
defined rigidly in terms both of relative position and of absolute 
numerical score. An individual who receives a mark of 75, for 
example, is now an individual located definitely with respect to 
rank in the group, provided the group distributes in ability in 
accordance with the area of the curve which has been used. 
X. A program for the reconstruction of the marking system. 
As a summary statement of the present status of thought the 
following steps are both desirable and practicable as means of 
thoroughly rebuilding our public-school marking system: 
1. The evident lack of reliability and consistency in teachers’ 
marks and their evident inaccuracy as measures of ability demand 
of administrators the initiation of campaigns of education among 
their teachers to a recognition of the importance of the facts set 
forth. In the carrying on of such campaigns helpful adminis- 
trative devices have been found to be:  
-P-A-G-E-278
266 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
(a) The publication of the distribution of teachers’ marks each 
semester in open bulletins. 
(b) The discussion of these bulletins in teachers’ meetings. 
(c) Insistence that each teacher tabulate and plot graphs of 
her distribution of marks each semester before submitting them 
to the office. 
(d) Requiring reading and discussion of the use of distribution- ‘ 
curves in marking. 
(e) Insistence that each teacher rank her pupils prior to as- 
signing final marks, whether on examination, “paper,” “quiz,” or 
semester’s work. 
(f) The appointment of departmental committees with in- 
struction to define, in detailed word-statements, each grade of 
ability represented on the marking scale. 
(g) The use of objective scales and tests in all those subjects 
and for all those types of subject-matter for which such tests and 
scales are now available. 
(h) The use of “general-ability” tests for purposes of classi- 
fying pupils and of detecting various grades of ability in our 
pupils early in the course of instruction. 
2. If letters are now used in a school system certainly each 
one should be merely a symbol to signify the abilities-to-do which 
have been defined in very detailed worded statements, understood 
alike by teacher, administrator, and pupil, in terms of which the 
instruction has constantly been oriented. 
3. If numbers are used they should be employed only as 
economical symbols to represent the various groups or divisions 
of the marking scale; that is, only one number (for example, the 
median one) should be used to typify a group of marks (as, for 
example, the “excellent” group, the “A” group), instead of using, 
as is now common, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Thus 
the only numbers used would be such clearly separated numbers 
as 95, 90, 85, etc. Numbers in themselves would cease to have 
the “picayunish” absolute differences in meaning that they pre- 
tend to now and would merely stand for abilities which have been 
distinguished clearly through detailed worded statements. 
4. As a practical and helpful tool in the adequate measurement 
of student work, measurement by ranking with subsequent trans- 
mutation to absolute marks by means of a distribution-curve 
(preferably the normal probability-curve) is very desirable.

Individual differences in interests. The interests of high-school 
pupils have been surveyed in a number of ways. For example, 
pupils have been asked to state their preferences for different 
forms of literature and for different school subjects. They have 
also been asked to report upon extra-curricular activities which 
interest them. The following account of the mathematical in- 
terest of pupils illustrates this kind of investigation. 
MATHEMATICAL INTERESTS OF HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS* 
By Watter F, Downey 
The purpose of this investigation is to obtain from high school 
pupils a frank statement regarding their interests and prefer- 
ences in the study of mathematics. The schools selected are of 
different types and sizes, and are geographically widely separated, 
so that the material should be fairly representative of the attitude 
and opinions of pupils in this subject of the high school curricu- 
lum. In order to obtain an honest expression of opinion from 
the pupils, the replies were in writing, without signature, and 
those who conducted the inquiry in each school were asked to 
impress upon the pupils the purpose of the investigation.

Q- no   
The preceding data indicate, in general, that more than four- 
fifths of the pupils studying mathematics “like” the subject. The 
highest percentage is 91%; the lowest 66%; the average of all 
schools is 84%. The variation seems to have no bearing on the 
size or locality of the school. The four schools with the highest 
percentages are very widely separated, and are near the two ex- 
tremes in size, while we have the same thing true of six schools 
with the lowest. percentages. 
In only one school was mathematics found to be required of 
all pupils for four years. The other schools have the subject 
required from two to four years in some courses, with no re- 
quirement in others. In one state represented, which has a state 
wide school organization, with a state university, there is no 
mathematical requirement in the high school curriculum. The 
schools which reported from this state have slightly above the 
average result. In the school with the highest mathematical re-

combined report and are so given above.

quirement the percentage compares favorably with the record of 
other schools and with the average. 
In a few schools a comparison was made on the basis of sex. 
The totals of these schools showed that 85% of the boys, and 
84% of the girls like mathematics. In comparing the coeduca- 
tional schools with those exclusively for boys or for girls, there 
does not appear enough variation to conclude that there is any 
marked difference on the basis of sex. 
Il. Why do pupils like or dislike mathematics? The distri- 
bution of reasons for liking the subject, as given up by 5788 
pupils, is as follows: 
  
  Goop Exact InTER- Goop Miscet. No UsEFUL MENTAL Easy AND ESTING TRamine Derinire | TEACHER | Reasons | REASON 
  
41% | 22% 19% 12% 27% 1% 1% 27%   
The reasons assigned by 1036 pupils for disliking the subject 
are as follows: 
  
Duty ANp REQUIRES 
  Uninterestinc | 100 Drevicunr Nor UsErut He sGeeke No Reason 
277% 4370 9% 1% 207%   
On the basis of interest, there is a wide variation, 57% in one 
school assigning this as a reason for liking mathematics and 15% 
in another, a range of 42%. On the basis of usefulness there is 
a range of 27%; in mental training the range is 33%; on being 
“easy,” the range is 22%. This would seem to indicate a great 
variety of reasons for motivation in different schools, and, per- 
haps, a great variation in the emphasis of mathematical values 
urged by instructors. 
The striking feature in the reasons for disliking the subject is 
that over two-fifths of the pupils who dislike it find it too difficult 
and one-fifth have no reason for their attitude. 
Ill. What topics in algebra are considered by pupils (a) the 
most popular, (b) the most unpopular? 
(a) On the basis of the returns received, the topics liked best 
by pupils in the order of! the number of pupils who selected them

are (1) the equation, (2) the four fundamental operations, (3) 
factoring, (4) problems. Other topics receiving enough attention 
to justify notice but selected by a much smaller number of pupils 
are the graph, square root, and logarithms. 
The reasons for selecting the four most popular topics are 
assigned as follows:

(b) As may be anticipated the same topics also receive the 
greatest attention by pupils in discussing their dislikes. Sym- 
bols of aggregation, fractions and surds also are disliked, but by a 
smaller number. 
The reasons for dislike are distributed as follows:

It seems obvious from the above that the main bases for choice 
of topics in algebra are (1) facility in doing the work, (2) in- 
terest in the topic. As a cause for dislike the question of diffi- 
culty outweighs all other reasons combined. 
In a few schools pupils who had studied both algebra and plane 
geometry were asked to express their preference. Algebra proved 
to be the choice of 20% more pupils than plane geometry.

ence. On this basis English was first, with 25%; mathematics 
and drawing in second place, with 23% each; Latin and science 
next, with 22% each, while German and Spanish occupy last 
places with 13% and 11%, respectively. Choices beyond the 
fifth are excluded in this table; also subjects which only a few 
pupils selected. 
Conclusions. Mathematics is liked by more than four-fifths 
of the pupils who study it.? 
Although there is great variation, the result stated above is 
entirely independent of the size of the school. 
Pupils “like” mathematics mainly on the basis of general in- 
terest, usefulness and the mental training involved, while they 
dislike it mainly because of its difficulty. 
In algebra, the topics which are favorites, are those selected 
mainly because they appear the “easiest,” while those least 
favored are so stated on the basis of being “too difficult.” 
At the present time, manipulation appears to be as popular with 
pupils as the applications of such work. This, possibly is due to 
the emphasis still given to the former in most schools. 
In geometry, constructions are very popular, while original 
exercises are equally unpopular. The former fact encourages a 
stronger appeal to the motor minded pupil, while the latter sug- 
gests a limitation of difficulty, and proper emphasis on the prac- 
tical use of geometry with the necessary contact to the life 
‘experience of the pupil. 
In popularity with pupils, mathematics compares well with the 
other common subjects of the curriculum. 
The gradual mental development of children. Until recent 
years, knowledge about the mental development of children was 
derived mainly from anecdotes and uncontrolled and unstandard- 
ized forms of measurement. Dewey, for example, observed the 
activities of children of the primary grades and found those chil- 
?%In 1916 Professor Hanus of Harvard, and Mr. Gaylord made a study 
of eleven schools in New England cities to determine the pupils’ likes and 
dislikes of this subject. They reported that 18.8% disliked mathematics. 
It is interesting to note that the two results point to the above conclusion 
although one was made on the basis of a study of larger schools in one 
section of the country, while the present investigation includes schools 
widely separated and varying greatly in size.

dren exhibiting, by their actions, evidences of reasoning analogous 
to that of adults when working under similar conditions. Many 
parents as well as teachers have observed evidences of the same 
general character in the case of children below school age and 
in case of others in all the grades of school. 
Likewise, in the case of children’s interests in different types of 
activities, there are ample evidences of an early beginning of 
a diversity of interests. Adventure, for example, manifests itself 
as early as the infant begins to explore his world and test his 
ambulatory powers. No greater is the infant’s apparent interest . 
in adventure than that of the youth, or of the mature individual: 
so long as mental activities operate sufficiently to make life in- 
teresting, mankind welcomes adventure. Equally normal is the 
tendency to make collections of odd pebbles, postage stamps, 
money, or rare books, according to the age and the individual: 
few persons are too young to lay claim to certain property and 
few too old to find pleasure in adding certain prizes to their store. 
Recently developed technique has made possible the more ac- 
curate measurement of certain mental traits. By successive 
measurements of these traits, corroboration of the theory that 
children develop gradually has been obtained. 
RATE OF MENTAL GROWTH, AGES NINE TO FIFTEEN” 
By Fowter D. Brooxs _- 
The results of annual re-tests of one hundred seventy-one 
children, ages nine to fifteen, of various economic and social 
groups (as to mehtal.ability, more highly selected at the earlier 
ages than at the later ones), give evidence that the rate of mental 
growth, as measured gnnually, is very nearly a straight-line af- 
fair, and is approximately the same for each year for school 
population of these ages. 
No nine- or ten-year-olds below the advanced fourth grade were 
tested. No children beyond the third year of the junior high 
school (grade IX) were tested. These limits cut off younger

children of less ability and older children of more ability. Dewey, 
Child, and Ruml,’! making a careful selection from three thou- 
sand New York City public school children, so as to secure an 
unselected school population, found that 34 per cent of the nine- 
year-old boys and 34 per cent of the nine-year-old girls were 
below grade IV, while 38 per cent to 46 per cent were in the be- 
ginning IV. Of the ten-year-old boys 16 per cent were in or 
below the beginning grade IV, while 26 per cent of the ten-year- 
old girls were similarly classified. Since we did no testing below 
the advanced IV, and since the testing was done at the end of 
the school year, it is seen that the nine- and ten-year-olds repre- 
sent a more highly selected group than those of later ages. This, 
of course, is upon the basis of grade reached in a carefully graded 
and carefully supervised school as an index of ability. 
Under these circumstances we would expect greater gains in 
the earlier years in those functions which we think of as being 
more closely associated with intellectual ability. The curves for 
memory, higher and informational functions seem to show this, 
or rather, are to be interpreted with this fact in mind. Without 
doubt a few children of superior ability were not tested at the 
later ages, having already completed the ninth grade. 
Then, too, quite a number of the older children made such 
high scorces at their first testing that at later re-tests there was no 
opportunity to show much gain in gross score in some of the 
tests (e.g., a twelve-year-old spelling fifty-seven of a sixty word 
test, could not show the same improvement in gross score during 
the two following years as could a ten-year-old who spelled 
twenty-six words at his initial testing; nor could a thirteen-year- 
old, having an initial score of 182 out of a possible 190 in reading 
vocabulary gain as much as a ten-year-old scoring 128). There 
are enough of such cases to account for much of the decrease 
shown in rate in several of the tests. Then, too, to make a gain 
of two points from a high initial gross score probably represents 
greater absolute improvement than the same gain in points from 
a lower initial score. These two considerations (such high initial 
scores as allow no chance for much improvement in gross score, 
and the significance of small increases in gross scores from high 
initial scores) account for much of the decrease shown at the 
later ages, and, when considered in connection with the effect 
™ Dewey, Child, and Ruml: “Methods and Results of Testing School 
Children,” 1920.
-P-A-G-E-287
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 275 
of selection at the earlier ages, indicate that the rate of mental 
growth is probably very nearly constant from nine to fifteen for 
school population. 
Significant sex differences in the rate of mental growth are 
not shown. Combining results for boys and girls of the same 
ages, we have twenty-four to forty-five cases of each age group. 
Space permits but very brief mention of the light our data 
throw upon the doctrine of compensation. The correlations be- 
tween the gains in the different groups of functions have been 
calculated by the Pearson product-moment formula, age and sex 
having been equalized. These coefficients, uncorrected for attenu- 
ation, are positive but low, varying from 0.04 to 0.31. These 
indicate that gain in one group of functions is not accompanied by 
loss or decrease in another group, as has often been stated. 
It is further seen that mental growth is here found to be at 
a regular rate from year to year, and not characterized by sudden 
spurts. Of course, it may well be contended that such spurts 
do occur but that the annual re-tests do not show them; that, if 
we had a great number of reliable individual mental growth 
curves—curves showing growth during a period of years by three- 
or four-month intervals—we might find spurts. This contention 
involves at least the three following considerations: 
First—We must not overlook the fact that the doctrine of 
spurts, is based, not upon extensive experimental evidence, but 
upon observation and reasoning by analogy from physical de- 
velopment; that experimental evidence seems to indicate regu- 
larity rather than irregularity. 
Second.—We do not now have, and in the present state of 
development and educational tests and scales it is doubtful if 
we can secure such reliable individual mental growth curves as 
are needed to settle this question. To do so we need tests of 
a very high degree of reliability; .for many functions we need 
enough alternates of demonstrated equivalence that two tests may 
be given at any one time (say one day to one week apart) and, 
three or four testings per year may be made without introducing 
the practice effect that would come from using the same form of 
a test or more times a year. We need, also, to be sure that all 
who are being tested have a certain ‘familiarity with test pro- 
cedures, so that the improvement due to becoming more used to 
tests, may be reduced to a minimum. -These are special consid- 
erations in addition to the usual standard procedures. _ 
Third—The re-test method may be called in question on
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
account of the limitations due to our present lack of an adequate 
number of reliable tests. It may be urged that this deficiency 
may be overcome if, instead of the re-test method, we test many 
thousands of each age, grouping them by quarter-years of age. 
Bureaus of research that have a broad program of measurement 
can supply much valuable data of this kind. Such bureaus, how- 
ever, by using suitable individual record cards, and by following 
a consistent program of testing from year to year, will also have 
valuable data for such studies of individual mental growth as 
our present (and of course, future) tests and scales enable us 
to make. The re-test method, despite the limitations placed upon 
it by our present tests and scales, has certain well-recognized, 
fundamental advantages, long ago pointed out by Thorndike. 
Conclusions—(1) We have seen that the re-tests of this group 
of one hundred seventy-one children, ages nine to fifteen, by a 
large battery of tests, show mental growth to be at a rate prob- 
ably very nearly constant from year to year. The variations from 
straight-line development at a constant rate are probably best 
interpreted as due to selection at the earlier ages, to the presence 
of numerous high scores at the later ages, and to the small 
number of cases. 
2. No significant sex differences in rate of mental development 
are found. 
3. Regularity, rather than irregularity, seems to characterize 
mental development as measured at yearly intervals. 
4. Increase in ability in one group of functions does not seem 
to be accompanied by a decrease in ability in some other group. 
5. Wherever careful testing is done, individual cumulative rec- 
ords of test results should be kept. Such procedure, if properly 
standardized, will give an increasingly large amount of very val- 
uable data on the problem mental development of school 
children, and will give it with a minimum <of extra expenditure 
of time and money. y 
ON THE IMPROVEMENT IN INTELLIGENCE SCORES FROM 
FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN * 
By E. L. Tuornpixe 
Adults measured by the intelligence tests in common use attain 
scores little if any above those made by 14-year-old children in 
“The Journal of Educational Psychology, XIV, 513-516. December, 
1923. Tables of data are contained in the original article.
-P-A-G-E-289
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 277 
school; and this has given rise to the conclusion that in general 
intelligence does not improve after that age. On the other hand, 
whenever repeated measurements have been made over an in- 
terval of a year or more upon the same individuals initially 14 
or 15, there has been a marked improvement. The data from 
repeated measurements need, however, some allowance for the 
special practice in taking the tests themselves, and the amount of 
this has not been known with surety. 
In May, 1922, 4473 pupils in Grade IX, 4304 in Grade X, and 
3544 in Grade XI in various high schools were tested with an 
examination representing composite or recognized group tests 
of intelligence. In May, 1923, the pupils in Grades X, XI, and 
XII of the same schools were tested with an alternate form of 
the same examination. 2790 + 3136 + 2638 of the original 
4473 + 4304 + 3544 were among those measured in 1923, rep- 
resenting (except for temporary absences or removals to other 
cities) those who had continued in school a year. 
After making due allowance for special practice effects, there is 
found to be a gain due to growth and training. This gain is 
11.1 points. The method for allowing for special practice is 
explained in the original article. 
What this average gain of 11.1 in a year amounts to may be 
realized from the fact that it is about one-third of the mean 
square deviation of individuals in Grades IX, X, and XI, in 
first-trial score with the examination or about one-half of what 
their mean square deviation would be if they were perfectly mea- 
sured. Since the variability of the high school population in 
Grades IX to XI may be estimated to be at least half that of 
all 14-year-olds, and since the mean square deviation of all 
14-year-olds may be estimated as 23 months of mental age, mea- 
sured by Stanford Binet or about 21 months if perfectly mea- 
sured, our gain may be set as equivalent to at least 10 months 
of mental age around 14. It is thus a gain of considerable 
magnitude. 
The gain is very closely the same for all pupils in Grade IX, in 
Grade X, and in Grade XI, in 1922, the medians being 22.4, 
23.6, and 23.4 for the entire gain, or 10.5, 11.7, and 11.5 if 
11.9 is subtracted from each for the effect of special practice with 
the tests. Any decrease in gain with age, if such there be, is 
offset by the selection of those more capable of gain.

COMPARATIVE VARIABILITY AT DIFFERENT AGES * 
By V. A. C. Henmon anp W. F. Livincston 
There is a widespread belief which frequently finds expression 
in the literature of education, that individual differences are 
greater during adolescence than at any other time in life and 
that the development from childhood to adolescence is not gradual 
but saltatory. G. Stanley Hall is the chief proponent of this 
doctrine. Concerning the adolescent period he says: “The human 
plant circumnutates in a wider and wider circle, and the endeavor 
should be to prevent it from prematurely finding a support, to 
prolong the period of variation to which this stage of life is 
sacred... .”** “The possibility of variation in the soul is now 
at its height.”'® “The forces of growth now strain to the utter- 
most against old restrictions. It is the age of bathmism, or more 
rapid variation, which is sometimes almost saltatory.’”*° “Indi- 
vidual differences of all kinds are now suddenly augmented.’*” 
“The range of individual differences and average errors in all 
physical measurements and all psychic test increases.””"® 
This theory has important practical applications and its influ- 
ence is plainly visible in our present systems of school organiza- 
tion. The contention that youth is the period of great fluctua- 
tion and that therefore throughout the high school age there is 
a decided increase in variability in all mental functions implies 
that the secondary school should provide a wider range of elec- 
tions in the curriculum, smaller classes and more individualiza- 
tion of instruction, and a greater versatility in methods of 
presentation of subject matter in order to appeal to the widely 
varying characteristics of a high school class. On the other hand 
(and this is the more serious consideration), the implied greater 
similarity between children in the grades offers an excuse for 
larger classes, for poorer teachers, and for forcing all pupils 
though the same processes and by the same methods until the 
approach of adolescence.

While thousands of children have been tested in a great variety 
of mental and physical traits, the writers have been unable to 
locate any systematic review of the available evidence on this 
supposedly greater variability during adolescence. It is a curious 
fact that in spite of the importance of the theory, no one appears 
to have taken the trouble to present the evidence for it, much less 
question its correctness. Common observation, confirmed by 
more exact study, shows the wider variability in height and weight 
at adolescence and, by analogy, the law appears to have been 
extended to mental traits without adequate investigation. 
This study represents an examination of the comparative vari- 
abilities as revealed in some of the most representative studies 
of mental and physical development. Those investigations were 
used in which the numbers of cases were large, in which the vari- 
abilities have been determined, and in which norms for a wide 
range of ages were available. 
The variabilities for different ages were rendered comparable 
by determining the coefficient of variation, obtained by dividing 
the measure of central tendency (average or median) by the mea- 
sure of variability (average deviation, standard deviation, or 
probable error). This is merely finding the per cent that the 
variability is of the central tendency from which the deviations 
were obtained. Whatever measures of central tendency or vari- 
ability were used by the investigator were used for our calcula- 
tions. While the essential problem was to compare variabilities 
at different ages, the variability in different grades is practically 
as important and this was determined in several sample cases. 
Incidentally, also, the ratios of female to male variability were 
calculated for the light they might throw on the mooted question 
of the variability of the sexes. 
Variability in physical traits. The comparative variabilities in 
height, weight, and lung capacity were computed from the data 
of Burk,'® Baldwin,?° and Gilbert.2" Various other physical char- 
acteristics were studied also but not reported here. In the interest

of economizing space and to prevent confusion in examining tables, 
only the total numbers and not the number of cases at each age 
are given. The number of cases is in all cases sufficiently large 
to make the coefficients reliable. 
An examination of the data shows for height and weight ap- 
proximately constancy in the coefficients for boys up to the age 
of 12% years, with a sudden rise to the high point at 14 
or 14% years and a decrease thereafter. The highest points for 
the three sets of measurements for height are at 1414, 154, and 
14 years respectively. For weight the high points are 13% and 
14 years, The same general tendency holds for girls except that 
with them the highest point is reached roughly two years earlier. 
In weight the highest points are at 1234, 1314, and 12 respec- 
tively. In weight the highest point is at 12 years in Baldwin’s 
results and in Gilbert’s data at 12 and 14 years. Both in height 
and weight, then, theory seems to hold for not only are the vari- 
abilities greatest at adolescence but the development is saltatory. 
Particular interest attaches to this table for height and weight 
are the only traits which we have been able to find where a 
large number of cases have been studied, in which the theory does 
hold, with one exception. The measurements of lung capacity, 
based on about fifty cases for each age, show no evidence of 
greater variability or saltation at adolescence. 
Variability in mental traits. Coefficients of variability in men- 
tal traits were computed for the data reported by Gilbert,?? 
Pyle,” and Bickersteth.* In Gilbert’s results there are about 
fifty cases at each age. In Pyle’s norms the number of cases 
varies widely. A detailed examination of these data shows that 
the period of greatest variability in mental traits is during the 
years of childhood, not at adolescence. The coefficients tend to 
decrease with fair uniformity from childhood to adulthood. There 
is no evidence whatsoever of increasing variability or saltation. 
On the contrary, the decrease in variability is as unmistakable as 
it has been shown to be in practically all special mental traits. 
Variability in mental traits by grades. Even if there is no 
evidence for increasing variability and saltation with age, it might

still be urged that, after all, pupils are not classified in school 
on the basis of age and that on a classification according to grade, 
a wider range of differences at adolescence might reveal itself. 
Many such measurements have been made but only two will be 
reported here. The first are the coefficients for five of the

The results show a rapid decrease up to the fifth grade and a

Discussion and conclusions. It is evident that the law of in- 
creasing variability at adolescence does not hold for mental traits, 
so far as the groups for which measurements are available are 
concerned. On the contrary, there is in the school groups a 
marked reduction in variability at adolescence as contrasted with 
childhood. How is this reduction to be accounted for, particu- 
larly in view of the results of experiments on the effects of equal 
practice on individual differences, which have uniformly shown 
that differences do not decrease but rather increase when oppor- 
tunities for practice are equalized? In a certain sense it may be

true that the range of differences is greater at adolescence if we 
include at each age the mentally deficient whose abilities in any 
test would be zero. School children from whom norms in mental 
tests are usually obtained are a selected group. Even so, in view 
of the large reduction in the coefficients, it is pretty certain that 
the average variability would not show an increase with age, 
provided a proportionate number of borderline and feebleminded 
children were tested and these results included in the distribu- 
tions. In any case, the pedagogical inferences are based on the 
normal school population. Selection by eliminating those at the 
lower end of the distribution curve accounts, then, in part for the 
reduced variability found but not for all of it. 
Inadequacy of training causes a narrowing of the distribution 
at the upper end. It has been shown over and over again that 
under proper stimulation, a very great increase in efficiency in 
mental functions is obtainable even in those traits which in the 
ordinary circumstances of life are much practiced. In other 
words, there are possibilities of very great increases in efficiency 
in the upper ranges which are not realized and are not revealed 
in the test norms actually obtained. The norms, for example, for 
the Courtis Tests are considerably lower than they would be if 
the stimulus of experimental conditions were provided.*® There

is then no contradiction between these findings and the experi- 
ments on the effects of equal practice on individual differences. 
Under ordinary conditions, the effects of equalizing practice is 
to reduce individual differences since a certain modicum of ef- 
ficiency is all that is required. When a sufficient stimulus is 
provided, the upper limit is greatly extended and both the range 
and average variabilities are greatly increased. There is then a 
possibility that individual differences may increase at adolescence 
but there is not evidence that they actually do. 
What we need for a final answer to the problem is repeated 
measurements of a greater number of unselected individuals over 
the entire period of childhood and adolescence. Such data are, 
of course, nowhere to be found now. 
Principles derived from discussions of pupils’ mental equip-

in the standardization of the rate of promotion. 
From the freshman to the senior year there is commonly a 
steady decrease in the number of failures. Reasons for this 
diminution indicate that the percentages of pupils who pass de- 
pend upon the school as well as upon the pupils themselves. 
That is, high-school failures are attributable to teachers, teaching 
equipment, and school policies as well as to pupils’ inabilities. 
Standards for passing as well as those for excellence should be 
set with reference to social demands, pupils’ abilities, the school’s 
ability to offer beneficial training, and the amount of the whole 
roo per cent scale used in assigning marks, 
The variability, the unreliability, and the inconsistency in the 
distribution of marks necessitate an overhauling of present-day 
systems of marking. 
Teachers’ marks should indicate pupils’ ability-to-do, this 
having been estimated from specific pupil-performances. 
Such matters as interest, effort, moral qualities, and attitude 
as contributing to the specific performance of pupils should be 
considered in assigning marks. 
As a result of the variability and unreliability among the

marks given by different teachers, the interval between assigned 
marks should be approximately equivalent to 8 per cent. 
As a rough check upon the distribution of marks, one should 
recognize both the advantages and the limitations of the normal 
probability curve. 
Literal and numerical marks should be readily referable to 
clear word-descriptions of the marks. 
Marks should be assigned by first ranking pupils in order of 
ability and then placing them within the approximate group on 
the marking scale. 
All school subjects find favor with pupils. The amount and 
quality of pupils’ interests depend upon’ the quality of teaching 
and the relation of each given subject to pupils’ imagination or 
real life. 
From infancy to adulthood, children’s capacities gradually 
develop. Ordinarily the capacities develop concomitantly to the 
extent that educative means are evenly distributed with refer- 
ence to the different tendencies. By special emphasis, that is, by 
exposure to certain educative processes, certain traits can be 
disproportionately developed. 
An increase in ability in one group of functions does not seem 
to be accompanied by a decrease in ability in some other group. 
There are no significant sex differences in the rate of mental 
development. 
So far as groups for which measurements are available are 
concerned, there is in school groups a marked reduction in vari- 
ability at adolescence as contrasted with childhood. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND piscussion 
1. Make a list of the qualities which characterize high school 
pupils of each of the following groups: excellent, good, fair, poor, 
failing. 
2. Place the letter x before the qualities which can be easily 
measured, the letter y before the qualities which can be readily 
estimated, and the letter z before any qualities which are immeas- 
urable.

INTELLIGENCE AND ITS MEASUREMENT? 
By V, A. C. Henmon 
1. The nature and measurement of intelligence. Intelli- 
gence, in the ordinary acceptance of the term, has been defined 
by Lester F. Ward to be “intellect coupled with the product of 
its operation,” or in other words, “intelligence is intellect plus 
knowledge.” This certainly corresponds to the use of the term 
in pedagogical and sociological theory and in practical life. The 
intelligent man is the well informed man and one who is capable 
of readily appropriating information or knowledge. Without do- 
ing violence to language the psychologist can not give it any other 
technical significance. Intelligence, then, involves two factors— 
the capacity for knowledge and knowledge. possessed. The 
untutored savage or barbarian may have high intellectual capac- 
ity, but without knowledge we should not ordinarily call him an 
intelligent man. We could best only say that he had a fine 
mind, a fine intellect, high intellectual power, or else that he pos- 
sessed a high native intelligence. But native intelligence from 
the point of view of this definition is a misnomer, as is also the 
customary distinction between intelligence tests and achievement 
tests. Nothing but confusion results from using the term intelli- 
gence to designate the level reached in the acquisition of knowl- 
edge or mental age, in which sense it is something which can be 
developed and trained, and using the same term to designate in- 
tellectual capacity or mental alertness which is probably given 
once for all with one’s constitution and can not be materially 
changed by anything we do. Achievement tests, while measures

-P-A-G-E-302
  288 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of knowledge possessed, are in turn indices of capacity for knowl- 
edge, though valueless for comparative purposes of crude, unin- 
structed intellect, only because there has been no guarantee of 
equality of opportunity. Intelligence tests, on the other hand, 
as at present constituted, area mixture in varying proportions 
of tests of knowledge, for example, the constantly recurring tests 
of arithmetical reasoning and of information, with those whose 
novelty is such that specific past experiences function much less 
readily and there is an approximation toward relative equality of 
opportunity. In any case, both groups of tests are measures of 
both native and acquired intelligence with differences in emphasis. 
The high correlations between intelligence tests and achievement 
tests and the high correlations between intelligence tests and 
teachers’ estimates or scholastic standings indicate their essential 
similarity. Teachers’ estimates and school marks, which are used 
as measures of reliability and validity of intelligence scales, in 
default of any absolute standard of reference, are based on what 
children know and on their capacity to know. 
Intelligence ought to retain this broad significance. To define 
it with Stern as “a general capacity of an individual consciously 
to adjust his thinking to new requirements,” which is substan- 
tially James’ definition of reasoning, or with Meumann as a gen- 
eral capacity for “independence, originality and productiveness 
in thinking” is to narrow its meaning arbitrarily and to neglect: 
its compound nature. The scholarly or erudite man who has 
merely acquired the knowledge created by others may not rep- 
resent as high a degree of intelligence as one who is independent, 
original and productive in his thinking, but we should scarcely 
say that he is unintellectual. Intelligence is indicated by the 
capacity to appropriate truth and fact as well as by the capacity 
to discover them. 
What we want, of course, is a measure of crude intellect or 
mental alertness as such, a scale for intellect, not a scale for in- 
telligence. Any test which requires mental processes, be they 
either on the sensory-motor level or on higher levels, which mea- 
sures the sensitiveness, responsiveness, and retentiveness of the 
nervous system, is a test of intellectual capacity. It is only be- 
cause of the absence of an absolute standard of reference, the 
inability to discount the effect of past experiences, and the narrow 
conception of the meaning of intelligence, that the tests of higher 
mental processes appear to be better measures of intellect, and 
not because they involve intellectual capacity any more evi-
-P-A-G-E-303
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 289 
dently. The essential thing in a test of pure intellect is to secure 
such novelty as to reduce inequality in opportunity and training 
to a minimum, and such complexity as to reveal differences 
clearly and unambiguously. It is not a matter of the kind of 
mental process involved primarily. A properly constituted test 
of intellect ought, therefore, to take a wide sampling of so-called 
lower as well as higher processes and the relative weights to 
be assigned to each element determined. The tests must be ex- 
tended to measure the capacity to learn in other directions than 
the ability to use words, signs, and symbols. The so-called gen- 
eral intelligence tests are not general intelligence tests at all but 
tests of the special intelligence upon which the school puts a 
premium. The extension of the term intelligence to include what 
Thorndike has called mechanical intelligence, the ability to 
manipulate things, and social intelligence, the ability to manage 
men, means that we need not one, but several scales of intellect 
from which we can secure an intellect profile. We have been 
gradually evolving a type of test for abstract intellect that is of 
use in classification and prognosis in school, but is of no convinc- 
ing value as a measure of general intelligence as such, nor of 
demonstrated value in vocational guidance and direction. 
2. Next steps in research. The construction of group tests 
proceeds apace. Many of them are uncritically and hastily as- 
sembled, hurried into print without norms or standards to sat- 
isfy the demand of some publishing company, and often merely 
rearrangements of familiar material, selected on the basis of the 
author’s opinion of the merits of the component tests. While 
experimentation in test construction is desirable, critical evalu- 
ation of the more important group tests is far in arrears and 
much needed. General mental age determinations from existing 
tests are seriously open to question; the intelligence quotient 
derivatives involve questionable assumptions as to the nature of 
mental growth; the relatively narrow range of functions mea- 
sured in many teams of tests make them invalid as measures of 
general ability; the assignment of equal weight to each test and 
“to each item in the individual tests is surely wrong. These 
matters need careful study with the better known and better 
standardized tests. 
The correlations between the scores in many of the group 
scales as a whole and such standards of reference as we possess 
do not differ very materially. The individual tests, however, 
differ among themselves considerably in diagnostic and prognostic 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
value, in susceptibility to practice, in interest to the one tested, 
in ease of administration and scoring, in relative emphasis on 
previous training and capacity for meeting relatively new situa- 
tions. What is needed clearly is more accurate scaling of the 
items within the individual tests, the reduction in number or 
elimination of tests that test apparently the same or similar func- 
tions, the application of the method of partial correlations to 
determine causal relationships and the correct weights to be as- 
signed to the individual tests in the scale as a whole. Besides 
the refinement in the tests of abstract intellect themselves we 
need also to determine the importance of various character traits 
which apart from intellect as such make for success in the tests. 
Until these things are done we shall be in constant danger of 
misusing the results of tests for classification and prognosis even 
in schools. We are still far from being able to give the signifi- 
cance and meaning of a test score. 
Besides the need for critical evaluation, standardization and 
interpretation of tests of abstract intellect stands the need for 
tests of ability to manipulate things and the ability to deal with 
men, leadership and adaptability in social relationships to com- 
plete the intellect profile suggested above. 
MENTAL GROWTH AND THE I. Q? 
By Lewis M. Terman 
The problems relating to native mental abilities and to the 
developmental changes which come with increasing maturity are, 
and perhaps always will be, among the central problems of edu- 
cational psychology. _We can not adapt the curriculum to the 
child without fairly accurate knowledge of the mental abilities 
which the child for the time being possesses and of the abilities 
which are required to master given types of curricula. We can 
not intelligently plan a child’s later education without more or 
less dependable means of forecasting what abilities he will pos- 
sess sometime in the future. Anything that adds to our knowl- 
edge of mental growth is bound to be of great practical signifi- 
cance for education.» Hence the immense popularity of the 
Binet tests, which for the first time made possible a fairly ser- 
viceable determination of the stage of intellectual maturity which 
a given subject has attained. The value of these tests was even 
*The Journal of Educational Psychology, X11, 325-326. September, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-305
  
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 291 
further enhanced when it was discovered that the intelligence 
quotient maintains, during the growth period at least, a certain 
amount of constancy. In proportion as laws of intellectual devel- 
opment obtain, the door of the future may be opened; determina- 
tion of the child’s present intelligence status will enable us to fore- 
cast, within certain limits of error, what manner of adult he may 
become. 
That rough prediction is now possible on the basis of intelli- 
gence tests can no longer be denied. For example, it is a fairly 
safe prediction that the child who has been completely tested by 
the Binet scale and found to have an I. Q. of 75 will never attain 
an I. Q. of 125, or that an I. Q. of 125 will never, barring definite 
nervous disease, drop to 75. No one would now expect a child 
with an I. Q. of 60 or 70 to be able to graduate from an average 
high school or pursue a college course. These predictions are of 
course very rough, but it is worth something to know that in gen- 
eral there is even a tendency for the superior to remain superior, 
for the average to remain average, and for the inferior to remain 
inferior. The child-study literature of a decade or so ago gave 
wide currency to the view that the typical genius was as a child 
stupid, and that the intellectual precocity is likely to be followed 
by post-adolescent stupidity! To have progressed in ten years 
from this stage of ignorance to the point where we can predict 
with a probable error of 4 or 5 points what I. Q. a given child will 
have several years hence is a long step forward. 
There is no likelihood, however, that even this modest claim for 
the possibility of prediction will go unchallenged: In fact, in- 
sistent challenge has already come, chiefly from two sources. 
First, from teachers and others whose inclination is to believe in 
miracles and to look askance at so-called “laws of growth” on the , 
basis of which we presume to forecast a child’s future. The ac- 
ceptance of such laws is hindered by the deep-seated and blind 
faith that anything is possible for any child. To people who de- 
rive satisfaction from the fact that child nature contains so many 
unknown quantities, the suggestion that one’s final intelligence 
level may be predicted is actually repugnant. 
A challenge no less insistent has been voiced by a number of 
psychologists. It should go without saying that the questions 
raised by any psychologist who has seriously investigated the 
problem are entitled to a hearing. The issues are large enough to 
justify any amount of scientific caution. At the same time it is 
possible that over-zealous attack on a tentative hypothesis may be 
   
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
as inimical to true progress as its over-zealous and dogmatic sup- 
port. I think it can be shown, for example, that some of the re- 
cent criticisms of the I. Q. are based on arguments and data so 
questionable that they are less likely to strengthen than to weaken 
the position they are intended to uphold. In the opinion of some, 
if the I. Q. can be demonstrated to have less than absolute con- 
stancy in a majority of cases, or to be markedly variable in se- 
lected individual cases, or to show a decrease with age in the case 
of feeble-minded subjects, or to be capable of misuse by the igno- 
rant, it is ipso facto worthless and dangerous. 
INTELLIGENCE AND PROGRESS IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS* 
By Marcarer V. Coss 
We can now turn to our data on specific high school subjects, 
and ask what intelligence is required for success in each. In gtn- 
eral, the figures show that the present courses in algebra make as 
great a demand on intelligence as do those in any one subject taken 
in the freshman year, and this will be reported as a sample study. 
More failures occur; more pupils drop out. There is a corre- 
spondence between the score a pupil makes on a general intelli- 
gence test, and the probability of his “passing” the course. There 
is a closer correspondence between his score on a test designed to 
measure mathematical ability, or ability to learn algebra, and the 
probability of his passing the course. It is worth while, if voca- 
tional or educational guidance is to be given, or if sections are to 
be made up on the basis of probable progress, to have both of 
these measures. 
Pupils who elect algebra, or who choose a course including 
algebra, are in general a more intelligent group than those who 
do not; pupils who pass in algebra are in general a more intelli- 
gent group than those who do take it but fail. The groups overlap 
considerably, but the one is definitely better than the other. 
The contrast between the median scores of those who “pass” al- 
gebra and those who fail, or do not take it, is quite striking (in cer- 
tain Michigan schools). In Alma, the median Alpha score of 
freshmen who passed in algebra was 94, while the median of those. 
who failed was 78. In Mt. Clemens the corresponding medians

respect, as well as carry on campaigns for higher teaching stand- 
ards and general educational welfare. Such organizations are 
being promoted among college professors and in our larger cities. 
They need to be extended into our smaller cities, towns, and 
_ Villages as a basis for effective county, state, and national asso- 
* ciations. 
If aggressive teachers’ organizations can be established, the 
development of a professional ethics will speedily follow. In Te- 
. cent years several committees have tentatively formulated the 
principles that ought to govern teachers in their relations to each 
other and to the public. Means are suggested for keeping com- 
petition on a higher plane, for improving the inequitable contract 
now so prevalent, and for the cultivation of a social attitude that 
will relieve the necessity of catering to the whims of patrons and 
the prejudices of boards of education. If these things can be ac- 
“ce greed and an income obtained that will permit a higher 
Hise of living, teachers will gain in self-respect and public esteem. 
A vocational pride, which is the essence of the professional spirit, 
will thus be engendered, and teachers will demand and receive 
the dignified social position that must characterize a true 
profession. 
Salaries and tenure, Improvident though the proverbial 
teacher may be, few questions have greater perennial cogency 
with teachers than questions relating to salaries and tenure of 
position. The following passages indicate present-day conditions 
and tendencies. 
SALARY OUTLOOK FOR HIGH-SCHOOL TEACHERS? 
By H. R. Bonner 
To choose a life-career intelligently three important factors 
about the vocation itself demand consideration—the prepara- 
_ tion required for admission, the remuneration granted to the inex- 
perienced, and future salary assurances, As two-thirds of all 
high-school teachers now hold degrees and since nearly all be- 
ginning high-school teachers are required to hold a baccalaureate 
degree, the first factor may be summarily disposed of as being 
known, This discussion deals with the analysis of the other two 
factors. :

High-school teaching as a career. There is some doubt as 
to whether high-school teaching should be called a life-career. 
In Bulletin No. 50, 1921, of the Bureau of Education, it is shown 
that the “average” (median) high-school teacher has had 
only six years of experience. It does not follow, however, that 
teachers enter this branch of professional service for only six 
years. The rapid expansion of high-school enrolment, at the 
rate of 8 per cent per year, calls for an increasingly larger pro- 
portion of inexperienced teachers annually to care for the in- 
crease in attendance. If the enrolment remained constant, the 
average experience of high-school teachers would be about eleven 
years. A calling which holds its employees for so short a time can 
scarcely be called a life-career. With the advent of higher sal- 
aries the profession promises to become more attractive, and the 
period of service will undoubtedly be much longer. 
Entrance salary. .. . The average teacher now enters the pro- 
fession at an annual salary of $1,297 or a little more than $100 
per month the year round. The entrance salary for men aver- 
ages $1,572 and that for women, $1,184. Thus it is seen that 
beginning. men teachtrs are paid $388 more than women. It 
should not be inferred that all beginners are equally paid. The 
entratieé salaries vary considerably in the different states.. For 
example, in Florida the beginner’s salary is only $960, whereas 
in California the corresponding average is’ $1,886, or about twice 
as mugh. The salaries of beginning men .teachers range from 
' $1,289 in Missouri to $2,154 in California, and the correspond- 
ing averages for women teachers vary from $835 in Virginia to 
$1,760 in California. With such inequalities as these, there is 
great danger that the states paying the higher salaries will at- 
tract the better college graduates, while the states paying the 
lower salaries will be obliged to employ teachers of inferior native 
ability and of more limited training. 
Outlook for the average teacher. The average salary of 
69,358 high-school teachers was found to be $1,678 in 1921. 
This average is only $381, or 29.4 per cent, more than the average 
salary for beginners. The salary outlook for the average teacher, 
therefore, is less than a 30 per cent increase. It should be borne 
in mind that the average outlook does not represent the salary 
assurance for every teacher in the profession. Men and women 
of unusual ability will excel this average even to the extent of 
being advanced to the more remunerative administrative posi- 
tions, while those of inferior ability may fall short of the aver- 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION “167, 
age expectation. The corresponding outlook for men teachers 
is 29.3 per cent and that for women teachers, 27.0 per cent. A 
profession that promises such a meager assurance is not far 
superior to a “blind-alley” job. The slightly higher percentage 
for men may be influenced by the reaction to check the decreas- 
ing proportion of men teachers. The fact that men are now paid 
$529 more per year than women undoubtedly shows that men’s 
services are at a premium. 
The salary outlook for the average teacher varies considerably 
in the different states. For instance, in Delaware the assurance 
is for an increase of only 7.8 per cent; in New York, 64.6 per 
cent. These extremes are unquestionably influenced by the 
longer period of service in New York than in Delaware. In the 
report referred to it is found that 64.3 per cent of the teachers 
in New York state have had over five years’ experience, whereas 
the corresponding proportion in Delaware with such experience 
is only 35.8 per cent. 
Outlook for teachers with over five years’ experience. As 
many high-school teachers drop out of the profession before the 
end of the fifth year, the salary outlook fog those who.remain is 
much larger than has been indicated. It is found that the out- 
look for the teacher who remains longer than five years .i§ for 
an increase of $646, or 49.8 per cent above the entrance salary. 
The corresponding assurance for men is $676, or 43.0 per cent, 
and for women $571, or 48.2 per cent. The promise, thogefore, 
for a long period of service is more favorable to the women than 
to the men. In other words, there is a greater initial induce- 
ment for men than for women to enter the profession, but a 
slightly greater percentage of increase is promised to women than 
to men for a long period of service. 
Premium paid to beginners. To induce young men and wo- 
men to enter the high-school teaching profession during the 
unusual period of the war it was thought necessary to increase 
the salaries of beginning teachers at a more rapid rate than the 
salaries of other teachers. Thus, the salaries of all teachers were 
increased only 52.6 per cent from 1918 to 1921, whereas. the sal- 
aries of beginners were raised 60.9 per cent, or 15.8 per cent 
more. In short, beginners were at a premium of 15.8 per cent. 
In ten states, however, beginners were at a discount; that is, 
their salaries were not raised at as rapid a rate as the salaries 
of other teachers. The premium on beginners reached a maximum 
of 87.8 per cent in Connecticut, and the discount was greatest
-P-A-G-E-310
  
  »\ 
168 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in Delaware where the percentage of increase was 43.9 per cent 
less than that for all teachers combined. Undoubtedly, in states 
in which beginners were at a discount an unusual attempt was 
made to retain teachers already in the service. On the other 
hand, the premium probably indicates an inability to recruit 
teachers in sufficient numbers to maintain the necessary corps of 
instructors. 
This premium-and-discount theory has a direct bearing on the 
salary- outlook for teachers. In states granting a premium to be- 
ginning teachers the salary outlook is not so favorable as it would 
have been ‘had all salaries, regardless of experience, been increased 
at the same rate. On the other hand, in states showing a dis- 
count on beginners the figures indicating the salary expectation 
are relatively large. Thus the salary outlook for Connecticut 
of 27.8 per cent for all teachers is lower than it should be since 
the salaries of beginners were unusually increased in the three- 
year period (87.8 per cent over the average rate). At the other 
extreme, it must be inferred that the low salary outlook of 7.8 
per cent for Delaware is larger than it should be since the sal- 
aries of teachers in service were increased more rapidly than 
those of beginning teachers. In other words, Delaware probably 
has no adequate schedule, either specifically adopted or implied. 
The average premium paid for beginning high-school teachers 
above the average percentage of increase for teachers with over 
five years’ experience is even greater than the premium based on 
the average percentage of increase for all teachers. . . . In other 
words, beginning teachers were granted a percentage of in- 
crease 21 per cent greater than that given to teachers with over 
five years’ experience. This practice, as shown in the bulletin 
referred to, has resulted in a decrease of 2.5 per cent in the pro- 
portion of teachers with over five years’ experience from 1918 to 
1921. This exodus of experienced teachers from the profession 
indicates deterioration in our high-school teaching staff. Again, 
Connecticut and Delaware exhibit extreme conditions. In the 
former state beginning teachers received a percentage of increase 
I1g.1 per cent greater than that given to teachers with five years’ 
experience. In the latter state beginning teachers were awarded a 
percentage of increase 49.9 per cent less than that given to 
teachers with five years’ experience. Beginners in Delaware were 
at a discount of almost 50 per cent in 1921. 
Conclusions. On each count there is sufficient evidence to 
show that beginning teachers were much in demand in 1921 and
-P-A-G-E-311

that more experienced teachers did not receive the consideration 
shown to inexperienced teachers. Boards of education probably 
found that it was easier to hold in the profession teachers who 
had already enlisted than to induce college graduates to enter it. 
The situation reveals an unfairness exercised toward experienced 
teachers. 
The report shows that an attempt seems to have been made to 
offset in part the increasing cost of living by adding a bonus to 
pre-war salaries—a tendency operating in favor of the beginning 
teacher. The average absolute increase for the United States 
from 1918 to 1921 was $578, varying from $315 in Flotida to 
$729 in South Dakota. For beginners the bonus was $571 for 
men, $444 for women, and $491 for both. For teachers with over 
five years’ experience it was $725 for men, $611 for women, and 
$643 for both. These bonuses were not sufficient until May, 1921, 
to meet the increased cost of living and did not meet it until it 
began to drop. The inadequacy of these increments resulted 
in a loss of college graduates amounting to 9 per cent, an in- 
crease of 17 per cent in the proportion of normal-school graduates, 
and an increase of 37 per cent in the proportion of non-graduates. 
Thus it is seen that inadequate pay and promise-to-pay resulted 
in a deterioration which will require many years to counteract. 
If present salary schedules remain as they are, there will be little 
inducement for young men and women of ability to remain in 
the profession. The result will be an ever-shifting teaching staff, 
and higher educational institutions will be called upon to supply 
an extraordinary number of high-school teachers each year to 
take the place of those who discover that the profession offers 
little financial inducement. It would seem, therefore, in view of 
these disclosures, that high schools are called upon to adopt 
salary schedules that will recognize and reward meritorious serv- 
ice and experience in this branch of professional service. The 
salaries of experienced teachers will need to be increased. A vo- 
cation that promises no greater reward than 29.3 per cent for the 
average employee or 49.8 per cent for those who pass the 
five-year mark is not likely to result in a contented personnel and 
will probably not succeed in holding the services of its most 
capable employees.

  “E7O™ SECONDARY EDUCATION 
TENURE OF HIGH-SCHOOL TEACHERS * 
By C. J. ANDERSON 
Some permanency of tenure is essential if a progressive policy 
in high-school instruction is to be realized. How long do the 
teachers in our high schools remain in the same community? The 
statistics show them to be an itinerant group. The size of the 
schools appears to make but little difference to them until they 
are employed in schools having over ten teachers. In these 
schools they are content to remain another year. 
In the two-teacher schools over one-half of the teachers are 
new each second year. Only 3.3 per cent of them have remained 
five years or over. None have remained in the same school more 
than six years. In the schools employing three teachers almost 
60 per cent of the teachers leave by the end of the second year. 
Only four teachers have taught in the same school for more than 
six years. The same story may be told for each group of schools 
with “ight variations here and there. Taking the state as a 
woole, 5.4 per cent of the teachers are new to their present posi- 
ms; about 39 per cent have returned to their communities for 
‘tae second consecutive year. The median for the state is three 
years, made possible by the greater degree of permanency of 
position in those schools employing more than ten teachers. The 
median for those schools employing less than ten teachers is two 
years. 
This is a situation that merits the serious attention of those 
who plan school policies. Teachers should be retained in the 
same communities for longer periods. Their restlessness is no 
doubt due in some measure to the fact that in any given school 
they reach the maximum of the salary schedule in a relatively 
short time. In fact they reach the maximum in salary much 
earlier than they reach the maximum in efficiency. Schedules 
should provide for smaller increases during the apprenticeship 
period and service and efficiency should be recognized in a mone- 
tary way. Statutes providing for permanency of tenure after 
a probationary period would assist in stabilizing these positions. 
This has followed in those cities which place their teachers under 
permanent tenure.

  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION er 
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING TEACHER TENURE LAws‘ 
With the growth of teacher organizations and the study by 
teachers of such professional questions as those of salary, pen- 
sions, and tenure, has come a more careful consideration of the 
underlying principles of all such legislation. There have been 
several recent studies of tenure principles. The following formu- 
lation, that of Ira Richardson, of the University of Oregon 
(slightly modified from the original) appears to represent with 
fair accuracy the conclusions of most of the recent studies of 
tenure: 
I. Principles which should be present and operative prior to 
the institution of tenure laws: 
1. Since education is a State function, a prerequisite training 
for teaching and a probationary period of service prior to perma- 
nent certification should be required by State law. 
2. The State should prescribe a minimum salary schedule 
accompanying stages of probationary service based on scholastic 
and professional training. 
3- Details of salary schedule, bases of promotion or cemotion ' 
to or from grades or levels of salary schedule, ratings and mi 
sures of professional improvement following probationary service 
may be left to local authorities. 
II. Principles which should control in the framing and opera- 
tion of tenure laws: 
1. All tenure laws should be associated with regulations gov- 
erning training, certification, remuneration, and annuities or 
pensions. 
2. Tenure laws should be devised and administered in the 
interest of better instruction for children and as a stimulus to 
better preparation and more efficient service on the part of 
teachers. _ 
3- Participation in the benefits of a tenure law should be 
based on— 
a. Evidence of a satisfactory preliminary training and service 
as shown by legal credentials of scholarship and professional 
training and of certification.

b. Evidence of ability as shown by ratings. 
c. Evidence of professional spirit as shown by professional 
activity and continued study. 
4. Dismissal from service should be based on clearly dem- 
onstrable causes. $ 
5. Suitable provision should be made for those already in 
service without preliminary qualifications. 
6. All groups and classes of public education workers should 
be provided for. 
Professional standards of teachers. Indications that teachers 
are taking their tasks seriously are found in the formulations 
which they themselves are making of teachers’ rights and duties. 
The passages which follow evidence a growth of class conscious- 
ness and also show the rise of a spirit of professionalism which 
is in harmony with the criteria already set up by Professor 
Smith. 
ETHICAL STANDARDS OF THE TEACHER * 
By W. L. Errrncer 
Is it not significant that recently we find bodies of teachers 
in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, and Mississippi dis- 
cussing and adopting codes of professional ethics? Such delib- 
erations and acts are indicative of the fact that the teaching 
profession is attaining a maturity—an adolescence, as it were— 
that inspires a reflective attitude which, in turn, leads to a discus- 
sion and formulation of standards of behavior consonant with 
the dignity of the service which teachers render the community. 
What are such codes of ethics? I presume we may define them 
as a formulation of the ideal relationships that should exist be- 
tween the teacher and the agencies and the persons with whom he 
comes in contact, such as the community, his fellow-teachers, his 
pupils, and those in parental or custodial relation to the pupils. 
Where, you may ask, should we look for the origin of such 
codes? In order to have vitality and significance, such codes 
must find their origin, their growth and their formulation in the 
teaching body and therefore should not be imposed upon teachers 
either from without or from above. They are meaningless, insofar 
® School and Society, XVIII, 568-572. 1923.
-P-A-G-E-315
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 173> 
as they are imposed upon teachers; they are vital and controlling 
insofar as they reflect a sensitive and enlightened professional 
conscience. 
When codes of ethics originate in the teaching body they are 
accepted by teachers as a guide to a type of professional attitude 
and behavior which commands the respect and admiration of all. 
Do not assume that either in a Pickwickian or a Pecksniffian 
sense I am about to impose a code upon you. I understand that 
a representative committee of the New York City Principals’ 
Association is engaged in studying and formulating a code and 
has already made a tentative report. I have no desire to enter 
into competition with such an admirable committee, but in re- 
sponse to your request I will sketch certain general considerations 
which appeal to me as ones that ought to constitute the minimum 
features of such a code. 
Relationship to the community. What obligation does the 
teacher owe to the community, using that term as one sufficiently 
elastic to include the city, the state and the nation? Surely we 
must concede that whether a teacher’s employment be the result 
of an expressed or an implied contractual relationship, there is 
a moral obligation to be loyal, patriotic, inspiring leaders, both 
in our community and in our classroom, whose service results in 
an increased understanding and appreciation of our institutional 
life. It is incumbent upon us to be the creators of an energized, 
critical public opinion, which leads to the reconstruction and to 
the betterment of our political and social life. You will note that 
I do not identify the teacher’s duty with either flag-waving jin- 
goism or reactionary conservatism. The successful solution of our 
city, state and national problems requires all the critical thinking 
we can initiate or inspire. But the obligation to develop such 
powers in our citizenship makes it imperative that teachers should 
not take advantage of the privacy of the classroom to assault 
the mentality of immature listeners by indulging in vicious propa- 
ganda or exposing to ridicule either the ideals or the institutions 
of our people, in order to clear the way for the promotion and 
establishment of questionable ideals and alien modes of gov- 
ernment. 
I am sure I need not argue in such a gathering as this that no 
issue of freedom of speech or personal liberty is involved in such 
a statement of a teacher’s obligations. The cheap radicalism of 
a soap-box orator and the pernicious propaganda of the oblique- 
minded parlor socialist cannot be tolerated in the classroom.
-P-A-G-E-316
  4. SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Teachers should be glad to take and be bound by a solemn oath, 
similar to that administered to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impar- 
tially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me ac- 
cording to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably 
to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that I will 
support and defend the Constitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and 
allegiance to the same; that I take, this obligation freely without 
any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I 
am about to enter. So help me, God.” 
Unionism. Perhaps no ethical question involving teachers has 
aroused more recent controversy in various parts of the country 
than the question of membership in unions. Frankness therefore 
demands that I refer briefly to the subject. 
The aim of teacher-unionism, according to its advocates, is 
teacher-participation in school management and administration 
to a much greater degree than has been conceded hitherto. 
Unionism is the golden key, the long-postponed device by means 
of which the administration of education is to be democratized. 
I am not opposed to teacher-unionism, but I do not believe that 
it is a panacea for ills pedagogical or administrative. The move- 
ment in a city like New York may easily fall into disrepute if 
controlled by unwise or intemperate leaders or if there be the 
slightest suspicion that the movement has its origin in conten- 
tiousness, radicalism or disloyalty to our highest ideals of either 
our profession or our government. The answer to the question 
as to whether or not unionism is desirable must be found in the 
motives that prompt teachers to join any group, whether it be a 
union, a fraternity or a federation. To the extent that such 
groupings are prompted primarily by selfish interests, and are 
based upon class appeal and concepts of economic and national 
life that run counter to those for which our government stands, 
such groups, whether you call them by one name or another, are 
vicious and undemocratic. We can not ignore the bald fact that 
the schools of a democracy are the schools of the whole people, 
and not the schools of a particular class. Moreover, let me 
affirm with great emphasis that nothing can be more detrimental 
to our schools than the assumption that the classroom teachers 
constitute a laboring class, a sort of intellectual proletariat who 
differ both in kind and degree from supervisors and administra-
-P-A-G-E-317
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION 175° 
tors who, by analogy, are classed as a sort of pedagogical capi- 
talistic class, constituting the sworn oppressors of the teachers 
with whom they live and labor day by day, and from whose ranks 
they are chosen. Any appeal to gross prejudice or to narrow class 
consciousness, whether labelled unionism or what not, contains 
the germs common to anarchism or bolshevism. A teacher’s 
union and the general union movement among teachers are just 
as good or just as evil as teachers make them. It is therefore 
the bounden duty of teachersin such organizations to be active 
to preyent the use of such groups for personal, political, or pro- 
fessional exploitation, and, above all, to maintain and promote 
those fine conceptions of service to our children and to our city 
which have always distinguished the teaching profession. 
Relationship to fellow-teachers. Need I state that teachers 
should display toward their superiors and their professional asso- 
ciates that fine regard and consideration for one’s professional 
reputation that is the boast of the legal and medical professions? 
The amenities of life and of professional relationships should 
be carefully observed. He whose services are marked by merit 
and distinction should receive the hearty appreciation of his 
fellows, unclouded by envy or captious criticism. With his supe- 
riors a teacher should work in a spirit of respectful, subordinated, 
harmonious cooperation. 
The real ethical problem arises when subserviency or acqui- 
escence in wrong are expected or demanded in place of 
courageous expression of conviction and the assertion and 
maintenance of rights. In a very real sense every one of us, 
from the Superintendent of Schools down to the most humble 
substitute, is a guardian of certain professional standards and 
legal rights. Therefore, no considerations of personal profit, 
comfort or advancement, no consideration of securing the good 
will and favor of those in either upper or lower ranks of the 
service, should prevent a courageous and outspoken assertion and 
sturdy maintenance of professional rights and obligations. 
In short, between the teacher and his professional colleagues 
as well as his statutory superiors there should exist the utmost 
respect, appreciation and cooperation, not inconsistent with the 
maintenance of professional service at the highest possible level 
of manly self-assertion, honest achievement and orderly adminis- 
tration in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law. 
Perhaps a word about professional associations other than 
unions is not inappropriate.
-P-A-G-E-318
  176 ; SECONDARY EDUCATION 
No one will deny the value of concerted action in the interests 
of worthy ends. . 
We have numerous associations. As George Ade says, one 
can not throw a brick out of the window without hitting cue of 
the brethren. We have a Teachers’ Council, .. hich is composed 
of representatives of such associations; we have a Federation, 
which theoretically is made up of representatives of the numerous 
professional associations. Recently much progress has been made 
in the development of a city-wide organization, intended either 
to supplement ofto supersede some of the existing ones. 
Wherever our sympathies lie, I think we should attempt to 
solve the problem of professional associations in an impersonal, 
impartial way, with an eye solely to the establishment of a rep- 
resentative organization which in moments of crisis or in relation 
to matters of grave importance, will register, not discordant and 
contradictory voices of a score of organizations, but will register 
with majesty and dignity the well-considered decision of a ma- 
jority of our vast army of teachers. 
In like manner, I am strongly convinced that membership in 
our local organizations should be supplemented by membership 
in a national body. We should not fail to identify ourselves with 
our colleagues throughout the width and the breadth of the land. 
Education countrywide needs a well-equipped, strongly organized, 
adequately financed, far-visioned organization, such as the Na- 
tional Education Association, in order that the teachers rather 
than the Carnegie Foundation or the United States Chamber of 
Commerce shall decide far-reaching educational policies affecting 
not only the teachers but the children of our country. Let not 
a selfish complacency prevent us from shouldering a burden 
which is national in scope. 
Relation to Pupils. In relation to his pupils, a teacher should 
be an exemplar of physical, mental and moral growth. Note that 
I emphasize growth rather than complete achievement. If the 
teacher is to be a master-craftsman who discovers to the pupil 
his latent powers, who reveals to the pupil the golden nimbus 
that surrounds each head, he must be a skillful and sympathetic 
master to whom stupid rule of thumb procedure and bitter cyni- 
cism are unknown. 
The unskillful, the unsympathetic, the cynical teacher is be- 
yond the pale and range of an ethical code. Day by day he does 
irreparable injury to child nature. He finds his own lack of 
skill, his own mental obtuseness, his own bitterness, objectified in
-P-A-G-E-319
  TEACHING AS A PROFESSION _ aT 
the lives of innocent, well-intentioned children. Let us work 
without ceasing to ifprove our weaker professional brother, but 
when he has failed to respond to long sustained remedial treat- 
men‘y let us be the first, in the interests of childhood, to insist 
upon his ouster fz9m the school system. 
Verily, the cultured, skillful, sympathetic teacher is a posses- 
sion beyond price, whose influence is found not merely in the 
present generation, but in our children’s children. 
Relations to parents. In a very real and in a legal sense the 
teacher stands in loco parentis to the pupil andstherefore should 
seek to identify himself with the interests, the plans, and the am- 
bitions of the parent as regards his children. Churlishness, in- 
civility, lack of cooperation, disinclination to inform and advise 
should be characteristics foreign to any real teacher. 
Our typical failure to secure the cooperation of the children 
and their parents is due in large part to the teacher’s remoteness 
and detachment from the human relationships of the home. There 
is no better cure for such condition than for the teacher to come 
into close contact with the parent through visitation, either at 
the home or at the school, and through various other devices 
such as formal parents’ meetings or more sociable gatherings. 
In the eyes of the teacher, the pupil as one of a mass tends to 
lose his individuality, his identity, and it is only by making this 
human contact with the parent that the teacher will really see 
and understand the child in certain relationships that are the 
basis not only of individuality, but also of that teacher-insight 
which is the foundation of successful teaching. 
Conclusion. Perhaps the much desired aims of those who are 
striving to set up, in concise and almost catechetical form, the 
standards that appear to be peculiarly applicable to the teaching 
professional may not be attained through such formulation. In- 
deed, those who prepare and disseminate such codes may find 
that teachers fail to display any marked enthusiasm over the 
principles formulated. If we meet with such failure it will prob- 
ably be because we are over-emphasizing the letter rather than 
the spirit, of which such ethical code is but the literal expression. 
The spirit is all. We may, ourselves, be deceived as to the range 
of influence of such codes. But we should not be discouraged. 
The teaching profession to-day occupies higher levels of accom- 
plishment and inspiration than ever before. We are moving ever 
onward and upward. The ethical codes in question may find 
their analogue not in the turbulent waters that rush down the

Principles derived from discussions of the profession of 
teaching. Desirable professionalism among teachers depends 
upon (1) specialized training, (2) a keen sense of their special- 
ized service, (3) adequate income, (4) and socialized self-con- 
sciousness. 
Unless adequate salary scales exist, poor teachers will drive 
out good teachers. 
“All tenure laws should be associated with regulations govern- 
ing training, certification, remuneration, and annuities or 
pensions.” 
Participation in the benefits of a tenure law should be de- 
pendent upon professional activity and continued study as well 
as upon initial qualifications. 
Personal and social responsibilities require teachers to formu- 
late standards of their rights and their abilities,

  “MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 309 
There is reason to suspect that the development of mental tests 
and measurements has brought with it a recrudescence of faculty 
psychology. Some writers, indeed, openly claim that intelligence 
is a single thing. The majority, as far as I can make out, refuses 
to commit itself on this point, and tries to “play it safe” by using 
such phraseology as the ‘capacity to handle abstractions,” or “the 
ability to learn.” But the evil delusion may conceal itself behind 
“the verbiage, and it may be much strengthened by the evidence 
which points toa tendency of the I.Q. to remain constant.’ The 
pessimism that has been generated by the results of mental test- 
ing is probably due primarily to the assumption that intelligence 
is a fixed and changeless thing. We can gauge the approximate 
amount of intelligence as we can record the position of the fixed 
stars, hut there is nothing that we can do about it. As Thorndike 
says, however, “It is probably unwise to spend much time in at- 
tempts to separate off sharply certain qualities of man, as his 
intelligence, from such emotional and vocational qualities as his 
interest in mental activity, carefulness, determination to respond 
effectively, persistence in his efforts to do so; or from his amount 
of knowledge; or from his moral or esthetic tastes. Even so 
apparently remote a trait as muscular strength may in some cases 
codperate almost indistinguishably in the production of what we 
would call intellectual. products. Thus a great scholar’s achieve- 
ment may be in part due to eye muscles which help making read- 
ing a pastime.” * 
Taken superficially the facts involved in mental testing may 
be explained either in terms of a single intelligence or from the 
standpoint that intelligence is a composite affair. Terman, for 
example, tells us that “Some children with I.Q. as high as 75 or 
even 80 will have to be classified as feeble-minded; some as low 
as 70 I.Q. may be so well endowed in other mental traits that 
they may manage as adults to get along fairly well in a simple 
environment.” ® Here the suggestion is conveyed that intelligence 
is a single thing, and that the shortcomings of intelligence may 
be compensated for by the operation of “other mental traits.” 
Conversely these other traits may interfere with the processes of

about 125 who “was once diagnosed by a physician as feeble-

This interpretation is natural and obvious. But it does not 
preclude the view that these “other mental traits,” such as moral 
traits, industry, emotional qualities, and the like, are component 
elements in a total behavior which in its totality is called intelli- 
gence. This use of the word intelligence is justified, if by intelli- 
gence we mean the ability to exercise foresight and to use the 
things in our environment as means to ends; or if by intelligence 
we mean the ability to learn the meanings of things in terms of 
what can be done with them. But if we take intelligence in this 
sense, the I.Q. with which the mental testers deal does not meas- 
ure general intelligence. It measures a more specialized ability 
or set of abilities, such as the ability to deal appropriately with 
the characteristic ‘objects of a school environment. 
As between these two views it ought not to be difficult to choose. 
The “pure reason” of philosophers and the “faculties” of tradi- 
tional psychology carry too heavy a load of odium to make the 
conception of “general intelligence” attractive or plausible. To 
assume that when we have ascertained a person’s I.Q. on the basis 
of a standard test we “have measured some general power which 
resides in him and determines his ability in every variety of in- 
tellectual task in its entirety is to fly directly in the face of all 
that is known about the organization of intellect.” + The assump- 
tion that we are dealing with a single thing and an unchangeable 
thing will hardly bear critical examination. The improvement 
of any one of the numerous factors which may enter into intelli- 
gent behavior is, so far forth, an improvement of intelligence. 
The evidence that the I.Q. remains constant is inconclusive on 
this point. It simply shows that intelligence does not change 
appreciably in certain simple types of situations from which the 
operation of factors that would be likely to make a difference 
have been excluded. 
Let me now try to relate this general conclusion to our previ- 
ous discussion. If intelligence is not a single thing. we seem to 
gain a new perspective on the educational significance of ‘“‘mental 
age” and of the 1.Q. These concepts, as developed in present- 
day tests, do not stand for hard and fast measurements or educa-

bility; and in particular they do not warrant the inference that 
the democratic ideal of education must be abandoned for any con- 
siderable portion of the population. The significance of these 
tests is rather that there are various kinds of grist for the educa- 
tional mill. To quote again from Thorndike: “Consider a score 
attained by a 12-year-old boy in say a combination of Stanford- 
Binet, National A and B and Haggerty Delta 2 (two trials of 
each). If the boy has had ordinary American opportunities, this 
score will prophesy rather accurately how well he will respond to 
intellectual demands in the case of ‘book-learning’ at the time and 
for some years thereafter, and very possibly for all his life. It 
will prophesy less accurately how well he will respond in thinking 
about a machine that he tends, crops that he grows, merchandise 
that he buys and sells, and other concrete realities that he en- 
counters in the laboratory, field, shop, and office. It may prophesy 
still less accurately how well he will succeed in thinking about 
people and their passions, and in responding to these. We know 
that, taking people as we find them, the ability measured by 
verbal tests is not the same as the ability measured by non-verbal 
tests, and there is reason to expect other similar specializations.” ? 
The mental tests are unquestionably valuable for certain kinds 
of classifications and predictions.. Their use, however, should 
not blind us to the fact that life is a garment of many hues. 
Thinking may occupy itself with many varieties of facts and 
relations, and it may occupy itself with these in various ways and 
with varying degrees of skill. The results of the mental tests have 
given new evidence for the view that education must take account 
of a much greater range of interests and abilities than it has 
done in the past. But these results have contributed nothing to 
shake the conviction that education in a democracy is under obli- 
gation to build upon these various interests and abilities a super- 
structure of common faith and common knowledge. The ful- 
fillment of this obligation means the realization of the democratic 
ideal of liberal education, the ideal to which our national history 
. has irrevocably committed us and which embodies our most 
' cherished conceptions of organized social living.

  312 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
THE CASE FOR THE LOW 1.Q” 
By J. L. Srenquist 
Illustrious school failures. Cases in which illustrious (not to 
include “merely successful”) men and women were, while in 
school, diagnosed as failures by their teachers have often been 
cited. Many of the men and women, who later became world 
authorities in their fields, were called at best but mediocre. Lin- 
neus’ gymnasium teacher told his father that he was unfit for any 
profession. Yet this boy later was to revolutionize the science of 
botany. Charles Darwin says in his autobiography that he 
“was considered by all his masters and by his father as a very 
ordinary boy, rather below the common standard of intellect.” 
Napoleon Bonaparte in the final examination at his military 
school stood forty-second in his class. We may well ask with 
Swift, “who were the 41 above him?” Robert Fulton was 
called a dullard because his mind seemed filled with things 
outside of school. Priestley, the great chemist, had “an exceed- 
ingly imperfect education.” Pasteur “was not at all remark- 
able at school. Books and study had little attraction for 
him.” M. Pierre Curie, late professor of physics at the Univer- 
sity of Paris, with his wife, co-discoverer of radium, “was so stupid 
in school that his parents removed him and placed him under a 
private tutor.” Such a list as this could, if space permitted, be 
continued to great length. Many men who to-day are national 
or world figures, but who had a poor school record, could be cited. 
Granting that these cases constitute but a minority—and grant- 
ing also a certain tendency to exaggeration by biographers who 
love contrasts—these cases are still too numerous and important 
to be ignored. The fundamental fact remains that the abilities 
of many pupils are widely misjudged in school, and abilities are 
either unperceived or misunderstood because of arrested develop- 
ment, poorly suited courses, stereotyped curricula, or general lack 
. of sufficiently broad means for estimating ability. 
No claim is here made that all so-called I.Q.’s are misjudged 
—only that many are.

MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 313 
the first year of high school is well known. Strayer’s study of 318 
cities quoted by Terman shows that of those who enter the first 
grade, on the average only 37 percent enter the first year of high 
school, 25 percent the second year of high school, r7 percent the 
third year, and 14 percent the fourth year. Studies by Ayres 
and Thorndike also show the same general tendency. Terman 
says: “It is not uncommon for one-third to drop out without fin- 
ishing the first year of high school.” Retardation and elimination 
figures from every city annually offer additional testimony of the 
same general facts in elementary as well as in high schools. Ter- 
man believes that “not all of this elimination is traceable to in- 
ferior mental ability, but that a large part is due to this cause 
there is no longer room for doubt.” With this general statement 
all will, of course, agree. The question, however, of just how much 
is due to actual lack of intelligence in its broadest sense, we do 
not know. Terman presents much evidence to show that with the 
use of general intelligence tests pupils who have low intelligence 
and who will drop out can be largely discovered beforehand. 
But a situation in which over 80 percent of the pupil population 
is eliminated before reaching the goal is not greatly helped by the 
statement that most of the pupils who thus are eliminated haven’t 
the general intelligence to proceed further. Is it not rather an 
indictment both of the curricula, and of the tests (which select 
too much on identical bases)? Terman suggests the query, “Are 
high school standards too high?” We might also ask are they 
too narrow? Or, in general, too far removed from the kinds 
of mental capacities of pupils? If such great numbers of the 
school population haven’t the kind of ability we call general in- 
telligence, why call it general? 
What is general intelligence? Certain it is that the term gen- 
eral intelligence is sorely in need of definition, for by the average 
person, and even by a large number of specialists in educational 
measurement, it is accepted at face value to mean just what it 
says. But is it not a loose use of terms that permits us to use the . 
name “general” intelligence to designate mental traits which are 
painstakingly limited to the literary-academic tasks of our present 
intelligence tests? Are we not misleading when we say that he, 
and (in effect) only he has general intelligence, who, with paper 
and pencil, can effectively do such things as, solve simple problems 
in arithmetic, state the opposite for each of a list of words, insert 
a number of deleted words in sentences, arrange words in certain 
logical relationships, decide whether a given number or word is
-P-A-G-E-328
j 
314 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
identical with another, write the seventh letter of the alphabet, 
arrange a jumble of words to form meaningful sentences, make 
a cross that “shall be in the circle but not in the triangle or 
square,” state which day comes before Sunday, write whether a 
sentinel should be trustworthy, indicate whether alliteration is a 
form of pentameter, show whether cessation of belligerency is ever 
desirable, declare “what one should do if it is raining when we 
start to school,” repeat “‘we are having a fine time. We found a 
little mouse in the trap,” repeat “3-1-7-5-9,” give the greatest 
possible numbers of words in one minute which rhyme with “day,” 
or any combination of such tasks that may occupy the 30 to 45 
minutes given to an average present day intelligence test! 
What sort of mentality has the individual who makes a low 
score in such tasks but who when he drops out of school has the 
ability to organize a gang that is all but undissolvable? Or 
who drops out of school and builds up a world-wide business 
on the identical ground where “brighter” men have failed? Or 
who can wrest from a Robinson Crusoe situation a triumphant 
career? Or even he who can start a balking automobile abandoned 
by “superior” persons—men of higher I.Q.’s? Or what shall we 
say for the lamented low intelligence of the New York boy who 
escaped from an institution for mental defectives and who before 
the authorities recaptured him had obtained and was holding a job 
paying him $37 per week as a foreman in a blacksmith shop? 
To say that there are but few such cases is untrue. Even 
though the illustrious cases do constitute but a minority, who 
shall estimate how many more of that large percent who drop out 
of school because it is unsuited to their needs would develop 
careers of marked usefulness, if their real abilities were discovered 
and trained? 
To say that such persons as those cited (except, perhaps, such 
cases as the last mentioned) are not possessed of general intelli- 
gence is to quarrel with words. Though they may classify as 
“low I.Q.’s” by present-day intelligence tests, surely we are on 
uncertain ground if we take such results at face value and con- 
sider the cases closed. 
It is a question of what our tests measure, a question of what 
we mean to include under the term general intelligence. 
If we examine the type of criteria by which nearly all these 
tests are justified, we find that they consist in the last analysis 
essentially of teachers’ estimates of pupils’ ability in school, plus 
records in other academic tests. But our major contention is pre-
-P-A-G-E-329
  
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 315 
cisely that for many children the teachers’ estimates and their 
academic record is merely an estimate of success in bookish tasks, 
and that here it is that fallacies of intelligence ratings creep in. 
It is submitted that these intelligence tests, at best, detect only 
those academic qualities of pupils which are noted by teachers, 
and which, it is freely granted, are of great importance for success 
in ordinary school curricula, but which do not constitute the 
whole of general intelligence. Of this our abler investigators 
are fully aware, but the average giver of tests is not aware of it; 
or, if so, he overlooks it. 
Other kinds of intelligence. As a matter of fact, it seems clear 
that intelligence may be of many kinds. Thus, for example, the 
campaign manager exhibits a quality differing sharply from that 
of the locomotive engineer; while the kind of intelligence required 
to lay out the construction work of a Woolworth Building is not 
very like that needed to write a forceful letter, and this in turn is 
not very like that employed in painting a great picture, or invent- 
ing a great machine such as the modern linotype. 
While it may be true that a certain minimum body of “common 
sense” mental ability, and some general academic information un- 
derlie all such activities, we know from at least a few correla- 
tions obtained (one of which appears later) that the relationship 
is not very close—though it is, to be sure, positive. 
If we had trustworthy criteria of ability in social leadership and 
in the various political and mechanical arts and sciences, it might 
be possible to devise intelligence tests that would be more nearly 
“general” than those we now have. This, however, is a more dif- 
ficult matter than to devise tests of academic ability. Again, 
while to measure in this wide sense the present general intelli- 
gence of our school population represents a heavy task, to prog- 
nosticate its potential ability would be a truly Herculean under- 
taking. But this is not equivalent to saying that it can’t be done. 
Much of the same methodology and technic which we already have 
would apply, and progress in this direction may be looked for. 
Current literature is already sprinkled with discussions of the 
limitations of what our present so-called general intelligence tests 
measure.

The tests of mechanical ability herein described may serve as an 
example and case in point, showing another type of intelligence 
and also emphasizing the need for clearer definition of just what 
we mean when we say a child has but little general intelligence. 
During 1919-1920 several hundred boys in a New York City 
public school (P. S. 64, Manhattan) were given a very exhaustive 
intelligence rating by means of the combined results in the fol- 
lowing well-known tests: 1°

The results of these six tests were pooled, given equal weight to 
each, and the final rating was called the composite intelligence 
score. These boys were next given a series of mechanical tests, 
consisting of the following: 
B. The Stenquist mechanical tests 
Assembling Series 1: Ten unassembled commercial mechani- 
cal articles in a 5 X 2%4 X 24 inch box, divided into ten 
compartments, to be assembled; these include a cupboard 
catch, an ordinary clothespin, a three-piece paper clamp, 
six links of ordinary safety chain, a simple bicycle bell, a 
shut-off clamp (used on rubber tubing), an ordinary wire 
rubber stopper (such as is used on pop bottles), a push 
button, a simple three-piece lock, and a mouse trap. 
Assembling Series II: Ten more articles like the above, con- 
sisting of a four-piece elbow catch (used on almost every 
cupboard door), a rope coupling, a toy pistol, an expansion 
nut, a window sash fastener (such as is commonly found on 
windows), a simple pair of calipers, an expansion four- 
piece rubber stopper for bottles, a four-piece paper clamp 
or clip, a double hinge (such as is found on every screen), 
and a simple lock.

Picture Test 1: Consisting of 78 picture-matching problems 
in which the pupil is required to determine which one of 
five pictures belongs with, or is a part of, one key picture. 
The pictures treat general mechanical subjects such as 
mechanisms, tools, toys, machines, and their parts. 
Picture Test II: This is similar to Picture Test I, but in- 
volves some language. Sixty questions are included refer- 
ring to numbered parts of machine. These call for a cer- 
tain type of mechanical reasoning, requiring the ability to 
think in terms of mechanical problems. Seventeen ques- 
tions are devoted to matching pictured parts of mechanical 
toys.** 
These mechanical tests inter-correlate on the average between 
0.6 and 0.7. One test of actual manipulation of objects, such as 
Series I, correlates about as high with either of the picture tests 
as it does with a second series of models to assemble. On the 
whole, any one of the four tests affords an important indication 
of a general ability that may for convenience be called “general 
mechanical aptitude”—general in the sense that it does not per- 
tain to any special trade, and mechanical, as is more or less 
obvious, from its nature. 
Comparison of results. If we now compare the results in the 
two types of examination we may observe the following points: 
As to the correlation between the Assembling Test, Series I, and 
the composite intelligence score, r=o0.23 + 0.04, for 267 
seventh- and eighth-grade boys. Between Assembling Test, 
Series II, and the composite intelligence score r= 0.34 + 0.06 
for 100 seventh- and eighth-grade boys. Between Picture Test 
II and the same intelligence rating r = 0.34 + 0.03 for 296 sev- 
enth- and eighth-grade boys.*® 
If we now combine all of the four mechanical tests into one

The important inference to draw from these results is not with 
regard to the exact coefficients obtained, but with regard to the 
general fact of low correlation between the two kinds of ability 
here represented. Results obtained in the army for over 14,000 
men bear out the same general fact. 
The validity of the measurements. The validity of a test deals 
with the question of what it is that it measures—i.e., with corre- 
lations with criteria. 
The question of what the intelligence tests measure has already 
been dealt with. to what the mechanical tests measure we 
may first cite the correlations which have been found in comparing 
mechanical test scores with pupils’ ranks in shop courses and in 
general science courses. The following instances are cited for the 
Assembling Tests and shop work:

Shop teachers’ ranks are, of course, no better than regular 
teachers’ ranks which have been criticized in the previous section. 
But there is every reason to believe them equally good, and the 
same may be said of the judgments of science teachers. Were 
other and better criteria available these estimates would be ex- 
cluded. In several of the above instances the average rank given 
by two shop or science teachers (intercorrelating 0.88 or better) 
were used. 
The mechanical tests may, therefore, be judged from these 
figures to detect to a marked degree the same qualities in pupils 
that are considered by shop and science teachers in judging pupils’ 
relative abilities. What is it that causes a pupil to stand out in 
this type of work? May it not be another type of intelligence 
that might well be called of general importance? 
The second way of deciding what these mechanical tests meas- 
ure is the very direct one of merely looking at the tests and judg- 
ing what type of task it is that has been set up. Thus we may 
not at once say that they represent an attempt (in all except 
Picture Test II) to get away from words. They deal with con- 
crete and real things, as against descriptions of things. In the 
Assembling Tests opportunity is given to work with hands and 
mind, rather than to perform with a pencil only, or to juggle 
mental abstractions. 
The relative importance of these two kinds of ability, Of the 
relative importance of each of these two types of ability, readers 
must form their own conclusions. But it should be kept in mind 
that we are living in a world that is dominated on every hand by 
every known form of mechanical device and machine. Every 
moment of present-day life is influenced directly or indirectly by 
the products of mechanical skill and genius. Is it not important 
that ability in this field should be discovered and developed? 
Rather than merely to dismiss our apparently stupid pupils as 
low in “general intelligence,” and to relegate them to some con- 
venient class, our time might profitably be spent in disclosing 
other kinds of intelligence of which they may be possessed. 
Possibly it would be more appropriate to designate these me- 
chanical tests by some other name for they are mechanical only 
in a limited sense. On the mental side they call for the ability 
to recognize parts of ordinary mechanical devices, for the ability 
to make judgments as to the reasons for the particular size, shape, 
weight, and nature of the parts—in short, for the mental ability 
to think through in some degree the same steps as those employed

ty “thé Mesigner f each machine. anually, they call for the 
dexterity required to put parts together to form the completed 
machine or device after it has been decided:how they should go. 
Much of the performance of a Pea is, of course, mere 
trial and error manipulation, in which he hopes somehow “to 
make the thing work.” But the nature of the various models is 
such that only a very low score is possible for the individual who 
depends merely upon thoughtless manipulation of the parts. A 
generous amount of the best kind of thinking is thus required to 
make a high score. It involves accurate perception, reasoning, 
and judgment applied to each model. In so far, therefore, as these 
mental processes are of general importance in every-day life, the 
ability demonstrated in assembling these models perfectly could 
well be called general intelligence. 
Fictitious stigmata. There is a strong and universal notion 
that a low score in such tasks as have here been called intelli- 
gence tests constitutes a disgrace, that must be shunned at all 
costs. To fail to receive a high rating in intelligence is regarded 
as a calamity. is feeling has come about partly through the 
loose use of the term general intelligence, and partly through a 
distorted estimate of the réle of intelligence in human conduct. 
Absurd as it may seem, there is a brief, and a reasonable one, 
which can be held for the I.Q. which is actually low—as well as 
for the supposedly low I.Q. For just as in man we find enormous 
individual differences in intelligence, so (fortunately) in the work 
of the world we find equally great variation in the character of the 
work to be done. As a matter of fact, the outstanding industrial 
tendency of the tt decade has been to reduce the number of 
skilled jobs and increase the number of unskilled ones. The con- 
stant tendency of our modern machine age is in this direction, be it 
right or wrong. Again, consider the hundreds of thousands of 
menial tasks outside of industry that somebody must perform in 
every society. Is it not clear that happiness, contentment, and 
efficiency in such jobs are far more apt to come with a low 1.Q. 
than with one that is high? Indeed, even when we consider the 
world’s sweetest and most lovable characters, it is not always 
their high general abstract intelligence that makes the strong 
appeal. Haven’t we in the academic atmosphere of our school- 
rooms come to value the intellectual side of human nature out of 
proportion to its real significance in life? Surely far worse calami- 
ties can befall the human animal than that of being pronounced 
of low intelligence. Physical disease, a crippled body, an insane

or actually feeble mind, with the multitude of tragic afflictions 
which this may imply—these and many other lamentable condi- 
tions which may befall should be kept in the background of our 
mind when we feel inclined to bemoan the lot of the stupid indi- 
vidual. 
Summary. This account attempts to point out some of the 
fallacies that are prevalent in the present-day conception of in- 
telligence tests. It recalls the many cases of illustrious men who 
were called school failures, and calls attention to the large percent 
of pupils who at present appear to lack sufficient mentality to 
carry on current curricula, and suggests the query “Is it the cur- 
ticula or the mental ability of the population that is at fault?” 
It criticizes present-day intelligence tests as narrow and academic 
in scope, being based largely on school success; suggests the 
loose use to which the term “general intelligence” is often put; 
and maintains that there are in fact many other kinds of intelli- 
gence than are now being measured by tests of that name. As an 
illustration the results of a study of mechanical ability are of- 
fered. Here it is shown that at least 20 per cent of the pupils from 
a typical school, who are below average in general abstract in- 
telligence, are above average in the kind of ability required in four 
mechanical tests, the detailed nature of which is described. It is 
submitted that such ability may be of quite as general importance 
as that required to score high in the abstract general intelligence 
tests, in view of the fact that present environment is so largely 
permeated with the fruits of mechanical genius and applied 
science. Finally, it is maintained that there is a strong, but 
wrong tendency to attach a stigma to pupils scoring low in so- 
called intelligence tests. Even for pupils whose true general in- 
telligence is found after adequate testing to be low, there is ample 
opportunity for useful and happy lives—lives concerned with 
tasks for which they are, in fact, better adapted than are indi- 
viduals of high intelligence.

lower vocational levels? How can this training be given? (7) 
What are some of the ‘general principles on which to base differ- 
entiation of subject-matter in any course to meet the needs of 
the pupil of limited intelligence? 
In a number of states the extension of the age of compulsory 
school attendance on either a full-time or a part-time basis has 
brought into the secondary school a large number of pupils who 
are below average in brightness, ie., of low I.Q. Of fourteen 
hundred pupils entering the tenth grade of the Berkeley High 
School during the past two years, 26 per cent tested below average 
(i.e., below 95 1.Q.) according to the Terman Group Test of Men 
tal Ability. A survey of the enrolment in the Berkeley junior 
high schools shows that the senior high school may continue to 
expect an equally large percentage of pupils of limited intelligence 
in the future. 
Many of these pupils of low I.Q. take one, two, three, or even 
four years longer than the normal amount of time to complete the 
work of the elementary school and the junior high school. Many 
even then do not complete the regular course of study prescribed 
in these lower schools but move forward term by term in “lim- 
ited” classes where differentiated and simplified work is offered. 
Finally, many of the C?* pupils and some of the D pupils reach 
the senior high school. Naturally, each consecutive grade of the 
public school acts as a graded sieve, sorting out term after term 
those who can succeed and profit by further standard academic 
classroom instruction such as is customarily offered in our public 
schools. 
“Tt is our practice in rating students to use the following seven-point 
scale: A, very superior, 130 I. Q. and above; B, superior, 115-129 I. Q.; 
C+, slightly above average, 105-114 I. Q.; C, average, 95-104 I. Q.; C—, 
slightly below average, 85-94 I. Q.; D, inferior, 70-84 I. Q.; E, very inferior, 
69 I. Q. or below. ¢

* The enrolment for the spring term of 1923. 
A careful study of the case record of every “drop-out” from 
the Berkeley High School for the spring term of 1923 showed that 
57 per cent of all of the “drop-outs” were below 100 I.Q.; 37 
per cent were definitely below average in intelligence. Approxi- 
mately 50 per cent were pedagogically retarded. While lack of 
ability successfully to master the subjects offered in the present 
high-school courses is by no means the only reason why students 
drop out of the senior high school, it appears to be one of the 
important reasons. 
Some limited ** pupils leave the public school to enter private 
schools, particularly business colleges, to which they are often at- 
tracted by the false notion that lucrative positions await them as 
soon as they have had six months’ or even three months’ training 
for which they pay a high tuition. Other “drop-outs” from the 
senior high school secure employment at unskilled labor. In 
many cases parents explain that they would be willing to finance 
their boys and girls through high school but that the children do 
not like school, are not succeeding, and want to go to work. 
One boy very aptly explained his view of the situation by say- 
ing, “When a fellow goes to high school, at the end of every seven 
weeks he gets pieces of paper with the teachers’ marks on them, 
telling how he ain’t any good. When a fellow works at a job, he 
gets a slip of paper every Saturday noon with which he can buy 
things. Who wants to go to high school anyhow if he ain’t going 
to college?” 
Tn this article the word “limited” as applied to pupils is used to desig- 
nate those pupils who do not seem to have the ability to do the work of 
the standard high school curriculum.  
-P-A-G-E-338
324 _ SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  Two of the most serious and most urgent problems facing the 
secondary school to-day are (1) the better classification of stu- 
dents and (2) the modification of curriculums to meet the needs 
of students differing in capacity. 
What the secondary school should offer students below average 
in intelligence can best be determined by a compilation of the 
salient points contained in the case histories of limited pupils. 
These should show, not only mental age as well as physical age, 
but also previous scholastic accomplishment, physical development 
and health, record of after-school and vacation employment, home 
and neighborhood conditions, the economic status of the parents 
as well as their plans for the child’s future, and the pupil’s in- 
terests and ambitions. 
A study of the particular group of children which is to be edu- 
cated is always one of the best bases for curriculum-making, pro- 
vided this study is supplemented by a survey of the occupational 
opportunities of the community. The latter is sometimes as im- 
portant as the former when vocational training is offered. To 
illustrate: A certain school board was perplexed as to what voca- 
tional training to offer a certain group of girls. They followed 
one of the customary methods of procedure in curriculum-making, 
namely, that of investigating to see what other schools were doing. 
They found that a trade school in a manufacturing city taught its 
girls to run power sewing machines. Forthwith they installed six 
power sewing machines and within six months had a group of girls 
trained to operate them skillfully. However, when the girls came 
to seek employment, they found that there were no power-machine 
operators employed within sixty miles of where they lived and that 
the wage paid for this work was usually so low that a girl could 
not be entirely self-supporting; hence she was obliged to live at 
home. 
Thus we see that in planning for the education of the limited 
secondary-school pupil there are two factors to be considered: 
(x) the pupil’s mental capacity and (2) his environment. Both 
of these considerations bring us face to face with the question, 
What are the minimum essentials of the education which every 
person should have in order to be a contributing, or at least a 
self-sustaining, member of a democracy? In other words, what 
are the common responsibilities that every individual should meet? 
Coupled with this is the question, What are the aspirations, 
common to all, that differ only in degree between one individual 
and another and which every individual must realize if he is to be
-P-A-G-E-339
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 325 
content? It has been suggested that the following are the aspira- 
tions and responsibilities common to all: 
1. Desire of everyone to take care of himself and be economi- 
cally independent. 
2. Desire to produce or create something. Along with this, 
there is a desire to couple up what one creates with a tangible 
reward. The elementary school is now emphasizing a type of 
tangible rewards through project-teaching. However, the secon- 
dary school, for the most part, gives only deferred values. The 
superior child appreciates these, but many other children do not. 
3. Aspiration to be strong physically and to have complete con- 
trol of one’s faculties. 
4. Instinctive desire for offspring. 
5. Fundamental human desire for leisure. 
6. Desire for a good name among one’s fellows in a social 
group. 
If these are the universal and the fundamental human desires 
and instincts, and if they are to be the bases for education, the 
public school must offer every child (1) training for work, (2) 
training for health, (3) training for parenthood and the care of 
children, (4) training for efficiency so that people will have leisure 
time, and when they have it, get both enjoyment and profit from 
it, and (5) training for social participation. 
What does this mean from the administrative point of view? 
It means that there must be various levels of training with definite 
terminal points. This is in accordance with the thesis laid down 
at the beginning of this discussion, that education should be 
differentiated according to the potentialities of the children to be 
educated, and that one of the greatest needs to-day is the revision 
and the extension of the present secondary-school curriculum to 
meet the varied needs of students. 
The same five objectives of education, based on the fundamental 
desires and instincts common to all, will apply to the training of 
the limited student as well as to the training of the average or 
superior student. This does not mean, however, that all pupils 
will be given the same kind or the same quantity of training, for, 
when they enter the field of labor, those of large ability may, in 
time, direct enterprises, while others of limited capacity may only 
faithfully carry out the routine work of a process job. 
Henry Adams wisely said, “Work is the badge of Citizenship 
in a democracy.” However, we must remember that work and  
-P-A-G-E-340
  326 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
unremitting toil are not the same. At the highest occupational 
level, work means more than taking care of one’s self—it means 
a contribution; at the lowest level, it means self-support. 
There is no doubt that the secondary-school pupil of less than 
average intelligence can be trained to fulfil successfully the re- 
quirements of the lower occupational levels. In time, it may be 
that the public school will offer courses of training to fit boys and 
girls to enter into process and semi-skilled work just as at present 
it offers training preparatory for the professional schools and 
training for expert stenographic and secretarial work and skilled 
trades. 
It would appear that there are four main reasons why provision 
for such training should be considered: (1) Training will help to 
eliminate the exploitation of the workers at the lower levels. (2) 
Training will often result in a living wage. (3) Training tends to 
standardize an occupation and give it prestige. For example, the 
telephone girl is now considered on the same plane as the clerk and 
the stenographer. Nursing is another example of an occupation 
in which training has added dignity to the occupation. (4) Train- 
ing is often a means of eliminating social hazard. The unskilled 
worker is usually the first one to be discharged when work is slack. 
Undoubtedly, in time, there will be a vast increase in the number 
of occupations for which training is offered. While there must 
be appropriate terminal points for different levels of intelligence, 
there must be facilities for going from one level to another. 
As time goes on, secondary-school people will develop a more 
wholesome attitude toward work as a part of education. As the 
secondary school meets the problem of training pupils of less than 
average intelligence for trade and industrial life, it will put less 
emphasis on full-time school and more on part-time education on 
a codperative basis, Many youths should be employed for part- 
time with two objects in view: (1) what they can do now and (2) 
what they can be trained to do later. One of the objectives of the 
continuation school should be to make better and more skillful 
workmen who can find joy in their work, in their increasing earn- 
ing power, and in their prospects for promotion. To accomplish 
this may require claiming for the education of youth many of the 
facilities of the community instead of limiting opportunities for 
training to mere classroom procedure. 
Even for the limited secondary-school pupil, however, there will 
necessarily be some supplementary classroom instruction as well 
as such teaching as will help to make a life as well as a living, 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
  MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 327 
ie., training for health, for parenthood, for leisure, and for social 
participation. In training for social participation, one of our 
objectives should be “to develop those human qualities in the in- 
dividual child which shall contribute to his joy of living and to 
his satisfaction in the environment in which he finds himself or 
which he makes for himself.” 
An analysis of the case histories of several hundred secondary- 
school pupils of less than average intelligence suggests the follow- 
ing general principles as bases for the differentiation of subject- 
matter as well as of the method of teaching in any subject to meet 
the needs of the limited pupil. In the absence of any better evi- 
dence, these principles are tentatively proposed for present use. 
1. Since the limited student can acquire only a limited amount 
of the present type of academic education, it is necessary that 
academic education be confined to that which will be most worth 
while in the student’s life. For example, the chief objectives to 
be sought in the academic English class of the‘limited student are 
(a) reading for appreciation and (6) self-expression in its simplest 
form. 
2. Short unit courses should be developed with distinct divisions, 
having definite objectives, so that both teacher and student can 
see the progress made. For example, the work in English will in- 
clude simple letter writing, brief oral reports, digests of articles 
read, and the keeping of individual spelling lists. 
3- The subject-matter should be elastic in content so that it 
can be modified to meet individual needs as well as group needs. 
In working out the details of a course of study for a particular 
group of limited students, we must not make the mistake of seek- 
ing for the average youth possessing a certain set of imagined 
qualities. The subject-matter should be varied according to the 
environing conditions, interests, and needs of the pupils in a 
particular school. Furthermore, we must be guided by what we 
know almost certainly is ahead of certain groups of students 
rather than by custom and tradition. 
4. The subject-matter should be concrete and deal with simple 
actual life-situations as far as possible. While superior children 
look for ultimate principles, causal explanations, and final objec- 
tives, children of limited mental capacity seldom seek beyond the 
immediate and the concrete. For example, English teachers have 
found that dull pupils can appreciate the story of the “Ancient 
Mariner,” while the philosophy of J? Penseroso is beyond them. 
Teachers have also found it wise to substitute for Milton, Muir’s  
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
dog story, Stickeen, or his Biography of a Naturalist. The univer- 
sal appeal in Gray’s Elegy usually reaches limited students, as do 
also the life-situations portrayed in Captains Courageous. 
5. Daily assignments should be distinctly and plainly set forth 
and should never be involved. For example, in English compo- 
sition it is better to require a few short sentences or paragraphs 
than to assign a three-thousand-word theme based on references 
which have to be acquired from many sources. 
6. It should always be remembered that the mental age of the 
limited student is less than his chronological age and that in aca- 
demic assignments it is his mental age that should be given first 
consideration. Experience in teaching literature shows us that one 
of the ways in which limited pupils differ from superior pupils is 
in their inability to project themselves into situations which they 
themselves have not experienced. The superior child with his 
quick imagination and ready powers of generalization does this 
very easily; not so the limited student. As a home economics 
teacher expressed it, “For the dull pupil one has to make a pas- 
sageway and drop in the idea—in other words, personally con- 
duct it.” 
7. Large opportunity should be given for drill work. Contrary 
to general belief, the slow thinker is not necessarily the accurate 
thinker. Nor does the child who learns slowly necessarily have a 
more retentive memory than the bright child. 
8. The limited pupil usually cannot reason out general prin- 
ciples or methods of attack but has to learn largely by rule and 
limitation. A successful teacher of long experience with limited 
pupils states that these children go at their work with greater 
enthusiasm and are more likely to finish it when it is carefully 
laid out for them. If left to themselves to work out a project that 
is at all difficult, they soon give up in despair because of bewilder- 
ment. Hence the course of procedure for the limited pupil should 
be carefully laid down for him. A better plan is the following: 
demonstrate the procedure while he observes; allow him to at- 
tempt it himself under careful supervision; have him repeat it 
until by repetition the various parts of the process come to have 
for him a habitual relation or association. In time, the whole 
action becomes easy and mechanical; then and not until then has 
the limited student mastered it. The more technical the subject, 
the more nearly one has to come to individual instruction. 
While the “keynote in the education of an exceptional child 
of any age is to provide a wealth of stimulations of a suitable
-P-A-G-E-343
MENTAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 329 
order,” the keynote in the education of the limited child is the 
establishment of efficient habits. Usually the limited child is not 
capable of constant adjustment to new situations. 
While it is highly important that counselors and teachers should 
recognize the fact that limited pupils do not have the ability to do 
successfully the work of the standard secondary-school curriculum, 
it is equally important that they remember that the limited high- 
school pupil has some ability; it is their privilege to codperate 
with him in developing the ability which he has. If possible, 
teachers should find at least one worth while thing at which the 
limited pupil can succeed, train him in this, and let him feel 
honest success. Too often the only thing the limited pupil gets 
from the high school is a sense of failure. 
To provide differentiated courses for limited students is not 
sufficient. Wise counseling and careful follow-up are necessary if 
the purpose of the special opportunities provided for in the cur- 
riculum is to be realized. 
While it is true of all children that the more thought, time, and 
money spent on their proper guidance before they reach the age 
of eighteen, the less cost will result to society later for correction, 
punishment, and inefficiency, it is particularly true of children of 
limited mental capacity. 
Principles derived from discussions of pupils’ mental equip- 
ment.?* The measurement of the mental equipment of high-school 
pupils requires the use of refined tests which measure not only 
special intelligence upon which the school puts a premium but 
also general intelligence such as mechanical and social abilities. 
The intelligence quotient is sufficiently consistent to enable one 
to predict that the superior will remain superior, the average 
will remain average, and the inferior will remain inferior. 
Pupils who elect rigorous courses are in general a more intelli- 
gent group, as measured by so-called general intelligence tests, 
than pupils who do not elect these courses. 
There are important innate and also important bequired indi- 
vidual differences. 
The relative importance of innate and acquired differences has 
not yet been scientifically determined. 
See also the principles at the end of Chapter VI. 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
  
  330 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The proper secondary education for individuals with mental 
differences, whether innate or acquired, is a differentiated one 
in which each task is adjusted to talent and social need. 
The abilities of many pupils are not only misjudged in school, 
but are even unperceived because of arrested development, poorly- 
suited courses, stereotyped curricula, or lack of adequate means 
of estimating ability. 
The purpose of educational and mental measurements is to 
discover innate and acquired ability and to assist in determining 
the type of stimulus which, for each individual, is the optimum. 
Education must recognize and take account of a much greater 
range of interests and abilities than it has in the past. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. What, according to Henmon, is intelligence? Can it be meas- 
ured? 
2. If, as is frequently asserted, there is a probable error of about 
five points in the successive intelligence scores of individuals, is 
Terman’s discussion of mental growth and the intelligence quotient 
radical or modest? 
3. What is meant by “diagnosing a pupil’s abilities’? Upon what 
bases can diagnosis be made? 
4. Given a pupil with superior ability who attains barely passing 
grades in your course. How would you begin a diagnosis of his 
case? 
5. Is the classification of pupils upon the basis of the results of 
intelligence tests likely to be more reliable or less reliable as the 
groups of children tested are more homogeneous? Why? What 
is the bearing of your discussion of this point upon the relative 
values of tests of secondary and of elementary school pupils? 
6. What is the meaning of “educational determinism?’ How 
real is the danger which Bagley uncovers in regard to such de- 
terminism? 
7. Prepare a brief of Kelley’s article. 
8. Of what significance are the results of intelligence tests? 
g. The term individual differences is sometimes employed to de-
-P-A-G-E-345

i as note that one pupil can read four times as fast as his slowest class* + 
mates. What more fundamental connotation may this term possess ? 
10. Given a high school girl, both of whose parents are engaged 
in work which requires them to be away from home ten hours 
per day. This pupil has to rise at five-thirty every morning to 
assist her parents and younger brothers and sisters. After school 
she has to prepare dinner for her family. In what ways would 
you expect her school work to reflect her home conditions? How 
far should teachers go in making the school particularly attractive 
for such a pupil? 
11. In high schools with whose conditions you are acquainted 
what provisions are now made for such pupils as those discussed 
in the latter readings of this chapter? 
12. Prepare a plan which provides a suitable curriculum and 
classroom teaching for both brilliant and slow pupils. 
13. Evaluate the principles at the end of this chapter.

    CHAPTER IX 
Tue PuysicaL EQuipMENT OF SECONDARY SCHOOL PuPILs 
How physical equipment has been investigated. The study 
of the physical equipment of secondary school pupils is in its 
infancy. Profitable work on this problem has been thwarted by 
the early tendency to depend for data upon measurements of 
pupils of many ages at a single time. Instead of such measure- 
ments, there should have been successive measurements of the 
same individuals. This latter type of measurement has been 
employed by Baldwin for more than a decade. A second hin- 
drance to progress has been the failure of many students of physi- 
cal equipment to examine as objectively as possible the mental 
equipment of pupils. Failure to include a mental examination 
has been conducive to the drawing of certain conclusions which 
now appear to be untenable. Baldwin, Gates, Freeman and 
Carter, and Engelhardt investigated both the physical and mental 
equipment of their subjects. A third hindrance to progress has 
been the failure to correlate medical, mental, and physical exam- 
inations. 
The obvious difficulty of obtaining a large number of repre- 
sentative subjects who can or will submit themselves to measure- 
ment for a period of years, and the difficulty of interpreting the 
measurements after they have been taken have prevented the 
rapid development of a body of usable facts concerning physical 
equipment. Already, however, certain products of Baldwin’s years 
of research are available. As his research is still in progress, it 
is necessary not only to become acquainted with his findings to 
date but also to keep abreast of his reports as they appear from 
time to time. The first of the readings which follow reveals many 
of the difficulties encountered in obtaining physical measurements. 
It also displays certain types of data which are required for 
336
-P-A-G-E-351
  PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 337 
progress in the study of physical equipment. The possible forms 
of applications of these data to pedagogical problems as indi- 
cated at the close of this passage are given and should be re- 
garded as tentative inferences. The second quotation from 
Baldwin treats of an investigation of both physical and mental 
equipments. That Baldwin’s findings are somewhat unlike those 
of other investigators may properly be taken as indicative of the 
need for further investigation before final conclusions can be 
formulated. 
The abridgment of Murdoch and Sullivan’s article also con- 
tains valuable data upon the relation between the mental and 
physical equipment of pupils. As the authors state in the orig- 
inal article, this report is a by-product of a more extensive sur- 
vey of the Punahou school. 
One of the ingenious methods employed in physical measure- 
ment is that of finding out the extent of ossification of the 
carpals and wrist bones. This method has been used by Bald- 
win, Freeman and Carter, Gates, and others. While Baldwin 
found a very high correlation, .83, and Freeman and Carter ob- 
tained correlations of .73 for boys and .75 for girls, between 
ossification and mental age (not intelligence quotient), Freeman 
and Carter found a partial correlation of only .o8.1_ That is, when 
all other elements are excluded, the correlation is greatly affected. 
Inasmuch as classroom work is mainly mental, Freeman and 
Carter conclude, therefore, that the promotion and classification 
of pupils “should be based primarily on measures of intellectual 
growth and capacity, and only secondarily, if at all, upon the 
measures of physical growth and capacity.” The findings of 
Gates are presented in one of the readings which follow. It is 
urged that readers of these discussions decide only to remain open- 
minded with regard to the controversial issues involved in the 
passages. Despite such a negative attitude toward certain issues, 
the promise of these researches is, as Gates asserts, too important 
to overlook.

  338 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
A very different manner of studying physical equipment is 
described in the later passages of this chapter—that which deals 
with a health program and those by Williams and Hummer and 
by Walter. While the earlier passages deal with bodily dimen- 
sions, these passages deal with the improvement of physical con- 
ditions and with athletic performances. 
A difficulty with sole dependence upon bodily dimensions and 
development as a measure of the actual equipment of a pupil is 
that there is often a great disparity between size-development 
equipment and functional efficiency. As Sargent states, “While 
it is true that other things being equal, the strength and func- 
tional capacity of a part increases with the size of the part, the 
number of cases where other things are not equal is so numerous, 
that the generalization should be greatly modified.” ** After es- 
tablishing the validity of a test as a measure of unspecialized 
physical efficiency, Engelhardt applied the test to 200 junior high 
school boys and 36 university men.? The results of this test 
were then compared with the results of general intelligence tests, 
educational tests, and school marks. Engelhardt found “no evi- 
dence of any significant correlation between mental and physical 
efficiency.” Investigations with results such as these, like the 
measurement data of Gates and Freeman and Carter, lead one to 
hesitate before giving great weight to physical data in promotional 
plans, except as secondary to mental capacity and achievement. 
That is, when pupils are performing physical activities, they 
should be,so far as possible, classified according to their physical 
equipment, but when they are performing mental activities they 
should, so far as possible, be classified according to their mental 
equipment. As previously stated, however, one should maintain 
only a tentative judgment regarding this matter, because the 
great mass of material which Baldwin has collected by measure-

ments of a large and representative number of children may war- 
rant conclusions which are contradictory to those based upon the 
measurement of a few selected children. 
The passages contained in this chapter show ways of measuring 
and raising the standards of physical equipment and suggest prac- 
tical uses which can be made of certain acts in furthering the 
development of certain physical abilities. It may be suggested 
that, after this type of investigation and Baldwin’s type have been 
conducted for a reasonably long period, there will be an invalu- 
able body of knowledge, a portion of which will indicate the static 
equipment of youth while the other will indicate the dynamic 
equipment. When the results of these two lines of development 
are combined with the results of a thorough-going health pro- 
gram, and not till then we can formulate reliable interpretations 
of physical data and can hope for definite principles for planning 
for the physical aspects of pupils during their schooldays and 
later life. 
PHYSIOLOGICAL AGE* 
By Birp T. Batpwin 
1. The age distribution of pubescence of boys and physio- 
logical maturation of girls. Two closely related ages which char- 
acterize a child’s development quite as much as its chronological 
age in years, months and days, but are less understood, less com- 
monly used, and therefore less familiar to parents and teachers, 
are the anatomical and physiological age. These denote the 
physical, or anatomical, growth and the accompanying stages of 
physical maturation of the individual as indicatéd by growth of 
bones, eruption of teeth, color of eyes, metabolism, marked func- 
tional changes in sex organs, changes of voice and many other 
phases of physiological development not so apparent to the casual 
observer. , 
The subjects of physiological and anatomical ages have been 
confused in the literature, because neither has been investigated

empirically beyond a limited degree, although both are full of 
fertile problems of great significance in the study of individual 
development. The direct applications of the meaning of these 
ages to physical, mental, pedagogical, social and moral develop- 
ment have been recognized to a very limited extent. 
There is a wide range to be found in the physiological differ- 
  earlier, others not until 16 or 17. Boys and girls who mature 
early in these functions may be considered physically older than 
those of later maturation. 
a. Data for boys. In order to determine the wide range of 
chronological ages that characterize the stages of physiological 
_growth which are entered into at adolescence, the writer and one 
of his advanced students at Johns Hopkins University, Charles F. 
Pennington, checked very carefully some material that was 
gathered under the direction of Dr. William Burdick and Dr. 
Brown on the ages of pre-pubescence, pubescence, and post-pubes- 
cence in boys. In Baltimore 3600 boys of a “motor” type of de- 
velopment, that is, those taking part in athletics, were examined. 
These data were supplemented by those from a group of 1317 
boys from 14 counties of Maryland, making a total of 4917 boys. 
With these particular children the criterion was that of pubescent 
growth and pigmentation of fine hair, which characterizes a very 
brief period of time marking the change from asexual to sexual 
life, when the ability to procreate is established. 
It is found that the pre-pubescent boys range from eight and 
one-half to 16 years of age in the group of country boys, and 
from nine and one-half to 17% for the city boys. The post- 
pubescent ages range from 1144 to 24 for the country boys and 
12%4 to 24 for the city boys. For the pubescent stages the 
country boys range from nine and one-half to 1514, with the 
mode at 134, and the city boys from 1o to 18, with the mode 
at 14. The country boys reach this period earlier than the city 
boys. At no age are more than 53 per cent of the age group 
of the city boys pubescent or more than 4o per cent of the 
country boys. 
b. Data for girls. For the girls the criteria were the first 
menstrual flow, enlargement of the breasts, the appearance of 
subcutaneous fat, and axillary hair, as noted by the physician

or nurse. Table XXIX shows the age distribution in terms of 
percent of 47 girls from the University of Iowa Elementary and 
High School who had their first period of menstruation between 
the ages of 10 and 17 years; and a similar distribution for 151 
Horace Mann school girls, 56 University of Chicago Elementary 
and High School girls and 134 Baltimore County girls from the 
Baltimore Athletic League. These data are accurate and repre- 
sent typical groups of normal girls from the middle and upper 
class homes. 
These data furnish satisfactory criteria for specific purposes,

IV. These data show that among children who are best de- 
veloped from a physical point of view there is no fixed 
age for physiological development as evidenced by the ad- 
vent of pubescence or first menstruation. Adolescence 
does not begin at the same chronological age for all normal 
boys or for all normal girls, physiologically speaking. Chil- 
dren, boys or girls, may be of the same chronological age 
between 104 and 164 and differ in physiological age 
from one to four or five years and still be normal in physi- 
cal development. The norm for pubescence is a distri- 
bution range, not an average chronological age. 
At no age do as many as 40 percent of the groups mature. 
There is a range in ages from 10 to 17 years for the age 
of first menstruation for normal girls. 
The girls from the country and from the smaller city 
(11,000 population) mature earlier than those from Chi- 
cago and New York, the median ages being respectively 
13 years eight months, 13 years seven months, 13 years 
nine months and 13 years nine months. This conclusion 
substantiates the similar conditions found for boys. 
2. Relation of establishment of maturity to height of girls. 
a. Data. In order to find the correlation from another angle 
between physical growth and the date of maturity (first menstru- 
ation) of girls, 151 Horace Mann girls and 53 University of Chi- 
cago high school girls between 11 and 17 years of age were taken, 
with the heights recorded at the time of the appearance of this ~ 
physiological function.
-P-A-G-E-357
  
PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 343 
It was found for the Horace Mann School, Columbia, that 
the seven girls who matured at 11 years of age had an average 
height of 148.2 cm., with the average or norm for the school at 
140.39 cm.; the 25 girls who matured at 12 years of age had an 
average height of 152.1 cm., with the average or norm for the 
school at 146.22 cm.; the 56 girls maturing at 13 years of age had 
an average height of 155.3 cm. and the norm was 152.74 cm.; 
the 42 girls maturing at 14 years of age had an average height 
of 159.6 cm. and the norm was 156.97 cm.; the 17 girls maturing 
at 15 years of age were 158.5 cm. in height and the norm was 
159.35 cm.; and the four girls maturing at 16 or a comparatively 
late age were 163.2 cm., while the average for the group was 
161.59 cm. 
It was found that in working with the data for the 53 girls 
from the University of Chicago, those who matured at 11 years 
of age had an average height of 146.9 cm., while the average or 
norm was 141. The nine who matured at 12 years of age had 
an average height of 151.4 cm., with the average or norm for 
the school of 146 cm. The 22 girls who matured at 13 years 
of age had an average height of 154.7 and the norm was 153 cm. 
The 14 girls maturing at 14 years of age had an average height 
of 158.7 cm. and the norm-was 157 cm. The six girls who 
matured at 15 years of age were 159.6 cm. in height and the norm 
was 159 cm.; and the two girls maturing at 16 or a comparatively 
late age were 161 cm., with the average for the group 160 cm. 
b. Conclusions: 
These results show that girls who mature early are on the 
average close to the norm or below it. This is contrary 
to the current belief that early maturation is a sign of poor 
health. 
3. Individual growth curves. «a. Data. As soon as the wide 
range of pubescent development in terms of chronological ages 
is appreciated, the question arises, what underlying principle gov- 
erns this period of physiological ripening and causes such differ- 
ences in the phases of physical maturation. This may be made 
very clear by the charts taken from a previous investigation,* 
*B. T. Baldwin. A Measuring Scale for Physical Growth and Physio- 
logical Age. Fifteenth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of 
Education, Part I, 11-23-16. The materials and charts in this article are 
supplementary to a previous study, Physical Growth and School Progress.
-P-A-G-E-358
344 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
  where the individual growth curves are given and the establish- 
ment of the period of first menstruation is indicated by heavy 
black dots. It must be recognized that a limited number of type 
cases are given, but they are all approximately normal. Since 
these are individual pictures, their validity is established and 
their worth of permanent value for future analyses. An appli- 
cation of scientific procedure will find several other conditions, 
such as heredity, social environment, climate, exercise and nation- 
ality as important determining factors. The problem here, as 
in the other sections of the Study, consists in finding the basic 
facts for further study of the normal child. 
In the collected results it may be noted that tall girls as a rule, 
mature earlier than short ones. This was shown in the writer’s 
original study ° by means of individual growth curves. The indi- 
vidual growth curves in height give some exceptions to this rule, 
but they demonstrate the law that early maturity means that 
growth is nearing completion in height as well as sex development. 
b. Conclusions: 
Tall girls of a fairly homogeneous group, as a general rule 
mature earlier than short ones. 
Score cards are presented for boys and girls 5!4-17%4 years, giving the 
Baldwin and the Boas norms for height, weight and lung capacity, with 
graphs on which the child’s development can be plotted for comparison 
with these norms. A chart with growth curves for height, of eight girls, 
measured over an extended period is given, showing the time of appearance 
of menstruation. These curves show that tall girls as a rule mature earlier 
than shorter ones. A distribution table of pubescent changes in 1241 girls 
is given. Another chart shows the distribution of pre-pubescent and post- 
pubescent boys (1317 from the city, 3600 from the country). From this 
it appears that the pubescent changes occur earlier in country boys. 
*B. T. Baldwin. Physical Growth and School Progress, United States 
Bureau of Education, Bulletin 1914, No. 14, Washington: U. S. Bur. of Educ., 
1914, No. ro. Pp. 212. This is an extensive series of measurements at yearly 
and half yearly intervals of 861 boys and 1063 girls in elementary and high 
schools of Chicago and New York City. The records include consecutive 
measurements on the same individuals (nude) for periods of three to 12 
years, of height, weight and lung capacity, together with the school marks 
of these same children from grade to grade. The data are carefully analyzed 
in 34 tables and 39 charts, which show that these children are on the average 
better developed physically than those measured for the norms of other 
investigators. The conclusion is drawn that “if pedagogical age is accepted 
as a fair equivalent in these three different schools, for mental development, 
the tall heavy boys and girls, with good lung capacity, are older physio- 
logically and further along in their stages toward mental maturity as evi- 
denced by school progress, than the short light boys and girls.”

4. Relation of maturation to growth. a. Data. The relation 
between the cessation of growth and the advent of sex maturity 
may be shown by a study of the average annual increments of 
growth between nine and 18 years of age. For the girls who 
matured at 11 years the increment of growth increased rapidly 
from nine to 11 and dropped rapidly almost to the one centimeter 
point at 14. For those girls who matured at 12 years of age, 
there was an increase in the average increment until 11, then 
a slight drop and after 12 a rapid cessation until 15, when it 
was below the one centimeter increment. For those who matured 
at 13 there was a slight drop at ro and an increase until 12, then 
a drop to less than one centimeter at 16. For those who matured 
at 14 there was a slight drop until 17, at which age the average 
is less than one centimeter. For the 15 year old girls there was 
a relatively high increment until 14 years, when there was a 
rapid decrease to less than one centimeter at 17. For 16 year 
old girls the rapid drop also began at 14 years and reached the 
minimum at 18 years of age.® 
b. Conclusions: 
I. Early maturity is followed, as a rule, by a rapid cessation 
of growth in stature. For girls who mature at 11, a rapid 
decrease in annual increment follows until 14, where there 
is less than a centimeter of growth. For those who 
mature at 12 a rapid decrease in increment follows until 
15, when there is less than a centimeter of growth. 
II. For girls who mature at 13 or later, the decrease in incre- 
ment begins in the year previous to maturation, and 
reaches one centimeter or less three years later. 
III. The decrease in yearly increment is more prolonged for 
girls who mature late. 
IV. There is a positive correlation between physiological stages 
of maturation and anatomical age, as evidenced by height, 
weight, and the development of the area of the carpal 
bones. 
5. Applications of the concept of physiological age. Six dis- 
tinct applications of the concept of physiological age in child 
development may be cited here: 
*Data from Horace Mann, University of Chicago and F. W. Parker 
Schools.
-P-A-G-E-360
  346 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
a. To plysical training. Physical age has a direct bear- 
ing on physical training and directed play. Not only do children 
naturally play with boys and girls of their same physiological 
age, but the types of games in which they participate are de- 
pendent upon the stage of physiological maturity. It would be 
justifiable to arrange physical training schedules in schools on 
the basis of physiological age, giving boys or girls of the same 
physiological age similar types of exercises. On the average, girls 
are older physiologically than boys. 
b. To stages of mental maturation. Physiological age is, the 
writer believes, directly correlated with stages of mental matura- 
tion. The physiologically more mature child has different atti- 
tudes, different types of emotions, different interests, than the 
child who is physically younger though of the same chronological 
age. While a child may be precocious intellectually, and have a 
high intelligence quotient and pass beyond its chronological age 
in the development of certain mental traits, other types of traits 
indicative of mental maturity may be undeveloped. 
Another experimental study just completed shows that the men- 
tal age of the individual bears a direct relationship to the physio- 
logical age as indicated by height and weight. The results show 
that at each chronological age the physiologically accelerated boys 
and girls have a higher mental age than those of the average or 
below the average physiological age. The girls, when classified 
on this basis, show a higher mental age for a given chronological 
age than do the boys. Girls are on the average mentally older 
than boys. 
c. To school progress and promotion. Physiological age has 
a direct bearing on pedagogical age, as many of our schools are 
beginning to recognize. The larger and physiologically more ma- 
ture child may be able to do certain types of school work better, 
although of inferior ability in specific’ traits which have been 
greatly emphasized by school curricula. No child should be pro- 
moted or demoted without taking into consideration his or her 
physiological age. Girls may be expected to progress more rapidly 
than boys. 
d. To industrial work. There should be a direct relationship 
between physiological age and the age at which boys and girls 
enter industrial work. Child labor legislation should take into 
consideration the physiological development of the boy or girl as 
well as his or her chronological age and school standing. Some 
children are sufficiently mature physically to meet the require-
-P-A-G-E-361
  PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 347 
ments of an age limit of 14 or 16, while others are immature and 
in a stage of physiological growth where more school training, 
more physical training and more opportunity for physical devel- 
opment are essential. 
e. To social adjustment. That there is a direct relationship 
between social age and physiological maturity needs only to be 
mentioned to be evident. Some girls at a given chronological age 
are sufficiently mature to meet the social conditions which may 
arise, while others are not. It is apparent that in dealing with 
children, especially delinquents, between 1o and 18 years of age, 
there is a tremendous problem involved which rests directly on 
the physiological age of the individual. Girls face this problem 
earlier on the average than do boys. In a particular case it may 
mean a social misfit for life with another child involved, or the 
individual may be subject to remedial social training and de- 
velopment. 
f. To moral and religious awakenings. The commonly ob- 
served periods of moral and religious awakening in children, par- 
ticularly at 12 to 16 years of age, show that there is a close re- 
lationship between physiological age and religious development, 
with girls preceding boys. 
THE RELATION BETWEEN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL GROWTH* 
By Brep T. Batpwin 
A few years ago, I published a study on Physical Growth and 
School Progress,* based on individual growth curves of children. 
The chief value of these curves consisted in the fact that they 
were the first to follow consecutively the same groups of children 
for several years in physical growth, school standing, and the 
relation of the two. Since the first report I have emphasized 
in various investigations the individualizing method. This paper 
presents additional empirical data on the analysis and signifi- 
cance of physical growth curves, the interpretation of similar data 
on mental growth curves, and the relation between mental and 
physical growth. 
At present I have data at hand on approximately 2500 indi- 
viduals for 30 physical traits with consecutive measurements on

nude children for periods of from 18 to 24 semi-annual intervals. 
These boys and girls have had systematic medical inspection, 
directed play, physical training, and those falling outside a normal 
growth zone on account of disease history or abnormal growth 
have been eliminated. If one of these specific physical traits is 
selected, growth in standing height for example, the curves show 
a number of individual characteristics and definite basic prin- 
ciples of growth for different types of children.® 
The relation between plysical and mental growth. It is ap- 
parent that certain phenomena associated with physical develop- 
ment show themselves in an increase or decrease in the mental 
age and in the IQ at certain chronological ages. Both superior 
boys and girls show a rise in the mental age and in the IQ’s 
between the ages of 11 and 12. Average girls also show this 
adolescent acceleration, although it appears later than in the 
case of superior girls. The IQ curve and the mental growth curve 
of the average boys do not show this phenomenon, possibly be- 
cause they have not reached the age of acceleration. 
The general pre-pubertal increase in mental development be- 
comes evident earlier in the case of superior children than in 
average children and in the case of superior girls about a year 
earlier than in average girls. These same contrasts exist between 
average and accelerated boys and girls physiologically classified. 
In general all of these curves show that in regard to these adoles- 
cent phenomena boys and girls are usually a year apart in their 
general development. 
The mean mental age of physiologically accelerated children 
is higher than for physiologically retarded children when those 
above the norms in height and weight (the accelerated) are com- 
pared with those above the mean mental age for each year. 
Growth in height shows in all of our studies a high correlation 
with physiological age, or stages of physiological maturity, when 
various criteria of this age are used. On the average, weight 
correlates with height +-0.809 for boys and 0.603 for girls at any 
two subsequent ages from 7 to 17. The inter-correlations of 
physical traits are consistently higher for boys; the coefficients 
of variability are also higher for boys. 
The coefficient for a group of 49 girls by the method of partial 
correlation (with age constant) is between weight and height

-++o.57; between height and x-ray +-0.52. For height and mental 
age the coefficient is +0.53. That is, physiologically accelerated 
girls (and the same holds true of boys) are mentally accelerated. 
The mental acceleration includes both stages of mental maturity 
and brightness, since the scale does not differentiate between 
these two distinct phases of mental growth. As I pointed out 
in 1914, no scale can accurately measure mental growth which 
does not take into consideration individual differences in physio- 
logical ages for children of the same sex and same chronological 
age. A thorough-going program for investigating the relation 
between mental and physical growth would require consecutive 
mental and physical examinations on a large group of children 
at regular intervals, with uniform methods and standardized scales 
for mental and physical maturity and intelligence. This would 
necessitate a tri-dimensional scale in place of our mental chrono- 
logical age scales. 
EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PHYSICAL STATUS AND OF 
PHYSIOLOGICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, AND 
SOCIAL MATURITY”

Dorotuy Van ALSTYNE 
An experiment was designed to test the significance of several 
representative measures under the actual conditions and in the 
customary groupings of the Horace Mann School. As subjects 
were used the pupils of three classes (fifty-seven pupils) at Grade 
4 level and, to test a pre-school level, approximately sixty pupils 
of the kindergarten groups. 
The following measurements and estimates were secured: 
I. Physical Measurements. (1) Total area of ossification of 
the wrist bones from X-ray photographs, measurements by means 
of the Planimeter,™ (2) ratio of area of ossification of wrist bones 
to total wrist bone area, (3) height, (4) weight, (5) chest girth, 
(6) lung capacity, (7) strength of forearm, (8) index of nutri- 
tion based on Dr. T. H. Wood’s tables.

III. Emotional Maturity, as indicated by absence of excessive 
emotionality, maturity of control, evenness and appropriateness, 
etc., which were described in a rating scale; estimated by several 
teachers. 
IV. Social Maturity, as indicated by responsibility, coopera- 
tiveness, respect for law and order and leadership; estimated. 
V. Mental Ability and Maturity.

osity. 
VI. Educational Achievement and Maturity. 
(1) For Grade 4, a battery of six tests from the Stan- 
ford Achievement tests plus Horace Mann objective 
tests in language usage and spelling. 
(3) Teachers’ estimates of scholastic maturity as indi- 
cated by initiative, interest, habits, persistence in 
school work, fitness for promotion. 
The mental tests were given at the beginning of the year, or 
based on I. Q.’s secured earlier; the physical tests were given early 
in the year, with the exception of the X-rays of the wrist which 
were secured near mid-year; the estimates were secured at the 
end of the year and were based on observations of at least a year; 
the educational tests were given at the end of the year. 
Since the existence of sex differences, at least in physical traits, 
has been demonstrated, for purposes of comparison and correla- 
tion, both groups—the kindergarten and Grade 4—were divided 
into the two sexes for each of which results were computed sepa- 
rately. Between each pair of variables, therefore, four correla- 
tions were obtained. Although the range of life ages was not 
great (the average deviations being about 0.65 years for the 
kindergarten and 0.57 for Grade 4) the effect on the correlations 
was appreciable and was therefore eliminated by partial cor- 
relation.

Details will not be presented in this paper, but will be pub- 
lished in full elsewhere.’? Only those conclusions which appear 
well substantiated by the evidence will be presented and these in 
summary. 
Our data force us to an apparent disagreement with Baldwin, 
Rotch, Woodrow, and others concerning the general significance, 
the predictive value, of physical traits. These writers have sug- 
gested that certain traits, notably the X-rays of the wrist bones, 
are indicative of general anatomical, physiological or physical 
maturity, or of “physical fitness” or of “maturity” in general. 
Thus, Baldwin recently has written that “there is a high corre- 
lation of the development of carpal bones . . . with growth in 
stature and with other criteria of maturity.” 1° 
Our objections are, first, that the correlations among physical 
measures while always positive and often high are also often 
low. No single measure is an adequate index of the status in 
all others. The area of ossification of the wrist bones, for ex- 
ample, while correlating about 0.60 with height and weight, 
yields lower coefficients, 0.43, 0.31, 0.26 and 0.25, respectively, 
with chest girth, lung capacity, strength of grip, and an index 
of nutrition. To secure a measure of general physical status it is 
necessary to combine several physical measurements. 
Second, no single physical measure yields a high correlation 
with the estimates of physical vigor, stamina, maturity and fit- 
ness made by several teachers after a school year of observation 
of their pupils. The ossification of the carpal bones, for ex- 
ample, yields an average correlation of 0.15 with these estimates; 
the highest correlation, 0.37, is given by nutrition. When all 
seven different physical measures are combined by the technique 
of multiple correlation, the correlation with physical fitness is 
0.61. Specialization in the development of physical features is 
thus indicated again; no single touchstone of physical fitness ap- 
pears. It may be objected, of course, that the teachers’ judg- 
ments are inadequate. The fact that the correlations run up 
steadily as more measures of physical traits are added to the team 
is some evidence to the contrary, and other evidence will be

Status and of Mental, Physiological, Social and Emotional Maturity.”

observed later, particularly the fact that the correlation of the 
teachers’ estimate of physical fitness adds to the correlation with 
educational achievement, over and above the influence of M. A., 
not only more than any single physical trait but more than all 
of them combined. 
Third, no physical trait is an adequate index—as other writers 
imply—of such types of maturity as mental, scholastic, social, 
emotional, or “general” maturity. For example, the X-ray of 
the carpal bones correlates from .o7 to 0.24 with the several 
ratings. No other single physical trait varies much from the 
average correlations for all physical measures, which are as fol- 
lows: with mental age, 0.09; with estimated mental maturity, 
0.11; with social maturity, 0.14; with educational maturity, 0.13; 
with emotional maturity, 0.14; with the sum of all maturity rat- 
ings (ie., “general maturity”), 0.16. Clearly there has been 
a great over-estimation by many of the general significance of 
these physical measurements. With no measure of maturity does 
a single physical trait give a correlation practically serviceable 
for individual prediction. Furthermore, when all of the physical 
measures here used are teamed together by multiple correlation, 
the resulting coefficients are in no case high except with estimated 
physical fitness. All physical traits combined with weightings to 
yield the highest possible correlation, yield with mental age 0.21, 
and with social maturity 0.37, which was the highest obtained. 
Fourth, maturities, as we have appraised them, are not every- 
where one and the same. Growth is specialized and has many 
phases. In so far as physical status, mental age, educational 
age, and estimated mental, physical, social, scholastic and emo- 
tional maturities, as here secured, represent phases or types of 
growth, the conclusion apparent is that growth is not everywhere 
uniform and single but varied and, in different degrees, independ- 
ent. In our groups there is little association between mental and 
physical growth, or between social or emotional maturity and 
educational age. Among some of the estimated maturities, the 
correlations are relatively high, due in part to the familiar ten- 
dency of human judges to fall into errors (the “halo” influence) 
which produces correlations that are spuriously high. When rea- 
sonable allowances for these influences are made, the disparity 
among the various maturities or growths which appear to exist in 
nature is strongly suggested. 
Classification, then, in terms of maturity offers this difficulty: 
The several varieties, while intercorrelated variously, are never- 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  
PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 353 
theless far from identical. Arrange the group according to one 
and there is left a wide range in others. 
The problem of classifying pupils can scarcely be adequately 
discussed until the objectives have been determined. It is the 
object to group together those that are alike in mental age, 
mental maturity, physical development, social, scholastic, or emo- 
tional maturity or what? Since students of the subject will dis- 
agree on these matters, it will be advisable to take up the prob- 
lem from definite but different points of view, attempting to as- 
certain what measures or estimates will best enable us to gather 
together those most alike in some respect. First, let us con- 
sider the problem from the point of view of predicting educational 
achievement on the assumption that our purpose, for the moment, 
is to get together pupils whose prospects of advancement in these 
respects are similar. 
The problem of classification of pupils, once mainly solved on 
the basis of demonstrated or estimated achievement, is now more 
difficult inasmuch as expectation of progress is the more prominent 
consideration. It is now considered not enough to group together 
children who are scholastically alike at the moment; those should 
be put together who will advance similarly. It is necessary, there- 
fore, that means of predicting probable achievement be secured. 
The degree to which the several variables will enable us to in- 
crease the accuracy of our prediction of achievement becomes the 
matter of prime import. 
Of all the tests or estimates used in this study, the Stanford- 
Binet Mental Age gave the best prediction of achievement. Al- 
though all of these tests were given at the beginning of the 
year, or at the beginning of the preceding year, the final attain- 
ments in May were foretold with an accuracy indicated by an un- 
corrected correlation of .595. Except for the teachers’ judgments 
of mental maturity (made at the end of the other year and doubt- 
less influenced by knowledge of test results), no other variable 
approaches this prediction. The physical measurements given at 
the beginning of the year gave correlations as follows: Height 
.o1, weight .o7, chest girth .o3, lung capacity .oo, grip .15, nutri- 
tion .15. The measure of ossification of the wrist bones, secured 
at midyear, gave for total area .o2, and percentages of ossifica- 
tion 0.16. All of these correlations are undoubtedly so small as 
to be of no appreciable value. Achievement is correlated with 
physical efficiency during the year, estimated at the end, .38; with 
social maturity .19; with emotional maturity .20.
-P-A-G-E-368
    354 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
How great the specific influences of these variables may be 
is disclosed by the multiple correlations obtained when one or 
more variables are added to M.A. to give the highest obtainable 
correlation with achievement as compared to the coefficient which 
M.A. alone yields. When all of the physical measures are teamed 
with M.A. the coefficient with achievement is 0.626, an almost 
insensible rise above the 0.595 given by M.A. alone. 
Better than the team of physical measurements is the teachers 
estimate of physical fitness, vigor and stamina. Whereas the 
team of physical measurements increases the coefficient from 
0.595, that given by M.A. alone, to 0.626, the addition of es- 
timated physical fitness pushes the coefficient to 0.653. This 
figure is higher than those produced by adding singly social or 
emotional maturity and the same as that given by adding the 
teachers’ estimates of mental maturity. When M.A., estimated 
physical fitness and mental maturity are all combined, the cor- 
relation with achievement becomes 0.67. This was the highest 
multiple correlation secured except those which included the 
teacher’s estimate or educational maturity. Adding educational 
maturity is, however, barely legitimate since the teachers, know- 
ing fairly well their pupils’ accomplishment, may have been more 
or less influenced by it in their judgments. The result is thus, 
in a measure, a spurious self-correlation. 
It may be urged that even if a measurement of mental ability, 
slightly qualified by considerations of physical status, and fitness 
and mental maturity, yields the best available means of pre- 
diction, it might still be undesirable. While the physically in- 
ferior may, or even do, accomplish essentially as much as those of 
similar mentality but superior in weight, size and other physical 
traits, they should not, perhaps in the interest of health or phy- 
sical growth, be required or allowed to do so. This consideration 
lies outside the scope of this study; no data are available on it. 
It is plainly a problem worthy of careful investigation. A priori 
there is a defense for an opposing point of view, namely, that 
health and growth are both benefited not by idleness or by work 
on materials below the level of one’s powers but by absorption 
in tasks which are adjusted as closely as may be to one’s ability. 
For this assumption there is, moreover, considerable evidence, 
both from observations of school children and from observations 
of adults by physicians and others. We have not as yet been pre- 
sented with evidence that acceleration on the basis of mental 
ability alone does any harm to health, happiness, growth or effi- ,
-P-A-G-E-369
  PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 355 
ciency; nor have we seen any satisfactory evidence that grading 
mainly on the basis of physiological maturity yields beneficial 
results in these respects. 
Even if it is urged that equality in capacity for scholastic 
achievement is not the only criterion for classification or promo- 
tion of pupils, but that similarity in physiological maturity, in 
physical strength, athletic abilities, motor abilities, social apti- 
tude, inclinations or maturity, emotional propensities and ma- 
turity, and other human traits, is also desirable, it becomes none 
the less essential that similarity in strictly scholastic possibilities 
be maintained; this problem can by no maneuvering be brushed 
aside. The other criteria of classification, however, do merit con- 
sideration. 
We should consider ways and means of selecting pupils alike 
in physique, in social, moral, emotional and other traits. Our data, 
so far as they go, demonstrate this fact: We do not secure groups 
uniform in the social, emotional, mental or scholastic traits by 
grouping them on a basis of physical measurements. Whether we 
would get pupils alike even in motor facility and aptitude, in 
athletic prowess, was not determined. In general, it was found 
that these several divisions of traits were far from perfectly cor- 
related. Each must be measured by itself and not estimated from 
something else. Thus, social maturity is correlated with ossified 
area, 0.13; with ossified ratio, 0.20; with height, 0.15; with 
weight, 0.17; with all physical traits combined, 0.37; with M.A., 
0.26; with educational achievement, 0.19; and with estimated 
educational maturity, 0.43; with mental 0.69, emotional 0.66, and 
physical fitness 0.66. When allowances are made for the con- 
stant error (halo effect) of judgments which produces correlations 
with social maturity, itself estimated, which are too high, it ap- 
pears probable that no grouping will give a compact distribution 
in all of these traits. 
No one, we trust, will accuse the writers of having said that 
“physical measurements are of little value, barely worth the 
trouble.” This is not implied. These measurements are highly 
to be desired for their own sake, for appraising physical growth, 
regulating diet, exercise, for correcting defects, suggesting sus- 
ceptibilities, and other uses, but not for the purposes of classify- 
ing children intellectually, scholastically, socially or emotionally, 
at least, as these traits were appraised in the Horace Mann 
School,

The subjects. The subjects of this study were the six hundred 
odd pupils of Punahou School who are of old American, British, 
German, or Scandinavian descent. By far the greater number of 
this group are of old American stock, coming originally from New 
England or the Pacific States. Many are Island-born. The Brit- 
ish stock is mainly from New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. 
As a group, these students constitute a fairly homogeneous race 
group. Punahou School is located in Honolulu, Hawaii. It con- 
sists of an elementary school, a junior and senior academy. All 
school grades from the first to the twelfth are included. The 
student body of the school is made up largely of white American 
children, although there is also a considerable number of Orientals, 
Hawaiians, part Hawaiians, and Portuguese. Since these last 
mentioned groups are too small numerically to be considered sep- 
arately we have excluded them from this study in order to elim- 
inate, as far as possible, the race factor. 
In economic and social status, as well as in general intelligence, 
the students of this school stand about half way between those 
of the ordinary American public schools and the better private 
schools. Punahou School is a private school, but because of the 
overwhelmingly large number of Oriental pupils in the public 
schools of Honolulu, it serves the purpose of educating a large 
number of the white children who would ordinarily attend the 
public school. The parents of these children are trades people, 
clerical and professional workers, and wealthy plantation owners. 
In most schools there is a gradual selection of pupils as ad- 
vance is made through the grades. Those whose general intelli- 
gence is below normal are more likely to be eliminated with each 
advancing school grade and in all comparisons between mental 
ability of the children of different school grades this fact should 
be taken into consideration. At Punahou School, as in most 
private schools, this factor of elimination is not so prominent as in 
public schools. One reason is that there are no children (or at

least, very few) even in the lower grades who have mental ability 
very much below the average. Another reason is that pupils of 
even inferior ability are likely to continue longer in private than 
in public schools because of the social position of their parents. 
The selective factor which eliminates pupils below the average of 
general intelligence is thus less operative in the series under dis- 
cussion than in a public school group. But we cannot say that 
it does not exist. There is also an influx of somewhat highly 
selected pupils from the public schools at the ninth grade which 
would probably accentuate somewhat the selection in the high 
school group. 
Method. The measures of general intelligence used here are 
the intelligence quotients which were found for each pupil. The 
intelligence quotient is the result obtained by dividing the mental 
age by the chronological age. Each of these ages was calculated 
to the nearest month. The mental ages used were obtained from 
the scores made in standardized group tests of general intelli- 
gence. The group tests used were: the Otis Primary Test for 
grades 1 to 3; the National Intelligence Tests, form 1, scales A 
and B, for grades 3 to 9; and the Terman Group Test, form A, 
for grades 9 to 12. 
For a final measure of the intelligence quotient of pupils, we 
used the following: for a pupil whose results were obtained from 
the National Intelligence Test only, we used the intelligence quo- - 
tient as originally obtained; for a pupil whose intelligence quo- 
tient was based upon the Terman Group Test, we used that quo- 
tient plus six; for a pupil whose intelligence quotient was based 
pon the Otis Primary Test, we used that quotient minus twelve; 
for a pupil for whom there were two available quotients (pupils 
f grades three and nine), we used the average of the two quo- 
ients, after properly correcting the intelligence quotient obtained 
rom the Terman and Otis tests. For the purposes of this study 
we feel that this use of our data furnishes sufficiently reliable 
information as to the relative general intelligence of the pupils. 
Table XXX contains these intelligence quotients for the total 
roup studied. 
The anthropometric characters used in this study were: (a) 
tature or body height without shoes recorded to the nearest cen- 
imeter. (b) Body weight with ordinary indoor clothing, but 
ithout shoes. (c) Average head diameters. The maximum head 
length and the maximum head width were added together and 
divided by two. This measurement was used to replace head cir-

cumference which is usually employed in such studies. While it 
would be obviously unfair to use the average of the length and 
breadth of the head in a comparison of the size of the head in 
two distinct racial groups, it is not unfair to use this diameter 
as an index of size of head within a group. 
Instead of using absolute stature, weight, and head diameter, 
the average of each character was found for each sex and age 
group and the individual’s weight, stature, or head diameter was 
expressed in so many pounds, centimeters, or millimeters above 
or below the average of his or her own age-sex group. Since the 
physical measures are expressed in these relative, rather than 
absolute, terms, there would be no particular purpose served in 
presenting these distributions. 
Our choice of intelligence quotients as mental measures and 
deviations from the average of the age-sex group in weight, 
stature, and head diameter as physical measures was made in

‘order to eliminate the age factor and so to make possible the 
direct comparison of all of our subjects. The use of the intelli- 
gence quotient which is computed to the nearest month prac- 
tically eliminates growth within the age period in mental meas- 
ures. In our physical measurements, the year rather than the 
‘month, was used as the computing unit. But the freeing of 
either of the measures of the age factor, as we have done by 
using the intelligence quotient, has made possible the finding of 
correlations between mental and physical traits which are not 
‘spuriously enlarged. Chance errors due to growth within the year 
period in physical traits can have resulted only in having slightly 
reduced the actual correlations. 
Results. Our most important results have to do with the cor- 
relations which were found between general intelligence and 
weight, stature, and head diameter. The coefficients of correla- 
tion are .16 for weight; .14 for stature; and .22 for head diameter. 
These coefficients are rather small but still too large to be ac- 
counted for by accident since they are from five to seven times 
‘as great as their probable errors. The fact that the coefficients 
are all in the same direction from o.also indicates that we are in 
all probability dealing with real correlations. The difference in 
the degree of correlation between weight and stature is probably 
not significant, but there is a possibility that the higher value 
for head diameter is significant. 
_ The significance and reliability of our coefficients were further 
‘tested for weight and head diameter by separating our material 
into two groups. Sex seemed to be the most convenient basis 
for this separation. (The coefficients or correlation for boys are 
-16 for weight and .20 for head, and for girls .13 for weight and 
.27 for head. The coefficients are from three to nine times their 
probable errors.) The results decidedly emphasize the fact that 
positive correlations do exist between mental and physical meas- 
ures. They also strengthen the belief that there is a higher cor- 
relation between general intelligence and head size than there is 
between general intelligence and body weight. No consistent sex 
differences in the degree of correlation appear. 
_ The degree of correlation may also be expressed by the differ- 
ence in weight, height, and head diameters of individuals with in- 
telligence above the general average and those whose intelligence 
is below the average. The group with intelligence quotients below 
100, who are, on the average, 27 points lower in general intelli- 
gence, are 4.8 pounds lighter, 1.5 centimeters shorter, and their
-P-A-G-E-374
  360 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
heads are 2.0 millimeters smaller than the group with intelligence 
quotients above 100. The corresponding chance differences which 
we might expect between two groups of the same size and vari- 
ability would be 1.09 pounds, .50 centimeters and .37 millimeters. 
The differences found are too great to be attributed to chance. 
(For weight, height, and head diameter, the correlations with in- 
telligence for pupils above roo I.Q. are .o4, .o6, and .11, re- 
spectively; for pupils below too I.Q., the correlations are .13, 
14, and .1o. In the case of weight and stature, there is a de- 
cided difference between the size of the correlations of those who 
are above and those who are below the general average in mental 
ability. For both weight and stature the correlation is about 
three times as great for those who have intelligence quotients 
below 100. The difference in both cases for weight and stature 
is as great as or greater than the sum of the probable errors of 
the two correlations involved. It seems, therefore, to be a very 
safe conclusion that the difference found is real and not due to 
chance. Our results indicate that the correspondence between 
general intelligence and weight and stature in individuals with 
general intelligence above the average is almost nil. The corre- 
lations with weight and stature respectively are .o4 and .06. 
Were it not that these two correlations substantiate each other 
by being positive and that in this they agree with our results in 
general we might even doubt that they are at all significant. This 
difference in the degree of correlation between different mental 
groups probably accounts for many apparent discrepancies be- 
tween the results of various investigators. 
The correlation between general intelligence and head measure 
of the pupils here studied shows no difference between those who 
are above and those who are below 100. Whether or not this 
similarity of the correlations is real or is due to chance is impos- 
sible to say. We have no check on this, by having a duplicate 
similar measure such as we might say weight and stature furnish 
for each other; it is quite within the limits of possibility as sug- 
gested by the probable errors of the correlations that the corre- 
lations between general intelligence really differ somewhat also. 
We do not feel warranted in drawing conclusions from any of 
our results, unless at least two measures point in the same 
direction. 
Our data bring out another important point to be borne in 
mind in interpreting coefficients of correlation. We saw that 
for weight and stature the correlation with general intelligence
-P-A-G-E-375
PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 361 
: s greater in those individuals whose mental ability was below 
the average. Yet an inspection of the data shows that the co- 
efficients of correlation are even greater for the total group. This 
is due to the fact that in arbitrarily dividing our material at the 
100 intelligence quotient point we decreased the variability of 
two groups for general intelligence. The result of this has 
of course been to decrease the size of the coefficient of correla- 
hina This result emphasizes the importance of selection of sub- 
jects in such studies as this. 
A HEALTH PROGRAM * 
By J. H. McCurpy, CaarmMan 
The health needs of the high school call for the following 
health program: 
I. A careful health examination which should include: 
A. Medical examination 
B. Mental examination 
C. Physical examination 
II. A healthful environment in home and school 
III. Instruction in health problems 
IV. Physical activity 
A. Equipment, minimum requirement 
B. Amount and kind, minimum requirement 
C. Kind of exercise 
V. School credit 
Health examination. The first step in the health program is to 
discover how nature has endowed the individual. It must ascer- 
tain by examination the physical and mental endowment and the. 
capacity for activity. 
A. Medical inspection. The objects of medical inspection 
int been the detection of infectious diseases, of physical defects 
in the pupil, and the improvement of the sanitary condition of the 
choolroom. The medical inspector should cooperate with the

‘ion. United States Bureau of Education Bulletin 1917, No. 50, 9-11. Of 
his report only the portion which deals with a health examination is here 
quoted in addition to the outline of a health program. 
   
-P-A-G-E-376
362 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
physical instructor in the correction of physical defects and with 
the regular teacher or the trained psychologist in the diagnosis and 
treatment of mental defects. 
B. Mental examination. The mental examination should seek 
to ascertain the mental health of the pupil and his nervous and 
mental constitution. The health of an individual depends in 
large measure upon a normal central nervous system, and upon 
his attitude of mind toward his work. The time of entering the 
junior high school is the most critical time in adolescence. At this 
time the constitution is particularly liable to nervous difficulties, 
as most neuroses either develop at this time, or lay their insidious 
hold then upon the individual, to develop later. Much stress in 
modern psychology is laid upon the necessity of correlating the 
program of the pupil with his dominant interest. In the junior 
high school he is offered a choice of subjects for the first time. 
The proper adjustment of his program is often closely related to 
his nervous health, and data for this adjustment should include the 
results obtained by mental tests. 
It is probably unnecessary that critical mental examinations 
should be given to every pupil. It is, however, necessary to give 
such an examination to the subnormal and the supernormal child. 
For the other pupils an examination of their grades in their 
studies, correlated with their grades in physical education and 
manual training, will give a very fair index of their nervous and 
mental health and constitution, and will give data on which to base 
an all-round program for their high-school courses. In correlating 
the grades of the pupils special care should be taken to make sure 
that the marks represent capacity rather than mere attendance 
and good deportment. Care should be exercised, too, in differen- 
tiating between manual training and physical education. Manual 
training calls for the use of the small muscles of the eye and 
hand, and, in a slight degree, the big muscles of the arms, legs, 
and trunk. Manual skill of the small muscles represents, in gen- 
eral, health of the fine neuromuscular mechanisms. In physical 
education the large muscles of the arms, legs, and trunk should 
be used vigorously. Good grades in this work should represent 
fundamental health with organic, neural, and muscular capacity. 
In terms of the physical education grades, pupils who are fond 
of physical activities, excel in them, and are leaders in games and 
sports as a rule possess good central nervous systems. The ex- 
treme type of such pupils, the athletes, need to be curbed in their 
-sport. The athletic scholarship rules are made largely for their  
-P-A-G-E-377
  PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 363 
enefit, to repress too great attention to sport and to stimulate 
Ss holarship. 
On the other hand, the pupil who has little physical skill and 
lo interest in games ‘and sports usually lacks organic vigor. In 
the extreme type of these pupils is the recluse and the bookworm. 
It is especially in this class that an unstable nervous system may 
be expected. If their education is confined to a purely intellectual 
education, it will be at the expense particularly of the organic 
centers of the nervous system, related to circulation, respiration, 
nd nutrition. 
_A well-balanced course for each individual is the ideal. A 
mental examination, with all the modern methods for the sub- 
rmal and the supernormal, and a careful examination of the 
grades of the average pupil with special reference to his work 
physical education and manual training upon entering the high 
school will aid materially in a wise selection of high-school courses. 
ike Physical examination. The physical examination calls for 
study of the growth and physique of the pupil and a close cor- 
relation of the conditions found with the physical activity pre- 
scribed. The examination should include such vital problems as 
eyesight, hearing, growth in height and weight, bodily strength, 
lung capacity, cardiac efficiency. All these factors should be cor- 
related with the adolescent maturity of the pupils and their schol- 
arship. They are in themselves indices of mental capacity and 
maturity. The programs of the schools should recognize and use 
these findings. Periods of rapid growth in height and weight pre- 
cede growth in strength and endurance. Vigorous big-muscle 
exercise should be the rule during this period. Over-exercise 
should be avoided. 
| Medical, mental, and physical examinations should be corre- 
lated with each other and with the general program of the pupil. 
eretofore the examinations have been conducted partly by the 
edical inspectors, partly by trained psychologists, and partly by 
e director of physical education, without correlation between 
them. Splendid work has been done, but thus far no city is 
known to the committee to have a good working coordination of 
the various problems relating to the health of the pupils. Vari- 
is cities have specialized on different phases. Some cities have 
administrative plan which will enable them to work out the 
edical, hygienic, and physical activity aspects of the problem, 
t apparently have no regular examinations for determining 
the health of the central nervous system, nor for finding the type
-P-A-G-E-378
  364 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of ability of the pupil. Many cities do not seem to know exactly 
what they should secure through a medical or physical examina- 
tion, and do not use the results obtained by either. 
STANDARDIZATION OF TRACK ATHLETICS” 
By Janet WALTER 
We know that many efforts are being made, and have been 
made for some years to work out standards of track and field 
events to use as measuring rods for individuals, teams, and classes. 
There are still some who scoff, but those of us who have used 
standards extensively know that they have a very practical value. 
If a girl is told to jump as far as she can, her effort and achieve- 
ment will not be so great as when she knows that at least a five- 
foot jump is expected of a girl of her age. She will practice 
throwing the ball to reach the standard required of her and keep 
on practicing with something in view to conquer. If in establish- 
ing aims, then, we have furnished an incentive for more exercises, 
we have accomplished something dynamic. 
There has been much discussion as to the basis of these stand- 
ards, and as yet there is no widespread solidarity of opinion. I 
can best put before you my standing on the question by giving a 
history of what we have done in Philadelphia. At least you can 
rest assured that it is not some fantastical theory, but something 
that is in actual practice. Physical education has been a required 
subject in elementary and high schools under the direction of Mr. 
Stecher for sixteen years. In the beginning of his work there, 
he started his corps of supervisors working on standards for 
track and field events. As I was one of the original group of 
supervisors, I have had the opportunity of seeing his ideas put into 
operation. 
We took age as the basis: first, because it was the easiest with 
which to work and could be obtained without any additional 
effort. These standards were to be used by the grade teachers who 
were conducting the physical training work and an age basis was 
possible for practical use in a large system, where a complicated 
plan would not have been. We still use age because of the large- 
ness of our system and the numbers concerned in keeping records. 
We have no quarrel with those who can administer an age-weight-

-P-A-G-E-379
  PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 365 
height system, but such a system is impossible in dealing with 
260,000 pupils. Furthermore, we believe that we do not go far 
wrong with such a basis, for if we allow 15 per cent above and 
below normal weight for any age, we include go per cent of the 
total number of cases in that group. 
In a study of the performance (in a dash, jump and throw) of 
two thousand high school girls, I found that there was little 
variation in the curve obtained when based upon age alone, from 
that based upon height alone, and when based upon weight there 
was a decrease in performance only for girls who were above 120 
pounds. The per cent of error involved in using age only as a 
basis, is compensated for by the amount of work accomplished, 
which would be impossible if an age-weight-height plan were used. 
The mean of the thousands of records obtained in each age 
was found. Taking a figure slightly above this mean, we formed 
our “age-aim.” This process had to be done for each event, so 
that when we finished we had quite a comprehensive working scale. 
The age-aim chart shows what each boy or girl is expected to do 
in different events according to his or her age. It has been neces- 
y every few years to make changes in our standards so that 
the ones we are using to-day represent the results of years of 
experience. 
To get this in the hands of the teachers and in use in the schools 
was a gradual process. But in this we have succeeded so that 
to-fiay in every elementary school we have our track and field 
work conducted along the following lines. Each class from the 
fourth A grade up is divided at the beginning of each term into 
four teams: a girls’ red team, a girls’ white team, a boys’ red 
team, and a boys’ white team. Each team elects a captain. Dur- 
ing the period for track and field work of the class the captain 
takes charge of the team. She has a printed “Captain’s Sheet” 
for her team’s record. This sheet is ruled so that the team can 
be listed by age. There are columns for recording height and 
weight, but these are used only for research purposes. There are 
four other columns, one for the jump, one for the throw, one 
for the dash (fifty yards—forty or thirty where fifty is not 
possible), and one for knee raising (on the boys’ sheet the 
fourth column is for chinning). Each column is sub-divided 
so that there are five spaces. In the first, is placed the aim; the 
four remaining spaces are for the recording of achievements. On 
the back of the sheet is printed the age-aim chart, so that the cap- 
tain has all her material on one sheet. At intervals during the 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
    366 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
month, the captain records each of her team mates’ accomplish- 
ments in the various events. In the dash the captain records only; 
the teachers or supervisors take the time. In the other events, 
however, the captains are trained to judge. To facilitate matters 
we have our school yards properly marked off for each event, so 
that distances are easy to judge. 
If the performance of a girl equals or betters that on the age-aim 
chart in a particular event, she passes in that event. At the end 
of the term, the teacher checks up on a “control sheet,” passed 
or failed in each event, opposite each name. Then, class and 
school percentages can easily be obtained from these sheets. 
Class percentages are charted by the supervisors. In this way 
it can be seen where each class stands in comparison with the 
other classes. In such a plan, we have not only the pupils com- 
peting with the standards or age-aims, but we have competition 
between the teams, between the boys and girls and between 
classes. 
In the junior and senior high schools the “captain sheets” are 
somewhat different, having six columns, five for events—jump, 
throw, dash, apparatus, game—and a sixth for rating. In the ap- 
paratus column, so far, rope climbing has been recorded for girls, 
and in the game column whether or not the student has a playing 
knowledge of the game—the game played during a given report. 
The column for rating has been added to record the number of 
events in which the student has passed. A rating is given, de- 
pendent upon the number of activities passed. Passing in five 
activities is excellent; in four, good; in three, fair; in two, poor; 
and in one, deficient. 
We must, I think, go a step further and give numerical value 
to accomplishments so that each individual can count his aver- 
age and get credit for what he does over and above his age-aims. 
CLASSIFICATION IN ATHLETICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
INDIVIDUAL SELF-RATING* 
By Jesse Ferme WittiaMs anp Myrtte HuMMER 
The interest in educational tests and measurements has spread 
into many fields. Physical education has begun to seek for new 
standards of classification, for tests of motor power that are dy- 
namic, and for measures that will determine not only motor ability 
™ Teachers College Record, XXIII, 240-254. 1922.
-P-A-G-E-381
  
PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 367 
but also health, endurance, and vitality. Up to the present time 
the experiments in this direction have accomplished little of im- 
portance. Reilly has devised helpful classification methods, but 
the work of Richards, Stecher, Brown, Schlafer, and Wilson, and 
the report of the Committee on Physical Efficiency Tests have been 
mainly a tabulation of what children of certain ages could do in 
certain motor acts. 
The field of physical education offers interesting opportunities 
for workers in the field of scientific measurement. It ought to be 
possible to secure a rating of motor ability based upon certain 
beentel motor acts that would result in what might be 
called a “motor quotient” (M.Q.). Such a determination would 
be of immense value for directors and teachers of physical educa- 
a in that part of the program dealing with fundamental motor   education. 
Although such a determination has not yet been worked out, 
the present available methods of determining motor skill or ability 
in definite motor acts seemed to offer an opportunity for improv- 
ing the quality of the work in physical education as it is conducted 
renton, N. J., by the Supervisor of Physical Education. This 
report of a method of classification of boys and girls in athletics 
for the purpose of individual self-rating seeks to show how the 
determination of what boys and girls can do in certain motor 
may be used to increase greatly the interest in the activi- 
ties of physical education. 
During the years 1919 and 1920 efforts in the Trenton schools 
to interest boys and girls in athletics had been directed towards the 
development of a point system. This system provided a minimum 
standard which had to be passed. Credit was given for each 
inch or fifth of second gained over that standard. While this 
brought some favorable results, they were not entirely satisfactory. 
It was decided to see what could be done by means of a class 
division system. In the point system there was a tendency to work 
hard upon that phase of athletics in which a pupil was unusually 
good, as standing broad jump, for example, and to neglect his 
weaker abilities. By the class division system, we hope to pro- 
vide an incentive, not only to improve the ability in which the 
pupil excels, but to bring up the weaker abilities as well. All of 
us like new worlds to conquer, and when the highest class in one 
event has been reached we want the stimulus of success to cause 
the boy or girl to put forth an extra effort to bring up the other 
events. 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
368 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
It is hoped that by this class division system the following aims 
will be accomplished: 
1. To make athletics vital, and so increase the interest of every 
boy and girl in it. 
2. To so grade the events as to furnish an incentive for further 
effort. 
3. To develop class spirit by enabling pupils to score not only 
for self but for the class as well. 
4. To make group competition possible between sexes, classes, 
and grades. 
5. To enable each pupil to grade himself in athletics and physi- 
cal ability, thus making physical standards compatible with 
academic standards and mental work. 
In order to obtain records with which to work, every boy and 
girl in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades of the Trenton 
public schools was tested in the following events: 
Boys Girls 
Standing Broad Jump Dash (60 yards) 
Pull Up (Chinning) Standing Broad Jump 
Dash (60 yards) Goal Shooting 
Running High Jump Overhead Far Throw 
These events were selected because they involved the use of the 
fundamental muscles and included the fundamental activities of 
running, jumping, climbing, and throwing; and because they could 
be measured readily. It is recognized that the standing broad 
jump and overhead far throw for girls are not the most desirable 
events. The methods used have been justified, however, and other 
events may be substituted. 
Forty-three fifth grades, 46 sixth grades, 22 seventh grades, 
and 20 eighth grades were tested, giving a total of 1612 boys’ 
records and 1773 girls’ records. No minimum standards were 
set. Each pupil did his best and his record was taken as such. 
All the records for each grade were then tabulated and three 
class divisions, A, B, C, were made. . . . For the A class 45 of 
the total was used; for the B class 54;; and for the C class, 
65.18 By this method those making the A class, or excellent, 
* The selection of 445, 545, and %»5 as division units of the total number 
of pupils was made arbitrarily. Three groups, A, B, and C, were desired. 
We might have divided the total equally into three parts, but, appreciating
-P-A-G-E-383
  
PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS 369 
     were the smallest group; those making the C class, or average, the 
largest group; and those making the B class, an even third. Ar- 
s soon as possible, these class divisions were put into opera- 
tion, and unless weather conditions prevented, there was daily 
practice in the scheduled events. Pupils were told that they 
would be placed in the next higher class just as soon as they could 
meet the requirements. At intervals of six weeks “try-outs” were 
given and the percentage of A, B, and C classes was determined. 
This was a decided spur to increased effort and caused a good- 
natured rivalry between grades, sexes, and classes. 
inal tests were taken in March and June. The March record 
was used as a stepping-stone to a perfect one in June. From the 
March records, we developed a self-rating scheme which has been 
of great value in grading the all-round physical development of 
the pupils. As mentioned before, values of 25, 15 and ro were 
assigned respectively to the classes A, B and C. After the March 
finals, the sum total of each pupil’s credits was made. These were 
classified and tabulated. The same division units of four-, five-, 
and six-fifteenths were again used and the following rating system 
was evolved: 
A class pupils must earn at least 70 credits 
class pupils must earn 50 to 70 credits 
class pupils must earn 40 to 50 credits 
e restricted the C class by insisting that at least ten credits in 
each event (representing the lowest class) had to be made before 
the pupil was entitled to that rank. This seemed necessary be- 
cause a boy might fail in one event and still make 50%, thus giv- 
ing a pretense of all-round physical development, when one phase 
was below par. 
the fact that normally a smaller number would be superior and a larger 
number average or below, we made the A group smaller by 45 and the 
C group larger by %4s, giving 445 for A, 45 for B, and %5 for C.

By this self-rating scheme which. is here shown in Tables XX XI 
and XXXII, we were able to compare the physical standard with 
the mental standard of the pupils. By this means a pupil may rate 
himself on his performance and determine his standing in each 
event as well as his total score. The class divisions of the self- 
rating (standards) also show that arbitrary values are set for 
chinning and goal shooting. The boys were so weak in the 
former and the girls in the latter that the tests gave no basis for 
determination of values. 
his rating and classification has brought about interesting re- 
sults for our boys and girls. It has aroused a keener spirit of 
competition, both group and individual; it has caused pupils to 
want to exercise before and after school as well as during school 
hours; it has given each pupil a definite knowledge of his strong 
and weak points, and has shown him that he alone can change his 
status. It has set definite goals toward which to strive and has 
rewarded effort. It has also set up a desire for all-round physical 
development, instead of development of one phase of athletics. 
  Principles derived from discussions of the physical equip- 
ment of secondary school pupils. Few generalizations regard- 
ing the physical traits of secondary school pupils are supported 
by repeated tests and experiments. 
ty school pupils are exceedingly variable in physical 
and physiological maturation and in certain grades range from 
preadolescence to postadolescence. 
The physiological and mental maturation of secondary school 
pupils and their “social age” are directly correlated with one an- 
other. According to this principle, tall precocious pupils may be 
advanced rapidly in school, but short precocious pupils should 
have their programs enriched and should not be accelerated. PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF PUPILS       Taste XXXII (Continued)

Physiological age rather than chronological age should be used 
as a guide in planning physical training and directed play. 
Investigations of the physical equipment of pupils are of-slight 
value save in so far as they contribute to a health program. There 
is, however, a singular lack of correlation between the physical 
education programs of schools and their medical inspection. The 
relation between physical education and health has been measured 
in few schools, and the effects of such education are still almost 
unknown. 
Bases for the standardization of physical attainments and 
physiological development are necessary in giving adequate 
guidance to pupils, in deciding who shall be promoted or de- 
moted, and in organizing, conducting, and motivation physical 
education. 
Physical proficiency can be standardized in terms of age, weight, 
height, grade, performance, and health, or a combination of these 
characteristics. Present-day practices emphasize standardization 
in terms of performance and health in combination with one or 
more other characteristics.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1, Since many physical characteristics can be measured more 
readily than mental characteristics, how can the tardiness of the 
investigating of physical equipment be explained? 
2. Examine the data of this chapter with a view to finding ade- 
quate support for Baldwin’s “applications of the concept of physio- 
logical age.” 
3. How can the average school take cognizance of the findings of 
Baldwin? 
4. Prepare an account of the points of agreement and disagree- 
ment between the investigators of physical traits. (Kelley’s dis- 
cussion of “determinism” in Chapter VIII may serve as a model.) 
5. Do you regard physical development as intrinsically worthy of 
great attention or is such development important only as it supports 
mental development? Give reasons for your answer.

6. Assuming that such investigations as those reviewed in this 
a will eventually be pursued ty their logical ends, what prac- 
tical results may reasonably be expectedzto follow them? 
7. Evaluate the principles at the end of this chapter.

  CHAPTER X 
THE GuIDANCE oF SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS 
Types of guidance. Secondary school pupils have always re- 
ceived guidance. Such guidance has, however, been conducted 
sometimes systematically and wisely, sometimes carelessly and 
even whimsically. Examples of wise guidance will be found in 
the later readings of this chapter. Examples of unwise guidance 
are provided by the observations of nearly all students. Unwise 
guidance is probably administered by certain well-meaning 
‘teachers who advise their strongest students to specialize in their 
own respective departments of knowledge. Occasionally such 
guidance is probably beneficial, but proficiency in a department 
is not a guaranty of permanent interest in the endeavors to which 
a department normally directs its students. Another type of un- 
wise guidance is the negative directing which failing pupils receive: 
they often receive certain knowledge of their inabilities with no 
knowledge of their abilities. When thus informed, failing students 
can do no better than try those departments or activities in which 
they have not already failed. While such negative guidance may 
at times be beneficial, one has only to converse with failing pupils 
to realize the great extent of this negative guidance and to find 
that such guidance more often than otherwise leads pupils to leave 
school altogether. 
Such misdirection of pupils results from a variety of causes 
which systematic guidance can eliminate. First, teachers with 
inadequate training are sometimes entrusted with the guidance of 
pupils. Except that such teachers may set up desirable reading 
projects, they are but little better as counselors than the pupils 
themselves. Second, misdirection may result from the superficial 
374
-P-A-G-E-389
  
GUIDANCE OF PUPILS . 378 
attractiveness of a certain course or curriculum. Nearly every 
college class provides examples of persons who have thus been at- 
tracted to high-school courses which seem to have yielded little 
profit. Third, misdirection often results from the examples of 
former schoolmates who have left school and appear to have 
obtained easily a large share of the world’s wealth and wisdom. 
Such examples constitute definite guidance away from the school. 
Fourth, the call of certain occupations whose initial wages are rela- 
tively high is sufficient to guide thousands of pupils in an unscho- 
lastic direction and toward unsuitable occupations. Such forms 
of misdirection together with those cited in the readings of this 
chapter show clearly that the school and community already pro- 
vide much guidance, but that the guidance is often of a quality 
far inferior to that which the school may properly be expected to 
administer. In other words, no school is ever going to initiate 
pupil-guidance; such guidance has already been initiated. Schools 
can only change from a negligent attitude toward guidance to an 
adequate program for guidance; from an attitude which fosters 
social waste to one which leads to the utilization of human 
capacities. 
There are of course certain dangers of systematic pupil-guid- 
ance. The guidance may be too rigidly and unsympathetically 
given. Again, systematic guidance may be accompanied by a 
failure to understand pupils’ capacities, interests, and powers of 
initiative. Another danger arises in certain schools from a failure 
to provide adequate exploratory facilities for pupils; that is, from 
a failure to show pupils either vicariously or at first-hand the 
world’s possibilities and a failure to provide a variety of courses 
which may be pursued during the years of the junior high school. 
One of the values of systematic guidance is a tentative orienta- 
tion of pupils. Such orientation leads in turn to a substitution of 
an academic-career motive or a life-career motive for a passing 
grade motive. In this way definite pupil-objectives are created. 
Even though pupils subsequently change their plans for life, such 
objectives have the immense value of giving strong incentives at 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
eS ee Te ee ee es fy Pe ae ee ee Te ee Meee Le Eee tape mena ewer g 
376 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
times when many pupils are listlessly aiming at nothing higher 
than a passing grade. 
At the present time pupil-guidance is systematically conducted 
in many schools. Edgerton and Herr recently canvassed the 
guidance activities of 143 public school systems.‘ It was found 
that 74 of these schools attempt to provide all pupils with educa- | 
tional guidance and vocational preparation. The types of guid- 
ance activities in these school systems probably constitute the 
fundamentals of pupil-guidance. These types are as follows: 
I. Collecting occupational information and making it avail- 
able to pupils: 
(1) Through central office surveys, source bulletins, op- 
portunity literature, etc.; 
(2) Through contact with employment problems of junior 
workers, etc.; 
(3) Through excursions, reports, posters, and charts for 
showing industrial opportunities, moving pictures, etc. 
H. Interviewing and conferring with pupils, parents, and 
others concerned in order: i 
(1) To assist in the selection of courses of study and 
training programs; 
(2) To assist pupils in the study and choice of vocations; 
(3) To assist, through the services of the placement bu- 
reau, those planning to drop out of school; 
(4) To consider failures referred by scholarship commit- 
tees or others, to determine cause and possible remedy 
for same; 
(5) To assist pupils desiring change of school subjects or 
programs; 
(6) To provide groups with (a) talks on occupations in 
general, and (b) talks for those interested in specific 
vocations; 
(7) To counsel students desiring working permits for 
steady employment, for after school work, etc.;   +A. H. Edgerton and L. A. Herr. Present Status of Guidance Activities

third Yearbook, Part Il, 3-27. 1924. »

(8) To follow up and help adjust graduates and former 
students, etc. 
III. Contributing to curriculum building and the adjustment of 
pupils to meet occupational needs and interests. 
IV. Recording results of school performance and measure- 
ments: 
(1) By adapting records (psychological tests, self-analysis, 
cumulative data) to educational and occupational 
needs; 
(2) By keeping records of case studies, etc. 
V. Acquainting the public with educational problems: 
(1) Through contact with prospective students; 
(2) Through parent-teacher organizations; 
(3) Through newspapers, industrial organizations, com- 
mercial clubs, etc.” 
That guidance has practical value is indicated by Proctor’s re- 
port of investigations conducted in Palo Alto.? ’ The forms of 
guidance which he reports are educational and vocational. Of 
two groups of nearly identical median 1.Q.’s, one was given edu- 
cational guidance, and the other was not. The success of the 
two groups can be summarized as follows: of the unguided 30.8 
per cent failed in one subject, and 10.3 per cent failed in two or 
more subjects in the first year of high school; while of the guided 
group only 18.2 per cent failed in one subject, and no one failed in 
more than one subject. As Proctor says, such guidance provides 
an aid which is vastly superior to the “trial and error” methods 
which now prevail. Just as different school subjects make differ- 
ent demands upon pupils, so different occupations make different 
demands. It can, therefore, be assumed that pupils with rel- 
atively low I.Q.’s should be advised to enter occupations whose 
apparent demands are only moderately difficult to meet. The 
superior pupil may of course enter any occupation with apparent 
promise of success. As a test case, Proctor’s subjects, 930 high

school pupils, were asked to designate their occupational ambitions. 
It was then discovered that 18 pupils whose I.Q.’s and school 
marks were below average had decided upon occupations, repre- 
sentative members of which rank, according to army test results, 
considerably above average.t While it is contrary to a certain 
type of democratic thinking to close any human activity to any 
American, it has long been a common American practice to defeat 
utterly the person who selects too difficult a task for his capacity. 
Whether the guidance should be given before the candidate pre- 
pares for and enters his occupation or after he has met humiliat- 
ing defeat, depends upon the type of democracy which is adhered 
to by the persons who judge the matter. Proctor’s very temperate 
comments are to the effect that the pupil-counselor can profitably 
avail himself of information which, if conservatively employed, 
will increase the counselor’s probability of giving helpful advice.** 
Data of the sort discussed in Chapters VI to IX together with 
results of Proctor’s study indicate clearly that teachers now pos- 
sess guidance devices which were unknown to their predecessors— 
devices which render an attitude of indifference toward guidance 
no longer tenable. Systematic use of certain of these guidance 
devices is exemplified by the readings of this chapter. It will be 
found that certain devices can be employed in giving educational 
and vocational guidance, while others can be utilized in directing 
or guiding pupils in their social, civic, and cultural activities. 
The following readings by Dickson and Alltucker describe the 
guidance work of the schools of Berkeley and Oakland, while 
Brewer’s discussion of college entrance problems sets forth general 
principles of guidance towards higher education... Lyman’s article 
outlines the multiple-type guidance program of a Philadelphia 
junior high school. Finally, certain problems and principles of 
vocational guidance are treated in Jones’s article on the relation

between vocational guidance and education. These readings deal, 
therefore, with many types of pupil-guidance: educational guid- 
ance, personal conduct guidance, remedial academic guidance, 
civic guidance, cultural guidance, and vocational guidance. 
SCHOOL COUNSELING AND THE PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL 
DIFFERENCES ° 
By Vircr E. Dickson 
Changing conceptions of the need for education and the purpose 
of education are bringing more pupils into the secondary schools. 
These conceptions have so taken hold of public opinion that our’ 
laws in many States force hundreds of children into high school 
who otherwise would drop out of school altogether. Now in 
California the law requires every pupil to attend school until he 
is eighteen years of age, provided he may elect to attend part- 
time school between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years. Many 
other States have similar laws. This has brought to our schools 
many pupils who are not adapted to the work our high schools 
have formerly offered. 
The standard high-school curriculum was built for a select 
group of pupils, for pupils with a high degree of mental power. In 
past years the pupils who did not readily adapt themselves to the 
learning processes required in classroom work were eliminated 
before they ever reached the high school. Even now less than 
50 per cent of the public-school children in America ever reach the 
high school. But in the future, theoretically at least, all of our 
pupils will reach the junior high school, and nearly all the senior 
high school. What problem does this place on our shoulders? 
These schools are supported by public taxation because our public 
conception is that every child has a right to an education until he 
is sixteen or eighteen years old—an education that will best fit 
him for his duties as a citizen. The duties of citizenship vary as 
widely as the capacities, interests, and destinies of the people who 
compose a nation. 
One argument behind the junior high school movement, which 
is growing rapidly in most States of the Union, is that the life 
interests, and aptitudes of pupils begin to show wide variations at 
* Addresses and Proceedings of the National Education Association, LXI, 
864-868. 1923. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  380 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
about the age of twelve, and that we should, therefore, give some 
opportunity for election of different courses suited to the differing 
interests and ambitions beginning in the seventh grade. I might 
say, parenthetically, that my own opinion is that these differences 
are almost, if not quite, as apparent in the first grade as in the 
seventh, but this is not the time or the place for that discussion. 
The fact is that our junior high schools offer a certain amount 
of election of courses and this election gradually increases as we 
go up through high school and college and university. How shall 
this election be made? Can we expect pupils of adolescent age to 
choose wisely in a labyrinth of electives? Mingle if you will 
among boys and girls in any large high school where specific 
guidance is not given in classification and on enrolment day listen 
to the remarks of boys and girls about choosing courses. “Don’t 
take that course, it’s too hard.” “This course is a snap.” “Old 
Jones is a fright! Don’t take anything with him.” “Come on, 
take this course with me.” Many times choices are made not on 
the pupil’s real interest or fitness for the course, but on the repu- 
tation,of the course for difficulty, the reputation of the teacher, 
personal chumship with another pupil, or some other equally 
unsatisfactory reason. 
Even a casual observation should convince anyone that a care- 
ful program of counseling should be planned so that every pupil 
may have expert and conscientious advice in his educational life. 
In the schools of Oakland and Berkeley we have chosen what 
we call “school counselors” to lead in this important work. We 
find some objection to the term “vocational counselor” because it 
signifies to many people something which I believe we are not 
able to do. To counsel immature boys and girls to fit themselves 
for this particular “vocation” or that seems to me to be fraught 
with danger. I know no counselors on whose shoulders I am will- 
ing to place such responsibility for classes of high-school or junior 
high-school boys and girls. 
I admit that you may come back with the rejoinder that behind 
any true school counseling must be the vocational objective. The 
duty of the counselor is to guide each child into the best possible 
use of the time he has to spend in school. This of course involves 
the most thoughtful analysis of the possibilities and probabilities 
of both the school life and after school life of the pupil. Since a 
rose by some other name may be just as sweet, we may call this 
“vocational counseling” or “school counseling” as each neighbor- 
hood prefers. I merely give this discussion to explain what we
-P-A-G-E-395
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 381 
mean by counseling and to show why we use the term “school 
counselor.” 
Few pupils in early adolescence absolutely know or even think 
they know what vocation they intend to follow in life. Specific 
vocational counseling is therefore apt to be wide of the mark. 
There are, however, numbers of things in the school lives of high- 
school boys and girls upon which counsel and advice are sorely 
needed. Explanations of courses, their purposes, and require- 
ments, words of encouragement or caution from an adult with 
broad experiences and training, expert analysis of probabilities 
of success or failure of a pupil based upon his past record, his in- 
terests, his habits and his apparent ability, advice as to various 
school, home, or social activities—these are illustrative of the fields 
in which pupils need help that can be given by a properly chosen 
counselor. 
Some will argue that such duties rest upon every teacher. I 
quickly agree. But I have found by study that gross malad- 
justments which a trained counselor will quickly discover in 
numbers in almost any large high school have escaped the notice 
of a corps of well-trained teachers. The average high-school 
teacher is a specialist in his field and it is not reasonable to expect 
him to keep himself also familiar with the diverse activities of the 
school and community in such a manner as to enable him to be a 
good counselor to pupils of varying interests and needs as now 
present themselves to high schools. Theoretically we might wish 
all our teachers to have such powers, but actually we know they 
do not, and we are dealing with facts and not theories. 
Many high schools have what is called advisory groups, each 
teacher being responsible for a given number of pupils. Obser- 
vation will quickly show that many pupils suffer seriously under 
such a plan. In my opinion, our raw material furnishes altogether 
too complex a problem for this system. 
« Every high school needs a person broadminded, scientifically 
trained, widely experienced, and personally adapted to deal kindly 
but frankly with boys and girls, men and women. Such a person 
should head the counseling program—should be responsible for 
seeing that every boy and girl in every department of the school 
is studied as fully as time permits, to know if each is living up to 
what may be reasonably expected of him. 
Such a program does not lessen the responsibility of each 
teacher to know his own pupils and to give them the best of his 
own expert advice. By experience, we have found that the plan 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  382 : SECONDARY EDUCATION 
actually inspires greater interest and greater accuracy in the 
advisory work of all teachers. The discovery of some gross misfit 
problem by the school counselor has caused many a teacher to say, 
“T shall take pains to see that never again shall a misfit condition 
be found among pupils in my classes, at least unless I am fully 
aware of the problem and have done my best to rectify it.” 
What I wish to make clear is that the plan of school counseling 
as we have it in operation in our schools does not, as some have 
thought it would, cause high-school teachers to relax their efforts 
to know and counsel their pupils, but on the contrary inspires 
them to greater efforts and greater accuracy in such matters. 
I am discussing this question today not as‘a theoretical problem 
but from the basis of experience. For five years we have been 
developing such a counseling program in the Oakland and Berke- 
ley public schools. Our scheme involves a counselor in every 
school—elementary, junior high, and high school. At present we 
have such a counselor either on full time or part time in all except 
a few of the elementary schools. The need for such work in the 
elementary grades is almost, if not quite, as imperative as it is in 
the upper schools, but that is outside the realm of discussion with 
you today. 
One outstanding feature of our counselors is the programming 
of all pupils who are being promoted from a lower to an upper 
school. For example, our schools just closed a few days ago, but 
during the last four months approximately 3000 pupils contemplat- 
ing promotion into junior high or senior high school have been 
studying, under the direction of a counselor, what the upper school 
has to offer. The counselor has had a personal conference (some- 
times several conferences) with each pupil and often with his 
parents. The high-school program of each child has been made 
out, has been signed by the parent of the child and by the school 
counselor and is now in the high school which the child will enter 
this fall (21%4 months hence). These children are classified now 
and will start a regular program in high school on the first day of 
the term. But the important thing is that this program is not the 
result of snap judgment amid the excitement of enrolment day 
and the confusion incident upon entering a new and strange school. 
The program is the result of weeks, if not of months, of careful 
study and conference between the child, his parents, and the school 
counselor and teachers who know the child best. Needless to say 
the high-school counselors have their share in helping to shape :
-P-A-G-E-397
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 383 
this program so that the high school can adjust itself to the needs 
of the pupils who will come to it. 
Just a brief warning I feel is in place here. Counseling does not 
mean arbitrary dictation. The counselor who demands that a 
pupil do this or refuses opportunity for reasonable trial when the 
pupil or pupil and parent sincerely desire a trial is ordinarily mak- 
ing a mistake. Democracy of opportunity demands that each may 
have his chance to prove himself. If the counselor frankly ex- 
presses his opinion—better in writing in cases of disagreement— 
and then kindly waits for time, light will settle either upon the 
counselor (we have often seen this happen) or upon the pupil and 
parent. In either evefit time has developed greater power for the 
future and usually the gain is much greater than the loss. Again, 
counseling too often takes the rdle of working only with failures or 
with disciplinary and other problem cases. These are the hardest 
to counsel, and from such we get the minimum results in propor- 
tion to time and energy spent. The time for counsel is before the 
individual gets into trouble. A real counseling program will 
usually anticipate trouble and prevent it from developing. 
On the other hand, the counsel that pays most dividends reaches 
those pupils who are most capable—those who will gain much 
from a mere suggestion—often those who are considered satisfac- 
tory by all teachers but who are really capable of doing much 
better. A counselor’s chief duty is dealing with “the misfit,” but 
let us remember that “the misfit” is anyone who is not measuring 
up in a reasonable way to his capacity. Let us not permit coun- 
seling to deteriorate into petty dealing with problems of disci- 
pline and failure. I do not by this minimize the importance of 
the discipline and failure. Counseling that is worthy of the name 
must be preventive and constructive—preventive of waste and con- 
structive of power. 
Permit me in closing to say not boastfully but frankly that 
our counseling program has the hearty cooperation of. teachers, 
principals, supervisors, administrative and executive officers and 
patrons of the school. It is the result of gradual growth and 
reaches nowhere except where it is wanted. It represents the 
cooperative thought and planning of many teachers, principals 
and administrative officers. 
In summary the main points I would leave with you are: (1) 
The increasing diversity of abilities and interests among our 
secondary pupils, coupled with an elective program offered by the 
schools, demands careful counsel and guidance. (2) This schoo
-P-A-G-E-398

384 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
counseling should be led by a person especially trained and espe- 
cially qualified for such work. (3) Such a school counseling pro- 
gram has been tried out and the verdict of all concerned is that “it 
works.” 
A COUNSELING PLAN FOR BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE 
JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS * 
By Marcarer M. ALLTUCKER 
Although the aim of education has often been defined as 
/ “adaptation to environment,” the public school has heretofore 
made little study of the process of adaptation of a given pupil to 
his school surroundings. Very often, to take a concrete case, there 
is a great gap between the junior and senior high schools. 
In Berkeley, we found that this was due, not to lack of articu- 
lation of courses of study between these lower and upper schools, 
but to lack of information on the part of the senior high school 
regarding its incoming students. It has been our custom on regis- 
tration day to have several hundred students who had completed 
the work of the junior high school register in the senior high 
school. Faculty advisers took them in groups of thirty and at- 
tempted to make up programs for all of them in a half-day. 
A few years ago this was done more or less satisfactorily, for 
then the senior high school students were a highly selected group 
of young people, most of whom wanted academic training and 
were preparing for the university. Today our high-school popu- 
lation is a cosmopolitan group of young people with widely vary- 
ing abilities, previous accomplishments, aspirations, environing 
conditions, and needs. 
We have found that making up on registration day the pro- 
grams of these students, who were entire strangers to us, resulted 
in much confusion and maladjustment. Failure to get work com- 
mensurate with individual capacity and needs resulted in dis- 
couragement and withdrawal from school for the less capable stu- 
dents. For the student of large ability, it resulted in undeveloped 
powers, loss of time in meeting university matriculation require- 
ments, narrowed experiences which could have been broadened by 
a wise choice of electives, and often general aimlessness with regard 
to vocational objectives.

GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 385 
The curriculum of the Berkeley senior high school includes 148 
subjects of various types and values designed to meet the needs 
of all. However, experience has shown that the needs of all can 
be met only by wise selection of school subjects. This requires 
guidance; and guidance, if it is to be something more than well- 
intentioned conjecture, must be based on cumulative data result- 
ing from scientific research. In other words, guidance must be 
given by specially trained people. 
The following plan, developed by the Bureau of Research and 
Guidance, under the directorship of Virgil E. Dickson, assistant 
superintendent of schools, has proved most satisfactory in meet- 
ing the individual needs of pupils. 
I. Policy and organization. With a view to assisting principals 
in the better placement of pupils in their schools, The Bureau of 
Research and Guidance has adopted the policy of adopting or 
selecting for each school in Berkeley, a teacher who acts as school 
counselor. It provides also for a careful follow-up system, includ- 
ing a study of the needs and capacities of each child, so that train- 
ing may be offered which will bring about as complete an adjust- 
ment of the pupil to all the phases of his environment as his native 
endowments will permit. 
Obviously, a good counselor is one who has keen insight into 
child psychology, who is trained to observe data and records 
carefully, who has practical teaching experience, who has a 
knowledge of mental testing and of methods of making and 
analyzing case histories, and who has a thorough acquaintance 
with the educational opportunities and the demands of the next 
higher school, as well as a knowledge of the conflicting situations 
that are likely to confront a pupil. 
II. Counseling for the next higher school. The following is a 
brief outline of the work of the school counselor as she helps to 
arrange the programs of the pupils in the senior high school: 
1. The counselor studies the cumulative card or data sheet and 
the case history of every pupil. These include records of the 
pupil’s scholarship for the previous nine years, his accomplishment 
in educational tests, his attendance, his attitude toward work, his 
mental capacity, as measured by a general intelligence test, his age, 
his future plans, and significant social data. 
2. A conference is held between the counselors of the junior 
and senior high schools for a careful study of the problems and 
opportunities in each school. 
   
-P-A-G-E-400
  
    386 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
3. The pupil’s program for the first term in the senior high 
school is made out. This involves: 
a) A careful study by every prospective student and his parents 
of the Bulletin, “What the Senior High School Has to Offer.” 
This bulletin supplies accurate information concerning the oppor- 
tunities offered, requirements for high-school graduation, essen- 
tials for matriculation in the various colleges, suggestions for edu- 
cational preparation for various vocations, and significant facts 
concerning the Berkeley High School with which the incoming 
student and his parents should be acquainted. 
b) Development, with the entire group and with each indi- 
vidual pupil looking forward to entrance into the senior high 
school, of the question, “Considering my interests, ability, and 
social and civic outlook for life, what should be my future educa- 
tional plans?” 
c) A conference between the pupil and his parents with refer- 
ence to the high-school courses as explained in the bulletin. This 
may be supplemented by a general meeting of the parents of pros- 
pective senior high-school pupils with the director of research 
and guidance and the senior high school counselor. Here oppor- 
tunity is given for parents to ask questions concerning the new 
school in which they expect to enrol their children and about 
which they have every right to know. 
d) The pupil’s selection of the program in which he is most 
interested and which he thinks will best fit his needs and capacity. 
e) A conference between the counselor and the pupil with ref- 
erence to the subjects chosen. Here the counselor checks very 
carefully to see that the student has proper prerequisites for the 
subjects he has selected, to see that the subjects meet the matricu- 
lation requirements of the college in which the student expects 
later to enrol or that they offer training for the specific vocation 
which he may have selected, and, finally, to make sure that enough 
interests are being developed. 
f) A revision of the program by the pupil and his parents in 
the light of any suggestions brought out in conference with 
the counselor. 
g) A second conference between the counselor and the pupil 
for final decision with regard to the program. The final choice of 
subjects is recorded on the “Introduction Card,” which becomes 
the child’s admission card to the senior high school. The follow- 
ing is a sample:

  h) The signature of the parent on the back of the introduction 
card. This indicates the parent’s approval of the course chosen. 
i) The signature of the junior high school counselor on the in- 
troduction card. 
The introduction cards are sent to the senior high school sev- 
eral weeks before the close of the term previous to the student’s 
entrance. The senior high school counselor makes a careful tally 
of each one and in this way determines exactly the number of 
sections in each subject to provide for the ensuing term. 
Each incoming student’s case record is carefully studied by the 
senior high school counselor. Students are placed in different 
sections in certain subjects, depending on whether they are of 
limited, average, or superior ability. In the classification of stu- 
dents, seven points are taken into consideration: (1) previous 
scholastic attainment, (2) teacher’s estimate of ability, (3) in- 
dustry, (4) health, (5) home co-operation, (6) chronological age, 
and (7) mental capacity as measured by a standardized test of 
general intelligence. 
At the close of the first seven weeks of the new term, when the 
the first report cards are issued, each individual student’s scholar- 
ship grades are compared with the quality of his entrance credits. 
All students who have done as well as or better than they did in 
the junior high school are called into the counselor’s office and are 
commended. 
An individual conference is held with each new student who has
-P-A-G-E-402
  388 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
not done as well as he did in the lower school. The student’s own 
statement as to the reason for his failure is always asked for and 
is recorded on his case record. The counselor also notes any 
extenuating circumstances that in her judgment are explanatory. 
A sample case record is shown on page 389. 
After each report period, during the student’s first term in the 
senior high school, the senior high school counselor holds a con- 
ference with the principal, the counselor, and the ninth-grade 
teachers of each junior high school. Here the case record of each 
problem case is carefully considered. In this way the senior high 
school learns what, in the estimation of those who have previously 
known, studied, and worked with him for three years previously, 
are the factor’s making for the pupil’s present failure and possibly 
what measure can best be adopted to prevent future failures. 
A large number of failures in any particular subject immedi- 
ately raises the question, “Why?” Are the failures due to poor 
teaching in the senior high school, or to poor preparation in the 
junior high school, or to a lack of co-ordination of the work done 
in the lower and upper schools? 
As far as is administratively possible, the counselor makes the 
necessary adjustments to meet the difficulties of each individual 
pupil, such as modifying the student’s program of subjects, in- 
creasing the time spent in study, or improving the physical con- 
ditions. 
A review of a large number of cumulative case records is ex- 
ceedingly helpful to junior high school counselors in showing them 
how best to counsel students and make out programs in the future, 
for case studies show clearly that certain students should not 
have attempted certain courses, either because of inadequate 
preparation or because of lack of innate ability, health, interest, 
or time sufficient to insure success. 
Since the chief interest of both the junior high school and the 
senior high school in Berkeley is to discover and meet the indi- 
vidual needs of pupils, a fine spirit of co-operation exists. Discus- 
sion is made possible, not concerning generalities, but concerning 
how best to serve specific boys and girls. A counseling program 
is also made possible, employing the case method, which means 
the individualization of educational diagnosis, the classification 
of pupils into case groups in the light of significant cumulative 
data which both schools have been able to gather, and a constant 
follow-up of each pupil. 
The plan described in this article has been in operation for two

years, and we find it entirely feasible even when it involves in 
one semester approximately five hundred students entering the 
low tenth grade of the senior high school from four different junior 
high schools. 
In time, as this policy and organization are perfected, there 
will be no gap, and hence no bridge, between the junior high school 
and the senior high school, for the counseling program will have 
cemented the work of the two schools into one. More than that, 
it will have made the senior high school truly democratic, in that 
each pupil will have the opportunity to work at tasks commen- 
surate with his ability. Both teaching and learning will be more 
purposeful because of the co-operation, based on mutual under- 
standing between pupils, teachers, and ’parents. 
GUIDANCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE 
TO COLLEGE ENTRANCE’ 
By Joun M. Brewer 
In limiting our discussion to the question of guidance for col- 
lege entrance we must first name several educational principles 
usually accepted, in order that we may proceed on common 
ground, or, if that be not possible, at least that we may recognize 
and take account of our differences. 
1. We must not forget the truth that all persons above the 
physical and mental age of five years can profit by education. 
The educational work in war times, the tutorial schools of Eng- 
land, labor colleges, and a number of other experiments have 
proved this beyond possibility of denial. It means of course that 
a system of universal education for all ages would be possible, 
that all normal persons could profitably take some work in juvenile 
or adult classes, and that no person need ever be told that his edu- 
cation is over. 
2. Since our modern life is full of complexity, doubt, difficulty, 
and disagreement, all persons should study. We shall find persons 
whose education cannot go very deep; nevertheless it can at least 
become broader and broader, on a lower level, no doubt, than the 
education of those with great educational gifts. 
3. We must recognize that in a world in which every person 
had habits of study without doubt a far greater number of per- 
sons than now would be studying the classics, history, philosophy, 
"The School Review, XXIX, 434-443. June, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-405
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 392 
languages, and literature. Even if a greater number of individuals 
were studying subjects related to their work, this study itself 
would lead toward the humanities. Adult education wherever 
tried has tended to prove this truth. It is about time we removed 
the versus from the ridiculous expression “liberal versus voca- 
tional education.” 
4. A worthy kind of vocational guidance must favor delay in the 
final choice of one’s calling for as long a period of educational 
experience as seems possible in view of individual requirements 
and opportunity. By the same logic the narrowing of one’s edu- 
cation to strictly vocational courses must itself be delayed as long 
as can be called safe. Thus, the high-school boy who claims to 
have decided that he is to be an architect should be encouraged 
to hold this decision as a tentative one, and should be persuaded 
in any case to continue his broad education as long as he can. 
5. In view of these considerations it appears that our present 
high schools are not completely meeting the need for universal 
education, and that we must recognize the necessity of caring for 
the equal or greater number of children of the same age now at 
work by means of co-operative or part-time systems, continuation 
schools, extension courses, or other organizations, whether parallel 
to the present high schools or incorporated within their adminis- 
tration. It should be said in passing that neither evening schools 
nor correspondence courses are adapted to juvenile requirements, 
since they can only function in the field of adult education. By 
the same reason as that which we have just used in appraising our 
high schools, the present offering of American colleges touches but 
one little corner of the possibilities involved in adult education. 
The American college is adapted to the 5 or ro per cent of our 
population whose intelligence level is highest. Parallel with it, 
if not in many cases incorporated with it, at least through exten- 
sion courses, must go a very much wider opportunity for educa- 
tion continued throughout life. The university extension courses 
conducted by state universities for inmates of state penitentiaries 
give us a hint as to future possibilities. In considering the ques- 
tion of guidance for admission to college, we must not forget the 
smallness of the size of the problem with which we are dealing. 
6. By the word guidance we mean enlightenment and advice 
leading to self-direction. Guidance relates to intellectual life, 
culture, future vocation, citizenship, moral problems, recreation, 
social behavior, co-operative activity, and the like. 
7. Educational guidance comprises all of the foregoing forms of
-P-A-G-E-406
  } 
392 SECONDARY EDUCATIUN 
guidance; it leads, whenever it is effective, into advice regarding 
various phases of the individual’s personal and social life. For 
example, most decisions regarding college entrance, choice of cur- 
riculum, and choice of studies, run into the question of vocational 
guidance. Vocational possibilities are accepted or rejected through 
the particular educational decisions made. 
Should the high school be a selective agency? Undoubtedly our 
colleges are and, under their present organization must necessar- 
ily be, selective agencies. The high school, too, as at present or- 
ganized, obviously must reject those children so retarded mentally 
that they have not been able to make progress in the ordinary 
studies of the elementary school. 
Even if our typical high school, however, be equipped to give 
broad or deep education to 99 per cent of our children of appro- 
priate age, there are at present three opinions on the question 
whether or not the school should try to accomplish this end. 
First, there are those among us who wish to see Greek and black- 
smithing, Latin and vocational agriculture under the same roof 
and the same school organization, with children of all kinds ming- 
ling, at least in some of the studies and activities of the school. 
Second, there are those who wish to separate children rather early 
for vocational training—to take those who have decided to be 
dressmakers into a trade school under a different organization from 
a school for those who continue general education. Third, another 
group wishes to skim off the intellectual cream—to segregate the 
brighter children in the classical or: “liberal” high schools and 
thereby protect them against intellectual contamination. 
It will be clear that we shall have to examine some of these 
questions before we can decide on educational guidance in the 
high school, and that our problem will never be solved simply by 
putting a well-equipped educational counselor into the unchanged 
school machinery. 
If 98 or 99 per cent of all our population between the ages of 
fourteen and eighteen were in our high schools full time, or con- 
nected with them for part-time work, what condition of affairs 
would we have so far as vocational guidance is concerned? Three 
groups might be easily distinguished: first, those wHd have not yet 
decided upon any vocational choice; second, those who have 
decided but wish to continue broad education as a foundation for 
later vocational work; and third, those who have decided and 
insist upon vocational training now. This classification is not 
so easy as it appears, because an investigation of the high-school
-P-A-G-E-407
  </UIDANCE OF ‘PUPILS 393 
students will show how variable and changeable these decisions 
are. Boys’ and girls’ decisions change overnight. Their choices 
are founded in many cases upon the merest whim. They rush 
into vocational courses on the basis of a second or third preference 
rather than a first, and they are led into decisions by means of 
the worst forms of false guidance. No one who has studied the 
problem of children’s choices, unless he is an adherent of in- 
tellectual aristocracy and therefore does not believe in universal 
education, can justify a neglect of educational and vocational 
guidance. Neither, I think, can one justify the separation of 
children into different high schools unless he ignores the obvious 
necessity for better guidance. Many of the champions both of the 
classics and of vocational guidance have failed to take account of 
the human factor involved in the choice of courses and the changes 
of mind which govern American school pupils. Transfers from 
course to course must be provided for and can best be offered 
within one school. 
Another possible classification is based upon intelligence 
quotients. Psychological tests are finding increasing use in help- 
| ing to determine levels of intellectual ability and have already 
proved their value in the educational guidance of students, both 
in high school and college. They do not, however—apparently 
it has never been claimed that they do—justify the separation of 
children into classic and vocational schools. In each occupation 
itself there are varying requirements in intellectual ability. The 
overlapping of intelligence levels is so extensive that there are 
undoubtedly many mechanical engineers who rank in intellectual 
ability with the average intelligence of bricklayers, cooks, and 
laundrymen, while, on the other hand, some teamsters and barbers 
excel in ability the average of bookkeepers, nurses, and dentists. 
A study of any occupation will reveal its possibilities for leader- 
| ship, its social and economic problems, its complex problems of 
unionism or other organization, while, on the other hand, there is 
room, in satisfying the world’s needs for some architects, teachers, 
draftsmen, musicians, and photographers of very moderate in- 
tellectual attainments. Vocational guidance cannot justify a 
separation of ehildren into different types of schools in the high- 
school age on the basis of intelligence levels. A social theory of 
aristocracy, false notions of leadership, or a laissez-faire philosophy 
may justify such separation, but not educational or vocational 
guidance. 
On the other hand, we can find positive and affirmative work  
-P-A-G-E-408
  394 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
_for the high school to do in the matter of selection, provided the 
selection and classification are always understood as tentative 
~ and do not mean radical separation of children. For example, the 
three classeg of students above described must be taken note of: 
those who feel they must have vocational education; those who 
have decided upon their calling but wish to continue general 
education; and those whose general education should be continued 
because they have not yet reached any decision. 
The necessity for vocational education in the high school is 
of course a sociological and economic necessity as well as an 
educational one, and it extends downward for a small number of 
children into the junior high school as well. Progress in social 
imagination may correct this condition. At present, however, 
some children in the junior high school rebel at the formalism or 
other worldliness of an all-sitting-still program and demand an 
activity which to them resembles vocational life outside. Others 
demand a variety of activities related to manual, agricultural, 
and home-making arts which the usual school offering in certain 
junior high schools does not yet provide. Further, many of our 
state laws allow the children to take up the burden of life at 
the age of fourteen; in ‘many cases this means that the child’s 
decision alone determines whether or not he shall continue in 
school. It becomes a choice, therefore, between vocational educa- 
tion or no education, and at present training for juvenile occupa- 
tions or a juvenile kind of training for adult occupations is the 
only offering that will hold certain children in school. 
An ideal plan would be to continue broad education for every 
child as long as possible, but to watch over the exigencies of 
his life so that when he becomes restless or shows signs of failure 
or threatens to leave school he may be given a combination of 
general education and vocational try-outs, may later proceed to 
try-outs combined with vocational training, then to a part-time 
system, and finally to full-time work, with perhaps a continuation 
school contact with the high school. 
Selection and classification of children in the high school can 
always be made in such a way as to provide for social contacts 
among all children of like age. There is a middle ground between 
coeducation in all studies and complete separation in schools; 
this middle ground is the mingling of all groups in student activi- 
ties, recreation, music, English, history, and manual arts, and their 
separation for purposes of specific training. We can have a com- 
prehensive high school full of effective specialized work, and at the
-P-A-G-E-409
  
8 
GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 395 
same time we can provide for social and academic contacts at 
many points. In life, persons of high attainments are not segre- 
gated. They are constantly at work for and with others of lesser ° 
gifts, and it is no doubt forced artificiality which separates these 
groups in school. A recent editorial very well remarked that the 
greatest problem in American education is the training of brighter 
children in such a way as to make them effective for service pro- 
portionate to their gifts, and at the same time to educate them so 
that they will not exploit the general population for their own 
account. The surest way to prepare for SHOT I SENG and 
exploitation is to keep the social groups far apart. 
Appropriate adjustments in the school program—We may here 
consider curriculum changes needed for proper educational guid- 
ance. Try-out courses have been spoken of above; the meaning 
in this connection is that the school shall be an instrument for 
discovering and testing the ability of the pupils in a number of 
activities related to life. Undoubtedly algebra will discover and 
develop mathematical ability, English composition the ability to 
write, and oral English the ability to speak. Work on the school 
paper will test interest in journalism; executive ability may be 
discovered through student activities; love of nature through 
scout craft and botany; interest in science through courses in that 
subject. The beginnings of interest in law, banking, agriculture, 
dressmaking, etc., may be discovered by means of the widening of 
the school program and the development of student activities. 
One who has had but one year of high-school experience should 
know at the end of that year whether or not he has some measure 
of initiative, persistence, co-operative behavior, and unselfish ac- 
tion. If the high school does not aim to uncover such qualities 
and to develop them, I cannot imagine by what other aims it 
may attempt to justify itself. 
Again, classes in occupations should be offered, perhaps in 
the freshman and junior years of the high school. In the fresh- 
man year the course should be devoted largely to a study of the 
work of the high school, with the particular school’s catalogue, 
yearbook, or curriculum announcement as one of its texts. A 
general survey of the occupational world both as to its general 
problems and the requirements of specific callings should serve to 
emphasize the need for continued education. The relation of both 
education and occupations to good citizenship should be par- 
ticularly stressed. The work of this class should be civic and 
social rather than individual in its approach and result. Individual
-P-A-G-E-410

396 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| needs will best be met, in my opinion, by a broad rather than a 
| narrow aim for the course, and this is further justified because 
| of the fact that even one’s own vocational decisions must be made 
| in the light of social relationships. 
The class in occupations for the junior year might include a 
study of various colleges, considering their aims, admission re- 
quirements, and the quality of citizenship and the professions for 
which they offer either a foundation or an actual training. Self- 
discovery and self-guidance must always be the most important 
result of try-out courses and classes for the study of occupations, 
and will thus lead to more satisfactory answers in the junior year 
to the question, Who should go on to college? 
The work of the counselor —On the basis of a school curriculum 
which discovers and tests all possible qualities of character, 
interest, and ability, the educational counselor may begin his 
work. He may use tests of general intelligence, but should re- 
member that these tests must be considered in the light of other, 
information. Even for the detection of border-line cases Dr. 
Fernald names the intelligence tests as only one of his list of 
ten factors: physical examination, family history, personal and 
developmental history, history of school progress, examination in 
school work, practical knowledge, economic efficiency, social his- 
tory and reactions, moral reactions, and psychological tests. 
| Doubtless our tests will show probabilities rather than absolute 
prophecy. Indeed, there are indications that the much-misunder- 
stood and difficult-to-define correlation coefficients ‘might well be 
superseded by probability tables; for example, a recent study 
indicates that those whose intelligence quotient falls below 90 have 
only one chance in twenty-five of graduating from an ordinary 
college preparatory course in high school. Later investigations 
may reveal how many chances out of a hundred any person has 
of being graduated from college if his record in the alpha psycho- 
logical test as given in the army be determined at any point along 
the scale of possible scores. The implied statement in the Penn- 
sylvania regulations that a system of educational guidance can 
lead “definitely to the giving of positive advice by the school to 
certain students that they have the ability to do freshman college 
work successfully and the giving of advice to other students that 
they do not have such ability” no doubt must be modified. We 
can determine this matter with a high degree of certainty for some 
students, but many others will be found to have an even chance 
to succeed and they or their parents will have to decide whether   
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 397 
or not they wish to take this chance. It is worth while to reiterate 
the possibility of modifying and differentiating freshman work, 
perhaps in junior colleges, so that practically all our population 
can succeed. 
It is the counselor’s business to lay before the individual all 
possible information which might affect his decision. He will 
save an enormous amount of time if much of this can be given 
in the class in occupations, as he can then confine his personal 
advice to the more difficult individual problems. He should have 
opportunity for home visits and visits to various places where the 
work of leading occupations is carried on. He should organize a 
list of persons, preferably ex-teachers, who are experienced in the 
leading occupations and should secure their co-operation in giving 
him facts and in helping individual children. He should have 
adequate clerical help and should have funds at his disposal for 
collecting a library of occupational literature. He should have 
at his command machinery for sending out helpful material and 
suggestions to the other teachers, particularly in giving them 
suggestions for making their work more vital for purposes of 
discovering and tésting ability. He should have opportunity to 
visit other schools and colleges and to keep in touch with the 
progress of guidance elsewhere. He should co-operate with 
librarians, employment managers, unions, chambers of commerce, 
newspapers, scout-craft organizations, clubs, recreational organiza- 
tions, Americanization agencies, and other avenues of social 
progress. He should not be overwhelmed with the task of finding 
jobs for children who leave school; this work should be done 
’ effectively outside of his own personal effort. He should keep 
simple and usable records of the successes of children under his 
care. He should find it possible to give boys and girls advice 
about miscellaneous working experiences which they have along 
with school experiences or during summer vacations in order that 
these contacts with life may be related to future hopes and op- 
portunities. He should continue teaching, preferably with a 
class in occupations. He should pay particular attention to pupils 
who are failing, and through the study-coach plan or other special 
classes he should keep them under school guidance as long as 
possible. He should take to the principal of the school and the 
superintendent of schools his findings as to the necessity for 
better forms of vocational guidance and for part-time work and 
should co-operate with them to carry into effect such important 
reorganizations as seem desirable. He should foster student

activities and student participation in school management, know- 
ing as he will that the qualities of character and ability therein 
developed will oftentimes prove more important in the general 
success of the future worker and citizen than will some of the usual 
studies. 
Training of the counselor—The personnel of those concerned 
with educational and vocational guidance ought to be even higher 
than our present standard for school principals. The principal 
directs the work of the teachers who are intelligent enough to 
check him up if he goes wrong. The counselor, however, dealing 
with the futures of defenseless children will need a high philosophy 
of education and life. The study of sociology, economics, educa- 
tional psychology, and education is essential. Effective work 
is impossible without whole-hearted interest in children, sound 
judgment, industry, and tact. 
Work to be done—lIs there any danger of over emphasizing 
guidance for college entrance? I think not, unless one deliberately 
ignores the proposition of educating and guiding others. The 
recognition of the existence of a diversity of gifts is in full har- 
mony with a true democracy. It has been well said that nothing 
is so unequal as the equal treatment of unequals, and no one wants 
a pseudo-democracy of dull sameness and limitation of oppor- 
tunity. There is work to be done, however, in bringing about for 
every child the ideal adopted by the National Vocational Guidance 
Association at its recent convention, “to make sure that each child 
obtains the equality of opportunity which it is the duty of the 
public schools to provide.” 
THE GUIDANCE PROGRAM OF THE HOLMES JUNIOR 
HIGH SCHOOL * 
By R. L. Lyman 
In junior high school literature the term “guidance” has come 
to stand for the principle that lies back of all worth-while teaching 
of adolescents, namely, the well-rounded development of the 
individual through the wise direction of his activities. This 
article undertakes to explain how one experimental junior high 
school of Philadelphia, the Holmes Junior High School, has been 
making guidance, thus understood, the keynote of a systematic 
program which has so commended itself to the authorities that

eighteen additional junior high schools are planned for that 
city. 
Obviously, it is impossible in a brief article to set forth in detail 
all of the agencies, devices, and organizations which contribute 
to guidance in a school of seventeen hundred pupils and fifty- 
three teachers. Therefore, the present endeavor must limit itself 
to the four outstanding features of the program—personal 
guidance, remedial guidance, civic guidance, and cultural guidance. 
Lengthened school day—The faculty of the Holmes Junior 
High School assumed that a program of student activities in- 
volving guidance must supplant the obsolete and barren endeavor 
to guide pupils by lessons and preachment. With this in mind, 
approximately one hundred student organizations have been 
evolved, a few at a time, as the expanding life of the school seemed 
to demand, all of them functioning in the direction of learning 
by doing under wise guidance. As the variety of activities grew, 
it was found necessary to provide for them a regular period in 
the daily program. This was accomplished very sensibly, accord- 
ing to current educational theory, by adding a seventh period to 
the school day for guidance. Naturally, opposition was at first 
apparent on the part of the pupils, and amusing stories are told 
about the methods by which pupil officers took effective measures 
to prevent absence from the added period until finally the value 
of the work firmly established that extra period in the children’s 
minds as an enjoyable climax to the day’s work. That the reader 
may be assured concerning the systematic arrangement of the 
many interrelated guidance activities, a small portion, about one- 
fourth, of the weekly schedule for the seventh period is presented 
in Table XXXIIT. 
Personal guidance-——Three weeks in the month the seventh 
period on Wednesday is set aside for teachers’ meetings and vari- 
ous other faculty conferences. On these days the pupils are dis- 
missed for the final period. Every teacher uses the last period of 
the fourth Wednesday for personal help with pupils in her classes 
who have met special difficulties or who have lost lessons through 
absence. In addition, every Friday each teacher conducts per- 
sonal conferences with the pupils of her own home room. Such 
guidance periods are strictly confidential; no visitors are per- 
mitted to attend them; even the principal of the school makes a 
point of not entering a room during the final hour on Friday. 
The personal guidance periods enable every home-room teacher 
to come into intimate contact with her pupils. Even less than

usual the teacher and more the “counselor and friend,” she gathers 
from every member of the faculty information about her own boys 
and girls concerning lapses in good conduct, the shirking of re- 
sponsibility, scholastic losses due to illness, burdensome home 
duties, etc. In the guidance period there are no “lessons.” 
Through friendly, intimate group conversation or personal inter- 
views, new pupils are imbued with the ideals of the school—co- 
operation, courtesy, the shouldering of responsibility, and the 
like. Individual failure or success is brought out, and remedies 
or causes stressed. During the time when affiliations with social 
clubs are being made or courses are being chosen, the topics of 
conferences are hobbies, favorite studies, and immediate and de- 
ferred values of various occupations. Here, too, are considered 
various ethical problems associated with the school “code of 
honor”—sportsmanship, clean speech, truthfulness, etc. Corre- 
lation of the guidance period with civic responsibilities brings up 
such topics as the right attitude toward holding office in the Holmes 
Junior High School, the duties of leaders and followers, and the 
sacrifice involved in all codperative endeavor. In short, the last 
period on Friday is the time for “direct moral guidance” par ex- 
cellence and is tied up, as all guidance is, with the daily privileges 
and duties of the varying school lives of the pupils. 
The last periods on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday are re- 
served for the remedial groups, the civic organizations, and the 
enrichment, vocational, and recreational clubs, each teacher acting 
as sponsor for two and sometimes three of these groups. 
Remedial guidance-—Remedial guidance, intimately associated 
with class work, is the practical agency for accomplishing one of 
the avowed purposes of the junior high school, namely, meeting 
the individual scholastic needs of boys and girls. The remedial 
groups are of three different classifications—the “restoratory,” 
the “preventive,” and the “opportunity” groups. All three paral- 
lel by grades the four major branches of the curriculum—English, 
science, mathematics, and languages. For example, remedial pro- 
visions for the second-semester children—the VII B pupils are as 
follows: VIIB English restoratory group for conditioned and 
failed pupils; VII B English preventive group for pupils in danger 
of conditions; VII B English opportunity groups for pupils who 
have special lines of interest; and nine other groups of similar 
distinction, three for science, three for mathematics, and three 
for language.
-P-A-G-E-416
402 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The restoratory and preventive groups are designed to guard 
against discouragement and other evils incident to retardation; 
they include in their membership, respectively, the pupils who were 
conditioned or failed in the preceding term and those who are in 
danger of condition or failure in the current term. Conducted 
largely as supervised-study classes with the minds of the individual 
pupils focused on restoration to good standing, the strictly remedial 
clubs, assisted by other remedial agencies, have reduced retar- 
dation more than 50 per cent. 
The opportunity groups, correlating closely with the more 
strictly remedial groups, provide direction for pupils who have 
special duties to perform. For example, the activities of the 
opportunity groups in English include the preparation of assembly 
programs; rehearsals of formal or informal plays; conferences with 
pupil chairmen, with committees, and with club officers who de- 
sire direction in any phase of club activity; the supervision of 
groups in charge of department bulletin board; and the training 
of pupils to conduct classes in the absence of regular teachers or 
to give suitable aid to substitute teachers. In the opportunity 
period, too, are conferences with pupils whose English habits are 
poor, special conferences with children who are socially crude in 
manners or deportment, and interviews with parents who are 
willing to come when summoned. Through similar activities, op- 
portunity groups in science, history, and mathematics operate 
along the lines of their departmental needs. 
An explanation of the fifty per cent reduction in retardation 
involves three considerations. First, for the obvious reason that 
pupils need positive guidance in scholastic deficiencies, member- 
ship in the remedial groups is mandatory. The children are di- 
rected into remedial work because they need to be there; on the 
recommendation of any of their teachers, they are placed in the 
way of avoiding failure or condition. It should be said that this 
compulsion is about the only manifestation of obligatory attend- 
ance found in all of the activities of the school. Although the 
remedial work is mandatory, it not infrequently happens that a 
child volunteers to give up one of his optional social clubs because 
he feels the need of the help that may be found in an appropriate 
preventive group. The case of one little girl who asked to give up 
the Social Dancing Club because she felt the need of Spanish 
preventive work is not untypical. This case is indicative, too, of 
a condition that a visitor sees throughout the school, although not  
-P-A-G-E-417
  
GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 403 
published or heralded, namely, that pupils are again and again in- 
duced to become their own critics; they pass judgment on their 
own behavior, their own scholarship, and their own share in the 
community life, and they discover their own opportunities for 
better participation in both the curricular and extra-curricular 
activities of the school. 
Second, remedial work reduces retardation because the pupils 
dislike to lose membership in the social and recreational clubs of 
their preference. Each child in the Holmes Junior High School 
is a member of three organizations, and under no circumstances 
may he be required to be a member of more than two of the 
strictly remedial groups; he is always privileged to enjoy member- 
ship in at least one of the selective recreational clubs. It is neces- 
sary for a child to belong to only one restoratory club, he may 
choose two recreational clubs, perhaps the Art Collector’s Club as 
his first choice and the Spanish Club as his second choice. If he 
has no conditions and no immediate danger of them and is there- 
fore free from all remedial obligations, he may be a member of the 
Glee Club as a third choice. This plan works both ways. Chil- 
dren in the remedial clubs are zealous in helping the sponsors 
find their weaknesses; self-diagnosis is very common; it does not 
take a careless speller long to discover that the judicious use of 
the dictionary will meet his needs; a pupil having difficulties with 
Spanish declensions soon learns that earnest application will re- 
lieve him of the necessity of membership in a Spanish preventive 
group and enable him to return to the recreational club of his 
choice. The universal testimony of the teachers is that the chil- 
dren in the Holmes Junior High School, heartily disliking condi- 
tions, soon learn to anticipate and ward off scholastic disaster, 
and, if “caught” and sent to preventive groups, they make vig- 
orous effort to return to good standing. It is estimated that only 
about 5 per cent of the students are at any one time in the 
remedial groups. During a semester the shifting in and out, 
which may take place at any time, brings to these groups perhaps 
15 per cent of the children. In one sense, the entire seventeen 
hundred pupils are in the opportunity group; they are all subject 
to the confidential home-room guidance on Friday. 
Third, remedial work tends to prevent retardation because a 
strong [XA teacher in mathematics, for example, or in French, 
is assigned as sponsor for the restoratory IXB mathematics group 
or the IXB French group. In other words, pupils who are lagging
-P-A-G-E-418
          404 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
in the second semester of any subject are privileged to do their 
remedial work under the one teacher who, if she had been their 
instructor in the first semester, might best have helped them lay 
a surer foundation. 
The faculty has at least one other device for individual work of 
a remedial nature. One of the strongest teachers in the school 
is scheduled for restoratory work all day; that is, she does re- 
medial work and nothing else. To her conferences come the most 
difficult cases—children who fail in spite of the efforts of the more 
general restoratory agencies. 
A word must be said also about remedial work as applied to the 
physical needs of individuals. A group is organized for children 
who have defects of speech like stuttering or stammering; another 
for pupils who are badly nourished or anaemic; and other groups 
for crippled children. These are samples of a program which 
cares for boys and girls who, because of physical handicaps, are 
not privileged to participate in the activities regularly scheduled 
in the department of physical education in the social clubs like 
singing, dramatics, and public speaking, or in hiking, tennis, swim- 
ming, and social dancing. 
Civic guidance —Guidance in citizenship is accomplished by the 
organization of the entire student body into what is called the 
Industrious Civic Union, so named by the pupils when the “school 
city” was established in 1921. The title is appropriate in view of 
the wide range of civic activities. Seventeen hundred boys and 
urls, crowded into a building modern and new but originally 
d for an elementary school of twelve hundred pupils, have, 
e leadership, roundgd out an ingenious scheme of self- 
governtent. Through the regular home-room units, called “‘chap- 
ters” of the Industrious Civic Union, fifty-three in number, the 
pupils elect their representatives to the civic bodies known as the 
Council or the Administrative Committee and the Department of 
Public Works, the Department of Public Safety, the Department 
of Sanitation, and the Department of Social Welfare. During the 
home-room elections, as in all of the life of the school, two prin- 
ciples are of current emphasis: first, the significance of respon- 
sibility in choosing capable delegates to the governing bodies; 
second, the readiness of every individual, whether an elected offi- 
cer or not, to give himself unreservedly to the public weal. 
The administrative Committee meets once a month to hear
-P-A-G-E-419
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 405 
the reports from the various bureaus into which each department 
is subdivided and to offer constructive suggestions. 
The Department of Public Works, responsible for the care of 
all property, functions through the Bureau of School Property, the 
Bureau of Neighborhood Property, and the Bureau of Personal 
Property. These bureaus, which are late developments, came 
into being when the pupils found that public sentiment needed to 
be created in their community for the preservation of three kinds 
of property and that a corps of vigilant officers with duties 
properly distributed ought to see that the rank and file of citi- 
zens respect such property. From the standpoint of guidance for 
citizenship, the actual care of property is of minor importance. 
The significant fact is that seventeen hundred boys and girls at 
the proper time and places are being taught habits altogether too 
much neglected by adults. 
The Repair Club, which actively codperates with the Depart- 
ment of Public Works, illustrates so well the principle that guides 
the origin and development of all the organizations throughout 
the Holmes Junior High School that it may be explained here. 
As in the case of the recreational clubs, the needs of the community 
dictate the type of organization attempted. Those activities are 
considered best which are not forced from above but which rise 
spontaneously in response to need. The Repair Club, a group of 
boys under sponsorship of a teacher of manual training, is the re- 
sult of a suggestion that there were many little jobs like repairing 
curtains or fixing desks in a big community like theirs which 
boys themselves could attend to. The writer saw members o 
Repair Club called in to restore a “dark curtain” which 
its roller during a general assembly Period. They climb 
ladders, fixed the curtain, and removed the débris while not so 
much as a single eye of the three hundred children in the room 
appeared to be turned in their direction. Citizens doing their 
duty in a normal way attract no attention. 
The Department of Public Safety supervises traffic and insti- 
tutes safety patrols for the protection of the pupils. It has a Bureau 
of Traffic, which operates both inside and outside of the building, 
a Bureau of Law and Order, and a Bureau of Fire, which super- 
vises the fire drills. The department prepares fire-drill charts 
which are reproduced by the Blue Print Club and placed in each 
classroom, so that the entire school becomes familiar with the 
scheme. 
       
  
-P-A-G-E-420
  406 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The Department of Sanitation interests itself in the cleanliness 
of the school. To facilitate its work, the school is zoned, and 
bureaus of basement, corridor, classroom, and yard inspection are 
established. Through the awarding of banners for clean class- 
rooms, rivalry is aroused. In each of these bureaus the “lieu- 
tenants” secure volunteer guards to aid in carrying on the work. 
The Department of Social Welfare consists of the Bureau of 
Decoration, the Bureau of Publicity, and the Bureau of Social 
Welfare. The latter bureau was hard to launch. Its duties are 
largely in seeing that the various organizations codperate in 
welcoming new pupils and in paying suitable attention to pupils 
who are in social need. For example, the fifty-three home-room 
representatives of this department are charged with the duty of 
making careful note of all absentees in their respective rooms. 
The Blue Print Club makes absentee cards. The Botany Club 
gives some of the flowers which it gathers so that the Bureau of 
Social Welfare may send them to every member of the school who 
is absent through illness. A representative in every class tele- 
phones the assignments to the children who have missed them for 
some good reason. 
The Bureau of Social Welfare also takes over the duties of 
helpers for the teachers. If a substitute is absent and no substi- 
tute appears, a lieutenant of the Bureau of Social Welfare in the 
room automatically assumes control of the class and conducts the 
lesson. If there is a substitute teacher, it is the duty of the lieu- 
tenant to help her in every possible way; in such an emergency 
he is the society’s discipline officer. Another function performed 
by these officers is taking charge of tardiness. At the front en- 
trance of the building there is a “late room,” to which every tardy 
pupil reports at once. Still other duties of the various branches 
of the Department of Social Welfare are ushering at parents’ 
meetings, promoting financial enterprises and aiding the principal 
and the teachers in emergencies. In general, the civic organiza- 
tions supply the leaders who automatically take charge of their 
groups when unusual and unexpected situations arise. 
It might be inferred that the members of the civic clubs are the 
only children whose activities are guided toward citizenship. Such 
is not the case. The fact is that by many skilful devices the in- 
fluence of every civic group—for that matter, of every club in the 
school—reaches beyond its own walls. The principle is that every 
organization shall extend its activities into the life of the school
-P-A-G-E-421
GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 407 
so far as possible. To reach the rank and file of the school citi- 
zenship, each civic organization and many of the social clubs have 
bulletin boards in conspicuous places, on which are displayed 
every manner of exhibits dealing with the club’s interests. Under 
friendly rivalry, diligent and persistent care constantly shifts the 
displays, so that something fresh and interesting is ever available 
to draw the attention of the passers-by. A second means of ex- 
tending influence beyond committee walls are the public announce- 
ments, made by civic club representatives or by members of the 
Public Speaking Club, at the four major assemblies which meet in 
various parts of the building the first fifteen minutes of the day. 
Especially valuable, the teachers think, are the addresses given 
by various representative club members in the early assemblies 
of the year when the new VIIA pupils are introduced to the 
various civic traditions which are being established in the school. 
Obviously the civic clubs are constantly in need of helpers, and, 
when occasion arises, such assistants are publicly announced and 
their names are posted on the appropriate bulletin board. In 
other ways which cannot be mentioned here, the ideal is to lead 
‘everyone into the civic service of the school. 
Cultural guidance—Membership in the remedial groups is man- 
atory; membership in the civic organizations is elective; mem- 
bership in the more strictly social groups is selective; that is, each 
pupil, with certain reservations for priority rights, enters into the 
vocational, recreational, and enrichment clubs of his own choice. 
These clubs, which are designed to cover all sorts of needs and 
desires of a large student body, number more than fifty. Some, 
like the Dramatic Club, are cultural, offering opportunity to 
develop latent tastes. Others, like the Art Collector’s Club, are 
zsthetic and are sponsored by the departments of art and music, 
and, in the case of esthetic dancing, by the teachers of physical 
education. Still others, like the Camp Cookery Club, are of more 
practical vocational nature and are sponsored by teachers of do- 
mestic science and manual arts. Others, like the English, the 
Spanish, and the French clubs, offer opportunities for extending 
class work for the more ambitious and capable pupils. Before any 
new club may be formed, it must pass official tests showing (a) 
that it meets the personal needs of several children, (6) that it 
will add materially to the types of activities already in the school, 
(c) that it embodies some contribution toward training for efficient 
citizenship, (d) that it ministers to community needs, and (e) 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
  408 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
that it will not arouse political or religious animosity on the part 
of the parents. 
It is apparent that free choice of the cultural clubs has to have 
certain limitations. For example, of one incoming VIIA group, 
more than one hundred children expressed preference for the Glee 
Club. The unwisdom of children’s unrestricted choices was indi- 
cated by the fact that many of them were overactuated by the 
word “glee”; they were looking for pure unadulterated fun. Re- 
striction of free selection is secured as follows. Membership in 
the clubs is limited. The older pupils of Grades IXB and IXA 
are allowed first, second, and third choices. Then the VIIIB and 
the VIIIA pupils choose, followed by the VIIB pupils. The in- 
coming group, made up of VIIA pupils, is given no option because 
of the immaturity of its personnel; instead they meet in mass in 
the auditorium for one semester in three large clubs adapted to 
their needs—Monday, story-telling; Tuesday, music appreciation; 
and Thursday, travel. In addition to the stories, the Victrola 
demonstrations, and the motion pictures, the sponsors, supple- 
menting the work of the Friday personal-guidance periods, try to 
introduce pupils to the aims and purposes of the new school. 
Moreover, upper-class representatives of all of the social clubs are 
given opportunity to display their work; speakers from civic 
organizations lay the foundation for true Holmes citizenship, and 
it is said that the newcomers listen with profound attention to the 
venerable fourteen-year-old officials of the Industrious Civic 
Union. 
As exemplifying the aims and activities of the purely cultural 
type, the undertakings of the Music Appreciation Club may be 
cited as representative. In order to open up to the children the 
field of music, the club carries on its work in a variety of ways, the 
chief of which are listed as follows: 
Talks by the club sponsor on the evolution of music from an- 
cient times to the present day, accompanied by excerpts from type 
compositions played on the Victrola. 
Consideration of the varying tonal qualities of the voices of 
both men and women from the point of view of the solo voice, of 
duets, trios, quartets, and choruses. Pupils are made acquainted 
with the names of past and present “master singers.” 
A study of the orchestra as a medium of musical expression— 
the function of each individual instrument and the color contrib- 
uted by each to the general ensemble. The various choirs—string,  
-P-A-G-E-423
GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 409 
wind, percussion, and brass—are studied, accenting the types of 
emotion voiced by each group. The tonal quality of all instru- 
ments is illustrated by solo passages, and students are made 
familiar with the peculiar timbre of each. 
A study of national songs and dances as they evince national 
feeling. Reference is made to the psychologic, climatic, and his- 
toric background responsible for the characteristic rhythm and 
melody of each. Among the dances considered are the jig of Ire- 
land, the hornpipe of England, the highland fling of Scotland, the 
tarantella of Italy, and the minuet of France. 
Dances by the pupils in the national costumes as a visual aid 
to musical memory. The characteristic instruments of each coun- 
try are also noted—the castanets of Spain; the bagpipes of Scot- 
land; and the dulcimers of Hungary. 
Lessons in rhythm, harmony, and simple musical forms are pro- 
fusely illustrated on numerous instruments and by many compo- 
sitions, like the funeral march and the military march. The char- 
acteristic rhythms of the waltz, polka, mazurka, minuet, gavotte, 
bolero, etc., are all made familiar to the pupils. 
Memorization contests in which the themes or opening bars 
of famous compositions are played for recognition and placement 
by the pupils. 
Story hours in which the plots of the operas are told by certain 
club members and illustrated on various instruments by other 
club members. 
Attendance at children’s symphony concerts given by the 
Philadelphia orchestra. 
It must be understood that only glimpses into the life of the 
Holmes Junior High School have been possible in this article. 
However, these glimpses of the personal guidance, the remedial 
guidance, the civic guidance, and the cultural guidance are at 
least indicative of the principle which helps make a happy and 
successful school community, namely, meeting the individual 
needs of children through agencies which stress activity as the 
chief means of learning. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE AND EDUCATION? 
By Artuur J. Jones 
The vocational guidance movement in this country has had a 
most interesting development. Like some other educational

movements, it was not, strictly speaking, an entirely new idea, 
but was and is merely a new emphasis upon an element long 
L existent in education. In fact guidance may be said to be as old 
as education itself, but until recently it was not separated out 
for special consideration. It has resulted from a more careful 
analysis of the educational process, by which certain elements 
were selected that were judged to be of sufficient importance to 
warrant special attention and definite organization. Like other 
movements, it has passed through several more or less distinct 
stages. It originated in the minds of certain far-seeing men here 
: and there, who began to realize the need for more careful atten- 
)L tion to this phase of education. Among the most notable of early 
pioneers in this field was Frank Parsons, who, probably more 
than any other man, first called our attention to the need for 
specialized study in the field of guidance. Even he but dimly 
realized its possibilities, nor did he clearly see the movement in all 
its phases, but he did point the way and inspired many to con- 
tinue the work. 
The next stage was that of propaganda, which was largely given 
over to “‘selling the idea,” to bringing it before people, to popular- 
izing it. This important phase was, as is usually the case, char- 
acterized by general and indefinite statements, by more or less 
emotional appeals and by somewhat extravagant claims, but it 
“sold the idea.” 
As a result of this second stage, the third or experimental stage 
, was inaugurated. Here and there the idea took hold and we saw

» by the facts presented in various studies and surveys showing the 
great wastage in our schools, by the conditions in labor and in- 
dustry under which boys and girls under sixteen years of age were 
working, by the peril of the “dead-end” job and by the personal 
tragedy and economic loss of the misfit, groups of men and women 
started placement bureaus whose object was to aid young people 
to find suitable positions and to give advice regarding the kind of 
vocation each should enter. We are now far enough removed 
from these first attempts, these initial trials, to judge the results 
with a fair degree of impartiality and accuracy. Some of these 
met a genuine need, they performed a real service and some are 
still in existence, though usually in a modified form. Not a few 
were flat failures, no one can deny this fact, and in some places 
the very name of vocational guidance is anathema. Any mention

of the term brings an instant reaction against it, and what is 
ys Worse, a smile. 
* At present we are in what might be called the fourth stage, when 
we begin to take account of stock, to analyze the results of past 
failures, to determine causes, and to plan for the future. It is a 
time of sober second thought, when we are seeking to clarify our 
aims and to build strong on a sure foundation. It is fully time for 
us to bend our energies in this direction. In many quarters we 
meet indifference or even opposition to the introduction of voca- 
tional guidance. Almost as bad, even worse in some respects, is 
the uncertainty, the lack of harmony and codrdination of effort 
among its advocates. The chief cause, both of the opposition and 
of the lack of codrdination, is to be found in a common failure 
to see clearly the objectives and the purposes of guidance itself. 
Practically all the failures that have resulted from hasty intro- 
duction of vocation guidance can clearly be traced to the extrava- 
gant claims made for it and to the half-baked ideas of those who 
introduced it. People are everywhere searching endlessly for 
panaceas, for educational “get-rich-quick” schemes, for easy short- 
cuts, and, even though they have been fooled again and again, 
they still remain gullible. Such short cuts do not exist and never 
can exist. We must forge out our educational as our social and 
economic destiny by the sweat of the brow, by hard unremitting 
toil, and it is good that it is so. Lured by the extravagant claims 
of some of these promoters, who often wanted to create a place 
for themselves, school authorities and and others got the notion 
that vocational guidance was going to solve the educational and 
industrial ills and remove the possibility of the misfit. While the 
plan was in the stage of talk, all was well, but as soon as they tried 
to translate it into action they had little to show. They simply 
could not make good their claims. The result has been to cast 
suspicion upon the whole movement. Much of this opposition has 
grown out of the misconception that vocational guidance means 
deciding for an individual what he should do and then making 
him do it: This is not guidance, it is prescription, and every true 
friend of guidance is and must be unalterably opposed to it. 
But the friends of guidance are by no means in complete agree- 
ment upon all points. Many conflicting ideas have come to light 
in the various discussions. Some of these at least may be briefly 
mentioned. Some say that the only thing that is definite and 
really worth while about vocational guidance is placement and
-P-A-G-E-426
  412 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
counseling when the boy wants a job. It is then that he feels the 
need and is reaching out after help. Everything else, they say, is 
visionary and impractical. Others maintain that this is the least 
important part of guidance: most of the effort should be expended 
before—several years before—the individual needs to get a job. 
Some say that-we must give actual advice and help in finding the 
job. Others say that “the only time when it is safe to give advice 
is when you know that the other fellow won’t follow it.” Going 
more deeply into the fundamental elements of the question, some 
maintain that vocational guidance in the narrow sense is the only 
form of guidance worthy of consideration, that other forms, educa- 
tional, health, civic, ethical are vague and indefinite and can best 
be considered from the standpoint of the job, if they need to be 
considered at all. Others are frankly afraid of over-emphasis 
upon the vocational, the job side of guidance, fearing that this 
will result in a one-sided view of the boy, and in a lop-sided 
development. There are some also who try to make the term “‘vo- 
cational” do duty for all forms of human activity. For example, 
playing the violin for pleasure is vocational; playing checkers or 
tennis is vocational; the activities of the father or mother are 
vocational. They say that “vocational” should include any form 
of occupation, whether “vocational” or not. 
There are still other differences in conception, but these are 
quite sufficient to show the need for careful analysis and definition 
of terms. But this condition of uncertainty or even of direct oppo- 
sition need not be deplored. On the contrary it is a most hopeful 
sign of life, for it means that we have begun to think. Such a 
condition always precedes a period of real constructive effort. 
During the past few months several associations have been con- 
sidering and discussing the fundamental principles of vocational 
guidance. Such study is most helpful and timely. It should now 
be our aim to discuss fundamental issues, and to contribute, if 
possible, to a clearer understanding and a better definition of 
guidance. In doing this, it seems very well to start at the very 
foundation, and we should make no apology for doing so. More- 
over, the unmodified term “guidance” may best be used, if we are 
not to begin with any presuppositions regarding the kind of 
guidance that is most important. What then, is guidance, and 
how is it related to education? 
Education is concerned with the training and development of 
individual human beings. In general, it seeks to secure the
-P-A-G-E-427
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 413, 
highest development of each individual and to fit him for effective 
participation in various social activities on those levels where he 
can do his best work. In achieving these objectives, two factors 
must be taken into account—the individual and society. The 
individual is the starting point; he is the one to be educated; 
the one in whom the changes we call education must take place. 
He must form certain habits, develop certain skills, interests, 
attitudes, and ideals. It is the function of society to determine 
in large measure what these habits, skills, attitudes, and ideals 
shall be. There are certain social needs that must be met, there 
are certain things that individuals must be trained to do, in order 
to provide and maintain an efficient social organization. 
A large, possibly the largest, part of education, considered from 
the point of time and energy expended, is concerned with the for- 
mation of habits, the development of skills, attitudes, and ideas. 
But this is by no means all of education. Education is not only 
formative; it is selective. If all people were exactly alike in na- 
tive ability, in physical and mental make-up; and if the habits, 
skills, attitudes, and ideals that we wished to form and develop 
were all the same, the task of education would be greatly simpli- 
fied. All we would need to do would be, in the words of Comenius, 
to “teach all things to all.” Education would then be non-selec- 
tive; it would be purely formative. 
But individuals are not alike. They differ in regard to almost 
every known category, in physical health and strength, in mental 
qualities, in intelligence, in special aptitudes as well as in racial 
and religious ideas and in home conditions. On the other hand, 
social needs are almost infinitely varied. Industry is become more 
and more specialized; we need a great diversity of workers, not 
only in various occupational lines, but in citizenship and govern- 
mental activities as well. We can not train all people alike, if we 
would; and we must not, if we could. Education must then be 
selective. There are, to be sure, certain fundamental habits that 
should be the common possession of every one in a democracy; 
these we must secure, but even some of these are rather vague and 
indefinite at present. Beyond these common factors the variety 
is infinite. In this complex social organization of ours we need 
many different types of workers, we can use every kind and degree 
of skill and intelligence. We have a place for the broadly trained, 
highly intelligent manager, and for the skilled specialist whose 
deft touch is utilized in a narrow field.
-P-A-G-E-428
  414 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
One of the most important aspects of education is that of dis- 
criminating between individuals with their varying capacities, 
abilities, aptitudes, and interests, and of so arranging our social 
system that each one will choose, prepare himself for, and find 
that place in society where he can serve best and at the same time 
attain his own best development. This is the guidance aspect of 
education. It is concerned with times of choice, times when the 
ways part, when it is necessary to make a selection of one course 
of action or another. Fundamentally any aid, directly or in- 
directly given, which helps in any choice is guidance, whether this 
is a choice between going out with umbrella and raincoat or with- 
out them, or between beef and pork for dinner, or between the 
Home Economics course and the College Preparatory course, or 
between the vocation of the physician and that of the carpenter. 
Any help given for any of these choices is guidance, whether by 
way of a long period of preparation or by definite advice given at 
the time. It is thus one of the absolutely essential aspects of edu- 
cation. In one sense, it is one of the most important objectives 
of education. Every day is a day of choice and to be prepared to 
make intelligent choices, whether of cereal at breakfast, or of 
mayors, governors, and presidents at election time, is to be truly 
educated. 
Interpreted thus, guidance is interwoven with every part of edu- 
cation. But, it may be said, this makes it too indefinite, too dif- 
fuse, too widespread to be of any practical value. That is true, 
but it is no more the case with guidance than with education in 
general. Every act, every situation, every experience in life is or 
may be educative. We are mistaken if we think that education is 
confined to the more or less formal, definitely organized work of 
the school. Children receive a very important part of their 
education at home, on the street, at the movies. But we cannot 
depend upon these to achieve the objectives of education. In 
order to make sure that certain habits are formed and that certain 
skills and attitudes are developed, we single out certain of these 
for special emphasis, and we place in the hands of experienced 
teachers the duty of seeing that these ends are realized. It is the 
same with guidance, every activity of the school helps or should 
help the pupils to choose wisely. 
This help is given, for the most part, unconsciously by the 
teacher, and has always been given. There are certain choices of 
vastly more importance than others; these may truly be termed
-P-A-G-E-429
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 415 
crises in the life of the individual, the places where the parting of 
the ways is more pronounced, where the choice is more vital to 
the whole after-life of the individual and to society as well. 
Among such crises are the choice of the curriculum in the high 
school; the choice of going to normal school or college; the 
choice of life work; the choice of specialized citizenship activities; 
even the choice of a wife or of a husband. All of these are of un- 
usual importance for good or ill. As such they need special at- 
tention, special preparation for, and special organization. Whether 
any of these or all of these, or many others, shall be definitely 
provided for in our schools depends largely upon whether we con- 
sider them really important, or whether our schools can be so or- 
ganized as to give effective help. 
Let us distinguish then, clearly between the two aspects of edu- 
cation—the selective aspect and the formative aspect. Guidance 
is concerned primarily with selection, the choice of habits and 
skills to be developed and not with the formation of habits. To 
be sure, the way in which a person forms a habit, the degree of 
skill that he attains is extremely helpful in proper guidance; this 
helps in diagnosis, and diagnosis is the first step in guidance, but 
the actual formation of habits is not in itself guidance. A physi- 
cian examines a man, he diagnoses his case and he suggests cer- 
tain exercises for him to do—all this is guidance—the actual per- 
formance of the exercises is not guidance, but is like the habit 
formation aspect of education. A part of the examination may 
well consist of certain exercises that will enable the physician to 
judge better the action of the heart and muscles, but this is a part 
of the diagnosis and hence of guidance. Guidance studies, ana- 
lyzes, and lists individuals with their varying capacities, abilities, 
and aptitudes; it studies, analyzes, and lists social needs in all 
their complexity, and seeks to arrange matters so that each indi- 
vidual will form those habits, develop those skills, attitudes, and 
ideals, and choose those lines of activities that will be best for 
himself and for society. 
As has already been said, it is impossible to separate these two 
aspects, just as impossible as it is to separate reading from geog- 
raphy or physics from mathematics, but it is helpful and necessary 
to single out this one aspect, guidance, for special treatment. It 
is of especial importance just now, because attention is being di- 
rected as never before towards individual differences and their 
causes. This question is being very carefully studied and we are 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
  416 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
generally realizing that it is of very great importance that all dif- 
ferences between individuals should be recognized and that many 
of them should be utilized and developed. We believe that this 
will necessitate a radical change in our educational system and in 
our methods of instruction. While it will not and cannot solve 
all educational problems, it should be of material assistance in 
improving conditions. Guidance, then, is the diagnostic, the 
selective aspect of education. 
What then, are the different forms of guidance and just how are 
they related? Guidance, like education is unitary, but it is 
helpful to single out now one phase, now another for special con- 
sideration. Here we can not do better than to follow the trail 
blazed by the committee that formulated the Cardinal Principles 
of Secondary Education. They have laid down this principle that 
the objectives of education must be determined by the activities of 
human beings. These activities they have grouped under four 
heads: home membership, citizenship, leisure time, vocation. In 
order to attain these, three other objectives must be realized: 
health, command of the fundamental processes, ethical character. 
While these do not cover all human activities, they are sufficiently 
inclusive for our purpose. The only one which needs to be 
changed here is that called “leisure time.” All of the others are, 
in a sense, ends, the worthy employment of leisure time is only 
a means. The chief end to be obtained by the use of leisure time 
is personal development. Hence this may well be changed to “per- 
sonal development.” If these are the objectives of education, we 
can properly speak of the organization of work which is calcu- 
lated to attain a certain objective as that sort of education. For 
example, if the work of the school is so organized as to attain the 
end of citizenship, we could call this civic education. We could 
then distinguish in the same way civic guidance, and say that 
when individuals are diagnosed and civic needs are analyzed and 
the effort is made to have the individual select habits and attitudes 
that he will form and develop, and choose. civic activities where 
he can be of most use to the state and to himself, this is “civic 
guidance.” 
At present, the one objective that is most commonly singled out 
as worthy of special consideration is vocation. When the work 
of the school and of society is so organized as to provide definite 
training that fits a person for a vocation, we call it vocational 
education. In the same way we can separate out vocational
-P-A-G-E-431
  
  GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 417 
guidance. Vocational guidance, then, is primarily concerned 
with diagnosis of individuals with reference to the job. It is “de- 
signed to help the individual to choose, to plan his preparation for, 
to enter upon, and to make progress in an occupation.” It has 
continually in mind the job and is not concerned primarily with 
health, character, home membership, citizenship, or self-develop- 
ment, except as these will help in the job. 
Vocational guidance is, then, only one phase of guidance but a 
very important one. There is unquestionably grave danger in the 
narrow vocational point of view. The job, while important, is not 
all-important, and if we confine our attention too narrowly to the 
job, we shall be very likely to have a one-sided view of the indi- 
vidual, and neglect the other very important objectives mentioned. 
But since vocational guidance, like vocational education, is more 
easily organized and more definite in its objectives than, let us 
say, civic guidance, it is possible that we should organize other 
forms of guidance around this as a center and seek to attain all the 
objectives at the same time, but this is by no means certain. 
If the principles here laid down are correct, some of the false 
conceptions have doubtless already been cleared away. Voca- 
tional guidance is not all there is to guidance, nor is it necessarily 
the most important, but it is the form that is most clearly rec- 
ognized, the most definite, and the most easily organized. While 
it might be desirable to make the word “vocational” do duty for 
the whole range of activities, it is not at all probable that it will 
ever be generally recognized in this meaning. There is a popular 
misconception that should be mentioned and removed. Some think 
that “vocational” refers only to industrial, agricultural, or the 
lower grade occupations, and does not include professional occu- 
pations. This is, of course, very wide of the truth. Voca- 
tional guidance is concerned with all kinds and grades of occu- 
pations. It includes all activities connected with recognized 
profitable employment, unskilled, highly skilled, trade, and pro- 
fession. 
Another question is, when shall guidance be given? Should it 
be given only at the time when the individual is confronted with 
the necessity for a choice or can it be given earlier? Guidance 
is concerned with choice, it has to do with crises, and as such it 
should help at the time when a choice is to be made, but the best 
kind of guidance is the kind that prepares one in advance for the 
choice; it forecasts the crisis and paves the way for intelligent
-P-A-G-E-432
  418 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
choice. It helps the individual to secure the data necessary for 
an intelligent decision. 
Should we give advice to young people or content ourselves with 
presenting facts to them and with the work of preparation already 
described? It is usually true that the more one has tried to give 
advice at the times of choice, the more he shrinks from it, and the 
less he thinks of the practise. In general, the better the prepara- 
tory work has been done, the less necessity will there be for actual 
advice. Of course, we cannot entirely escape responsibility for 
giving advice, but when we do give it, it should always be but- 
tressed by actual facts and experiences. 
It hardly seems necessary to discuss compulsion as a method 
of guidance, for surely no reader of the Educational Review needs 
enlightenment on that point. Clearly it is no part of the purpose 
of guidance to choose for a person what he shall do, to prepare him 
for it, and to make him do it. This is never desirable nor per- 
missible as an educational process. In times of great national 
crisis, as in the late war, this method may, of course, be not only 
desirable, but absolutely necessary. And it might always be de- 
sirable as a method of training in an autocracy, but never in a 
democracy, whose ultimate purpose is the good of each individual 
citizen. We shall continue to employ negative prescription in 
certain lines of work, where we refuse to allow a person to perform 
a certain activity, if he lack the qualities or the skills necessary to 
do it successfully. Thus we shall refuse to allow a man that is 
color blind to become a locomotive engineer. We may refuse to 
allow an osteopath to practise medicine, because he has not pre- 
pared himself in materia medica. Nor do we allow a person to 
teach in our public schools unless he has a certificate that is sup- 
posed to guarantee a certain minimum of training. This field of 
negative prescription will inevitably be enlarged whenever and 
wherever public safety or the public good demands. But this is 
far removed from positive compulsions. We may surround an 
individual with forces that will predispose him to a certain choice, 
we may give him the facts and experiences that should enable him 
to choose intelligently, but in the last analysis he must make his 
own choice. The purpose of guidance is intelligent self-guidance. 
This only is democratic, this only is educative. This is the point 
at which so many people fail. They are so afraid that the boy 
will make an unwise choice that they cannot leave him alone. 
They fail to realize that efficiency is not the chief purpose of
-P-A-G-E-433
, GUIDANCE OF PUPILS 419 
democracy; it is the development of character. Character cannot 
be developed except by responsibility, and responsibility is de- 
pendent upon choice. When there is any real choice between a 
lower and a higher, there is always the possibility of choosing the 
lower. But it is only thus that we can accomplish the purpose of 
education in a democracy. 
In conclusion, let us reaffirm our faith in guidance and in voca- 
tional guidance. It is fundamental, it underlies all that is best in 
education. The guidance movement has been long on the way; it 
has passed through storms of varying intensity; the criticisms 
directed against it and its very factions have served but to purify 
it, and to make clearer its real position and its real objectives. It 
remains for us to make even more definite and clear the purposes 
underlying it—to come to a common understanding and agreement 
upon the fundamental issues and to organize our forces and de- 
velop our methods in such a way that we shall actually attain the 
objectives that we have set for ourselves. We must admit that, 
as yet, some of our work is indefinite, ill-defined, and lacking in 
organization. The needed definiteness and organization can be 
accomplished only by the most careful and painstaking study and 
experimentation, by vigorous criticism and evaluation of results, 
and by the whole-hearted codperation of all who are in any way 
interested in the problem. 
Principles of school pupil-guidance. As pupil-guidance is 
now conducted in all schools, each school must decide only as to 
whether it will provide haphazard or systematic guidance. 
Increased high-school enrolments, and increased variety of 
subjects offered in school increase the need for guidance. 
Guidance should be based upon pupil-records, which furnish as 
full an account as possible of home life, occupational activities, 
school life, mental capacities, aptitudes, and interests. 
School counseling is a technical task which demands the ser- 
«vices of expert counselors. 
Democracy of opportunity demands that all pupils have the best 
available counsel about themselves. 
Individual needs can be met only by educative activities which 
result from personal, remedial, civic, vocational, and cultural 
uidance. Q

When Based upon vocational considerations, educational de- 
cisions should be regarded as tentative until final choice is neces- 
sary. 1s 
Pupil-guidance improves both teaching and learning by increas- 
ing the codperation between.pupils, teachers,;-and~parents; 
Adequate pupil-guidance leads to the substitution of ever higher 
pupil-objectives for lower objectives. 
Guidance is concerned, primarily with “the choice of habits 
and skills to be developed*and not with the formation of habits.” 
Education should be so organized that each pupil will “choose, 
prepare himself for and find that place in society where he can 
serve best and at the same time attain his own best development.”

COUNTRIES 
CHAPTER XI 
SEcoNDARY EDUCATION IN GERMANY, FRANCE, AND ENGLAND 
Certain experiences of foreign nations are needed as counsel in 
planning American High Schools. A general discussion of Ger- 
man and French schools is given in order to orient the student 
as he reads the remainder of the chapter. A similar discussion of 
‘English schools is omitted because of the’ fulness of Dr. Kandel’s 
treatment of the schools of that country in one of the readings of 
this chapter. 
German schools. German schools are organized on the gym- 
nasial plan, the essential divisions of which are a three-year 
-elementary, school and a nine-year secondary school. | Children 
enter: the elementary school—at~six” years of age and the 
Gymnasium at nine. Within this simple pattern there are, how- 
ever, many different designs. 
The nine-year Gymnasium is a direct outgrowth of the Renais- 
sance. The early Gymnasien, as organized by Johann Sturm in 
the sixteenth century, were only six years in length. These 
schools were designed to teach German boys knowledge, eloquence, 
and piety by means of the writings of the Greeks, the Romans, 
the Church Fathers, and the Bible. As the task proved too great 
for the time allotted, the schools became nine-year institutions. 
The six-year Gymnasium still exists, however, in localities which 
are unable or unwilling to supply sufficient patronage to maintain 
a nine-year school. 1

Besides schools of different lengths, there are divisions of Gym- 
nasien according to the curricula offered by them. The original 
Gymnasium offers a classical course; the Realgymnasium, a 
modern language-science course; the Oberrealschule, a technical 
course. Children or their parents are required to decide, when the 
boys are nine years of age, which curriculum is to be pursued. 
The six-year schools which offer shorter courses of the same char- 
acter are, respectively, the Progymnasium, The Prorealgymnasium, 
and the Realschule. Although all elementary schools prepare boys

for these schools, the Vorschule is a three-year school which is 
conducted solely as a preparatory school. The eight-year ele- 
mentary school known as the Volkschule or the nine-year Mittel- 
schule may be attended for three years as preparatory to any of 
the secondary schools. 
An obvious defect in the German system is that a secondary cur-' 
riculum must be chosen when boys are only nine years old. In 
order to correct this defect, a new type of school known as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-439
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 425 
Reformschule has been organized in certain cities. Before the 
Great War opened, there were nearly two hundred Reformschulen 
in Germany. The programs of study of these schools are so 
planned that boys need not make their final choice of a curricu- 
lum until they are fourteen years of age. That is, secondary edu- 
cation is begun as formerly when the boys are nine years old. At 
that time, however, no language save French which is common to 
all gymnasial courses is begun. At the age of twelve, boys may 
select either the Gymnasium course with two hours a week of 
French and ten hours a week of Latin or the Realgymnasium 
course with four hours of French and eight hours of Latin. At 
the age of fourteen, choice is made between the curricula by elect- 
ing Greek if the Gymnasium course is to be followed, or English 
if the Realgymnasium course is to be taken. Other differences 
exist between the curricula of the Reformschule, but these are the 
ones which finally determine which curriculum is to be followed. 
Typical German curricula are given in Tables XXXIV- 
XXXVII. To the American student the striking characteristics 
of these curricula are the early beginnings of and the large allot- 
ments of time to foreign language and the important place given 
to religion. Reasons which necessitate the early selection of a 
school are found in these tables. For example, if a pupil enters 
an Oberrealschule at the age of nine and continues therein for 
three years he will have credits in excess of those required in a 
Gymnasium in mathematics, history, German, and French, but 
he will be deficient in Latin. As he would have great difficulty 
in making up a Latin deficiency of twenty-four year-hours, he 
would be practically unable to change to a Gymnasium. Similar 
difficulties would be experienced by a pupil who wished to trans- 
fer from a Gymnasium to an Oberrealschule. Between the Gym- 
nasium and the Realgymnasium, the difficulties of transferring at 
the age of twelve are comparatively slight; later transference is, 
however, very difficult. The Reformschule avoids this kind of 
difficulty by offering uniform subjects for all pupils until the 
fourth year of school. The fourth and fifth years are also uni-

form except in the case of foreign language, where the differences 
are slight. This virtually postpones the necessity for final choice 
of curriculum until the pupils are fourteen years old. 
Secondary education has never been popular in Europe. In 
Germany several conditions have combined to restrict educational 
-opportunities; namely, the tuition fees exacted in all secondary 
schools, the small number of free scholarships, and most impor- 
tant of all, the strong popular tradition favoring early elimination 
from school. In the year preceding the Great War, while less 
than one per cent of German children of the ages six to fourteen 
were out of schools, only seven per cent were attending secondary 
schools. As children enter the secondary schools at the age of 
nine, this percentage shows that few began courses in secondary 
schools; also as no secondary schools are open to pupils at the. 
completion of the Volkschule, this percentage shows that even 
boys do not commonly attend secondary schools at all. 
The education of girls beyond the elementary grades was not
-P-A-G-E-442
ee eT ee ne aT ee ae eee ee We anege BE es ems sere Tn ee 
428 HaconbAne EDUCATION 
common in any country at the time the German school system 
was established. Against the education of women there has been, 
therefore, not only such prejudice as existed until the last century 
in America, but also the strong influence of a well-established 
national system which provided education for boys only. The 
many types of schools which have recently been organized for 
girls follow roughly the gymnasial plan. Some of these schools 
train girls for teaching, a few train for entrance to a university, 
others offer general courses without fulfilling the needs of pros- 
pective university students. The later readings of this chapter 
show that interest in the education of girls is increasing. 
In addition to schools which are ordinarily classified as secon- 
dary there are other which offer subjects commonly included in 
the programs of many American high schools. These schools 
include the middle schools, “citizens’ schools,” vocational schools, * 
continuation schools, and trade schools. One of the reasons for 
the establishment of the many German vocational schools is that 
the traditional schools make no provision for vocational education. 
Another important school to be referred to later is the folk high 
school. This type of school has been introduced recently from 
Schleswig-Holstein where it has met with strong popular approval. 
The Danish form of this school was originally in Schleswig in the 
middle of the nineteenth century for men and women over eighteen 
years of age. It offers training in the following subjects: Danish 
history, language, literature, and music; science; physical training; 
and vocational work. The account given by Orr of this type of 
school in Germany shows that folk high schools are doing for 
adults much that American high schools attempt to perform for 
adolescents. 
German schools provide intensive training for secondary-school 
teachers, Such teachers must be graduates of a gymnasial and a 
university course and must have pursued professional courses for 
two years—a seminar year and a practice year—after finishing the 
university. In terms of years, this training includes twelve years 
prior to graduation from the Gymnasium, three years in the
-P-A-G-E-443
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 429 
university, and the two years of educational theory and practice. 
In terms of credits in American schools, a graduate of a Gym- 
nasium has completed the equivalent of two years in American 
colleges; he then attends a university three years—this would be 
equivalent in time to a year of graduate study; he then pursues 
professional studies one year as his seminar year and one final 
year as his practice or probation year—this is equivalent in time 
to that required in America for a doctor’s degree. The seminar 
year and the practice year are spent in a Gymnasium under the 
Director of the school. The work consists of a study of educa- 
tional theory practice under the skillful direction of efficient in- 
structors. At the end of this period of training the young teacher 
often has to wait several years before he receives an appointment. 
He is willing to wait for the appointment, however, because teach- 
ers belong to a high rank in civil as well as social and profes- 
sional circles. Women who expect to teach prepare as men do 
except that provisions have not been made for the seminar and 
practice years. In spite of the low salaries of teachers—fifteen 
to eighteen hundred dollars in the best positions before the war, 
teachers have been able to live comfortably. In comparison with 
other professional men, the teacher was fairly well-paid. His 
tenure is for his teaching life: after forty years of teaching or at 
the age of sixty-five he retires upon a pension which amounts ap- 
proximately to three-fourths of the last year’s salary. 
PEOPLE’S HIGH SCHOOLS IN GERMANY* 
By Wr11aM Orr 
In a classroom of the “Real Gymnasium” of a suburb of Berlin 
there may be found from half past 6 to 8, on each Monday eve- 
ning during the winter months, a group of people, most of whom 
are employed by day in the great factories of the “Allgemeine 
Elektrische Gesellschaft” (General Electrical Co.) or in the auto- 
mobile industries. This group numbers 20 men and women, with 
both sexes equally represented. The room is plainly furnished, 
but electric lamps give a good, even brilliant, light.

    430 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Students of the People’s High School.—One, however, soon be- 
comes so intent in watching the students that the surroundings are 
forgotten, for these men and women are members of the local 
unit of the “Volkshochschule”—People’s High School—an educa- 
tional enterprise, scarcely two years old, one of the significant re- 
sults of the revolution of 1918, intended to give the citizens of the 
new republic that equipment in knowledge and in capacity to do 
their own thinking as shall fit them to discharge aright their civic 
and political duties and responsibilities. 
In age the students range from 25 to 40 years. Most of them 
are wage earners, engaged in manual labor and in the ranks of 
skilled workmen. A few of the women are housewives. An army 
overcoat shows that the wearer has seen war service. Another 
has on a somewhat frayed soldier’s fatigue jacket. All bear the 
signs and marks of stress and strain in that struggle for a live- 
lihood that goes on to-day in the homes of the common people in 
Germany. For the time, however, their cares and anxieties are 
forgotten as they dwell in the world of intellect and of spirit in 
which material things have no part. 
Variety and animation mark the exercises —The instructor is a 
man of perhaps 35 years of age. His methods are those of a 
leader who provokes and directs discussion, in marked contrast 
to the practice of the university professor who delivers his lecture 
in prosaic, perfunctory fashion, not permitting, least of all invit- 
ing, comment from his hearers. In this class, however, views are 
interchanged, and there is a clash of opinions, and at times an 
outburst of laughter, that give variety and animation to the 90 
minutes of solid, substantial study of two writers, Storm and 
Keller, who portray the contrasting temperaments of the north 
and south German folk, for these people’s high schools are not 
vocational in character, but are definitely and solely institutions 
for liberal and cultural training. 
In the fall of 1920, a little over a year from their inception, 
these schools in Greater Berlin had an enrollment of over 4,000, 
and during the winter semester, January to March, 1921, there 
were 147 courses taught by 70 instructors, picked men from the 
faculties of high schools and universities. Eighty-four commu- 
nity groups of working people are codperating in this enterprise. 
It can be readily understood, therefore, that this movement is of 
great significance and of tremendous possibilities in the develop-
-P-A-G-E-445
  
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 431 
ment of free political institutions through an intelligent and 
trained citizenship. 
Movement is extending rapidly—tThis educational movement 
is well under way also in Thuringia and in Wiirtemberg, and is 
extending over Germany as rapidly as organizations can be es- 
tablished. 
The broadly representative and democratic character of these 
schools is shown by the methods and procedure followed in set- 
ting up the system of the Volkshochschule. A preliminary survey 
of the resources of the area as regards available teachers and 
equipment and the probable demand for instruction is made by 
the field agent of that division of the ministry of education which 
has to do with these schools. 
When conditions are favorable, a conference is held of repre- 
sentatives of the communities, of the labor organizations, and of 
the faculties of schools and colleges. This meeting is at a place 
where there is freedom from all distracting and disturbing in- 
fluences—generally a quiet country town. The sessions are held 
in the morning, while the afternoons and evenings are given up 
to informal group gatherings, to outings and recreation. Ample 
time is taken for a full and free consideration of all questions. 
Usually the conference lasts for two weeks. An especial effort is 
made to ascertain the desires of the people on the subjects to be 
taught, the methods of instruction, the places of meeting, and 
the personnel of the teaching force. 
Based on community, union, and university —If the conference 
acts favorably, the next step is to create an organization for the 
Province or municipality. Here, again, the democratic character of 
the system is shown. In Berlin, which may be taken as an ex- 
ample, the People’s High Schools are based on three elements— 
the communities, organizations of working people, and the public 
high school and university; the communities assure financial sup- 
port, the unions and clubs of the laboring classes hold and main- 
tain the confidence, interest, and codperation of the common 
people, and the recognized institutions of learning insist on high 
standards of instruction. 
In the fall of 1919 the leaders in the Volkshochschule movement 
called together representatives of these groups and agencies in a 
conference at which rules and regulations under which the schools 
were to be operated were unanimously adopted. By these regula- 
tions, the management is vested in a board of directors responsible 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
entero ae ee ha phn area eR Wwe BATES Remmmee CNTs We heen 
432 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to a general committee made up of representatives of the commu- 
nities supporting People’s High Schools, or organizations of 
workers, of educational departments, of political groups, of the 
students, and of the department of education. Each division of 
the general committee chooses its delegates to the board of direc- 
tors, to whom are added representatives of the university and of 
the technical and commercial higher schools. 
The superintendent is chosen annually—tThe executive of the 
system of Volkshochschule, the superintendent (Geschdftsfiihrer) 
is selected by the board of directors from a list of candidates 
submitted by the university. The term of service is one year, at 
the end of which, if the incumbent fails to receive a majority vote 
of the directors, he must vacate his office. | 
In order to secure unity of action between the people’s high 
school and the university, an advisory council has been formed 
of representatives of these two institutions. 
| Large significance attaches to the origin of the people’s high 
schools. They are a direct outcome of the revolution of 1918. 
With the utter collapse of the political and social system in 
November, 1918, Berlin was filled with multitudes of people with- 
out occupation. Far-sighted men and women sensed the urgent 
and serious problem created by these conditions. As a remedy 
they outlined the general plan and program for a system of eve- 
ning high schools whose aims should be to raise the level of the 
individual, of personality, in the social organism by putting at 
the service of the common people Germany’s rich resources in 
liberal and cultural studies. 
Inadequate preparation for citizenship. + tt should be under- 
stood that while every child in Germany receives an elementary 
education, a comparatively small number attend the high schools. 
Excellent as the instruction is in the lower schools, or folk schools,. 
it does not prepare adequately for the duties of citizenship in a 
free State. Therefore the people’s high schools aim to develop 
in these students intellectual independence, including enriched 
mental resources, good judgment, and the capacity for logical 
thinking. 
Much use is made of mathematics and pure science, as the study 
of these subjects gives habits of ordered thinking, ability to con- 
sider, weigh, and test evidence, and an insight into the world of 
ideas. Art, literature, and music make for the fuller and more 
abundant life. Economics, political science, and sociology give  
-P-A-G-E-447
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 433 
a grasp on the universal elements and factors in the problems of 
the new democratic order. History puts at the service of the citi- 
zen the experience of mankind whereby it has step by step ad- 
vanced in civilization. Philosophy and religion are included as 
they relate to ultimate problems of existence and to the inner 
meaning of life. The courses in all subjects are so planned that 
the student may advance year by year from the introductory and 
elementary to advanced topics. 
Problem method is gaining ground—A notable feature of these 
schools is the method of instruction. The purpose is increasingly 
to use discussion and interchange of views and opinions, in which 
process the teacher is a leader and guide, and not one who im- 
poses his own knowledge or convictions on the students. It can 
be easily understood that such a radical change from the stereo- 
typed, formal methods of university lectures is not easily made. 
By no means do all the teachers in the Volkshochschule comply 
with these requirements. The subject matter in any course is so 
great, that, apart from the force of habit, there is a strong tempta- 
tion to be didactic and even dogmatic in presenting each topic 
and to regard discussion as a waste of valuable time. Yet, espe- 
cially in the case of the younger instructors, the discussion, or 
problem, method is gaining ground and force. 
Teach pupils how to think.—Two tendencies are guarded against 
in these high schools, that toward vocational education and the in- 
culcation of any particular social, political, or religious doctrine. 
As regards vocational training, the school system of Germany 
makes abundant provision for the teacher of trades, business, and 
professions. As regards the second limitation, self-imposed, the 
function of these schools is not propaganda. They are intended 
to give the material for thought and how to think, not what to 
think. And herein is their promise as a helpful influence in the 
evolution of the new Germany. 
French schools. French secondary schools, like those of 
Germany, are fee schools. There are two kinds, the lycée and the 
college, both of which are described in the articles by Merds and 
Kandel. The French boy enters the secondary school at the age 
of five or six where he pursues an elementary school course until 
he is ten or eleven; this completes his preliminary cycle. He
-P-A-G-E-448

434 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
then begins the higher seven-year course, or, as Americans would 
say, the secondary school proper, which is divided into two 
parts: the first cycle of four years, the second cycle of three years, 
which includes a final year in either a “philosophical” or a 
“mathematical” course. Boys regularly complete this course, 
therefore, at the age of seventeen or eighteen at which time they 
receive the bachelor’s degree. 
The seven-year secondary school offered until 1923 a choice of 
either a classical or a modern language curriculum during the first 
cycle of four years. The second cycle still offers a choice between 
four curricula: the classical, the Latin-modern language; the 
Latin-science and the science-modern language. In the third year 
of the second cycle, students specialize upon either mathematics 
or philosophy. In addition to this kind of secondary education, 
there have been developed specializing curricula some of which 
are technical while others are predominantly military. The divi- 
sion of the secondary period into cycles is advantageous to both 
students and administrators. It enables students to complete 
definite, orderly units of work. At the end of a cycle the courses 
are drawn together and examinations held. If the pupil leaves 
school at the end of the first cycle, he has a thorough grounding 
in secondary subjects; if he continues school, he is not hampered 
by the lack of training in the elements of secondary-school sub- 
jects. Teachers and administrators are able to organize sequences 
which are both unified and comprehensive. The courses of study , 
of the cycles are described in the readings which follow. i 
The training of secondary school teachers in France is con- 
ducted so as to select.only persons of superior_scholarship. “The 
professors of the highest rank must have the title of “agrégé. The 
education necessary to pass the examination for this title repre- 
sents five years in elementary studies, seven years in secondary 
studies, one year or more in preparation for the competitive exami- 
(nation for admission to the higher normal school, and three or 
‘four years in a professional school preparatory to the aggregation 
for the title agrégé. This title represents eight orders of subjects;
-P-A-G-E-449
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 435 
viz., philosophy, grammar, letters, history and geography, modern 
language, mathematics, physical science, and natural science. 
“This course of training differs from the training of a graduate 
of an American college in the early beginning and the extent of 
specialization upon the major subjects, and in the drill necessary 
to the final competitive examination. As a sifting or selective 
process, it is superior to the American method of certificating teach- 
ers upon graduation from approved courses. But it raises the 
standing questions of, ‘specialization versus breadth,’ and ‘scholar- 
ship versus personality.’ In rank below the agrégés are the 
regular teachers who hold the master’s degree, those who hold the 
bachelor’s degree, and those who have only the primary teacher’s 
certificate.” * 
FRENCH SECONDARY SCHOOLS; THEIR ORGANIZATION AND 
CURRICULUM PROBLEMS * 
By Apert A, Meris 
1. Organization, All public schools, Lycées, colleges, and uni- 
versities in France constitute the University of France, organized 
by Napoleon I in 1808. The minister of public instruction, who 
is a member of the French cabinet, is Grand Master of the Uni- 
versity of France, usually called ?Université. He is assisted by 
the Conseil Supérieur de V' Instruction Publique, consisting of five 
Academicians, nine educators at large, eighteen professors repre- 
senting l’enseignement supérieur, ten professors representing l’en- 
seignement secondaire, six teachers from the primary schools, and 
four from private institutions. 
There are three orders of public instruction: (1) ?Enseignement 
Primaire is given in primary schools, in superior primary schools, 
and in preparatory departments of lycées and colleges. (2) l’En- 
seignement Secondaire is given in lycées and colleges. There is 
practically no difference between lycées and colleges as far as 
courses of study are concerned. Lycées are directly administered 
by the state, and colleges are administered by communes, cities,

or private organizations under the surveillance of the state. (3) 
VEnseignement Supérieur is given in the universities. 
Secondary education proper covers a period of seven years from 
the age of eleven to eighteen years, comprising the sixth, fifth, 
fourth, third, second, first, and the mathematics or philosophy 
forms. This does not include the primary instruction of five years 
given in lycées and colleges for the children of the well-to-do 
bourgeoisie, who prefer the preparatory departments of lycées 
and colleges to public primary schools. Hundreds of scholarships 
open the doors of French secondary schools to pupils of ability 
from the poorer classes. 
Secondary instruction, therefore, begins at eleven years of age 
in the sixth form of lycées and colleges, to which are admitted 
pupils from private schools, primary schools, preparatory depart- 
ments of Lycées and colleges, as well as pupils who, with a certain 
amount of state control, are permitted to begin their studies at 
home; and ends at the age of eighteen in the philosophy or in the 
mathematics form. The degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor 
of Science is conferred after thorough preliminary and final oral 
and written examinations. 
2. Curriculum problems. Léon Bérard, author of the reforms 
of 1923, was a member of the Chamber of Deputies when he was 
appointed minister of public instruction. As president of the com- 
mission on education of the Chamber of Deputies, he had studied 
the defects of secondary education based on the reforms of 1902, 
and as early as January, 1921, he made known his ideas on what 
he considered much needed reforms. At the January session of 
the Conseil Supérieur de L’Instruction Publique, he made clear 
the weaknesses of prevailing courses of study, his opinions on 
the real aims of secondary education, essentially cultural and not 
utilitarian, his opposition to premature options and early speciali- 
zation, and his belief in the classics as indispensable disciplines 
for human intelligence. At the June session of the Conseil 
Supérieur, he outlined his project and presented for advice seven 
questions dealing with the existing cycles, a common course for 
the first four years inspired by ancient disciplines, the bac- 
calaureate degree for graduates of classical courses only, a re- 
duction of the number of class hours per week, and the secondary 
education of girls. 
In many notable speeches at public ceremonies, before the 
Conseil Supérieur, before the two parliamentary commissions on
-P-A-G-E-451
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 437 
education, and before the Chamber of Deputies, the Minister of 
Public Instruction presented his ideas on the prevailing defects 
in the utilitarian reforms of 1902 as he saw them, namely, early 
specialization; premature options; confusion of primary and sec- 
ondary studies; neglect of humanistic culture and the sciences; 
and the abandonment of the old system of class professors who 
taught Latin, Greek, and French. M. Bérard’s emphasis on the 
memory-training and cultural classics brought up the “eternal 
controversy,” and renewed the ancient quarrel between the classi- 
cists and the modernists. 
The most important arguments of the modernists, opponents 
of the Bérard reforms, may be summed up as follows: 
1. French, the native tongue, cannot be neglected in favor 
of the old classics. There is a French classicism perfectly com- 
plete and independent which is worthy of profound study. 
2. Modern times are the result of decades and centuries of 
changes, and demand a corresponding reformation of the old 
processes of education. Classicists, bound to the ancient lan- 
guages by educational tradition, are always blind to the necessity 
of practical revisions of programmes. 
3. Modern languages cannot be brushed aside as inferior dis- 
ciplines. They train the powers of discrimination, analysis, ac- 
curate reasoning, trustworthy observation, and retentive mem- 
orizing; they form the will and make men, since young men 
formed by the programmes of 1902 gave an example, on the 
battle fields and in the trenches, of will and intelligence unsur- 
passed. 
4. The new reforms will create an élite of literary scholars, 
but an élite of leaders in industry, commerce, and agriculture is 
equally necessary. 
5. Compulsory classic studies for all in state institutions will 
be the death knell of many colleges, the clientéle of which will 
be driven into inferior private institutions based apparently on 
modern utilitarian principles. 
6. The classical humanities should be open to all students, 
but forcing all to take up Greco-Roman studies for four years 
means waste of time for the unwilling, who will be a source of 
annoyance to the others, Unquestionably the coerced students 
will drop their classical studies at the end of the obligatory period 
just when the studies are beginning to be worth while. 
7. The new reforms will deter many students from professional
-P-A-G-E-452
; ! 
438 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
careers since the classics will be obligatory in the secondary 
schools through which they must pass in order to be admitted to 
the universities. Students must be permitted to work toward 
other goals, if they feel that a modern, scientific education is a 
national necessity. 
8. To establish a long period of four years of classical studies 
for all secondary students, will be to found an undemocratic 
system whereby a wide gulf will be created between the youth of 
the bourgeoisie and the youth of the people. 
On the other hand, the classicists, supporters of the Bérard 
reforms, set forth the following claims: 
1. The new reforms will establish an equilibrium of literary 
culture and of scientific teaching, and at the same time, by a 
methodic selection, will call all pupils to participate, regardless 
of fortune or social distinction. 
2. Secondary education should be liberal and cultural, without 
any utilitarian or vocational bias. Intellectual culture should 
not be subordinated to material progress or to economic necessity. 
3. Common classical studies must come first because complete 
scientific culture can find a place only at a later stage of in- 
tellectual development. 
4. Options and specialization at eleven years of age are danger- 
ous. A period of common studies allows the formation of apti- 
tudes and capacities and permits of more intelligent selection at 
the time pupils are called upon to make the crucial choice. 
5. French civilization is Greco-Roman. The end of the humani- 
ties would be the end of French genius. The moral wealth, 
eternal youth, and living beauty of Roman and Hellenic culture 
have always enriched and completed French civilization. 
6. The French language, which has its origin in the genius of 
ancient times, cannot be studied thoroughly without a classical 
introduction, The common period of classic studies will make 
the explanation of French authors easy. To understand Latin 
is the shortest method of acquiring ability to understand, speak, 
and write French. The classics are also the basis for other modern 
languages. 
7. Studying the classics means forming habits of careful re- 
flection, fine analysis, and measured reasoning. 
After two years of discussions and deliberations, without warn- 
ing or further consultation, M. Bérard sent the Reform Decree 
on May 3, 1923, to the President of the Republic for his ap-   
 
-P-A-G-E-453
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 439 
proval and signature. M. Millerand signed the decree, and the 
Reform of 1923 became a law. The most important articles of 
the decree follow: 
Article 1: Secondary Education comprises a unity of studies 
covering a period of seven years. It follows the course of 
elementary primary studies instituted by Article One of 
the law of March 28, 1882. 
Article 2: All pupils will follow the same programme of studies 
during the first four years. 
Independently of other studies in common, Latin is ob- 
ligatory during the first four years (Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, 
and Third Forms) and Greek during the last two years 
(Fourth and Third Forms). 
Article 3: In the Second and First Forms, pupils will have a 
choice between a Classical Course and a Modern Course. 
In the Classical Course, Latin will be obligatory and Greek 
optional. . . . The hours assigned to the study of Greek 
will be devoted to French and the modern languages, by 
those who do not continue their Greek studies. 
In the Modern Course, Latin and Greek are replaced by 
a more advanced study of French and a second modern 
language. 
Article 4: From the Sixth Form to the end of the First Form, 
the science programmes and the hours assigned to science 
studies are the same for all students. 
Article 5: The Philosophy Class and the Mathematics Class 
are open to all students who have completed the First Class 
irrespective of their selection of courses (Classical or 
Modern). 
Article 6: The Baccalaureate Degrees are under the control of 
Secondary Education, 
At the time of registration for the first part of the bac- 
calaureate examinations, every candidate must furnish proof 
of having satisfactorily completed the common programme 
of classic studies, by showing that he has passed a special 
examination consisting of two written tests, one in Latin, 
the other in Greek... . 
Article'9: The present decree will be in force on October 1, 
1923, and will apply to those pupils who enter the Sixth 
form except in so far as certain conditions of admission are 
covered by Article Seven... . 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  440 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Article 11: The decree of May 31, 1902, relative to the sec- 
ondary school Course of Study is abrogated except in so far 
as it applies to the pupils who at the present time are pur- 
suing studies in accordance with this decree. 
The Reform Decree of 1923 is in force, but the “eternal con- 
troversy” is far from ended.t The experience of France ought 
to be a notable lesson to American secondary education. Our 
classical Latin grammar schools of the colonial period yielded 
to the private academies of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- 
turies, and these academies were in turn replaced by the public 
high schools of to-day. The controversy between classicists and 
modernists has often been a bitter one in the various phases of 
the development of secondary education in the United States. 
Nothing seems to indicate a cessation of “hostilities.” The 
classicists for the time being have lost some of their ancient pres- 
tige, but they will undoubtedly return to the “combat.” 
Language selfishness and language jealousies must cease in 
order that we may be spared a renewal of wearisome language 
controversies. Political, economic, industrial, and social pro- 
gress demand, from time to time corresponding revisions of 
studies, but American education must not be periodically revo- 
lutionized at the will of one-minded specialists. The writer is 
a special pleader for all foreign languages, ancient and modern, 
but not for foreign languages for all. He has little sympathy 
with the language specialist who spares no efforts to destroy a 
“rival” language in order to establish his own as a prescribed 
“master” study. There are pupils who ought to be encouraged 
to study the ancient languages; there are likewise pupils who 
ought not to be deterred from taking up modern literatures; there 
are others who ought never to be allowed to take up either. A 
modern secondary curriculum ought to be flexible enough to cover 
these three types. A modern system of varied selective offerings 
ought to leave the choice of languages to pupils and parents; 
schools have yet to devise effective means of deciding what pupils 
shall not pursue linguistic studies. 
All foreign languages are an essential part of cultural dis- 
ciplines. There are modern as well as ancient humanities. The 
languages and literatures of Greece and Rome bequeath to us 
ancient culture, precision of thought, and perfection of form; 
*M. Bérard’s successor, M. Frangois-Albert, has already (1924) dropped 
the requirement in Latin and Greek. (W. L. U.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
  
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 441 
modern languages and literatures trace for us the story of the 
creative thought that has controlled, in each modern national 
group, the progress of civilization toward the truth. Surely this 
general distinction between the two disciplines cannot account 
for their hostility. The humanities, ancient and modern, have 
their place side by side in a modern curriculum. Bitterness and 
discord within these fields should be replaced by complete under- 
standing and codperation. These studies have well-defined lin- 
guistic, disciplinary, vocational, social, and cultural aims and 
values. Sciences, mathematical, physical, political, or moral, are 
not au fond opposed to language studies. The real enemy of 
humanistic culture in the United States is a narrow, intolerant, 
patriotic chauvinism which sees no inspiration in foreign (an- 
cient or modern) contributions to progress and to civilization. 
Let us beware of substitute “get-culture-quick” schemes. “New” 
culture is a menace. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN EUROPEAN SYSTEMS * 
By I. L. Kanpe, 
One of the anomalous features of the American system of 
education, organized though it may be for the democratic pur- 
pose of providing opportunities for all, is the absence of variety 
and elasticity. The elementary school retains its pupils up to 
the age of fourteen; without a flexible system of promotion each 
boy and girl is expected to pass through one grade in a year. Good, 
bad, or indifferent, few manage to reach the high school before 
the age of fourteen. For many pupils this system must mean 
mental retardation, since the progress is based on the speed of 
the average. The elementary school curriculum could probably 
be completed by many pupils at the age of twelve or thirteen. 
The system has another inherent weakness. By postponing the 
age for beginning secondary education or, more generally, the 
time for differentiation, the American boys and girls at the age 
of eighteen or nineteen are at least two, if not more, years behind 
the European boys and girls in intellectual attainments. 
In the accompanying study it is not intended to argue for the 
introduction of any foreign system. . An attempt will be made to 
indicate what provisions are made for differentiation of the cur- 
riculum, the age at which these opportunities are offered, and the

organization of courses to meet the needs of pupils who will nec- 
essarily leave school at the age of fifteen or sixteen. Finally, the 
movements, based partly on the American experiment in educa- 
tional democracy, partly as a conscious desire to offer an all- 
round curriculum for pupils who cannot remain at school beyond 
their sixteenth birthday, will be considered as they are taking 
place in England and Germany. 
German middle schools. The German school system is or- 
ganized on a horizontal basis; the elementary and secondary 
schools form two separate compartments running parallel for a 
number of years. The boy who wishes to enjoy a secondary edu- 
cation must enter a secondary school at the age of nine or not 
much later. In Prussia the result is that hardly more than one 
boy in ten thousand passes on the completion of an elementary 
school to a secondary school. With this obvious fact in mind 
there is a tendency to neglect the intermediate or middle school, 
an institution whose appeal is to a social class a little lower than 
that which attends the secondary schools. It corresponds in 
general to the French and English Higher Elementary School. 
Established originally under the Allgemeine Bestimmungen of 
1872, the middle school was reorganized in 1910 on the following 
grounds: 
“The development in the fields of handicrafts, art industries, 
commerce and industry demands an extended preparation of boys 
and girls for these occupations. In connection with this the need 
is becoming pronounced of a suitable preparation for several 
intermediate positions in the administrative services of the state 
and municipalities as well as in the larger industrial and business 
concerns. 
“These demands the elementary school, however well devel- 
oped, can meet only in a slight degree owing to the difficulties 
involved by its compulsory character. The aims of the higher 
school, on the other hand, are directed to intellectual ends, so 
that this school is also unable to meet the situation satisfactorily. 
Hence there arises the need of an institution intermediate between 
the elementary and the higher school which, while avoiding even 
the appearance of scholarly pursuits, adjusts the pupils to their 
environment and enables them to find themselves in their future 
careers. The middle school as provided under the decree of Octo- 
ber 15, 1872, can no longer serve this end. The course of study 
is organized on a basis of six progressive classes, and its require-  
-P-A-G-E-457
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 443 
ments do not pay sufficient attention to practical life—it can, 
accordingly, no longer satisfy the educational demands of the 
present. Where these are suitably recognized, the middle school 
has practically developed into an organization with nine classes, 
because only in this manner can it satisfy its legitimate task. 
“The scope of this type of school is increased by the extension 
of school attendance by one year and the consequent greater 
maturity of the pupils. The significance of this year for the in- 
tellectual development as well as the moral training and strength- 
ening of the youth cannot easily be exaggerated. The effective- 
ness of the extended school period is still further promoted by 
smaller classes, a greater wealth of teaching equipment and home 
environment generally more favorable for home studies.”’* 
The middle school is organized on a nine-year basis, the first 
three of which may be given in an ordinary elementary school. 
Pupils may thus be transferred to the middle school proper at 
the age of nine and are expected to remain until they reach the 
age of fifteen. Tuition fees are charged but are lower than in 
the secondary schools. In 1913 there were 62 such schools in 
Prussia. 
The curriculum in these schools includes religion, German, 
history, geography, arithmetic with bookkeeping in the last year, 
nature study, writing, drawing, singing, handwork (gardening and 
domestic subjects), physical training and one foreign language 
(French or English), begun at the age of ten or eleven. A second 
language may be offered to pupils of ability with the approval of 
the local authorities. When this is permitted, the language is 
studied during the last three years of the course. Handwork is 
compulsory for boys and girls—gardening for both, housekeeping 
for girls. Maximum and minimum hours are assigned for lan- 
guages, mathematics, nature study, and drawing; the remaining 
subjects may be organized to suit local needs or be given a com- 
mercial or industrial bias. 
This type of school is not popular with teachers or with parents. 
The teachers of the elementary schools object that the middle 
school attracts the brighter pupils who cannot afford to attend a 
secondary school. The parents, on the other hand, feel that, if 
the children are retained in school until the age of fifteen, they ~ 
should be granted the same privileges as pupils who attend the 
first six years of a secondary school up to the same age. As a

concession the one-year military privilege is granted to boys who 
graduate from the middle school and in addition pass an examina- 
tion which includes two foreign languages. Certain positions in 
the civil service also have been opened to pupils from these 
schools. 
It may be objected that this type of school is a concession 
to the class spirit or that the trades and continuation schools af- 
ford a better training. The point to be noted, however, for Ameri- 
can practise is the attempt to organize an institutional type that 
on the one hand is not elementary and on the other is not sec- 
ondary, that is intended to give an all-round general course of 
a prevocational character to boys and girls who intend to enter 
the vocations in intermediate positions at about the age of fifteen. 
The course is not merely a broken morsel of a secondary course; 
it is not academic in intent; and it is not definitely vocational. 
It supplies a course for those whose schooling must close at the 
age of fifteen. The objection that the course begins at the age of 
nine while differentiation in this country would not begin before 
twelve is not valid. On closer examination it will probably be 
found that the elementary schools of this country offer in gen- 
eral as rich a curriculum as the middle schools with the excep- 
tion of bookkeeping and the modern language and some introduc- 
tion to the vocations. Bookkeeping is postponed to the last year; 
the modern language is taught for only four years. It would prob- 
ably not be difficult to offer a similar type of work in a junior 
high school. 
Secondary Education for Girls in Germany. The system of 
secondary education for girls was reorganized in Prussia in 1908 
on the basis of a ten-year course beginning at the age of six. 
The first three years are elementary and preparatory. Secondary 
education proper begins at the age of nine and is continued up 
to the age of sixteen, when the majority of pupils leave school. 
Specialization in courses corresponding to the secondary schools 
for boys is provided, but is not pertinent here. With the ex- 
ception that French is begun at the age of nine the first three 
years of the general course do not differ from that of good ele- 
mentary schools in this country. The major part of the secondary 
work falls within the period from twelve to sixteen—the period 
corresponding broadly to the junior high school. In this period 
English is added and the time devoted to natural science is in- 
creased; the remainder of the curriculum includes religion, Ger-
-P-A-G-E-459
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 445 
man, history and art history, geography, arithmetic and mathe- 
matics, drawing, singing, gymnastics and needlework (optional), 
with the major amount of the time given to languages. Pupils 
who desire to specialize in the classical or semi-classical courses, 
which continue up to the age of nineteen, begin Latin at the age 
of thirteen; those who wish to emphasize foreign languages and 
sciences commence their specialization one year later and also 
continue up to nineteen. 
Here again the point to which it is desired to draw attention is 
not the organization of a secondary school type, but of an educa- 
tional opportunity that goes beyond the elementary school sub- 
jects, with the major part of the differentiation between the ages 
of twelve and sixteen. Those pupils who leave at the latter age 
have completed an all-round course; they do not merely drop out 
with a large number of straggling and unfinished subjects behind 
them. This secondary course may be used as the basis either of a 
general course of two years in practical arts for women, given in 
the Women’s School (Frauenschule), or of a professional course 
for elementary school teachers of four years’ duration (Lehrer- 
innenseminar). ‘The other opportunities for specialization for the 
few who intend to prepare for the universities have been men- 
tioned above. The essential contribution of the general sec- 
ondary course is the recognition of the fact that most girls will 
leave school at the age of sixteen. 
German “Reform Schools.’ The German reform schools 
(Reformschulen) of the Frankfort and Altona types are of con- 
siderable importance in any discussion of the reorganization of the 
American high school. While the latter represents a movement 
for earlier differentiation of educational opportunities, the former 
is an attempt to postpone the prevailing practise of imposing the 
choice of a career at the age of nine. Both movements prac- 
tically coincide in making the age of twelve the crucial point. 
Under the general secondary school system which includes the 
Gymnasium, Realgymnasium, Oberrealschule, and Realschule, a 
boy is compelled to make his choice of a school at the age of 
nine, and this choice practically prevents him from transferring 
to another type in case of failure. The reform plan involves the 
organization of a common basis for all the schools beginning at 
the age of nine. At this stage French is begun; the remainder 
of the curriculum for the first three years corresponds to that of 
an elementary school in this country. The time of differentia- 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
  446 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tion is postponed to the age of twelve, the period at which the 
junior high school would begin. At this time Latin or English 
is begun; sciences follow later in the course on a foundation of 
nature study. For the majority of pupils, no matter what type 
of course or school they have chosen, the goal is the one-year 
military service privilege. This is granted on the successful com- 
pletion of six years in a secondary school. In the schools or- 
ganized on the reform plan this means that the privilege may be 
obtained three years after the period of differentiation, or nor- 
mally at the age of fifteen or sixteen. In other words the bulk of 
the secondary school work proper falls between the ages of 
twelve and fifteen—the junior high school period. Not only does 
the reform school postpone the date of final choice, but under 
a more democratic system it would facilitate the transfer of 
pupils from the elementary to the secondary school at the age of 
twelve. A discussion of the revived movement for the Einheits- 
schule will indicate the contribution made by the reform school 
to democracy in education. The Einheitsschule involves only 
the postponement of French to the age of twelve to throw sec- 
ondary school opportunities open to all. Still one other contri- 
bution to educational thought made by the reform school must 
be mentioned. The experiment has proved that by better methods 
of instruction the attainments in Latin expected of a pupil from 
the Gymnasium at the close of nine years’ study can be reached 
in six, while the six years’ work in Greek in the Gymnasium is 
accomplished in four years. The same results are achieved with 
English; in the Realgymnasium this language is studied for six 
years, while only four years are required to cover the ground in 
the reform school of the same type. 
Emphasis must again be placed not on the organization here 
discussed, but on the general principle. If a traditional and con- 
servative system like that of Germany can make a successful ex- 
periment in affording a well-rounded course to pupils who leave 
school at the age of fifteen, and under the reform plan can give 
the bulk of this work in the last three years of the course, a re- 
organization of the American high school to begin at the age of 
twelve and offering a far better variety of opportunities suggested 
not only by sounder psychological principles, but also by the 
social needs of a democracy should be within easy reach of ac- 
complishment. 
The common school movement in Germany. The most recent
-P-A-G-E-461
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 447 
movement in German educational thought is the agitation for the 
Einheitsschule. This is a revival of a movement that had its 
rise in the revolutionary period of 1848, when it met the fate of 
all other liberal propaganda. It came to the surface again in 
1870-71, but without effect. In its origin the proposal was to 
‘establish a uniform system on the foundation of a common ele- 
mentary school, articulating at the age of twelve with the sec- 
ondary schools. About 1885 the movement took another turn 
and was confined for a few years to a desire to reorganize the 
secondary schools on the plan of the cosmopolitan high school— 
a common foundation with differentiation at thirteen or fourteen. 
This plan was incorporated in the Reformschule which has al- 
ready been considered. 
The present movement, however, is a revival of the original 
idea—a common elementary foundation with differentiation at 
the age of twelve. The agitation is frankly to abolish the claims 
of caste and privilege and to throw open educational opportunities 
to all in order to repair the intellectual losses of the war. The 
only salvation for the future is to draw on the intellectual re- 
serve of the people. Ability and talent must be encouraged 
wherever it is found, and every boy must find the place that is 
best suited to his needs and capacity. The future school must 
provide not an easy but an unobstructed road. The Einheits- 
schule must be established to afford the best opportunity for all 
to codperate in promoting the great aims of the German culture 
state. The national unity aroused by the war must be made the 
basis of the educational reorganization of the future. To pre- 
serve the unity of party, class and sect all must sit upon the 
same school bench. The Einheitsschule implies a unified school 
system branching out into various school types when the needs 
for further culture and the demands of practical life appear. 
The logical consequence of the establishment of the Einheits- 
schule would be the abolition of the preparatory schools (Vor- 
schulen). The disappearance of this class-school would mean 
a saving in fees for three years, while pupils would not be com- 
pelled to select a secondary school until the age of twelve, at 
which time they would have exhibited some capacity or bent. 
The present system of an early choice of a secondary school type 
frequently leads to retardation in the middle classes of the sec- 
ondary schools. Too many pupils who have no business to be 
there attend the secondary schools. If selection were postponed
-P-A-G-E-462
  448 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
to the age of twelve, there would be greater likelihood or a cor- 
rect choice. The Einheitsschule implies a common foundation 
on the basis of a thorough education in the mother tongue. Such 
an institution would secure the basis of national and social unity 
and would satisfy the social and cultural demands of the laboring 
classes. True nationalism can only be fostered by a national 
system of education, which would absorb the laboring classes 
into the political and social system to renew the life of the nation. 
The aim of the Hinheitsschule, however, should not be merely to 
enable a few individuals to reach the top, but to give each indi- 
vidual the opportunity of being placed in the position best suited 
to his ability without distinction of class. 
Detailed plans of organization are not yet suggested, but 
tendencies may be surmised. The present types of secondary 
courses—literary, linguistic and scientific—would be retained, 
but the beginning of specialization would be postponed. In ad- 
dition it is recommended that a three-year course based entirely 
on German should be offered, and that trade schools should be 
recognized as of secondary grade and should be permitted to lead 
to the privilege of the one-year military service. 
The movement involves four principles: (1) The democra- 
tization of education; (2) the redefinition of the meaning of a 
liberal education; (3) the postponement of specialization in sec- 
ondary school subjects to the age of twelve; and (4) the pro- 
vision of differentiated courses, some for those who must leave at 
the age of fifteen, others for those who can complete a nine-year 
course or desire to continue to the universities. A summary of 
the movement is contained in the suggestion that the question 
for the artisan is not “How can I raise my son in the social scale 
through education?” but “How can I secure thorough education 
for my class, or rather the able men in it, suitable influence in 
the administration of the state and of the community, and in 
industry, commerce and transport, and how can I put an end 
to privileges that are socially detrimental?” 
French higher elementary schools. Although the French sec- 
ondary schools are practically closed to the pupils who are unable 
to afford the requisite tuition fees, other educational facilities are 
offered to them for enjoying an education reaching beyond the 
scope of the elementary schools. These are provided in the 
higher elementary schools (écoles primaires supérieures) organized 
originally in 1893 and reconstructed in 1909. In character these
-P-A-G-E-463
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 449 
institutions correspond almost exactly to the proposed junior high 
schools, perhaps more closely than any other foreign institution. 
Boys and girls are admitted to the higher elementary school 
after completing the elementary school course and obtaining the 
certificate of primary studies for which they can present them- 
selves at the age of twelve. The duration of the course in the 
higher elementary school is two or three years; always three 
years in a fully reorganized school. The three-year courses pro- 
vide a common curriculum for all pupils in the first year and then 
differentiate into general, industrial, commercial and agricultural 
courses and household arts for girls. But these schools are not 
vocational. In the words of M. Gasquet, director of elementary 
education, “We do not aim to train apprentices or specialists 
ready for immediate employment in commerce and industry. The 
task of our schools is to help pupils to know themselves, to give 
them a taste for manual work, to make them familiar with the 
essential equipment of all occupations; then they should prepare 
them by a strict theoretical education which should never lose 
contact with the practical and after an indispensable period in 
an industrial (or commercial or agricultural) concern to become 
the progressive non-commissioned officers in industry, capable of 
adapting themselves to the diverse and ever-changing needs of 
manufacture.” Opportunities are offered to those who complete 
the general course to transfer to the second cycle of a secondary 
school; this, together with an increasingly flexible curriculum in 
the secondary schools, is making for the greater democratization 
of higher education. 
The subjects of instruction common to all pupils in all the 
courses are: Morals; civics; French language and literature; 
modern foreign languages; national history and outlines of gen- 
eral history; geography of France and the colonies, and a gen- 
eral outline of geography; practical arithmetic, speed in number- 
ing, algebra and geometry; outlines of chemistry, physics and nat- 
ural sciences; hygiene; writing; design and modeling; singing; 
gymnastics and military training (for boys). 
The special interests cover: Outlines of political economy and 
every-day law; theory and practise of subjects relating to indus- 
try, commerce and agriculture such as mechanics, technology, in- 
dustrial chemistry, industrial electricity, agriculture, agricultural 
chemistry, wares, transportation and customs; stenography and 
typewriting, accounting and bookkeeping; geometrical and artis-

tic design and modeling; workshop bind laboratory practise, agri- 
culture and horticulture for boys; and care of infants, household 
management, cooking, gardening, farming, care of linen, and dress- 
making for girls. : 
Fees are charged in these schools, many of which are boarding 
schools, but the state offers scholarships covering the board, or 
maintenance, or expenses of a lodging where there are no boarding 
facilities in the school. The scholarships are granted on a com- 
petitive examination, and the home conditions are also taken into 
consideration. Grants are also made for clothing. At the close 
of the course pupils who have graduated and are between the 
ages of sixteen and eighteen are eligible for traveling scholar- 
ships, granted on a competitive examination. The scholarships 
are offered to pupils who intend to pursue an industrial or a com- 
mercial career, to enable them to improve their command of a 
foreign language. The scholarships were ordinarily held in Eng- 
land or Germany, sometimes in Spain or Italy. 
The completion of a course in a full higher elementary school 
is marked by an examination for the certificate of higher ele- 
mentary studies. Candidates must have attained their fifteenth 
birthday on the last day of the year in which they present them- 
selves for the examination. The examination is written, oral and 
practical. Five certificates are granted in the general, agricul- 
tural, industrial, commercial, and household arts courses. Gradu- 
ates in the general course have the privilege of proceeding to 
a secondary school, where they may be admitted to the second 
cycle, while others enter the lower branches of the civil service. 
French secondary school for boys. The French secondary 
schools (/ycées and colléges) are limited to those pupils who can 
afford to pay the high fees. Ordinarily few pupils pass from the 
elementary to the secondary schools, and a small percentage are 
assisted by scholarships. The complete secondary course is or- 
ganized on the basis of seven years, beginning at the age of eleven, 
the preparatory courses from the age of six up to eleven are ele- 
mentary in character, with the exception that modern languages 
are begun and taught for three years before the secondary course 
proper commences. Since the time allotted to the subjects is 
small (2 week hours for three years), and since as a rule the sub- 
jects are poorly taught, this difference may practically be elim- 
inated. The secondary course proper is begun usually at the age 
of eleven.
-P-A-G-E-465
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 451 
In order to provide flexibility the secondary course is divided 
into two cycles—one for four years and the other of three years. 
For purposes of the present study the first cycle only—taking 
pupils from the age of eleven to fifteen—is of interest. - Two 
differentiated courses are offered in the first cycle—the Latin- 
modern language course and the modern language-scientific course. 
The common subjects of both courses are: French, ethics, mod- 
ern languages, history and geography, arithmetic and mathe- 
matics, and natural science. The first course lays emphasis on 
Latin and Greek, which may be added in the third year; the 
second course stresses modern language and sciences. 
At the close of the four years pupils who desire to continue in 
the secondary school have the further choice of four courses— 
classical, Latin-modern languages; Latin-science, science-modern 
language, pursued for two years, and followed by one year of 
specialization in the class/of philosophy or mathematics. The 
significance of the division in two cycles, however, is that pupils 
who desire to leave on the completion of the first cycle may do 
so and may obtain on the basis of their record and the recom- 
mendation of their teachers a certificate of secondary studies of 
the first degree. Farrington sums up the significance of this 
opportunity of leaving at the age of fifteen, as follows:? The 
close of the first cycle ‘forms a natural break just about midway 
of the course and rounds out a complete though elementary circle 
of intellectual achievement. If the pupil is compelled to drop out 
there he can do so without feeling that he is leaving a piece of 
work half done. He can carry away with him a definite unity 
of ideas. He has covered in cursory fashion the whole range of 
the national literature, paying considerable attention to the classic 
writers; he has studied from one to three foreign languages, ac- 
cording to the course he has selected, for from two to four or more 
years; he has completed elementary arithmetic, with perhaps 
some more advanced mathematics; he has been introduced to 
scientific lore; he has studied the geography of the whole world; 
he is familiar with the great movements of history from the very 
beginning down to 1889; and he has had two years of elementary 
moral instruction, introduced to supply the place of the former 
religious teaching; in other words, he has touched practically all 
the subjects of secondary school study.” 
The emphasis must here be placed not so much on the differen-

tiation of courses, for since they are mainly literary they cannot 
serve as a model for American practise, but on the definite recog- 
nition that a considerable percentage of pupils do drop out from 
the secondary schools around the age of fifteen. It is mainly with 
these in view that the seven-year course was in 1902 divided into 
two well-marked courses, offering those who desired to leave the 
opportunity of completing a definite course, and to others the op- 
portunity of specializing in the second cycle. This practise obvi- 
ates the patent evil of English and American secondary school sys- 
tems in which pupils leave when and where they please without 
anything but a mass of uncodrdinated, unrelated and undigested 
subjects rather than on the completion of a well-marked and 
rounded-out stage in the secondary school career. 
French secondary education of girls. The system of secondary 
education of girls in France bears a closer resemblance to the de- 
sired organization of the junior high school than the system for 
boys. But like the boys’ secondary system the secondary girls’ 
schools (/ycées and colléges) are also divided into two cycles. 
Secondary education for girls begins a year later than for boys, 
that is, at the age of twelve. A preparatory course of four years, 
beginning at the age of eight, is offered and includes two and a 
half week hours of modern languages. Otherwise the preparatory 
course is elementary in character and includes French, history 
and geography, arithmetic, nature study and drawing. Secondary 
education proper begins at the age of twelve and lasts five years, 
divided into two cycles of three and two years. The majority 
of the girls leave school on completing the first cycle at the age of 
fifteen. The certificate of secondary studies may be obtained 
at the end of this course, representing the completion of a defi- 
nitely rounded-out general cultural course. The program of stud- 
ies covers the following subjects: Ethics, French language and 
literature, modern language, history and geography, mathematics, 
natural history, physics and chemistry, domestic economy and 
hygiene, sewing, drawing, singing and gymnastics. 
The second cycle of two years includes the following required 
subjects: Ethics, psychology applied to ethics and education, 
French language and literature, ancient literature in translation, 
modern foreign literature in translation, modern languages, his- 
tory, geography, mathematics, common law, physics and chem- 
istry, animal and vegetable anatomy, and physiology and hygiene. 
In addition, the following optional subjects are offered: Mathe- 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 453 
matics, additional modern language, sewing, drawing and singing, 
and gymnastics. 
Intermediate education in England. Within the past few years 
a new type of school, offering a course beyond that of the ele- 
mentary schools to pupils who cannot remain at school beyond 
the age of fifteen, has been established since 1911 in London, 
Manchester, and other cities. This is an attempt to supersede 
the higher elementary schools for which the Board of Education 
prescribed an inelastic curriculum that could not be adapted to 
local needs. The London County Council in establishing the 
central schools declared their object to be the provision for the 
boy or girl of “the best possible equipment for entering upon the 
industrial and commercial world as soon as he leaves school which 
at the same time qualifies him to enter upon a special course of 
training for some particular industry at a polytechnic or similar 
institution if he desires to continue his education further.” 
Elasticity and adaptation to local needs are the guiding prin- 
ciples in the organization of the central school, and the school 
principals enjoy considerable freedom in framing the curriculum 
of their schools. The pupils for the central schools are selected 
by competitive examination between the ages of eleven and twelve. 
In ability these pupils come next to those who are successful in 
obtaining scholarships to secondary schools. Each central school 
draws upon about 18 to 20 contributory schools. The complaint 
is, of course, met that the elementary schools are denuded of 
pupils of ability, without recognizing that these pupils deserve 
every possible opportunity for educational advancement. 
The central schools are organized with a commercial or an in- 
dustrial bias, or both. Generally the nature of the bias is de- 
termined by the character of the district in which the school 
is situated. Where a school is organized on both commercial and 
industrial lines, the wishes of the parents, and, if possible, the 
bent of the pupils, are considered in determining the choice of a 
course. In some cases the determining factor is the accommoda- 
tion of the school. Of the two courses, the commercial, probably 
because the requirements are more obvious and because a tra- 
dition has already been established, is the more definite and ob- 
jective. The industrial courses, for boys at any rate, are more 
generalized and aim at training in alertness and initiative rather 
than special training for any particular occupation. And, indeed, 
special preparation in an area like London, where the industries
-P-A-G-E-468
454 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
are gradually moving away, would offer a problem of unsur- 
mountable difficulty, even if it were desirable. As a matter of 
fact many boys who have passed through an industrial course, 
enter warehouses and offices. This problem is not surrounded 
with such difficulties in the case of girls’ schools, for here the in- 
dustrial courses combine preparation for the home with general 
training in needlework and dressmaking. 
The commercial courses in schools or departments with a com- 
mercial bias are so framed that scholars are able to enter business 
houses without any further preparation. The minimum require- 
ments as laid down in the Elementary Schools Handbook of the 
London County Council are as follows: 
(1) At least four hours a week must be given to a modern 
language during the whole of the four years’ course. 
(2) Not less than two hours a week must be given to labora- 
tory work in experimental science during the first and second 
years of the course, and, if thought desirable, this instruction may 
be continued during the third and fourth years. 
(3) At least two hours a week must be given to drawing, in- 
cluding scale drawing throughout the whole of the course. 
(4) In the case of boys, one session a week must be given to 
handicraft during the first and second years. 
(5) In the case of girls, one session a week must be given to 
domestic economy during the first three years of the course, but 
its continuance in the fourth year is optional. 
(6) Not less than one and a half hours a week must be given 
to shorthand as an optional subject in the third and fourth years. 
(7) Not less than one hour a week must be given to the prin- 
ciples of bookkeeping during the third and fourth years as an 
optional subject. 
(8) Where there is sufficient demand, an optional out-of- 
school class in typewriting must be held for one hour a day .. . 
to be attended only by third and fourth year pupils. 
In addition to the above, the ordinary school subjects—Scrip- 
ture, English, history, geography, mathematics, singing, and phy- 
sical exercises—are also included. Where both commercial and 
industrial courses are offered in the same school, the curriculum, 
with the exception of the modern language, is the same for both 
groups in the first two years, the bifurcation taking place at the 
beginning of the third year. 
It would be impossible to enter into details of the curriculum, 
for the standard is found to vary from school to school, and for 
 
-P-A-G-E-469
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 455 
comparative purposes an outline will be of greater service. As 
compared with the ordinary elementary schools, it may be said in 
general that the curriculum of the central schools, in spite of the 
additional subjects, is richer in content, and since the classes are 
smaller, a certain improvement in the methods of instruction can 
be observed. Training in initiative and in habits of independent 
working and thinking is more successful. The teachers are free 
from the bad practice of lecturing, while the pupils show greater 
ability to work by themselves. It is not forgotten that the pupils 
of the central schools are selected, nor that as a rule the teachers 
have higher qualifications (although poor teachers are to be found 
here too), but it is a fact that here are schools which are attempt- 
ing to realize the standards of the newer pedagogy. Let it, how- 
ever, not be inferred that the curriculum is beyond criticism or 
that the methods of instruction are always unimpeachable. There 
are schools the head teachers of which feel that the old practise 
of working for examinations according to the scheme of some out- 
side examining body cannot be improved upon, or who hold that 
a broad, general preparation for the career of the office or the 
home does not possess educational elements. 
In those schools or departments which have been organized 
with an industrial bias the object is perhaps somewhat less well 
defined than where the commercial bias has been adopted. Here 
it is clearly impossible to provide the special preparation of the 
type given in a trade school or polytechnic. The aim, as it is 
indicated by the headmaster of the Monnow Road school for 
boys and indorsed by other headmasters, is “to produce an intelli- 
gent and alert boy, accurate and skilful of hand, capable of con- 
tinuous effort, and less book taught.” The curriculum is accord- 
ingly organized to train industrial intelligence rather than to 
impart vocational skill. The aim in the girls’ schools with an 
industrial bias is somewhat more specific, and, besides affording a 
preparation for the home, enables the pupils to secure employ- 
ment in dressmaking, needlework, and millinery establishments. 
The minimum requirements for central schools with an indus- 
trial bias or a department with such a bias are as follows: 
(i) Not less than ro and not more than 12 hours per week 
must be given to practical work during the whole of the four 
years’ course. The practical work in the case of boys shall con- 
sist of science (including mensuration), drawing, clay-modeling, 
wood and metal work, and, in special circumstances, leather work 
and printing or other approved subjects; and in the case of girls it 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
456 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
shall consist of elementary science, domestic economy, drawing, 
practical needlework, or other approved subjects. 
(ii) Instruction in a modern foreign language may, in special 
circumstances, be given, but the minimum of three hours a week 
to be devoted to instruction in the subject . . . must be ob- 
served. 
Work of similar character is being done in other cities. A 
study of the elementary schools of England carries the conviction 
that the majority of pupils after the age of twelve profit by some 
differentiation of causes suited to their needs and abilities. The 
Act of 1918 provides both for the establishment of advanced 
instruction for pupils who remain in the last two grades of ele- 
mentary schools and for the extensive organization of central 
schools. As things are at present the child of wealthy parents, 
no matter what his intellectual capacity may be, is admitted to 
the secondary schools, where he fritters away his own time and in 
most cases public money as well, while a large percentage of less 
fortunate boys and girls drop out of the elementary schools with- 
out any life preparation whatever. Under a more democratic 
system the central schools would be classed with secondary schools. 
Many of the central schools, because the principals are conscious 
of a definite purpose, are far more alert than the traditional sec- 
ondary schools. The central schools are conscious of this aim— 
the completion of an all-round four-year course; the secondary 
schools merely display a variegated program of courses and are 
not much concerned either with the number of pupils that com- 
plete the course of their choice nor with the time consumed in 
the process. 
English secondary education. The situation in England with 
reference to the adequate education of boys and girls who can 
remain in school only up to the age of fifteen is almost the same 
as in this country, with the exception that pupils of ability may 
complete the elementary course and obtain scholarships at about 
the age of twelve, which take them to the secondary schools. 
These schools, however, are not organized with the intention of 
meeting the needs of the pupils under consideration. In gen- 
eral, their aim is to prepare boys and girls for the universities or 
at any rate for the entrance examinations to the universities. 
They are, in other words, not self-contained; their aim lies out- 
side of and beyond the secondary schools. A few schools at- 
tempt to provide specialized courses in commerce and technical  
-P-A-G-E-471
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 457 
subjects, but these provisions are inadequate, and will be met by 
an increase of junior and senior technical and commercial schools, 
articulated ultimately with the university courses in these special 
branches. The basis of organization is literary; pupils may begin 
to specialize either in classics or modern languages, and in some 
schools in science. 
The majority of pupils leave at least two years before com- 
pleting the course offered by the schools. They have a smattering 
of a number of subjects without any definite command of a 
single one. It is obvious that with conditions as they are the situ- 
ation should be faced and a general all-round and purposeful train- 
ing should be given to suit the needs of those who must leave at 
about the age of sixteen. The Board of Education requires that 
a secondary school to be recognized for purposes of the state 
grant “must offer to its pupils a progressive course of general 
education . . . of a kind and amount suitable for pupils of an 
age range as wide as from 12 to 17.” The curriculum of such 
schools must provide instruction in the English language and 
literature, at least one foreign language, geography, history, 
mathematics, science and drawing, with organized games, physical 
exercises, manual instruction and singing. Girls’ schools must 
provide for practical instruction in needlework, cookery, laundry 
work, housekeeping and household hygiene. It must be noted 
that the Board simply considers secondary education in terms of 
subjects taught rather than in terms of purpose suited to the 
needs of the pupils. It implies that pupils while they are at school 
shall take some or all of these subjects but provides no machinery 
for the organization of courses adapted to the conditions men- 
tioned above. The schools exist for the benefit of the few who 
will continue to the end and probably pass on to the universities. 
With reference to the proper age for differentiation it is sig- 
nificant that the tendency is to encourage the transfer of the more 
gifted pupils from the elementary to the secondary schools be- 
tween the ages of eleven and twelve. In the case of fee-paying 
pupils the practise has grown up of discouraging late entrance 
into secondary schools by increasing the fees with age. Scholar- 
ships are as a rule offered to pupils between the ages of eleven 
and thirteen. Some education authorities add a percentage of 
marks for each month that a candidate is below the maximum age 
limit in order to discourage late entrance and incidentally depriv- 
ing those who develop late of their due opportunities.

The reform of secondary education in England. The most sig- 
nificant movement for the reform of English education after the 
war centers around secondary education. At present the element- 
ary and secondary school systems overlap, but the transfer from 
the one to the other is encouraged by means of scholarships and 
free tuition. The secondary schools, however, are not organized 
in such a way as to meet the needs of the majority of the pupils 
in attendance, with the result that they fail to hold them until 
the end of the courses provided. The new movement, as voiced 
in the Times Educational Supplement since 1915, demands a 
reorganization of the whole school system with elementary or 
preparatory education up to the age of eleven or twelve, and free 
universal education thereafter. The second part of this proposal 
involves the reconstruction of the secondary system so as to meet 
the requirements of the large number of pupils who can only 
remain at school until the age of fifteen or sixteen, and a revision 
of the meaning of liberal education. Side by side with these radi- 
cal proposals must be placed' the recommendations of a number of 
conservative bodies, which, while not advocating universal sec- 
ondary education, are thinking of it in terms of the pupils who 
will leave at the age of sixteen. 
The campaign was begun by the Times Educational Supplement 
in September, 1915. The arguments for reconstruction were that 
the elementary and secondary schools overlap, and economy de- 
mands dovetailing. The work of the elementary schools is good 
up to about the age of eleven; this should become the preparatory 
stage from which pupils should move forward to an intermediate 
school for a minimum of four years. “It is in the training of 
children between the ages of eleven and fourteen that the element- 
ary schools so largely fail. It is not the fault of the schools or 
the teachers. The teachers have never been trained to give inter- 
mediate or secondary training, and the result is that to the chil- 
dren between the ages in question there is given what Sir Joshua 
Fitch called a cul de sac education, something that leads no- 
whither. . . . We must have intermediate schools for all, pro- 
vided with teachers specially trained for intermediate or secondary 
schools teaching.” 
Returning to the subject in October, 1915, the Times ampli- 
fies this statement, ‘There are nearly half a million children be- 
tween the ages of twelve and fourteen who are receiving no edu- 
cation or no education worth having. Some of these are at school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-473
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 459 
but all are at work, work leading nowhither, at an age when moral 
and physical development are at stake. ...In our view the 
problem of the elimination of human waste and the multiplication 
of human efficiency can only be secured by a universal system of 
secondary education. . . . There should be, as there is to-day, 
preparatory education up to the age of eleven years . . . and 
from that age onward there should be in every school in the land 
compulsory secondary education for every child given by teachers 
who have received a secondary training, and, in ever-increasing 
numbers, a university training. . . . The primary school has failed 
lamentably in its dealing with children between the ages of eleven 
and fourteen; and it has failed because of the inherent defects 
of the primary ideal.” 
The article then proceeds to point out the distinction be- 
tween elementary and secondary education from the point of view 
of aim and content. ‘Elementary teaching cannot give an outfit 
for life. It is in its nature preparatory; and when it ceases to 
be preparatory it merely supplies uncorrelated knowledge and an 
education leading nowhither. On the other hand, secondary teach- 
ing has as its goal the power of reasoning about acquired knowl- 
edge and thus securing self-realization. The primary ideal is the 
heaping up of knowledge as an external property or possession; 
the secondary ideal is the assimilation of knowledge as part of 
the personality. The latter ideal gives an outfit for life, a wise, 
thoughtful, and productive people; the former gives us what we 
have got—a nation with two million children running to waste.” 
As described in the December issue the course of this inter- 
mediate school should be general in character, but suited to the 
different abilities of the pupils. Specialization is only to be pro- 
vided for on the completion of this course. “We claim that when 
once the child has had a thorough preparatory training—such a 
training up to the age of eleven as he has now—he shall have for 
four years a liberal training in a school that uses hand as well as 
brain for the acquisition of knowledge of himself and the world, 
and that then there shall at the age of fifteen be not merely bifur- 
cation, but branchings off in such directions as the experience of 
a skilled teacher during four years shows to be the direction for 
this or that child—for one group continued school life with special 
training in humanities, or in higher mathematics, or in applied 
science; for another, apprentice work in industrial or agricultural, 
or mercantile life, but with some hold still retained, some claim
-P-A-G-E-474
   
460 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
still, on the child’s daylight time till the seventeenth year is 
reached, if it be but two mornings or afternoons in the week.” 
The reference at the close is to the parallel movement for the 
establishment of compulsory day continuation schools for all who 
are not attending school between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. 
Briefly analyzed this education revolution advocated by the 
Times contemplates the reconstruction of the century-old secon- 
dary school systems in the interests of individual and national 
welfare. It involves a revision of the educational possibilities be- 
tween the ages of eleven and fifteen; it provides for an education 
more appropriate than the present as an outfit for life; and, fin- 
ally, it requires the employment of teachers with wider and 
broader training. The scheme aims to give the pupil not merely 
a better preparation for life, but one more suited to his own needs 
and abilities. At the same time the new school will not be cut off 
in a watertight compartment; it will be built up on the founda- 
tion of the elementary school and itself will form the starting- 
point for further specialized education. The pupil who will be 
compelled to leave at the age of fifteen or sixteen will feel that 
he has completed one course, but properly organized such a 
course should prompt him to seek for further training. 
It is difficult at present to discover to what extent the sug- 
gestions of the Times have met with approval. A large number 
of educational bodies have considered the reconstruction of Eng- 
lish education. Not one of these, however, appears to accept the 
recommendations of the Times, in toto, although a number wel- 
come the provision of free secondary education. There is unani- 
mous agreement that secondary education should begin at eleven 
or twelve and offer a general course of four years without speciali- 
zation. This reorganization was advocated among others by the 
Long Teachers’ Association, and the Workers’ Education Associa- 
tion, the Headmasters’ Association and the Education Reform 
Council, of which Sir Michael Sadler and Professor Gilbert Mur- 
ray were members. These associations represent the interests 
of the elementary and secondary profession, and of labor. There 
is general agreement that the minimum essentials of a four-year 
secondary course should cover English, history, geography, one 
foreign language, mathematics, science, drawing, music, hand- 
work and physical training. This plan does not provide ade- 
quately for the differentiation that is desirable in such a four- 
year course, but it is an advance on the present system which
-P-A-G-E-475
  FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 461 
neglects to take actual conditions into consideration. The Educa- 
tion Reform Council, without entering into any details, contem- 
plated the organization of middle departments in the elementary 
system for pupils from the ages of eleven to about fifteen to be 
linked up with a system of compulsory continuation schools re- 
quiring attendance up to the age of seventeen. The National 
Union of Teachers, representing about 100,000 t teachers_mainly 
in in elementary schools, recognizes that there is a ‘demand for a 
higher type df instruction than that of the elementary school for 
pupils who can stay up to fifteen. This demand should be met 
either by an improvement in the upper departments of the ele- 
mentary schools or by other schools of varying type. The Union 
considers it undesirable to specialize in the direction of a particular 
trade before the age of fourteen; such special training should be 
given in a trade school or in connection with workshops. The 
schools here under consideration should be for instruction of a 
general character with a special bias in the direction of industry 
or commerce and providing a broad equipment for life. 
The recent administrative regulations of the Board of Educa- 
tion recognize twelve as the suitable age for beginning secondary 
school work; the first four years are general in character and cul- 
minate at sixteen in an examination, success in which may ad- 
mit a candidate to the universities; this period is to be followed 
by specialization for two years in “advanced courses”—classics, 
modern languages, or science and mathematics—concluding with 
a second examination at about the age of eighteen. 
Whatever the outcome of the proposals for reform may be, the 
principles underlying them all are: (1) That educational differ- 
entiation for most pupils shall not begin before the age of eleven 
or twelve; (2) that at present the last years of the elementary 
school are wasteful; (3) that for the majority of pupils of secon- 
dary school age a course or choice of courses covering four years 
should be provided; (4) that such course shall-be general and 
not vocational in character; (5) that they should be planned to 
meet the needs of pupils who will leave school at the age of fifteen 
or sixteen; and (6) that intensive specialization should not be 
begun until after this period.

462 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ENGLISH SCHOOLS: THE EXPANSION oF SECONDARY EDUCA- 
TION IN ENGLAND * 
By J. L. Paton | 
The backwardness of England in secondary education was 
clearly illustrated by Lord Bryce’s Commission. No exact figures 
were available at that time. That fact in itself was a proof of our 
lack of system in this, the most important branch of national 
progress. But it was abundantly clear that the proportion of 
boys and girls receiving secondary education in England was 
painfully inadequate when compared with the number in any 
other European country that could claim to be progressive. The 
contrast was quite as marked, whether one took Germany and 
Switzerland on one hand, or Denmark and Norway on the other. 
The figures of Wales, and still more of Scotland, were a silent 
rebuke to our backwardness. The wealthiest country in Europe 
was among the most backward to spend on the higher education 
of its boys and girls. That was the indictment. Our plea was 
“guilty.” ‘There were no extenuating circumstances. 
There were men and women ready to argue that the lack of sup- 
ply was due to lack of demand. Now it is always fallacious to ar- 
gue from bales of cotton to human souls. Commercial law does not 
necessarily hold for the spiritual world, and as a matter of fact, 
in the history of education, supply has always preceded and 
evoked and fostered the demand. ‘That this is true also for our 
own country has been amply demonstrated since the beginning 
of the present century. 1902 saw the first attempt to put within 
the reach of every home the opportunity for secondary education. 
The supply at once evoked the demand; the demand grew and 
grew so fast that supply has never succeeded in catching up with 
it. Even in war time, with a clamant demand for juvenile labor, 
and a scale of remuneration which is out of all proportion to what 
was in vogue before, with boys and girls under 16 able to com- 
mand a wage of 35s. per week—even under these conditions, the 
number in our secondary schools has steadily grown, the figures 
for 1915-16 showing an increase of over 6 per cent. That rate of 
increase would certainly be higher if the schools were able to ac- 
commodate the pupils who present themselves for entrance, but 
with the war all building has been stopped, and a good many

schools in big towns have been dispossessed of their premises. 
The consequence is that at the present moment the supply is 
definitely inadequate to the demand, and many boys and girls 
are being excluded from the advantages of higher education, whose 
parents are willing to pay for it. Not only so, but the buildings 
are overcrowded, and the classes are becoming unwieldily large, 
also owing to the men of military age being called up, the teachers 
in day schools are predominantly feminine. 
In laying plans for the expansion of secondary education, we 
are therefore working along the line of spontaneous growth. 
What happened in Scotland many years ago, what happened in 
Wales at the end of last century, is happening in England now. 
At last she has caught the contagion, and is awake to the fact 
that she must take the flood on the rise or the rest of her national 
life will be bound in shallows and in miseries. 
What do these lines of growth appear to be? 
It is to be noted that it is the day school, and not the boarding 
school, that is growing. This is a sign of health. Only the day 
school can cover the ground and meet the national need. The day 
school is the only way of opening up education to those social 
strata of our population with whom the hope of the future resides 
—the better-paid artisans, the worse-paid professional classes, and 
that increasing proportion of the population which works under 
the management of large joint-stock concerns. But Nature does 
not confine ability to any social stratum, and wherever nature 
provides the brains, it is for the nation to provide the training— 
the best training of which those brains are capable. The best 
brain in thesArmy, the brain on which the whole well-being of 
Our Army depends, was born in a charwoman’s home. First and 
foremost, then, an enlightened national policy means that we 
must open up the way for the lad of parts, and equally for the 
girl of parts, to climb to the highest positions which they are 
capable of filling, and to render the highest service they are 
capable of rendering not only in our Government administration, 
but also in the universities, in commerce, in industry, and in the 
professions. 
Not only so, but the whole level of our national education must 
be raised. Social progress is not the progress of select individuals 
here and there; it is the progress of the whole body politic. The 
gifted few must find their chance, but the ungifted many must not 
be shut out from the kingdom of light, the treasure house of
-P-A-G-E-478
  464 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
knowledge and all the things that are more excellent. Until that 
is done, our democratic government remains democratic only in 
name, and the basis of our democratic government is insecure be- 
cause it is unenlightened. The lines of our advance must be deter- 
mined mainly by our national needs. These are only too plain at 
the present time. 
1. Our land produces, on the mildest computation, only half 
the foodstuffs which it should produce. Many causes, legislative 
and economic, contribute to this, with which we have not now to 
deal, but the chief cause is, after all, educational. Land cultiva- 
tion needs not only the sweat of the brow but sweat of the brain. 
The allotment which the cultivator must assiduously till is the 
allotment that lies within the walls of his own skull. The educa- 
tional curriculum of the country school must be related vitally to 
the science of the garden, the field, and the hedgerow, with which 
the pupil is daily familiar. It must train his hand to execute the 
purpose or the invention of his mind. It must open up the way 
without let or hindrance for the pupil who has brains to learn all 
that the best agricultural science has to teach him about the 
management of cattle and crops. 
Owing to the scattered nature of the population, this will inevit- 
ably mean hostels with free board and tuition in connection with 
well-placed and well-equipped secondary schools. 
The town boy who has aptitude for the land must not be for- 
gotten, and urban authorities which provide all manner of technical 
and university scholarships must not forget to provide for the 
higher education of the boy or girl whose bent is agricultural. 
In this sphere one may almost say that everything has yet to be 
done. The yield of the ground in Belgium is five times per acre 
what it is in England. In Germany, where the soil is far poorer, 
the yield is twice as great. In other countries the annual yield 
shows increase; in England it shows shrinkage. There is a much- 
quoted saying which cries blessing on the head of him who makes 
two blades of grass grow where one grew before. The saying is 
foolish. Men and women cannot live on grass. Not grass but 
corn must be the deitmotif. 
2. The second need is industrial. The war has opened the eyes 
of the nation as never before to the weaknesses of our industrial 
position. It has made us see how America, Germany, Austria, 
and Switzerland, by the study of electricity and applied science 
in all its branches, have been able to wrest from us whole prov-
-P-A-G-E-479
  
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 465 
inces of production, even when the invention which made these 
new productions possible was of English origin. What has always 
been clear to a few is now patent to all, viz., that without a higher 
standard and a wider range or scientific knowledge our nation 
stands to lose not only its industrial position, but even its power 
of self-defence. In this matter we have been too eager for im- 
mediate results. We have not taken the long view. We have 
acted individually when we should have codperated in our several 
trades. We have been blind to the industrial value of science. 
Our new system must provide for a far closer association be- 
tween our universities and the work of our staple industries. This 
implies, in the first place, a less donnish attitude on the part of 
dons, and appreciation on the part of the manufacturer of the 
value of that theoretical study of science which hitherto he has set 
down as academic and unpractical. It will not be a case of quick 
returns. The call is for prolonged study, concentration, patient 
endeavor, and a fixing of the eye on distant consequences; in a 
word, what Benjamin Kidd calls “projected efficiency.” 
The call is, further, for a new spirit of codrdination and coépe- 
ration on the part of manufacturers and traders of all kinds. 
Hitherto, competition has been between firm and firm; in the 
future competition will be between nation and nation, and the 
nation whose forces are not marshaled and organized will go 
under. This spirit of codperation, which is needed as much in 
agriculture as in industry and commerce, is, like the power of 
waiting for distant results, a moral quality. And for these moral 
qualities the school must prepare; in all school societies a healthy 
corporate spirit is as much needed for national efficiency as sound 
and strenuous intellectual work. 
3. It is, therefore, clear that there must be not only secondary 
education for the man who is to take up higher directive work, 
but there must be a higher standard of civic education and intelli- 
gence on the part of all the workers in the different trades. The 
Junior Technical Schools, though few in number, show clearly on 
what lines progress can be made. Secondary education must not 
be exclusively bookish; many an English lad is intelligent without 
being intellectual, just as many are intellectual without being in- 
telligent. At present we put perhaps too much premium on the 
boy who is intellectual. A secondary curriculum which shall be 
focussed on practical constructive work, and get its problems for 
thinking out of the needs of practical occupation, has yet to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
    466 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
thought out. There is no doubt that it will appeal very strongly 
to a large proportion of English boyhood who have the instinct 
for things but do not respond to the appeal of words and literary 
form. American experience shows us how such a scheme of prac- 
tical secondary education can be infused with a generous and in- 
spiring interest in poetry and literature. 
4. For many years the nation has felt that her secondary edu- 
cation was not as effective as it might be for the purposes of com- 
mercial efficiency. Its dissatisfaction has not been very articulate, 
and to meet it there has grown up a type of “commercial educa- 
tion” which has brought deserved discredit on the term. Short- 
hand, typewriting, long-tots and cross-tots may be necessary, but 
they do not call into play the higher activities of the mind. Many 
of these processes of drudgery will before long be replaced by 
mechanical contrivance. What we need is a new type of school 
which shall teach languages as living things, with practical applica- 
tion from the first to the needs of everyday existence, which shall 
develop in connection with geography the study of products and 
trade routes, and in connection with history the study of economic 
law, and so lead on to the intelligent study of economic science as 
a whole. In this connection it is relevant to point out that in all 
our universities, and especially in our ancient universities, the 
study of modern languages lags far behind every other faculty. It 
is safe to say that at the present time there is next to no organic 
connection between the highest modern language work in our 
secondary schools and the universities. This lack of upward de- 
velopment has reacted most prejudicially upon the development 
of modern language teaching in the schools. 
Nothing has been said so far about what are called the learned 
professions. The reason is that there is no evidence of serious 
national deficiency in connection with these professions except in 
the profession of teaching. Indeed, it is evident that a large num- 
ber of unemployed barristers might have found a much more use- 
ful employment of their gifts on the lines of national industry 
and commerce. But it must not be forgotten that the learned 
professions, being scientific, must necessarily also be progressive, 
and in developing on the lines indicated we cannot afford to 
weaken the provision for these professions or for the higher 
branches of our civil service. Whether the Civil Service in its 
lower branches is not absorbing an undue proportion of high- 
class intellect, and finding for it employment which is by no means
-P-A-G-E-481
  
FOREIGN SECONDARY EDUCATION 467 
commensurate with its intellectual quality, is a question well 
worthy of consideration by the directors of our national educa- 
tional policy. 
Clearly the position calls for strong handling and a mind that 
shall be not only synoptic but able to plan on a big comprehensive 
scale for the future. It must provide machinery which shall not 
be static but ready equipped for progress in any required direction, 
which shall not be centralized and bureaucratic, but in touch 
with local needs, appealing to local patriotism, and adapted to 
local needs. Above all, our national system must not be laid down 
in rigid horizontal strata; it must provide for upward mobility on 
every line, and in order to secure that there shall be no waste of 
that most precious of all material—human souls, it must exer- 
cise educational control and guidance over every boy and girl 
up to the age of 18. And the need is immediate. 
Principles of secondary education derived from foreign 
policies and practices. Varying conditions in different countries 
may necessitate the maintenance of different types of schools 
within different countries. 
Educational organization reflects social organization. Educa- 
tion might properly assume a more aggressive leadership. 
The secondary school of the future must provide an “unob- 
structed road” for the encouragement of talent wherever it is 
found. That is, the needs of national progress require that sec- 
ondary education be provided for social and economic groups to 
which secondary education has heretofore been closed. 
In order to make secondary education actually available to 
more population groups, the content, methods of teaching, and 
character of school administration must be adapted to meet new 
needs. 
There should be differentiation with reference to the ages at 
which pupils leave schools. It is desirable to organize secondary 
education into cycles so as to accommodate better the large number 
of students who throughout the present generation will continue 
to leave the full-time school at about fifteen years of age. That is, 
secondary education should be so organized as to prepare not only
-P-A-G-E-482
  468 ECONDARY EDUCATION 
for higher training but also so as to lead to self-realization. As the 
elementary school provides training for further schooling, so the 
secondary school should provide for both further schooling and 
life in general, _ 
Practical secondary education can be infused with a generous 
and inspiring interest in the cultural aspects of life. 
The desirability of the early beginning of secondary education 
is an established principle. The junior high school features which 
have characterized foreign secondary education for centuries are 
being continued. The age of nine has been found to be too young 
for educational guidance. Intensive specialization should be post- 
poned until at least the age of fifteen. 
The possibility of crossing from one curriculum to another 
should be provided during the earlier years of secondary education 
by means of carefully organized curricula arranged in two- or 
three-year cycles. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. Compare the uses of the term secondary education in Ger- 
many, France, England, and the United States.

sien as a whole with courses offered in American cosmopolitan high 
schools. 
3. How do you account for the rapid development of folk high 
schools in Germany?

requirements of teachers as set forth in Chapter V, why is it possible 
for Germany and France to require such amounts of training as 
they do of prospective teachers?

education?

many? Discuss its significance.

THE REORGANIZATION MOVEMENT IN 
SECONDARY EDUCATION 
CHAPTER XII 
Economy oF TIME IN EDUCATION 
The drive for economy. During the last quarter of the nine- 
teenth century, a group of progressive schoolmen began a 
concerted drive for economy of time in education. In the course 
of that drive for economy all the administrative units of training 
were examined—the elementary school, the high school, and the 
college. Likewise, the content and technique of teaching each 
elementary and high school subject were scrutinized in a search 
for possible economies. Although certain persons doubt the 
advisability of reducing the total time required for completing 
one’s training for professional and technical vocations, no one 
questions the advisability of developing efficiently the types of 
skill and the new purposes which are to be acquired for such 
vocations, and for life in general. Therefore, the movement for 
economy has not lacked support. ; 
The readings in this chapter indicate (1) the main currents 
followed in the early discussions of economy of time, (2) the 
specific proposals for economy as made by the national com- 
mittee, (3) typical experiments in economizing time, (4) the 
use of tests as a special device in adjusting classroom work to 
pupils’ needs, and (5) the social issues involved in the adapta- 
tion of educational procedure to the needs of a certain group 
of pupils.

472 SECON DARY EDUCATION 
CAN SCHOOL PROGRAMMES BE SHORTENED AND ENRICHED ?* 
| 
By Cuartes W. Error 
In the process of improving the secondary schools, colleges, 
and professional schools of the United States—a process which 
has been carried on with remarkable energy since the Civil War— 
certain new difficultes have been created for the higher education 
in general, and particularly for colleges. ‘These difficulties have 
to do with the age at which young men can get prepared for 
college, and therefore with the ages at which boys pass the suc- 
cessive stages of their earlier education. The average age of 
admission to Harvard College has been rising for sixty years 
past, and has now reached the extravagant limit of eighteen years 
and ten months. Harvard College is not at all peculiar in this 
respect; indeed, many of the country colleges find their young 
men older still at entrance. The average college graduate is 
undoubtedly nearly twenty-three years old at graduation; and 
when he has obtained his A. B. he must nowadays allow at least 
three years for his professional education. 
In respect to the length of time required for a satisfactory pro- 
fessional training, there has been a great change since the War. 
Twenty years ago the pericd of residence at Harvard University 
for the degree of Bachelor of Laws was eighteen months; now it 
is three years. Many of the States of the American Union have 
passed laws which practically make three years the normal period 
of study before admission to the bar. Ambitious medical students 
are giving four years to their medical training. Twenty years ago 
the leading colleges were satisfied to take men just graduated 
in arts as tutors in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Now they 
expect a candidate for a tutorship or instructorship to have de- 
voted two or three years of study after taking his bachelor’s 
degree. School boards and trustees have become correspondingly 
exacting. In short, professional education in the United States 
is becoming constantly more thorough and elaborate, and is 
therefore demanding of aspirants to the professions more and 
more time. The average college graduate who fits himself well 
for any one of the learned professions, including teaching, can 
hardly begin to support himself before he is twenty-seven years 
old.

ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 473 
This condition of things is so unreasonable in a new country 
like the United States—being hardly matched in the oldest and 
most densely peopled countries of Europe—that some remedy 
is urgently demanded; and the first partial remedy that suggests 
itself is to reduce the average age of admission to college to eigh- 
teen. This reduction would save about a year. In effecting this 
saving of time, it is greatly to be wished that no reduction should 
be made in the attainments which the average candidate for ad- 
mission now brings to the American colleges; for it is probable 
that the saving thus effected will not be sufficient in itself, and 
that the public interests will require in addition some shortening 
of the ordinary college course of four years. College men, there- 
fore, are anxiously looking to see if the American school courses 
can be both shortened and enriched—shortened, so that our 
boys may come to college at eighteen instead of nineteen, and 
enriched, in order that they may bring to college at eighteen 
more than they now bring at nineteen, so that the standard of the 
A.B. may not be lowered. 
The anxiety with which men charged with the conduct of 
college education look at this question is increased by the relative 
decline of American colleges and universities as a whole. This 
relative decline, which was pointed out nearly twenty years ago 
by President Barnard of Columbia College, is very visible of late 
years. The population of the United States is supposed by the 
best authorities to increase about one-third in every period of 
ten years. In the ten-year period from 1875 to 1884 inclusive, 
the universities and colleges included in the tables published by 
the Commissioner of Education show an increase in their number 
of students of only 11 per cent., instead of 33 1/3 per cent. If 
we select from the same tables the ten-year period from 1876 
to 1885, the increase is 16 per cent.; but the explanation of this 
higher percentage of increase is that the total number of students 
in the 1876 was abnormally low, being 2400 below the number 
of 1875. If we add to the institutions enumerated as universities 
and colleges all the schools of science and all the higher institu- 
tions for the education of women, we still find that this enlarged 
list of institutions has not gained students at the same rate at 
which the population has increased, although the schools of 
science have made very large gains in the decade referred to. 
Thus the increase in the number of students in universities and 
colleges, schools of science, and women’s colleges, all taken to- 
gether, was only 23 per cent. in the ten years from 1875 to 1884
-P-A-G-E-488
  474 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
inclusive. Obviously there are serious hindrances affecting all 
the institutions which receive young men and women at the age 
of eighteen or nineteen to keep them under liberal training for 
three or four years. One of these hindrances undoubtedly is that 
the colleges as a whole held too long to a medieval curriculum; 
but a greater hindrance, in all probability, is the burden imposed 
upon parents when their elaborately educated sons cannot support 
themselves in their professions until they are twenty-seven or 
twenty-eight years old. Hence the importance of the inquiry, 
Can school programmes be shortened and enriched? 
It will not be unprofitable to consider some of the means of 
improving the American public school, from the primary grade, 
through the high school. 
1. In the first place, better programmes need better teachers. 
The great difference between the French and German secondary 
schools and the American is in the quality of the teachers. Two 
modes of improving the general body of teachers in the public 
schools demand special attention. In the first place, school com- 
mittees, superintendents, teachers themselves, and all friends of 
public education should constantly strive to procure a better 
tenure of office for American teachers. The American schools 
will never equal the schools of Germany and France until well- 
proved teachers can secure a tenure during good behavior and 
efficiency, like teachers in those countries. Consideration, dignity, 
and quietness of mind go with a permanent tenure, and the 
public-school service will never compete successfully with the 
service of private educational corporations in this country until 
the public employ is as good as the private employ in this 
regard. Secondly, the average skill of the teachers in the public 
schools may be increased by raising the present low proportion 
of male teachers in the schools. Herein lies one of the great 
causes of the inferiority of the American teaching to the French 
and German teaching. The proportion of women teachers in 
American schools is vastly greater than it is in Europe. The 
larger the proportion of women in any system of public schools, 
the larger will be the percentage of new appointments every year, 
and the larger the amount of work done by temporary substitutes. 
New appointments and substitutes generally mean inexperienced 
teachers, or, at the best, teachers suddenly put to work in unac- 
customed places. This superiority of men as teachers has, of 
course, nothing whatever to do with the relative intelligence or 
faithfulness of men and women. It is a well-known fact that
-P-A-G-E-489
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 475 
many women enter the public schools as teachers without any 
intention of long following the business; and also that women 
are absent from duty from two to three times as much as men. 
Young men who take up teaching as a temporary expedient are 
also unsatisfactory material. The schools need the life-work of 
highly trained and experienced teachers. After these two most 
important means of raising the average quality of public-school 
teachers come lesser means which ought not to be neglected; 
thus, superintendents and committees can do something to im- 
prove teachers by invariably advocating the expenditure of money 
for teaching, rather for mechanical appliances or buildings. Cheap 
teachers and expensive apparatus and building are precisely the 
reverse of wise practice, particularly if the fine buildings are 
not fire-proof after all. Again, the teaching of the public 
schools can, of course, be improved by the establishment of 
teachers’ examinations, which secure a better preparation in the 
average teacher, and by methods of supervision which make 
known the relative merits of teachers who are on probation. 
Good progress has been made in this direction during the past 
ten years (1878-88). 
2. The second direction of untiring effort should be to the 
improvement of programmes; for the programmes are all- 
important to the steady development of the whole system of 
schools from top to bottom. A good programme will, of course, 
not execute itself; it must be vivified by the good teacher; but 
an injudicious programme is an almost insuperable obstacle to 
the improvement of a city’s schools. As a rule, the American 
programmes do not seem to be substantial enough, from the first 
year in the primary school onward. There is not enough meat 
in the diet. They do not bring the child forward fast enough 
to maintain his interest, and induce him to put forth his strength. 
Frequent complaint is made of overpressure in the public schools, 
but Friedrich Paulsen is probably right in saying that it is not 
work which causes overfatigue so much as lack of interest and 
lack of conscious progress. The sense that, work as he may, 
he is not accomplishing anything will wear upon the stoutest adult, 
much more upon a child. One problem in arithmetic which he 
cannot solve will try a child more than ten he can solve. One 
hour of work in which he can take no intelligent interest will 
wear him out more than two hours of work in which he cannot 
help being interested. Now, the trouble with much of the work 
in the public schools is that it is profoundly inevitably uninter-
-P-A-G-E-490
  
  476 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
esting to the childish mind. To enrich the school programme, 
therefore, and to make serious subjects follow each other in it 
more rapidly than now, is not necessarily to increase the strain 
upon the child; it is, however, necessarily to increase the skill 
demanded of the teacher, and hence the improvement of teachers 
must go hand in hand with the improvement of programmes. 
The best way to diminish strain is to increase interest, attractive- 
ness, and the sense of achievement and growth. American teach- 
ing in school and college has been chiefly driving and judging; it 
ought to be leading and inspiring. Here are these beautiful 
fields—I will show you the way through them. Here are these 
rewarding exercises—I will show you how to practise them. Here 
are these heights—I will lead you up them. 
3. Much time can be saved in primary and secondary schools 
by diminishing the number of reviews, and by never aiming at 
that kind of accuracy of attainment which reviews, followed by 
_examinations, are intended to enforce. Why should an accuracy 
of knowledge and of=statement be habitually demanded ofchil- 
dren which adults seldom possess? How many well-educated 
adults can add long columns of figures correctly, or find the 
least common multiple or the greatest common divisor of six 
or eight numbers? Nothing but practice.can keep one skilful in 
these exercises, and we may reasonably be grateful that few 
people are compelled to keep in the necessary practice. Few 
adult minds retain accurately considerable masses of isolated 
facts; and it is commonly observed that minds which are good 
at that are seldom the best minds. Why do we try to make 
children do what we do not try to do ourselves? Instead of 
mastering one subject before going to another, it is almost invar- 
iably wise to go on to a superior subject before the inferior has 
been mastered—mastery being a very rare thing. On the mastery 
theory, how much new reading or thinking should we adults do? 
Instead of reviewing arithmetic, study algebra; for algebra will 
illustrate arithmetic and supply many examples of arithmetical 
processes. Instead of re-reading a familiar story, read a new 
one; it will be vastly more interesting, and the common words 
will all recur—the common words being by far the most valuable 
ones. Instead of reviewing the physical geography of North 
America, study South America. There, too, the pupil will find 
mountain-chains, watersheds, high plateaus, broad plains, great 
streams, and isothermal lines. The really profitable time to 
review a subject is not when we have just finished it, but when
-P-A-G-E-491
ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 477 
we have used it in studying other subjects, and have seen its 
relations to other subjects and what it is good for. For example, 
the French programme puts a review of arithmetic, algebra, and 
geometry into the last year. With all his mathematical powers 
strengthened by the study of algebra and geometry, and with 
all the practice of arithmetic which his study of mensuration and 
algebra has involved, the boy returns at seventeen to arithmetic 
and finds it infinitely easier than he did at fourteen. Further, 
the French boy has escaped those most exasperating of arithme- 
tical puzzles which a little easy algebra enables one to solve with 
facility. Many an educated New-Englander remembers to this 
day the exasperation he felt when he discovered that problems 
in Colburn’s Sequel, over which he had struggled for hours, 
could be solved in as many minutes after he had got half-way 
through Sherwin’s Algebra. Is it not an abominable waste of 
the time and strength of children to put them to doing in a diffi- 
cult way, never used in real life, something they will be able to 
do in an easy way a year or two later? To introduce any artificial 
hardness into the course of training that any human being has 
to follow is an unpardonable educational sin. There is hardness 
enough in this world without manufacturing any, particularly for 
children. On careful search through all the years of the public- 
school programmes now in use, many places will be found where 
time can be saved and strain lessened by abandoning the effort 
to obtain an exaggerated and wholly unnatural accuracy of work. 
It is one of the worst defects of examinations that they set an 
artificial value upon accuracy of attainment. Good examination 
results do not always prove that the training of the children 
examined has been of the best kind. 
4. In almost all the numerous collections of school statistics 
now published in this country, it appears that the various grades 
contain children much too old for them, who have apparently 
been held back. This phenomenon seems to be due partly to 
the ambition of teachers and partly to the caution of parents. 
To illustrate with a specific case: in the Boston primary schools, 
which are intended for children of five to seven years of age 
inclusive, 44 per cent. of all the children for three years past 
were over seven; and in the grammar schools of the same city, 
which are intended for children of from eight to thirteen years 
inclusive, from 20 to 24 per cent. were over thirteen. It has 
already been mentioned that the average age of admission to 
the Latin School is not eleven years, as indicated in the pro-  
-P-A-G-E-492
  478 ‘SECONDARY EDUCATION 
gramme, but thirteen years. It is really thirteen years and 
three months. For three years past, from one third to one half 
of the graduating classes of the Boston grammar schools have 
been more than six years in the schools, the programme calling 
for but six years. In the Boston primary and grammar schools 
the tendency is in the wrong direction; that is, in 1887 there 
was a larger proportion of pupils over age than in 1877. The 
ambition of teachers tends to keep children too long in the several 
grades, because they desire to have their pupils appear well at 
the periodical examinations, and also because they like to keep 
in their classes the bright children as aids to the dull ones. The 
caution of parents tends to produce the same difficulty because 
they fear over-pressure; not comprehending that with children, 
as with adults, it is not work so much as worry that injures, or 
finding that the existing system adds worry to work. The exag- 
gerated notion that it is necessary to master one thing before a 
child goes to another is also responsible for the retardation of 
children on their way through the regular course. The result of 
this retardation is that the boy comes too late to the high school 
or to the Latin School, and so fails to complete that higher course 
if he is going into business, or comes too late to college if his 
education is to be more prolonged. The great body of children 
ought to pass regularly from one grade to another, without delay, 
at the ages set down on the programme; and any method of 
examination which interferes with this regular progress does 
more harm than good. Of late years many experiments have 
been made on semiannual promotions and other means of hurry- 
ing forward the brighter children. The aim of these experiments 
is laudable; but the statistics suggest a doubt whether semi- 
annual promotions really promote, and whether they do not 
disturb to an inexpedient degree the orderly progress of the 
school work. In general the work of any school must be laid 
out by years, and on this account irregular promotions will hardly 
provide a remedy against the common evil of retardation.* 
5. If we look back a generation, or two generations, in the 
history of American schools, we shall find that the time spent 
in school by children during a year has been decidedly reduced; 
although great improvements have been made during the same 
period in the ventilation of school buildings, and various bodily 
exercises, such as singing, gymnastics, and military drill, have 
been introduced. This reduction of school hours has gone quite 
*Trregular and rapid promotion has been greatly facilitated since 1888. 
 
-P-A-G-E-493
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 479 
far enough, and some steps need to be taken in the other direc- 
tion. The ideal school should be so conducted that the child’s 
physique is not impaired by attending it, or his enjoyment of 
his daily life lessened. Then longer school hours would not be 
unsafe or unwelcome. It should be the teachers that need rest 
and vacation, and not the children. In cities vacation schools 
seem to be a desirable addition to our present organization. A 
long vacation may be a very good thing for children who have 
at home some intellectual resources, or who can go to the country 
or to the sea in vacation, and there learn some things not found 
in books; but for the children of ignorant or heedless parents, 
who have nothing of intellectual life to offer them at home, a long 
vacation is likely to be a serious injury, particularly in cities and 
large towns. Vacation schools tend to bring forward, or keep 
up, the least favored children, thus accelerating the general rate 
of progress during the year. 
The chief objects of this address are, first, to point out a 
serious difficulty which is embarrassing the whole course of 
American education; and, secondly, to indicate briefly a few 
of the directions in which labor may be wisely spent in improv- 
ing our school system, to the general end that the pupils may 
receive a better training in a shorter time. 
THE ECONOMY OF TIME? 
Nature of the Inquiry. This investigation was prompted by 
the seeming need of a comprehensive view of the whole field of 
American education. Special problems were discussed in a frag- 
mentary way, without consideration of. related questions and 
without hope of even temporary conclusions. The length of 
the college course, and the relation of the college to the uni- 
versity proper, was a leading topic. But this involved the 
question of the length of the whole period of general education, 
the waste in elementary education, the place of the secondary 
school, the relation of educational aims to civic needs and the 
ideals of our civilization, the definition of culture. 
The problem assumed this form: The period of general educa- 
tion is too long; economy in the selection of subjects and topics 
and in methods will save approximately two years in the whole

period of general education; with greater efficiency in the earlier 
periods the college course may well end nominally at 20 instead 
of 22; a redefinition of culture may modify the preparatory 
period; the ideals of our civilization to-day may affect the view 
of culture and the desirable limit for formal training. 
Length of the Period of General Education. The length of 
the preparatory period in America is exceptional. The German 
student advances at once from the gymnasium to the university. 
The French student enters the university from the lycée, except 
that for certain faculties a year or two of supplementary prepara- 
tion is required which may be taken either in the better lycées 
or in the general courses of the university. The English student 
enters the university from the public school; and Oxford and 
Cambridge are universities in a sense not represented by the 
American college. The English university, besides the tradi- 
tional course which has always had a special significance in 
England, offers at the start a choice among many groups leading 
to law, medicine, theology, or a knowledge of various sciences. 
It is understood that the nominal age for completing the secon- 
dary course in European schools is the same as for our high-school 
graduation. 
Since the early New England college we have added four 
years to preparation and three or four years to specializing for 
the professions. Instead of converting the college into a uni- 
versity, we have piled the German university on top of our 
imitation of the English type (the college) without adjustment 
of the educational system, and the condition is full of difficulties 
and absurdities. 
The early New England college met the simple conditions of 
its day and served both as a school of culture and in a way as 
a professional school. Until comparatively recent times it still 
performed a widely useful function as a broad preparation for 
business and the professions. But the recent rapid differentia- 
tions in professional, commercial, and industrial life, and the 
increased demand for knowledge and skill in each line, changed 
the whole aspect of the college problem in so far as in the past 
it represented professional training. Special education must 
occupy, in part at least, the place of the college. To-day the 
college, interposed between the high school and the university, 
occupies an anomalous position, and one that is no longer tenable 
eer important adjustments are made. The high school and 
e university include its former functions.

The committee agree (and for reasons which will appear) that 
“graduate” and professional studies should begin at about 20. 
They will attempt to show that the saving of two years in time 
need be no loss in education. 
The committee here present a provisional time scheme to be 
discussed later:

Educational Principles Involved—Vocational Education. Per- 
haps the most difficult part of this investigation is the one involv- 
ing principles of education and the relation of vocational educa- 
tion to the main question. Here is a brief summary of the 
committee’s views: 
1. The period of general education must be shortened in 
order that the vocation training—that of the graduate and pro- 
fessional schools—may fall within the period of greatest energy 
and adaptability. In other words, there must be an economic 
division of time in the “plastic” period between general and 
special preparation for life. Too long a period of preparation, 
general and special, may unfit for action. The age of 22 is too 
old to begin specialization, and 27 is too old to begin apprenticc- 
ship in a profession. 
2. There is loss of interest and energy in a long preparatory 
period of unmotivated study. 
3. The fundamentals of elementary education—facts, habits, 
dexterities, sentiments, etc—can be taught in six school years, 
allowing the elementary period to end at 12. 
4. At the end of the first six years of school the child requires 
new and varied interests, beyond those found in the elementary 
curriculum. Many believe that for physiological, as well as 
psychological, reasons a beginning in subjects and methods of 
secondary education should be made earlier. 
5. By a division of the six-year high school into two periods, 
junior and senior, a large number would complete the first 
period; the plan would be adapted to an advanced grade of voca- 
tional school between 15 or 16 and 18 for pupils unable to 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
  i 
482 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
continue a general course. The whole scheme then would pro- 
vide for vocational lines of work beginning at 12, 15 or 16, 18, 
and 20. i 
6. For economy, subject matter should be made a means and 
not an end. The aim should be to gain a few fundamental facts, 
power and inspiration, and the ability to go alone. There is great 
waste in material and method. 
7. The idea of culture must be modernized, reinterpreted in 
terms of present-day need, in terms of the value of the individual 
in the industrial and the social scheme. Every man has his own 
definition of culture, and for a particular discussion it means 
nothing if not defined. The majority of our correspondents 
give culture a wide meaning and include whatever prepares for 
the large demands of life—personal efficiency, civic fitness, ra- 
tional enjoyment. Each member of the committee would define 
culture differently, but agree that it should include power for 
the higher appreciations of life. They further believe that culture 
may grow out of an education which is more conscious of its 
motives and spends less time in purposeless study. Culture in 
the sense of power of appreciation is not a “study,” but is due 
to timely suggestion, inspiring influence, and guidance. There 
is much waste in the 16 years of general education, and “culture” 
has been made the chief excuse for it. 
This report has to do primarily with the whole period of gen- 
eral and special education for those who take both in their entire 
extent. But since the problem of vocational studies also affects 
the question, it can not be omitted. The status of this problem 
in the United States to-day is about as follows: 
1. It is understood that boys who, through the home, have 
gained some kind of manual skill, such as may be had by work- 
ing in shops or on the farm, have a great advantage in substantial 
character, and in a wise attitude toward life. 
2. Motor training in various forms is a recognized part of 
general education. Manual training has a well-recognized gen- 
eral educational value. 
3. Vocational education (commercial, technical, industrial, 
trade) is now making large claims on the public schools. 
4. Conservative educators would connect all work looking 
toward a vocation with the present schools, allowing for it about 
one-fourth of the time, making it elective, making it preparatory 
to various industries, limiting the kind and number of industries 
selected by the conditions of each locality.
-P-A-G-E-497
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 483 
5. A large number would separate vocational work from the 
regular schools. 
6. For a large class of pupils it is proposed to begin industrial 
education (general foundation for each of several industries, to- 
gether with selected general studies) at about 12 and end at 
about 16. 
7. A majority claim that trade schools as such, leading to 
apprenticeships, can not be profitable before 16; that, whenever 
possible, trades are better learned in connection with the shops, 
but that compulsory laws should secure part time in school for 
young apprentices. 
8. There are special problems in highly congested centers that 
would greatly modify the general principle and call for earlier 
and more technical preparation for industrial work. 
The committee are in sympathy with the wise claims of in- 
dustrial education, but believe that the heritage of the race in 
the form of systematized knowledge will always be the founda- 
tion of education. They believe that humanism in the form of 
interest in the thoughts and lives of men needs not less, but more, 
emphasis; that scientific knowledge, rational power, and aesthetic 
and ethical appreciation are the highest ideals of our civilization, 
but that learning will be more and more vitalized by relating it 
to the life of the present day. 
Representative opinion holds that our schools are not giving 
results proportionate to the time, in efficiency, culture, or char- 
acter. There is a growing belief that in the name of culture 
much time is wasted, without securing real culture or substantial 
character, which is the prime element of culture. As an economic 
ideal, the vocational movement looks toward preparation for 
skilled employment for those pupils who otherwise would leave 
school and become unskilled laborers. The fact that under 
present conditions many pupils leave at the end of the sixth 
grade is an additional argument for the time scheme proposed by 
the committee. The demand upon the scientific and professional 
schools for thorough and extended courses calls for economy in 
all the preparatory courses (including the college). The voca- 
tional movement in the end will not detract from the culture 
ideal, but will give it a clearer interpretation. We believe that 
nothing will be lost to the best ideals of our civilization—power of 
reflection, or the need of transmuting wealth into scientific 
knowledge, literature, art, and ethical standards. Allowing for 
all historical differences, the results in older countries, in develop-
-P-A-G-E-498
  484 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ing high intellectual power, confirm this view of the educational 
scheme. 
Sociological View. The relation of our educational aims to 
civic needs has been too much neglected. Every kind of a scien- 
tific, philosophical, and experimental method of studying educa- 
tion is in vogue, but the criticism of results, now so common, 
awakens us to the need of a simple examination of the ends 
proposed, and adapting the means to the end. Throughout the 
history of civilization, education has been determined or modi- 
fied by the ideals and philosophy of the people, and by material 
conditions of life, and we in America can not ignore the just 
claims of representative criticism outside of the calling. 
If we understand the conditions to-day, there is a demand for 
more efficiency, and for a culture which is related to real life 
and whose core is moral character. Education must be in har- 
mony with its environment, but it must develop also original 
power to change the environment and to cope with whatever 
problems of efficiency and ethical conditions a given period may 
present. 
New views of the needs of society change the old aristocratic 
ideal of culture and make it democratic in opportunity and pur- 
pose. This change requires that less time be given the old 
humanities and more weight be placed upon preparation for 
efficiency and service. The scientific method, broad concepts, and 
the higher appreciations must ever be the foundation of citizen- 
ship and of practical activities; but a larger proportion of time 
must be given to the vocational aims. This ratio will be approxi- 
mately determined as a question of proper balance between 
receptive study and practical motor activity, also as a question 
of the economic division between preparation for life and active 
life. There has always been a selfishly unsocial factor in cul- 
ture, and the whole movement of to-day is to correct this by con- 
necting higher education and all education with democracy. 
If, as in Germany, professional studies began earlier, with the 
motive of service to the State, the false element in culture would 
be largely eliminated and a better citizenship would result. It 
would seem evident that earlier specialization, beginning at 
about 20, would promote all industrial and scientific interests, 
and would result in an expert knowledge of many problems of 
government and society. Moreover, there would be a distinct 
economic advantage, in terms of social fitness and intellectual 
power of the nation, in graduating earlier from preparatory
-P-A-G-E-499
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 485 
courses, and carrying through real university training those espe- 
cially fitted to profit by it. To consider the earlier years, many 
leave school at the end of the sixth grade who would be retained 
if practical studies were offered them. This would result in the 
efficiency of a larger number, and the training would have also 
a cultural value. Of course this is another argument for the 
time scheme proposed. 
If we consider those who go through college and the profes- 
sional school, by shortening the time, the two additional years of 
active life and the greater power, hope, and enthusiasm of the 
earlier age would be a great economic advantage. It may be 
argued that here would be a loss in intelligent citizenship of the 
higher quality, because of the shorter culture period. But we 
believe the better methods of education in the proposed scheme 
of economy and the larger spirit of service would prevent any 
such loss. 
Our great problem is to bring together the science and power 
of the schools and the popular will. The codperation of higher 
education and democracy is the salvation of both. An educated 
aristocracy is not the ideal of the people, but a learning that 
shall be serviceable and represent their highest needs, aspira- 
tions, and ideals. They accept real culture, scientific power, 
trained skill, and are willing to pay for them. But they believe 
there is waste, a nonsocial element, inefficiency in some of the 
ways and means. The scheme proposed would tend to enlist 
the sympathy and support of the people. 
Economy in Elementary Education. We approach now the 
question of saving time in the elementary period or of accom- 
plishing more within the time. There must be important reasons 
why in Germany, France, and England the secondary graduate 
is believed to be two years ahead of our high-school graduates. 
Here are some reasons, assigned by a recent writer, for the superior 
progress in German schools: Beginning many subjects earlier 
than is the custom in America, such as foreign languages, ele- 
mentary science, history; absence of marks and examinations; 
care of pupils as individuals; greater length of school year. 
The committee agree that there is much waste in elementary 
education, and that the elementary period should be from 6 to 
12. Nearly all of our correspondents. are emphatic regarding 
waste and the importance of shortening the entire period of 
general education. Saving of time can be made in the following 
ways:
-P-A-G-E-500
  486 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
1. The principle of selection is first: Choose the most 
important subjects and the most important topics; make a dis- 
tinction between first-rate facts and principles and tenth-rate; 
prune thoroughly, stick to the elements of a subject; do not try 
to teach everything that is good; confine the period of elemen- 
tary education to mastering the tools of education. This does 
not prevent inspirational work, which is a demand on the skill 
of the teacher rather than on time. A great secret of education 
is to accomplish a maximum of training with a minimum of 
material. This is especially true of formal subjects; it is true 
also of inspirational subjects in that after a general survey of the 
field emphasis should be placed upon a few selected points. Under 
the conditions above enumerated the formal elementary period 
can end in six years. 
2. Content subjects should not be taught with the methods 
suitable to the formal subjects; for instance, in the elementary 
period literature, history, science should be inspirational; this 
does not mean presentation to pupils of amusing stuff. No 
doctrine has been more harmful than that one subject of study is 
as good as another, and that all subjects should be taught alike; 
arithmetic is a tool and a discipline in absolute accuracy; litera- 
ture, history, and elementary science in this period are for culture. 
3. Include the last two years of the elementary school in the 
period of secondary education and begin the study of foreign 
language, elementary algebra, constructive geometry, elementary 
science, and history two years earlier. 
The High-School Problem. The committee favor the change 
noted in a previous statement, for the reason that it will adjust 
itself to present tendencies more conveniently than any other, 
and because it represents, we believe, essential principles in the 
organization of education. The proposition to make the high- 
school period 12-18 or 12-16 and the college period 18-20 or 16-20 
will adjust itself in the following ways: (1) It begins high-school 
work at the proper time and continues it to the recognized age 
of college admission or of beginning life (12-18); (2) it pro- 
vides for a large number who will enter vocations at 16 and 
adjusts itself to the idea of an intermediate industrial school 
(12-16); (3) it provides for the contingency that the college 
course in the reorganized scheme will end with the sophomore 
year and that the two years of college may be done in the uni- 
versity or in the larger high schools, and that the independent 
colleges may make a four-year course (16-20), admitting from

the smaller high schools at 16. It should be noted that this 
whole discussion is a vastly different thing from the question of 
shortening the college course. 
As to economy of instruction, the following principles may be 
stated: 
(1) In general the principles recommended for elementary 
education apply equally to secondary education. 
(2) Simplify the courses of instruction; cease multiplying 
subjects; concentrate on a few valuable studies—it is not neces- 
sary to take all the sciences in a high school; make college 
entrance requirements reasonable. The great mistake of our 
education is to suppose that quantity and strain constitute educa- 
tion. Education is a question of doing a few essential things 
well and without overstrain. The college has committed a 
grievous mistake in demanding ever more in quantity rather 
than in quality produced under conditions of healthy normal 
development. 
(3) It is of prime importance that, so far as possible, sub- 
jects be vitalized and related to modern life, and be adapted 
to the pupil’s interests, capacity, and mental development. 
(4) The principle of selection obtains here—choice of sub- 
jects and of facts and principles under each subject; also differ- 
entiation of method—training from formal subjects, and knowl- 
edge and inspiration from certain content subjects. 
(5) By far the greatest emphasis is given by our correspon- 
dents to moral training and preparation for citizenship. 
(6) Under the conditions recommended for elementary and 
secondary education, the committee believe that as much can be 
accomplished at the age of 18 as at 20 under present conditions, 
and that the period now represented by the school and college 
can be shortened at least two years. It is to be understood there 
should be less, rather than more, cramming, strain, and mechani- 
. cal measure of values. 
The College Problem. In a way the whole previous study has 
been made with reference to the college problem. The committee 
believe that shortening the whole period of general education is 
inevitable and necessary; that college work must end at about 
20, and university work must begin at that age. Since this result 
appears to be in the near future, is it not time for the universities 
to take hold of the problem and aid in the reorganization of the 
scheme of education? A somewhat remarkable judgment appears 
in the summary of the opinions of our correspondents upon the
-P-A-G-E-502

488 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
subject of the college and university. Approximately one-half 
favor ending the college work with the sophomore year and 
beginning university work with the junior year—this work to 
count toward the higher and professional degrees—and building 
the schools of medicine, law, and engineering on the present first 
two years of college. In other words, the university age is to be 
20, instead of 22. Until the reorganization and adjustment are 
effected the majority would retain the A.B. degree at its present 
standard, allowing, however, almost any consistent group, cultural 
or professional, to be elected the last two years. 
The present tendency in the reorganization of the college is 
really preparing the way for the adjustment recommended. We 
quote from a report made to the National Association of State 
Universities and unanimously adopted. This part of the report 
was really intended to look forward to the time when the uni- 
versity would be founded on two years of college. 
Present tendencies point, in our opinion, then, to a definite 
differentiation in the work of the college at the close of the 
sophomore year toward university work in the real sense. If 
these views are just, we suggest the following formulation of 
principles underlying the organization of such an institution, and 
we may define the standard American university to be an 
institution— 
Which offers in the college of liberal arts and sciences two 
years of general or liberal work completing or supplementing the 
work of the high school; 
Which offers a further course of two years so arranged that 
| the student may begin work of university character leading to 
the bachelor’s degree at the end, and reaching forward to the 
continuation of this work in the graduate school or the pro- 
fessional school. 
In recommending that University work begin with the junior 
| year of the college and that the professional schools be based 
on the first two years of college, the report is in line with present 
tendencies. It is in accord with the growing belief that the work 
of the last two years of college should be organized into groups 
that aim at more definite results and lead to greater efficiency. 
But this is only the first of many problems. We are facing 
2. questions of the time beyond the junior year for attaining the 
| Ph.D. degree, of adjusting the scheme of counting the last two 
years toward both arts and professional degrees, of the place of 
the A.B. degree, of the age when the period of general education   
 
-P-A-G-E-503
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 489 
should end, and of a possible reorganization of elementary and 
secondary education. But these questions are not ready for 
solution and hardly belong to the work of the committee at the 
present time. 
When by economy—this does not mean more cramming, but 
less—as much can be. accomplished in the elementary and secon- 
dary schools and in the first two years of college as is now done 
in the full 16 years, the last two years of college can count 
toward graduate and professional, degrees, and two years in the 
whole period can be saved. In other words, the graduate school 
and the professional schools constituting the university would be 
built on the first two years of college. The present device is a 
makeshift. Finally, this whole discussion is to be understood 
as looking toward a very different thing than the shortening of 
the college course. 
Conclusions. The committee draw the following general 
conclusions: f 
1. The contemporary judgment is that the period of general 
education should be shortened at least two years. 
2. This judgment is supported by the demands of society to- 
day, both practical and ideal. 
3. It is claimed that more will be accomplished for a people 
if the preparatory stage of education ends at a reasonable period 
and special aims be emphasized while the mind is at a high degree 
of adaptability, energy, and interest. 
4. In the elementary and secondary period, economy through 
selection, elimination, vital methods, relation to modern life 
would yield much better results, and little or nothing would be 
lost by the proposed change in time. 
5. The American college in its present form presents problems 
for immediate solution; there is no longer an excuse for it as a 
mere four-year addition to the two earlier periods of education. 
The history of European education supports this view. This is 
not the same question as that of abolishing the college or of 
shortening the college course. 
6. It is recommended that all university colleges organize the 
last two years in’ view of the coming elimination of two years in 
the whole period of preparatory education, and make them of 
the university type in form and method. When the college degree 
can be reached at about 20, those two years can become a part 
of the real university, consisting of a reorganization of the pres- 
ent graduate and professional schools.

7. It is recommended that the “National Association of 
State Universities” and the national “Department of Superin- 
tendence” be urged to continue their. work on this problem— 
both the economy of time in the period of general education 
and the form or reorganization throughout; that the ‘Association 
of American Universities” be invited to codperate. Upon these 
bodies will rest the responsibility of a final solution.

TYPICAL EXPERIMENTS FOR ECONOMIZING TIME IN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS * 
By Franx E, Taompson 
There is ample material, and excellent material too, for a 
chapter or even a book on this subject. This paper must be 
limited to some general observations on the economizing of time 
and a brief but, it is hoped, a faithful characterization of the 
types to which the various experiments are readily reduced. In 
the first place, let it be said that all of the persons who are 
experimenting and the hundred or so who have taken the trouble, 
often a great deal of trouble, to respond to inquiries, are appar- 
ently impressed deeply with the belief that so far, the possi- 
bilities of our education have not been anywhere nearly realized. 
Furthermore, and this is an exceedingly healthy condition, they 
believe pretty generally that it is not one little thing nor even 
some one considerable thing that is needed to make the system 
yield these larger results. A surprising proportion of those who 
have answered—easily 75 per cent—indicate more or less expli- 
citly their conviction that all of our educational procedure will 
need to be examined and later adjusted, one part to another and 
every part to every other part, before it will produce results

tion, Part I. 1915. Pp. 28-36. Abridged.

ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 491 
commensurate with its possibility. The same persons seem confi- 
dent that such readjustment is entirely feasible, is even already 
well begun. Not many have indicated very much interest in the 
shortening of the period of education, but almost everyone, 
explicitly or by implication, would have much more accomplished 
within this period. The impression would seem to be that our 
aims for education are not far from right, that our materials, 
generally speaking, are not badly suited, and, with a few excep- 
tions, that the period in which our work is to be done is about 
right, but that so far we have not begun to arrange these materials 
nor emphasize activities to the attainment of aims within the 
time allowed to anything like their possibilities. Fully nine- 
tenths of the experiments and suggestions reduce to attempts 
at better sequence of subject-matter, better correlation with the 
pupil’s ability or with other subjects, more industry on the part 
of the pupil, more effective assistance by the teacher, and other 
things of the same general sort. Educators are trying to save 
time, not to the end of having more time for something else than 
education, but to the end of having more in it of education; in 
general, “economy of time” is but a synonym for “efficiency.” 
Despite the fact that the problem is not anywhere regarded as 
simple and that practically no one has a panacea to propose, 
the experiments under way, or suggested, readily reduce to com- 
paratively few types. The experiments of each type all, or 
practically all, aim to do what was just suggested, namely, to 
make more of the possibilities inherent in materials, pupils, and 
teachers in the present time allotment. Apparent exceptions, 
such, for example, as shortening the elementary course of study 
one or two years, show on examination that the advocate con- 
templates for the pupil a longer course either in some trade or 
technical school, somewhere about the high-school age, or in 
professional, cultural, or research activities at the graduate level. 
Almost no one indicates a wish to get the student completely out 
of school at an earlier age. Some would get the pupil in touch 
with life’s activities earlier, but practically all would accomplish 
this either by bringing such activities more actually into the 
school or by taking the school (or its students) more into the 
midst of such activities. Again no one seems anxious to termi- 
nate the child’s connection with the schools at an earlier period. 
Though some of the types enumerated and some of the instances 
specified under the types which follow may not at first reveal 
their pertinence to the economizing of time, the instances have  
-P-A-G-E-506
oe ee ee ee eee oe eae ay meme Reve ey fee ee sayy 
492 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
all been adduced as attempts at that end, many of them, of 
course, in the better-use-of-time sense. 
| | 
BRIEF CHARACTERIZATION OF TYPES DISCOVERED 
1. Regrouping of the school years—The experiments under 
this type are numerous and include such regroupings as are com- 
monly known as the six-six plan, the six-three-three plan, the 
seven-one-four plan, the six-two-four plan, the seven-five plan, 
and the seven-two-three plan. Closely associated with these in 
several instances are plans for the elimination of the eighth 
grade, but, on examination, in most instances there is no true 
elimination of the eighth-grade work. Some of it is usually 
found to be crowded down into the lower grades and some of it 
has been pushed ahead into the higher grades. Where, by this 
regrouping “elementary” education is shortened, the purposes 
and probably the effects are the clearing of the course to some 
extent of nonessentials; the bringing of goals (such as gradua- 
tion, the conclusion of a certain course of study, etc.) closer; 
getting pupils into intermediate or high-school earlier; “speed- 
ing up”; keeping pupils in school longer; securing better corre- 
spondence of certain types of work with “epochs” in the child’s 
life; dividing the work into more reasonable instalments; and 
providing better shunting-points that pupils may, to better 
advantage, change from one course or type of school to another 
parallel with it. According to testimony, these plans work well, 
and inasmuch as the differences between them are not so great 
after all, especially at what may be regarded as the crucial 
point—the seventh and eighth grade—we may predict that some 
one of them, probably the six-three-three plan, will soon take 
a decided lead over the others and the present eight-four plan. 
2. Modifications of grading and promotion schemes.—A great 
many schools are trying out grading and promotion schemes, in 
general by making more subdivisions of the year grade, such as 
half-year grades; term grades (usually twelve weeks); quarter- 
year grades; and no grades at all, that is, ungraded sections; 
“quick” and “slow” sections. Promotions, in most instances, 
are possible at any and all of these grade divisions; and over and 
above that, in some instances, by subjects, on the basis of spe- 
cial examinations; and for work carried’ “with honor.” The 
purposes specified are: bringing goals closer; spurring the pupil 
to his best by competition with his own record, with the records  
-P-A-G-E-507
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 493 
of his school and of other schools, and with his fellows; making 
it possible for each pupil to find the pace best suited to his health, 
ambitions, or peculiarities; making possible a change of pace, 
without serious inconvenience, on occasion or necessity. Enthu- 
siastic reports of good results are the rule in connection with this 
type of experiment, and there can be little doubt that much 
has been done and will be done in these ways to accommodate 
the individual pupil and to bring into education more effectively 
one of the greatest factors in any improved efficiency scheme— 
competition. 
3. Rearrangements and eliminations of subject-matter — 
These experiments might almost be classed as of two different 
types—rearrangements and eliminations—were it not for two 
facts which examination of them reveals: that the two are 
always complicated in any specific instance and that as a rule 
there is no real elimination, but rather minimization, transference, 
or substitution; for example, a topic may drop out of arithmetic 
but reappear, in modified form in geography. It is difficult to 
characterize the experimentation of this type for the reason that 
it is going on in all of the subjects and in all of the grades. Per- 
haps the most salient thing to be noted is that a challenge of 
its right to its place and emphasis is being put to every subject 
and topic. Another salient characteristic is a search after logical 
and psychological sequence, correlation, and subordination. The 
aims most frequently specified are: to relieve the pupils of dead 
and uninteresting occupation; to employ them with things of 
which they can see the importance; to avoid cluttering their 
minds with bric-a-brac of curious and antique sort; to com- 
pensate for paucity of detail by clarity of outline; to secure 
the study of subjects at more favorable periods of the pupil’s 
development; by correlation and concentration to “kill two birds 
with one stone.” 
4. Extra-time and emphasis schemes —Extra time is pro- 
vided for in after-school classes, special classes, evening schools, 
summer schools, and by ingenious adjustments in some instances 
which permit the pupil to emphasize his more difficult subjects in 
time taken from easier ones. The purposes of these experiments 
are variously specified as: giving the pupil a chance to keep 
up by means of extra work instead of falling behind; to get 
ahead in time or power if he chooses; to maintain during inter- 
school periods, (for example, in the summer) a hard-earned 
momentum; to keep pupils in the spirit of scliool work, to save

Boe | SECONDARY EDUCATION 
time that otherwise would have to be given to the warming-up 
process. Some of the most hopeful reports of progress have been 
given in connection with these innovations. In some places the 
whole spirit of schools and community would seem to have been 
changed. Comparison with European school systems, especially 
those of Germany, France, and Switzerland, tends to force upon 
us the conviction that so far we have not made enough of our 
schools in a time way, that is, they do not take up enough of our 
time, are not in our lives enough; modern industrial conditions 
no longer very generally justify numerous and long vacations. 
We are realizing more and more that education is not an incident 
of life, but, instead, a very large part of it. More than that, we 
are beginning to realize, when we think in world-terms, that 
preparation for the world’s work cannot be made in brief and 
intermittent attacks. 
5. Tying the school up with the life and occupations of the 
community—This sort of thing is reported from every part of 
the country and usually as though it were (as it is) the discovery 
of the times. It takes on many forms, such as allowing credit for 
non-academic exercises in school-time; allowing credit for work 
done at home or in the shop or store; arranging for industrial 
work in connection with school work; introducing into the school 
the study of community phenomena; interesting the home, church, 
press, and other institutions in the school’s activities. The rea- 
sons alleged are that these things make for greater attractiveness 
of school life, for insight into the relationships of school and life, 
for fuller occupation of the pupil’s powers, for the larger power 
that comes through versatility. There can be no doubt that, 
rightly administered, all these advantages obtain and that all 
of the arguments urged in favor of extra-time schemes apply 
equally well here; in fact, these are the ways, to quite an extent, 
in which to expend extra time. 
6. Modifications of recitation, assignment, and study schemes. 
These instances are almost as numerous as the schools of the 
country, and the substitutions proposed for the present usages’ 
are of every degree of ingenuity. That there are enormous un- 
realized possibilities in the contact of the pupil with the teacher 
and in the exercises in which the pupil engages, or should engage, 
seems to be a profound and widespread conviction. The more, 
common instances reported are such as the setting aside of a 
part of the recitation period for supervised study; devoting differ- 
ent recitations to different and carefully discriminated uses, such 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 495 
as reviews; preparation for future lessons; application of prin- 
ciples to problems; giving pupils assignments of a degree of 
difficulty adjusted to age and experience—all to the end that the 
pupil may come to acquaintance with, and use of, his mind; 
acquaintance with, and respect for, the minds of others; capacity 
to express himself on short notice. All these and many more are 
legitimate aims of the recitation, the study period, and various 
less formalized school exercises. The agitation in this field is a 
matter of immense promise. We have long said that it is not 
what one does that counts so much, it is the manner in which he 
does it. We still more than half believe (the wish being father 
to the thought) that there is a good deal in formal discipline. 
Now that we are really looking into the possibilities of teacher- 
pupil and pupil-school contacts, we may expect to realize some- 
thing as good as if not better than the things which formal 
discipline, were it a possibility, would give us. 
7. The training of superintendents, principals, and teachers 
for expert service —Here again the air is full of hope. Teacher- 
training institutions are seriously, and as never before, consider- 
ing just what goes into the make-up of the successful teacher. 
The teacher is being analyzed out to his ultimate constituents. 
He is being thought of no longer, or at any rate not so much, 
in a sentimental way. He is an expert. His function is to help 
children to learn—to become. He is thought of as immoral 
if he wastes time or permits it to be wasted. He is being held 
almost universally to a more strict account than even the minister. 
A great many of those who report see in the teacher the key to 
the whole economy problem. He is the inspirer, the technically 
trained adviser, as well as and more than the taskmaster. Not 
only are certification requirements and plans for such require- 
ments stipulating more in detail the teacher’s qualifications, but 
numerous provisions are being made and advocated for the 
improvement of teachers while in service. To make the teacher’s 
profession one of dignity and worth could well be one of the 
most practical objectives in the campaign for wise economy of 
time; in fact, and obviously, no advanced ground can be taken 
and held without the dependable teacher. 
8. Measurement and appraisal of results—This is presented 
last, not because least in importance nor because less frequently 
mentioned, but rather because everything else is, in a way, de- 
pendent upon it. School people are trying everywhere, some with 
scientific insight and some without, to estimate the outcomes, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-510
496 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
results, following upon their hard work. There is general, whole- 
sale, and wholesome suspicion of ritual in education and con- 
ventional justifications of ritual. It is quite unnecessary here 
to mention the proposed tests and measurement scales with which 
we are all familiar, or the surveys which are being undertaken or 
have been completed in all parts of the country. It may not be 
irrelevant to call attention to the fact that even the rank-and-file 
teacher is beginning to talk in terms of surfaces of frequency, the 
personal equation, etc., and their relations to the marking system, 
and that even in remote places the superintendent or principal is 
discussing such matters in teachers’ meetings. From the move- 
ment for standards and measurements it is expected that we 
shall be able better to say just what is being done, just what each 
is doing, so that the educator shall be guilty neither of too much 
nor of too little endeavor, that one pupil may be rated accurately 
with reference to another, that one school may be rated accurately 
with reference to another, that one teacher may be rated ac- 
curately with reference to another, all to the end that com- 
petition may be intelligently and effectively encouraged. 
Some other types of “progressive experiments in economizing 
time” appear in the returns, but will not be discussed in this 
paper. One other at least ought to be mentioned—the general 
campaign for improvement of the health and “condition” of the 
pupils—and its mention is probably sufficient to bring to mind 
its intimate and enormously important relation to any true 
economizing of time. 
These gleanings, which are here so broadly sketched, seem to 
the writer to accord perfectly with the view expressed in the first 
section, that essentially, the problem of economizing time in 
education in the mind of the American educator reduces simply to 
making better use of time. Few persons, we take it, will be 
found who think that we have not time enough in which to do the 
work of education, and quite as few, probably, who think that 
the material, the subject-matter, available for education is not 
adequate. We have the things to do with and we have the time 
in which to do; we are doing pretty well as it is; but we are 
trying to do better—to use the materials we have, in the time 
we have, for the production of better results. We ought not to 
be in doubt as to the nature of these results; the very purpose of 
“America,” its democracy, indicates as the duty and the program 
of education in America: to raise the levels of skill, intelligence, 
and character in as many as possible, as high as possible, as soon 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
  
ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 497 
as possible. This is our aim of education, and this is why we 
should economize time. 
To economize time it is required that the right persons, under 
the right leaders, shall use the right materials, at the right time, 
in the right way. The right persons are those who are in “con- 
dition” to work and who see that the work they are doing is 
pertinent to the attainment of reasonably immediate and attrac- 
tive goals. The right leaders are those teachers, principals, super- 
intendents who are clear as to the purpose and worth of life, who 
believe in life, and who are possessed of the appropriate knowledge 
and technique. The right materials are such exercises as will 
lead, and can be seen by those who take them to lead, definitely, 
and with fair directness, to worthy and desired goals. The right 
time is early—before the edge of interest is dulled—before ir- 
relevant habits are formed. The right way is industriously, 
competitively, cheerfully; with as much freedom as possible from 
distraction; with occasional refreshment and reanimation. 
The right carrying out of such a program requires the further 
segregation of its elements. It is necessary to see clearly the 
particular matters administration must work with and upon, 
that emphasis and correlation may be intelligent. It is necessary 
to figure out just what are the means of improvement—of eco- 
nomy. We shall not be far wrong if we say we are economizing 
or getting in a way to economize wherever we are really securing 
one or more of the following: (1) better “condition” of pupils; 
(2) more definite, attractive, and immediate, as well as distant, 
goals; (3) a course of study more pertinent in content and more 
psychological in sequence; (4) wiser, more tactful, and more 
human teachers; (5) a student-body more devoted and indus- 
trious, as well as cheerful; (6) a completer elimination or mini- 
mization of distractions; (7) more timely beginnings in all acti- 
vities; (8) more industrious prosecution of work; (9) keener 
competition of the pupil, with himself and with others; (10) 
saner refreshment and reanimation of pupils. 
That these are the means to a higher educational efficiency— 
to the economizing of time—and that they are believed in by 
American educators, is made to look probable by the fact that 
practically all attempts, of which we have learned, to improve 
things, in whatever part of the country, readily appear as at- 
tempts to accomplish one or more of them. These attempts are 
various—are undertaken sometimes with more, often with less, 
vision of the whole problem, but all of them are earnest attempts

INTELLIGENCE TESTS AND ECONOMY OF TIME* 
| By Arruur W. Katrom 
Tests, either intelligence or achievement, may be given for 
three reasons: (1) for the purpose of collecting data; (2) for 
the purpose of satisfying the curiosity of the teacher; (3) for 
the purpose of bringing a definite constructive help to the teacher 
in guiding and aiding her in dealing with some of the problems 
with which she is confronted. 
Up to the present, much of the work of educational measure- 
ment has been concerned with the first step. This is important. 
It has fhadd, it possible to establish standards, it has confirmed 
the theories that the educational product is variable and not con- 
stant, it has emphasized and placed on a more or less scientific 
basis, perhaps, the greatest educational fact of the past genera- 
tion, namely, individual difference. There is still need for a 
great deal of work to be done along this line. This research work 
is the work of universities, foundations, and similar bodies and 
not the work of city departments, which are supported by public 
money. Their research work, per se, is a by-product. 
It isa good sign to see the teacher’s curiosity aroused to know 
what her class will do with certain tests. Perhaps she has a 
suspicion that Her class will not show marked signs of individu- 
ality because Her class was a selected group and because children 
of about the same grade of ability were put together in her room. 
Therefore she is curious to see if some of the theories of the 
savants can not be exploded and is much surprised to find that 
there is, perhaps, as great variation in her room as in another 
room not so carefully selected. 
The ror who is curious to know what will happen when a 
test is given should be greatly encouraged, because out of the 
“knowing” is going to come “doing.” Out of the knowledge of 
where each pupil stands is going to come a better directed effort 
to help those who need help, to drill those who need drilling, and 
to guide those who need guiding. The efficient teacher is the 
one who is accepting all the help which tests can give in pro- 
moting, drilling, and guiding. Such a teacher makes it justi-

fiable for a city school system to expend public money for a 
department of research. Directly or indirectly such a depart- 
ment makes it possible for the taxpayer’s son and daughter to be 
better and more efficiently taught than before; better taught 
because both teacher and pupil have a definite aim toward which 
to press, and more efficiently taught because the teacher with a 
more direct knowledge of what the child is able to do can save 
valuable time. 
Intelligence Tests—During the past few years intelligence 
tests have held a prominent place in the testing program of 
departments of research and of all up-to-date superintendents. 
Such tests are fraught with a good deal of difficulty unless one 
is careful how the results are used and unless the one in charge 
realizes the limitations of such a test. Two cases will illustrate 
what I mean. 
In a certain city one of the well-known group intelligence 
tests was used and a certain pupil scored low. The score was so 
low that the pupil was judged feeble-minded by the principal, 
and the parents were asked to withdraw the pupil from the 
school. The parents objected, and when he was tested by a 
competent person, using the Binet-Simon scale, the boy showed 
an intelligence quotient of 123. 
The second case was a girl in one of our Boston schools who 
tested low with the National Intelligence Test but who was 
judged one of the brightest children in the school by the teachers. 
The possibility of such a condition was admitted, but an indi- 
vidual test was given. The girl showed an I. Q. of 115. It was 
found upon investigation that, on the morning the group tests 
were given the girl had come from home after witnessing a brawl 
between her father and mother in which she was obliged to take 
some part. She had had no breakfast and had taken the test 
within half an hour after arriving at school. 
The giving of a group intelligence test in a public school system 
by the superintendent or director of research, may have one or 
more of a number of possible objects in view. In Boston there 
have been four main reasons for giving such tests: (1) to guide 
teachers in making promotions; (2) to guide pupils in their choice 
of courses; (3) to advance demoted pupils; and (4) to guide 
teachers in dealing with individuals who are failing in their work. 
Use of Intelligence Tests in Making Promotions. In March, 
1921, 45 districts were tested with the National Group Intelli- 
gence Tests. In spite of the request of most of the principals that 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
500 . | Hitokcitl EDUCATION 
all grades should be included, only Grades VI, VII, and VIII were 
tested, owing to the expense and inability to handle results, 
Grade VI was tested in order that the results might be used in 
the promotion of children to intermediate or junior high schools. 
Grade VII was tested with the expectation that the eighth grade 
would be better organized for promotion to high school the suc- 
ceeding year. Grade VIII was tested that teachers might have 
the data to guide them in promoting to high school. The succeed- 
ing fall the data collected from Grade VIII were also used by the 
high-school principals and teachers. 
In promoting a pupil, two factors were taken into consideration 
—his test score, and his teacher’s mark. If the two agreed, 
there was no particular difficulty in settling the question of promo- 
tion. If the individual’s test score was high and the teacher’s mark 
low, he was promoted on the basis of his test score. If the 
teacher’s mark was high and the test score low, he was promoted 
on the basis of the teacher’s mark. In either case, it will be 
noted, the pupil was given the benefit of the doubt. These pupils, 
therefore, became marked pupils and have been problems for 
study during the year. How far children who were promoted on 
teachers’ marks have succeeded will not be known until the end of 
the year. 
Intelligence Tests Aid in Guiding Pupils to Choice of Courses. 
Children entering the seventh grade in any Boston intermedi- 
ate school, may choose to take a modern foreign language, either 
French, Spanish, Italian, or German. Each school may have only 
one foreign language, however. Because this modern foreign 
language is an extra subject, only those children are allowed to 
take it, whose marks are equivalent to an average of B. 
Of 51 children in one school who were tested in the sixth grade 
and placed in French classes, 25 percent had a score of less than 
109, the median of the sixth grade. Of this 25 percent, 39 per- 
cent made good, but in every instance effort and conduct were 
excellent. Of the 75 percent who were above the median, only 2 
persons or 4 percent failed. One of these had an effort of E and 
a conduct of D. This school is typical of all intermediate schools. 
Therefore, for a pupil who scores below the median the chances 
of success with a program which requires an extra amount of work 
are about two chances out of five, and then only because effort and 
conduct are excellent. When the pupil’s score reaches 120, the 
chances of success amount almost to certainty.

When children enter high school they are required to select a 
definite course which may lead to a college, technical school, nor- 
mal school, or business. In many cases children desire to take a 
college course, who are totally unfitted either to profit by such a 
course or to handle the necessary preparatory work. Such chil- 
dren are not warranted in spending their time either in high school 
preparing for college, or in college, providing they barely reach 
the minimum requirements for entrance. 
Making a careful study of the relation between the score of an 
intelligence test and the marks obtained by an individual in his 
' high-school work, will enable us to prophesy the chances which the 
individual may have to complete his high-school work successfully. 
Table I shows that Pupil No. 1 is 14 years 8 months old. In 
the Binet-Simon Test he showed an intelligence quotient of 99. In 
the Terman Group Test he received a score of 104; and in the 
Army Alpha Test a score of 107. The marks in his elementary _ 
and high school subjects are in his major subjects. 
Number 11 in Table XX XVIII is a boy who came to one of 
our high schools at the age of 15. He entered from the Lyman 
school, which takes incorrigible cases sent by the courts. He has 
a bad temper and does not get along with other boys. He gave 
acceptable definitions for 45 words in the first column of the 
vocabulary used in the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon 
Test. He answered all but one question used in the Superior Adult

test satisfactorily. He is now taking two subjects in addition to 
his regular work and is planning to take trigonometry at an eve- 
ning school. After an hour’s talk (and he talked very freely), it is 
evident that the only trouble with the boy is the fact that he never 
had enough to do in school. He was a boy who could have done 
considerably more than was required but his spare time was used 
in getting into trouble. 
A certain boy, A. B., in one of the high schools had been taking 
an industrial course for three years. His work was eminently 
satisfactory. An older brother, however, had graduated and 
entered technical school. This had created a desire in A. B. to 
attend technical school also. He had previously tried the tech- 
nical course and failed. The mother requested that the boy be 
tested to find out whether he was capable of doing the work of a 
technical school. The boy tested slightly above normal. After 
a long talk in which the boy agreed that he would rather be a 
good mechanic than a poor or fair civil engineer, it was decided 
that he should re-enter the mechanical course. At the last report 
the boy is happy and contented, doing a thing which he can do 
well. 
A second case in the same school, a boy who remained there be- 
cause his father so insisted, had an I.Q. of 79. He had failed in 
freshman classes for two years and was failing the first year in 
the sophomore class. Since giving the first test the boy has been 
withdrawn. The practice, however, of withdrawing a boy who is 
not keeping up, even though he may not be able to do so, is not 
a solution of the matter. The boy has a right to as much of an 
education as can be given. The state is insisting on more and 
more. 
Determining mental ability for purposes of differentiating be- 
tween those fitted to do the work now required at any stage of the 
educational program, and those unfitted to do the work, means 
the organizing of a suitable program for those who find the present 
curriculum ill-adapted to their particular needs. In determining 
this mental ability, an important question arises regarding the 
extent to which it is wise to go in our differentiation.

MENTAL TESTS AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY * 
By N. F. Stump 
One of the greatest contributions that psychology has made to 
education is the scientific study of individual differences. All 
wide awake teachers are aware of the fact that all school classes 
are made up of children who possess potentialities of infinite 
variety and grade. The possession of this fact and the acquisition 
of methods for the objective study of these individual differences 
are, however, two widely different things. I hope that the follow- 
ing account may be of value to teachers in the future study of 
individual differences. 
The study here presented was begun because it was found that 
seventy-six per cent of the students in the high school were below 
their ability level in scholarship in one, two, three, or four sub- 
jects: 17% were below in one subject, 21% in two subjects, 15% 
in three subjects and 23% in four subjects. 
Purpose. ‘The primary purpose of the experiment which is 
here reported was to help high school students to change them- 
selves in scholarship from where they are to where we think they 
ought to be. The second purpose was to compare the measure- 
ment of achievement in school, as determined by the six-week 
grades, with the level of attainment that may reasonably be ex- 
pected in scholastic accomplishment from pupils who possess their 
particular type and grade of ability. The third purpose was to 
present, in some objective way, to the teachers, parents, and pu- 
pils, this relationship between mental ability and actual scholastic 
standing in school. It was hoped, furthermore that the objective 
presentation of these data, by revealing to the parent and pupil 
any failure to accomplish what he is actually able to accomplish 
might improve the individual’s attitude concerning his application 
and interest in school work, his interest in his own success and im- 
provement. 
Method of study. During Education Week the foregoing pur- 
poses were crystalized by devising a chart that would furnish us 
with the necessary facts. A graphic chart which represented in 
full the scholastic achievement attained in each subject, as indi- 
cated by the marks of the teachers in relation to the pupil’s own 
mental rating, and in relation to the median ability of the class, 
together with the average scholarship in all subjects, determined 
®The West Virginia School Journal, LITE, 170-171. February, 1925.
-P-A-G-E-518
  504 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
by calculating the percentage which each student obtained in all 
subjects, was worked out. 
It seems quite pertinent at this moment to give a rather detailed 
description of the graphic chart. At the extreme left of the chart 
there are twenty equal parts, each part representing the range 
in mental test scores ° made by each five percentile group. Each 
individual’s intelligence score was represented on the individual 
card in its appropriate place. At the extreme right of the chart 
there are twelve equal divisions, which aided in recording the vari- 
ous scholarship ratings. It will be noted that these twelve divisions 
are used for recording the grades ranging from 60 to 93. Each 
one of the twelve divisions stands for a range of 3 per cent. The 
chart was then divided horizontally into six equal parts. In this 
form the chart was mimeographed and all that was then necessary 
was to record the various data. 
After these cards were prepared for each student, one chart was 
used by the Principal, for interview with the students individually, 
and one was sent to the parents, together with a detailed descrip- 
tion of the chart. 
This is a verbatim form of the letter sent to the parents: 
Dear Patron: 
Since this is American Education Week I feel that it is fitting and proper 
that you should join us in the appreciation of the achievements of your son, 
Ate ee , attained thus far during the early part of the school year. 
We, as teachers, would enjoy very much to visit the home of every 
patron and speak to them about the work of their children, but since time 
will not permit doing this in all cases, we are trying to bring rather pertinent 
material to the parents in this way. Parents are always very welcome 
visitors to the school, and we are interested in speaking to you about the 
work of your children. 
You will note attached to this letter a profile chart which is explained 
in detail. A similar chart is being used by the teachers, in attempting 
to diagnose the needs of your son. We are interested that he should accom- 
plish the most that is possible while in school. 
We are asking that you codperate with the school and teachers, by help- 
ing your son to strengthen the weak points as indicated by the grades 
of the past six weeks. We all agree with the slogan: “A man of knowledge 
increaseth might.” 
Cordially yours, 
(Signed by the Principal.)

I will use the figure to show how the charts were explained to

John should aim to make 89 in all his subjects. 
Results. Several teachers of the Mount Hope High School in- 
formed me that some very appreciable changes in attitude have 
been manifest in many of the students. The attention given to

class work has increased. Many of the brighter students were 
stimulated and encouraged to do better work. 
Pupils possessing only average ability were also encouraged, 
since many of them were told that thzy were doing excellent 
work, even though their achievement was not up to that of the 
most gifted persons in their class. 
This method has enabled us to measure the results of instruction 
in a more efficient way. It has also aided the teachers, in pointing 
out individual differences among the pupils, in tne various classes. 
ECONOMIZING THE TIME OF THE GIFTED CHILD’ 
By Gerorce S. Counts 
The gifted child is apparently coming into his educational 
inheritance, if one may judge from the attention he is receiving 
in our journals. He is being told on every hand that he has been 
grossly maltreated, and unless we take care he will come to believe 
it himself. It has become the fashion to hurl polemics at the 
public school for its neglect of the child of superior talent. Any- 
one who champions his cause is certain of the enthusiastic accla- 
mation of students of education. In many quarters it has been 
lamented that the educational pace in American schools has been 
set by the average student with the consequent sacrifice of 
talent to mediocrity. And in the more progressive systems actual 
practice is being modified in various ways to make special pro- 
vision for the gifted child. 
Certain concomitant advances in the field of educational science 
have imparted impetus to this movement and added to its poten- 
tialities for good or evil. The invention and development of 
psychological tests have placed a powerful instrument in the hands 
of those interested in the education of the more promising children. 
By means of these tests it is already possible in a few minutes time 
to arrange a group of children into a series of sections rather care- 
fully graded from the standpoint of either ability or attainments. 
No longer can the gifted child escape the vigilant eye of the edu- 
cator, for he is almost certain to expose himself in these tests. 
We may consequently regard this mobilization against the gifted 
child as a serious matter, since the attacking party is so well 
armed. 
But why educate the gifted child? Or at least, why single him 
" Educational Review, LXIV, 233-244. October, 1922.  
-P-A-G-E-521
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 507 
out for this special and flattering attention? What are the pe- 
culiar functions to be performed by the talented citizen in a 
democratic social order? How can the promising child be best 
prepared for the discharge of these functions? It is clear to any- 
one that all of these questions are fundamental and primary in 
any consideration of the education of the gifted child, but it must 
be admitted that they have received scant attention. It has simply 
been taken for granted that it is good to educate the gifted child 
more or less on {he conventional lines, without inquiring too 
narrowly into the purposes to be served. This is due in part to our 
scorn of theories and theorizing, which is the natural reaction to 
the exaggerated theoretical emphasis of the older generation of 
educators. We also have an enthusiasm for a progress which is 
not always distinguished from change. We are a practical, opti- 
mistic, sanguine people who rejoice in movement itself without 
taking note of its direction. We are confident that things will be 
for the best. Even an American president has said that a benevo- 
lent Providence watches over the fortunes of fools and the United 
States. It is, therefore, not surprising that most of the discussion 
of the education of the gifted child has gone serenely on its way 
quite oblivious of certain of the more far-reaching considerations 
involved. But public education is a great social enterprise, and 
every departure in practice should be clearly and definitely related 
to social ends. 
A technical advance in a particular direction unaccompanied by 
a corresponding adaptation of social controls may tend to destroy 
rather than conserve society. Many of the problems that the 
world faces to-day arise from the failure to subordinate inven- 
tions and discoveries to the larger human purposes. The very 
rapid development of mechanical inventions during the past cen- 
tury and a half has created a world for which we are not ready 
socially and morally. Now it is at least conceivable that psycho- 
logical tests are to-day freighted with as large social significance 
as were these earlier inventions in the domain of physical nature. 
If ever used universally as they are used occasionally at present, 
they would be a powerful factor in determining the character of 
social stratification and might even bring into existence a new type 
of social order. We are forging a mighty instrument, which is 
neither good nor evil in itself, but which becomes either the one 
or the other according to the uses to which it is put. 
Let us see just what form this special attention to the gifted
-P-A-G-E-522
  508 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
child is taking. At least two tendencies may be observed in recent 
experiments. One looks backward, the other forward; one means 
a more or less complete return to the individual instruction of a 
century or more ago, the other a further extension of the notion 
of group instruction through the classification, into sections of 
relatively homogeneous ability, of all students pursuing a par- 
ticular subject or belonging to a particular school year or grade. 
Since the latter plan apparently has some chance of wide accep- 
tance in schools of at least moderate size, and since the rapid in- 
crease of population and the improvement of means of communi- 
cation mean a diminution in the importance of the small school, 
where the return to individual instruction is possible, the discus- 
sion in this paper will center around the practice of homogeneous 
grouping, although much that will be said will apply to any effort 
to make special provision for the promising child. This plan, of 
course, involves the segregation of the gifted children from those 
of mediocre and inferior talents. For them the methods of in- 
struction are changed somewhat to secure adaptation to a superior 
intellectual type; the course of study is usually enriched and deep- 
ened; and some provision is made for acceleration or more rapid 
promotion. 
It is not surprising that this proposal of breaking the ordinary 
class up into several groups for purposes of instruction has evoked 
considerable and even heated discussion. The opposition has 
styled this practice undemocratic, because of the separation of the 
superior child from the mass. Our faith in the common man is 
thought to be repudiated through the double action of such a 
scheme. The individual of talent is exalted, and the stamp of 
inferiority is placed on the great majority. This has been inter- 
preted as at least reminiscent of a social order in which the masses 
are subordinated to an aristocracy, a conception that has always 
been anathema in this country and which is certainly contrary to 
the spirit of our institutions. It is feared that the separation of 
the gifted child from the mass of children will promote class dis- 
tinction and develop antagonisms. Furthermore, it has even been 
maintained that the according of special attention to the gifted 
child is contrary to the fundamental conception of equality which, 
as an abstract notion, is dear to the hearts of many Americans. 
The extension of educational opportunity, so it is suggested, should 
bear an inverse rather than a direct relation to native talent, in 
order to diminish the inequalities of nature. The superior indi-
-P-A-G-E-523
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 509 
vidual does not need the advantages that education can give in 
order to be successful in the struggle of life, while the individual 
handicapped by nature is dependent upon them. Numerous other 
objections have been raised to any plan involving homogeneous 
classification with special attention to the gifted child, but these 
two alone are pertinent to our discussion. 
The arguments advanced in favor of such a plan are likewise 
many, of which we shall mention but two. It will be observed 
that they also are so stated as to appeal to the prejudices of our 
people. The doctrine of equality is again brought into service, 
but now as the doctrine of equality of opportunity. Every indi- 
vidual should be given the opportunity of developing his talents, 
so the argument runs. Consequently in each case education 
should be adapted to the needs and abilities of the individual, and 
since the gifted child has superior talents he has a right to superior 
and more extended educational opportunity. The position is 
also frequently taken that it behooves society to give special at- 
tention to the gifted child because of the greater returns that may 
be expected from the expenditure of a given amount of educational 
energy. With the limited resources placed at our disposal for 
educational purposes it is the part of wisdom to apportion those 
resources so as to secure the largest possible return; and, as in 
agriculture we till our more fertile soils first, so in education our 
first and largest expenditures should be on the gifted child. 
In each of these arguments, either for or against the giving of 
special attention to the education of the gifted child, there is 
something of truth. But in the main they are either superficial 
or inadequate. The problem is not grasped in its entirety. There 
are appeals to prejudice and even a certain blindness to facts. 
Those who oppose this departure do not realize its possibilities for 
good, while those who favor it are apparently unmindful of the 
size of the undertaking to which they are committed and of the 
difficulties to be surmounted. Our real task is that of utilizing an 
invention without sacrificing human values. 
Let us, therefore, return to the question about which this entire 
question revolves. Why should special attention be given to the 
education of the gifted child? Certainly not because of any nat- 
ural right to special privileges. Before the law and in the moral 
order we do not recognize inequalities. There is nothing sacred 
about the gifted child, nor is his education an end in itself that 
finds justification without external reference. 
A

It is also clear that in a system of schools maintained through 
public taxation the only justification for unusual attention to any 
group, aside from a natural and laudable concern from humani- 
tarian motives for the welfare of the peculiarly unfortunate, is to 
be found in the return that society may expect from such atten- 
tion. As pointed out in an earlier paragraph, the individual of 
superior gifts is the best possible social investment. The truth 
of this statement, coming from those favoring the development, 
is apparent to even the most prejudiced. And it is undoubtedly 
for this reason that there is so much interest to-day in the educa- 
tion of the gifted. 
But it is not clear that education in the accepted sense when 
applied to the gifted child necessarily means a social gain. The 
mere enriching and deepening of the curriculum will not auto- 
matically produce the result desired. Unless superior gifts are 
linked with a strong sense of social obligation, their possessor is a 
menace rather than a blessing to society. Add to superior gifts 
superior educational advantages and the danger to society becomes 
the greater. The need of society to-day is not only a more thor- 
ough development of the special talents of its members, but also, 
and perhaps even in larger measure, the dedication of these talents 
to some social purpose. 
As educators we would be rendering a disservice rather than a 
service to society, if we should promote an educational innova- 
tion that would increase the power of its more capable members 
without at the same time making them more sensitive to the com- 
mon good. Few societies have lacked talent, but in many that 
talent has been devoted to predatory purposes. It is probably 
this fact more than anything else that lies at the base of many of 
the objections to making special provision for the gifted child. 
There is a suspicion that the individual will forget his benefactor 
and turn his superior training to his own advantage. And who 
will say that this suspicion is not well-founded in a society in 
which profit rather than service is the dominant note of industry? 
Not infrequently the self-seeking individual has ascended to a po- 
sition of power and influence and even respectability through 
ruthless disregard of all social obligation and the pitiless exploi- 
tation of the lives and fortunes of those weaker than himself. 
Certainly an educational system maintained at public expense 
should mitigate rather than foster these egoistic tendencies of 
gifted persons. This does not mean that opportunities for the ex- 
a  
-P-A-G-E-525
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 5Ir 
pression of personal initiative will be denied the individual, as 
many superficial critics maintain. There is ample opportunity 
for the utilization of every bit of enterprise which the population 
possesses in efforts to gain more complete mastery over the forces 
of nature, and to abolish ignorance, poverty, disease, crime, social 
and race antagonisms, and vulgar and obscene appreciations. 
Some identify initiative with predatory activities, because so 
much of human energy has been turned in this direction. There 
is no place in a democracy for the notion that the powerful have 
the divine right of exploitation and that the weak exist primarily 
to serve them. 
There is growing reason for apprehension on this score in so- 
ciety as we know it to-day. Observe the effects of that process of 
urbanization and industrialization which has especially character- 
ized the development of western civilization during the past cen- 
tury. Every succeeding census reports an increase in that propor- 
tion of our population living in the great industrial centers. In 
these centers the small virile community of intimate personal con- 
tacts and homogeneous interests has disappeared. Here we see 
the segregation of individuals into comparatively isolated groups 
according to talent, interests, or fortune. This constitutes a grave 
danger to social stability and welfare. Those gifted individuals 
who in an earlier generation would have occupied positions of 
leadership in their respective small communities, identifying them- 
selves with these communities and being more or less concerned 
about the fortunes of every member, are to-day in the modern 
city associated together in a group of their own and have only re- 
mote and impersonal contacts with those of more humble talents. 
Feelings of class distinction, consequently, are appearing on every 
hand. The superior individual is loyal to his own group, sanction- 
ing and defending an exploitation of the less favored members of 
society that he would not have tolerated in the little community. 
Thus in the great industrial societies of modern times there appear 
certain difficulties in securing that whole-hearted devotion to social 
amelioration on the part of the more gifted members which are 
not encountered in a less highly differentiated social order. 
From the foregoing it is clear that the education of the gifted 
child is laden with serious consequences. Such a program should 
not be entered upon light-heartedly and according to the best tra- 
ditions of American optimism. It is a matter of supreme con- 
cern, not so much to the individuals of superior gifts as to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  512 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
rest of society. The entire population must be educated regarding 
the nature and social significance of individual differences. This 
will require the revision of certain of the traditions of our people 
and the development of others. Not only must we adjust the 
curriculum to the talents of the individual, but, what is just as im- 
portant, we must also provide for the development of attitudes 
and ideals that will draft human knowledge and energy into 
human service. 
The popular notion of equality must be revised. In so far as 
native endowment is concerned, inequality rather than equality 
is the first law of nature. Enormous differences are found in the 
case of every measurable trait, and no society can afford to close 
its eyes to this fact. A stable and worthy civilization must recog- 
nize the truths of science in every field. That one man equals an- 
other in physical strength, in the manipulation of arithmetical 
combinations, or in the ability to organize and conduct chemical 
research, is of course ridiculous. Nothing but evil can flow from 
the denial of inequality here. On the other hand, that men are 
equal before the law and that they are of equal worth in the 
moral order are notions that constitute a priceless social heritage 
and to which we should hold with tenacity. But we merely play 
into the hands of the enemies of society when we confuse the lat- 
ter with the former sort of equality. Equality before the law and 
in the moral order are not objectively given, but rather are ends 
to be attained; and they can be attained only by the recognition 
of inequality in the realm of nature. 
Because of this mistaken notion of equality, we have been reluc- 
tant to admit the existence of the individual of superior natural 
gifts. It is a point about which we have been sensitive, actually 
fearing perhaps to acknowledge that through no act of his own a 
particular individual may be born into the world with either a 
robust or feeble physical inheritance, a stable or unstable mental 
constitution. We have consequently maintained a tradition that 
any ordinary individual can perform the duties of a political office, 
whether it be that of city mayor, police commissioner, or post- 
master. Place must be made in our traditions for the gifted 
citizen. 
Our failure to recognize natural inequality makes impregnable 
the position of the gifted individual who uses his gifts for the pur- 
pose of exploiting the weaker members of the community in a per- 
fectly legal way. He argues that all men are created equal, that
-P-A-G-E-527
COE i en ee ee Lea ee Ee es ee 
ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 513 
each individual therefore reaches that position in society to which 
his industry and character entitle him, and that his own superior 
position is merely the expected reward of a life regulated by the 
virtues. He maintains further, and with some pride perhaps, that 
he is a “self-made” man, and that any other individual, willing to | 
make the sacrifices that he has made, could as easily ascend to his 
position. Thus, while exploiting those less favored than himself, 
he applies as a balm to his own conscience the very doctrine of 
equality that he finds perpetually in the mouths of those he ex- 
ploits. 
It is clear, therefore, that we need not only a revision of the 
popular notion of equality, but also of the attitudes towards in- 
equalities. Our attitudes are derived from the assumption that 
differences in achievement are due essentially to moral factors. If 
an individual is born with a meagre intellectual equipment, we 
act as if he had committed some abominable moral outrage, and 
must suffer the consequences. On the other hand, the individual 
of superior gifts is encouraged in the belief that they are the re- 
ward of fortitude on his part, to which he has a moral right. The 
fact is that the first is unfortunate and the second fortunate by 
nature. There is no moral factor involved in either case at least 
in so far as the individuals themselves are concerned. We no 
longer think of condemning a man because he has been struck by 
a thunderbolt, overwhelmed by a flood, or visited by smallpox. We 
regard him as a fit subject for commiseration. Likewise, only in 
the most benighted of communities is it customary to accuse the 
blind, the crippled, and others suffering from physical defect or 
misfortune. It is time that we should endeavor to develop atti- 
tudes towards psychological traits that have now become common 
in the physical and physiological realms. The inheritance of a 
superior mental equipment should be less a cause for pride than 
for thankfulness. Individual differences are a part of the plan of 
nature and as such they should be recognized. 
There is one additional point that deserves attention in this dis- 
cussion. The special treatment of the gifted child is necessarily 
associated with some form of educational guidance. When this 
guidance is uncritical, as much of it is to-day, we have additional 
cause for grave apprehension. The opinion is not uncommon that 
it is a serious waste of talent to permit an individual of superior 
mind to engage in the more common and humble callings. The 
argument, which has a certain appearance of cogency, runs some-  
-P-A-G-E-528
  514 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
thing like this. Since it requires but a mediocre grade of intelli- 
gence to make a successful carpenter, no individual of superior 
intelligence should be permitted to enter this calling. Indeed, it 
is argued, it would be dangerous to allow such a thing to occur, 
because the individual of superior mind would not be content as a 
carpenter and consequently might as an agitator promote unrest 
and general dissatisfaction within the industry. Furthermore, the 
converse to the above proposition is also accepted as good doctrine, 
namely, that all persons intellectually gifted should be definitely 
prepared, by means of the higher education, for those professional 
and managerial occupations required by the established order in 
which success is conditioned on the possession of a high grade of 
intelligence. This notion of arranging all occupations in a graded 
series according to the intelligence quotient demanded for success 
and then guiding all individuals into the occupations that corre- 
spond to their own intelligence levels, is an attractive one and 
is certainly serviceable, but it has its limitations and even dangers. 
In its negative aspect it is sound. An individual should at least 
not be encouraged to enter an occupation requiring an intelligence 
level in all probability higher than he possesses. But that the 
principle should be applied in the other direction by excluding 
from the lower occupational levels all persons of superior intelli- 
gence is doubtful. 
The point that the enthusiastic advocates of this program of 
guidance overlook is that the direct demands of the vocation are 
not the only demands made on those engaged in it. They assume 
that the present industrial order is fixed and that the compensa- 
tion, conditions of labor, and social status of the various occupa- 
tions are determined by some immutable natural law before which 
individuals and classes must bow. Either this, or that we are 
living in a non-competitive industrial order in which no group can 
or will promote its own welfare at the expense of others. But 
few indeed would hold to either of these views. We realize fully 
that, if the position of the more humble occupations is to be raised, 
if the lot of the common man is to be ameliorated, it must be done 
in considerable measure by those engaged in these occupations, by 
the common man, under devoted leadership. Consequently there 
is need in each calling, however humble, for a limited number of 
individuals of high intellectual and moral gifts who may aspire to 
and occupy positions of leadership within their own class and thus 
lead that class up into a richer and fuller life. It is folly to expect
-P-A-G-E-529
ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 515 
this to be accomplished entirely by individuals belonging at the 
time to the more favored classes, at least until social obligation 
is taught much more effectively than it is taught to-day in our 
schools. History records few examples of the emancipation of 
one class by another. Thus, if through a system of guidance, we 
should drain out of the less fortunate classes all the superior talent 
born to them, we would deprive them of that leadership necessary 
to their salvation, close the door to the general improvement of 
the condition of these classes, and make it possible to rivet upon 
them a system for their more complete exploitation. 
The history of rural life in the United States gives us a splendid 
illustration of what to expect from the operation of this principle 
of guidance. Here the school, along with other agencies, has 
selected the more promising children and directed their attention 
away from the rural community towards the higher education and 
urban life. From generation to generation this selective process 
has gone on until to-day in certain of the more long-settled regions 
the rural population exhibits a serious lack of that intellectual 
vigor and those qualities of leadership which are necessary to the 
development of a superior rural civilization. This continued with- 
drawal of the more gifted strains from any section of the popula- 
tion is bound to produce the same result. If our desire is to cre- 
ate in this country a docile, servile, obedient proletariat, surpassing 
in these respects anything the world has yet seen, lacking in all the 
virile traits and incapable of effective protest, we can do no 
better than promote that type of educational guidance that seeks 
to remove from the ranks of the less favored classes all individuals 
of superior gifts. To some there is nothing abhorrent about such 
a social order, but it would hardly find a congenial atmosphere 
among American traditions. 
Our conclusion, then, is that special attention should be given 
to the gifted child, that on him particularly should society lavish 
its educational opportunities. The justification of this unusual 
extension of privilege, however, is not to be found in any superior 
rights to which the individual of promise is entitled, but rather 
in the large social values involved. The gifted individual is not 
sacred, although his gifts are, and so he should be taught to regard 
them. It is the chief function of the educational system to con- 
vert every normal child from a social liability into an asset, and 
the greater the gifts of the child the more necessary this is. The 
gifted citizen who recognizes no social obligation is much more
-P-A-G-E-530
ee a eae a ee eee Cees ot See ee ee 2 eae 
516 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
dangerous than the ordinary criminal of mediocre or low-grade 
intelligence. Consequently the education of the gifted child should 
insure above everything else the development of a strong sense of 
social obligation. Otherwise such expenditure involves the mis- 
appropriation of public funds and, more than that, the actual 
subversion of these funds to anti-social purposes. It is particu- 
larly necessary in the complex world of to-day, cut across, as it is, 
by class and race divisions and violent antagonisms, to bind the 
individuals of talent to the service of the larger human purposes. 
Principles involved in effecting economy of time in educa- 
tion. Economy of time together with no loss in the total educa- 
tion can be effected by continued improvements in the quality of 
teachers, selection and organization of curricula, promotion plans 
and articulation between administrative units. Such economy of 
time is in reality a better use of time. 
Loss of interest and energy result from a long preparatory 
period of unmotivated study. 
The fundamentals of education can be acquired in less than 
eight years. 
Children require differentiated training by the age of twelve. 
Excessive expenditures of time for review over-emphasize the 
importance of subject matter at the expense of the development 
of pupils’ “ability to go alone” intelligently. This principle is 
intended to encourage well-conducted and well-organized drills 
and reviews. 
The term cultural training must be redefined from time to time 
“in terms of the value of the individual in the industrial and social 
scheme.” Such a redefinition of culture should lead to a balance 
between the time and effort expended upon efficiency, culture, and 
character. 
“Education must be in harmony with its environment, but it 
must develop also original power to change the environment and 
to cope with whatever problems of efficiency and ethical conditions 
a given period may present.” 
Experiments show that “to economize time it is required that 
 
-P-A-G-E-531
  ECONOMY OF TIME IN EDUCATION 517 
the right persons, under the right leaders, shall use the right ma- 
terial, at the right time, and in the right way.” This principle 
emphasizes the importance of the following conditions: 
Better conditions of pupils. 
More definite and attractive immediate as well as remote 
goals. 
The organization of courses pertinent in content and psycho- 
logical in sequence. ‘ 
Wise, more tactful, sympathetic teachers. 
A devoted, industrious, and cheerful student-body. 
A more complete elimination of distractions. 
Timely beginnings of all the activities pursued. 
Adequate diagnosis and proper classification of pupils. 
Adequate training for one group of pupils should not preclude 
adequate training for all groups. 
The greater the talents of a child the greater the need for his 
adequate training. 
Society needs an educational system which will train thor- 
oughly the special talents of all its members and dedicate these 
talents to high social purposes.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
How much time for the elementary school? Do Americans 
require a longer period of elementary training than Europeans do? 
As pointed out in Chapter IX, European practice favors a rel- 
atively short period of undifferentiated, elementary school train- 
ing. In the case of foreign pupils who are destined for secondary 
education, this period ranges from three to five years. Only in the 
case of the foreign pupils to whom the secondary school is closed, 
does this period cover as many years as it has covered in the 
traditional American elementary school. Also, it was found in 
Chapter XII that well-informed educators of this country maintain 
that the amount of instructional material to be mastered by Ameri- 
can children during the old eight-year school can be mastered in 
seven years if America will provide herself with as skillful teach- 
ers as Germany has had for half a century. 
Furthermore, America has developed elementary schools of dif- 
ferent lengths in different parts of the country. In New England 
the nine-year elementary school has been common, while northern 
and western states have found eight -years adequate for elemen- 
tary training, and the South has managed to succeed with only 
seven years. That certain parts of the nation should require nine 
years to do that which can be done in seven years by schools in 
other localities indicates a lack of economy and a need for reor- 
ganization. This need was made emphatic by Brooks who can- 
vassed the actual practices of seven-, eight-, and nine-year 
schools.*

This canvass showed great diversity in planning the divisions 
and activities of the school day and in promotion plans. The 
diversity led Brooks to say that school practices within certain 
states as well as among all the schools canvassed are as different 
as though the reports had come from different nations with dif- 
ferent purposes and ideals. 
Investigations have been made to find out whether there is a 
difference in the proficiency of pupils who have finished elemen- 
tary schools of different lengths. In conducting an investigation 
of this kind, Melcher ? found it necessary to distinguish between 
the alleged length of the course and its real length. He found 
that representative seven-year school systems require on the aver- 
age 7.32 years for completion and that eight-year systems require 
8.25 years. By the application of certain measures of proficiency, 
Melcher found also that the scores of the elementary school pu- 
pils of Kansas City’s seven-year system are “generally equal to 
or slightly above the average scores of other cities on the same 
test.”* He found also that when the graduates of that school 
system enter universities they achieve standings which are slightly 
superior to the average grades of university students. The report 
of this investigation closes by pointing out additional advantages 
of the seven-year system as compared with an eight-year system: 
the seven-year system retains a higher percentage of pupils until 
completion of the elementary school; ninety per cent of these 
pupils enter high school; 30.4 per cent graduate from high school; 
57 per cent of the high-school graduates enter college; the seven- 
year system raises the educational level of the whole community 
a year or more; this system reduces the cost of elementary school 
education about $83 per pupil who completes the seventh grade; 
and children who must leave school at fourteen have one year’s

training in advance of what they could obtain in an eight-year 
system. In reporting upon the University of Chicago elementary 
school of seven years, Morrison comes to somewhat similar conclu- 
sions as to the effectiveness of a seven-year system.** These in- 
vestigations indicate that there is no particular virtue in the 
period of eight years as the optimal length for elementary schools. 
Such investigations indicate some of the reasons why it is desirable 
to reorganize American schools instead of allowing them to con- 
tinue in the same state of organization in which, by chance, they 
now find themselves. The readings of this chapter look toward 
such reorganization. 
THE MEANING OF SECONDARY EDUCATION * 
By Cuartes H. Jupp 
The student of American educational institutions finds himself 
very much confused when he attempts to discover the points at 
which the typical high school begins, and the point at which this 
middle school ends. There are many high schools in this country 
which carry on courses that in other communities are thought of 
as belonging to the elementary grades, and it is well known that 
many of our American colleges are in fact high schools in every 
respect except in name. The overlapping is evident in such de- 
tails as methods of organization and subject-matter of instruction. 
Take such a characteristic as departmental instruction. In the 
high school and upper schools all instruction is departmental, that 
is, the work of the mathematics department differentiates itself 
with great clearness from the work of the English department and 
from that of the Latin department. The tendency to adopt this 
mode of organization has of late appeared more and more in ele- 
mentary schools, especially in the upper grades. In defense of 
this mode of organization in the elementary school, it has been 
pointed out that departmental classes give greater freedom of adap- 
tation of school work to individual needs. Departmental classes 
permit students, for example, to go forward in certain lines, even

mentary Educational Monographs, No. 24. The University of Chicago,

REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 523 
though they may have failed in others. Departmental work also 
makes it possible for students to elect to some extent those courses 
which are best adapted to their future work. Again, it is said that 
the instruction is more efficient because the training of the teacher 
and the interest of the pupil are more highly specialized. In these 
and other respects the upper grades of the elementary school are 
supposed to gain by approaching the type of organization typical 
of the high school. 
On the other side, if we examine the college course, we find 
that there is great similarity between the work of the Freshman 
year and the work of the high school. This is perhaps most 
strikingly illustrated by reference to the subjects of instruction. 
There is not an American college in existence which does not offer 
elementary work in modern languages, elementary work in science, 
elementary work in history. More and more there is a tendency 
for the colleges to offer elementary work in classical languages. 
Greek has been almost entirely carried over to the college. Even 
the elementary phases of Latin are now being offered in many col- 
leges. It is difficult to determine how far this tendency will ex- 
tend. Without waiting for future developments, however, we are 
compelled, even at the present time, to say that the Freshman 
year of all American colleges is just as much a stage of secondary 
education as is the work that is carried on in high schools. 
In Germany one of the chief marks of distinction between sec- 
ondary edutation and higher education is to be found in the fact 
that the secondary student is put through a required curriculum, 
while the student in the higher schools, especially the universities, 
is allowed to elect freely the courses which he wishes to pursue. 
In this country we have experimented extensively with the re- 
quired and elective systems. It is perhaps bold to make any state- 
ment about what is generally accepted in the matter of elective 
courses, but there seems to be a tendency to mark off the imma- 
ture student of the high school and the first years of the college 
from the mature student of the later college years. One may 
venture the statement that it is characteristic of the high-school 
period that the student must be carefully supervised in his selec- 
tion of courses, and must be guided into those courses which form 
a coherent curriculum. It is certainly the prevailing experience of 
colleges that the Freshman and Sophomore must also be guided in 
his selection of courses. The free elective system is successful 
with advanced students in the Junior and Senior years of the col-  
-P-A-G-E-538
ee ae eee eee ee ee ee er ee ene ee Tee ee eee Te ene eee 
524 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
lege, but it is certain that the Freshmen and Sophomores are not 
yet prepared to elect without careful supervision and guidance. 
In this respect, therefore, it is obvious that the first two years of 
college and the high school are Parts of the same general period 
of education. 
The intimate relation between the high school and the institu- 
tions above and below is so vital a fact in American education 
that many movements have sprung up in different parts of the 
country looking toward an extension of the high school in one 
direction or the other. We find many high schools which induce 
students to stay on for work after they have graduated. These 
institutions are developing in the direction of what is nov classi- 
fied as college work. On the other hand, we find that many of 
the schools which aim to do secondary work as their primary 
function find it necessary to have a preparatory class for students 
who come from elementary schools which are inadequately 
equipped to give a complete training in the so-called common 
branches. 
Perhaps the most significant extension downward of the domain 
of the secondary school is that which is coming in ‘response to the 
demand for vocational education in the lower schools. Children 
who are not sure of going to high school must be allowed to pur- 
sue differentiated courses in the upper grades of the elementary 
school. The boy who is going into the trades and has no thought 
of high school cannot with equity be required to do the same 
work that»is required of the boy who is going to become a clergy- 
man and looks forward to a college education. Many boys have 
to make a choice between the trades and professions before they 
leave the seventh grade. The seventh grade must provide for such 
boys by adopting a type of organization similar to that now 
established in the high school. 
The facts which have been pointed out thus far show how vague 
is the present definition of secondary education. They also chal- 
lenge us to a thoroughgoing consideration of what is to be done in 
order to direct intelligently the evolution of our American school 
system. 
I am going to venture to make the next part of my paper as 
concrete as possible, by referring in detail to the school with which 
I am best acquainted, namely, the Elementary School and the 
High School of the University of Chicago. These two schools 
differ in some respects from the ordinary schools of like grade, but  
-P-A-G-E-539
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 525 
we are prepared to defend the thesis that what we do could be 
advantageously considered by all elementary and secondary 
schools. The schools are the laboratories of the Department 
of Education, and the business of the department is to understand 
as fully and immediately as possible the opportunities of economy 
and co-ordination of organization. 
Let me begin by commenting on the problem of organizing the 
English in the two schools, so as to avoid unnecessary duplication. 
It was found that the upper grades of the elementary school spend 
much time in reading some of the classics, and in studying the 
elements of correct composition. Most of this was repeated in 
the high school. Thus we had going on under our own roof work 
so repetitious that a child who went through the two schools re- 
peated in the first year of the high school much that he had done 
in the elementary school. There is nothing so destructive to a 
child’s interest as the thoughtless repetition in which our schools 
indulge. We who are older in years and patient in mind would 
refuse to listen to the same sermons gone over again and again. 
But we seem to think it our duty to make children go over the 
same poem or story several times. The conscientious child reads 
the poem at home. He comes to class and hears some other child 
read it. The teacher then reads it. The conscientious child now 
reads it again, in review, and takes an examination on it. He 
goes on into a higher school and a new teacher takes him in hand 
and announces with great enthusiasm that now this same poem will 
be read and studied. ‘Please read the poem several times at 
home before coming to class tomorrow!”” When tomorrow comes 
the poem is once more read by someone, as though it had never 
been read before, etc., etc. One parent said to me not long ago, 
“My boy is now reading and studying the ‘Ancient Mariner’ for the 
third time. He read it in the eighth grade, he read it in high 
school, and now his class in college is taking it up!” Is it any 
wonder that we find students more intelligent about the working 
of our elective system than are we ourselves? Think of three 
teachers of English managing the destinies of a boy and the in- 
terests of the “Ancient Mariner” absolutely ignorant of the sphere 
of each other’s work and influence. 
We found in our schools that a little consultation between the 
English teachers brought out enough of these repetitions so that 
we were able to eliminate one year of English. We put the chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-540
  526 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
dren who had done our eighth-grade English directly into second- 
year high-school English. 
We found a similar situation in science. In common with the 
better elementary schools, ours had irbdhced a good deal of 
science work. In the first year of our high school we are giving 
a general science course. This we believe in keeping with the 
best practices. Yet there is 2 lack of co-ordination here. We 
encountered some embarrassment in dealing with two types of 
students who enter our high school. There are those who come to 
us from schools which have very little nature-study. For such 
students a general first-year science course seems to have many 
advantages. For other students, especially those who come from 
schools teaching much nature-study, this first-year general course 
is very uninteresting, because it is so repetitious and elementary. 
What shall be done? The remedy seems simple, but it requires the 
intelligent co-operation of two schools. Let the elementary school 
administer much general science, let the high school take up the 
specialized sciences and give the student more systematic differen- 
tiated courses. 
A third illustration may be drawn from our experience with 
language instruction. For a number of years the elementary 
School of the University of Chicago has offered to students in the 
fourth grade and upward the opportunity of electing a modern 
foreign language. The student may take either French or German. 
Whichever language he elects, he will pursue this study during 
the remainder of his elementary-school course. He does not have 
each day as long a period of study as he will have when he comes 
later to take up the same subject in the high school. He does not 
undertake to do the same kind of work. For example, he does 
not, in the elementary course, emphasize grammatical study. He 
does, however, acquire the ability to pronounce the language at a 
period in life when it is easier for him to take on the pronunciation 
of a foreign language than it will be when he grows older and more 
fixed in his methods of pronunciation. We regard the courses in 
modern language as very desirable in the Elementary School. It 
was found difficult, however, to take advantage of the work which 
the children had done in the Elementary School, when these 
children came to the High School. The instructors in the High- 
School department did not know exactly what had been done in 
the lower grades, and the methods which had been pursued in the 
lower grades were not identical with those which were used in the
-P-A-G-E-541
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 527 
High School to train up introductory students. As a result many 
of the children who had spent four years in the Elementary School 
in studying modern languages were obliged to begin the work as 
though it were entirely new on entering the High School. This 
showed, of course, that there was no proper correlation between 
the two institutions. Gradually an arrangement has been worked 
out which has led to some modifications of the methods of teach- 
ing languages in the Elementary School, and to a very large modi- 
fication in the attitude of the High-School instructor; with the re- 
sult that the children now get the advantage of the work which 
they have done in the Elementary School. There has been abso- 
lutely no loss or omission in their education, but there has been 
such a recognition of the good results of the work they have done 
in the Elementary School that the High School can begin its work 
at a higher level. Credit, if one wishes to put it that way, for a 
year of high-school work, can with all propriety be allowed to these 
children. They have done the same work that is expected of others 
who begin the language in the Freshman year of the High School, 
and they are amply qualified to go on with the higher studies in 
these same fields. 
The problem of dealing with mathematics is somewhat more 
difficult, and yet it is perfectly clear to all who have been inter- 
ested in the problem of organizing mathematics in the elementary 
and high school that a very radical change needs to be made. 
The elementary school certainly has the right to include in its 
course a great deal more constructive geometry than has hereto- 
fore been common in the elementary course. The elementary 
school also has a right and duty to include some of the simpler 
‘algebraical methods of procedure. The use of the simple equation, 
the use of the unknown quantity, can readily be taught in the 
grammar grades, and the ease with which these devices make it 
possible to solve many problems that heretofore have been solved 
by cumbersome arithmetical methods justifies the introduction of 
algebra into the elementary school course. 
I need hardly emphasize the importance of effecting economies 
of the type which have just been described, wherever such econo- 
mies are possible. The pressure which is felt throughout our 
whole civilization for economy of time in education, certainly 
has commanded enough attention in recent years to be worthy of 
the closest attention on the part of teachers. If we can save a 
year of the time of elementary pupils, and bring them into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
  | | 
528 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
secondary school at a period a year earlier than is customary, we 
shall have helped to solve the urgent social question which con- 
fronts all educators. 
I have illustrated my remarks by reference to our schools, but 
I believe the same general plan is coming in all schools. Elemen- 
tary-school teachers are convinced from their experience that 
there is at some point in the elementary course a waste of time 
and energy. There is a great deal of undue reviewing in the 
seventh and the eighth grades. Teachers in the seventh grade re- 
view at the end of this year in the hope that their pupils may be 
better prepared to go on with the work of the eighth grade. At 
the beginning of the eighth grade there is a long and laborious 
review of what has been done before, and finally, at the end of the 
eighth grade, there is a long period of preparation for the work of 
the high school. All this reviewing is wasteful. There ought to 
be a continuous review of the work which the children have done 
in earlier years, by a constant revival in ordinary routine of the 
principles and information which have been acquired in the earlier 
years. There ought never to be the necessity of a long period of 
review, such as is too common in our schools at the present time. 
I find support for the doctrine which I have been defending in 
the fact that such schools as those of Concord and Berlin, New 
Hampshire, are making an effort to differentiate sharply between 
the elementary school and the high school at the end of the sixth 
grade. These experiments exhibit a clear conviction that the 
seventh and eighth grades as now organized are not satisfactory. 
Furthermore, in personal conference with many teachers in these 
grades I find a widespread feeling that the reviewing to which 
reference was made above is not justified. It may be that the 
Concord plan is the best one. There are, however, two different 
issues involved in the matter. First, there is a matter of actual 
economy of time; the second problem is the problem of better 
organizing the work. 
Thus far I have dealt with the problem of the high school and 
its extension downward. Let us turn now to the problem of 
extending the high school upward. 
The discussion will, I believe, proceed from this point most 
clearly if I lay down a definite program of organization and at- 
tempt to defend this program. I am sorry not to be able to offer 
a concrete case where the program has been carried out, as I was 
able to do in dealing with the relation between high school and
-P-A-G-E-543
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 529 
elementary school. The program which I wish to advocate is the 
fusion of the first two years of the college with the high school. 
The work which is now done in six years, that is, in four years of 
high school and two of college, can under proper organization 
be completed in five years. For convenience I shall speak of this 
five-year school as a secondary school. 
_ It should be noted again that the subject of discussion at this 
point is economy of time. Assuming that no radical change is de- 
sirable in the general course to be following by a student, there is 
a possibility of economical organization. The first year was saved 
between the elementary school and the high school; a second 
year can be saved between the high school and the college. When 
the waste in our present system is eliminated then we shall be in 
a position to work out readjustments of a broad type in the content 
of the course. The program which is now to be defended is a 
program of economy of one year between the high school and the 
college. 
The first argument which I wish to present is somewhat indirect. 
Students who go to college under our present plan are often 
mentally and socially immature. The shock of readjustment is 
very great, and many a student loses much time and energy in 
the radical change in his habits of life and study. Society has 
recognized this fact and has attempted to make the adjustment as 
easy as possible for the immature student by keeping him for the 
first years of his college work as near home as possible. The most 
striking fact which has been brought out in recent investigations 
is that American colleges are local institutions. The colleges of 
the great universities are local and the small colleges are chiefly 
justified in their struggle for existence by the fact that they bring 
the advantages of a complete education to boys and girls who 
could not go far away to attend college. The defense is valid, 
because a local institution is likely to save the student from some 
of the dangers of readjustment. Why not extend the advantages 
now provided here and there to as wide a range of people as 
possible? If the local college does a service when it provides that 
a group shall enjoy under favorable conditions an extension of 
high-school training, why not make the advantages of such an 
extension accessible to all children through an enlargement of the 
local institution best fitted to carry on this work? Strong public 
high schools ready to do the work of the Freshman and Sophomore 
years are the right and duty of every community. They exist to-

530 SECONDARY bn igi 
day in a form benich calls for very little enlargement, in all the 
leading centers of population in this country, 
It may be said that the plan which is proposed will only put off 
the day of readjustment. The student going from the enlarged 
high school will still be obliged to meet new and exacting condi- 
tions in the higher university to which he goes. True, there will 
have to be a readjustment, but it will be relatively easy be- 
cause the student will be more mature and more fixed in habits 
of concentration. Furthermore, the later years of college work 
are more flexible and the adjustment will be easier because the 
student who elects his courses with some definite end in view, will 
not have to repeat at the arbitrary demand of the Freshman in- 
structor the English and the science and the history which are 
now regarded as necessary to complete a general education. 
~The second argument against our present organization is much 
more direct. Consider the educational waste and lack of co-ordi- 
nation which is exhibited every year, when colleges admit students 
with conditions. A student admitted with conditions is a living 
evidence that secondary education is to be completed in the col- 
lege under a system of instruction which is not frankly and fully 
organized for that purpose. A college which accepts such a 
student is saying something like this: ‘The subject in which you 
are not prepared is indeed stated in our catalogue to be a logical 
and necessary preliminary to our higher work, but we are a good 
deal in doubt about the truth of what is said in our catalogue. 
If you will consent to take the major risk, and let us remind you 
from time to time that you are probably unable to do our work, 
we will accept your tuition and admit you to our classes and 
undertake from now on to organize your course.” It would be 
most wholesome for college faculties to go into the details of the 
cases of conditioned students. Sometimes the fact is that a condi- 
tioned boy is strong in mind and body. Perhaps he discovered 
in high school that he has a future. He will be an honored 
alumnus of any college that knows enough to let him in. Why 
talk about him as conditioned? Why not say frankly that his 
training of the secondary or general type is incomplete and frankly 
provide that he shall take first what he needs, namely, training 
of a secondary and general type? The trouble now is that we 
talk as though his secondary training were completed; we let 
him into the college family, and keep reminding him that his 
adoption is of doubtful legality and of uncertain wisdom.
-P-A-G-E-545
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 531 
Another type of conditioned student is he who is not strong 
in mind or body. He is let in and told to make bricks without 
straw. He is known to be unequipped with the rudiments, and 
is confused and worn out. He must meet at the same time both 
the usual requirements of regular work, and also the requirements 
growing out of his unpassed entrance requirements. His con- 
fusion blossoms into mental chaos, and then our educational 
machine cuts him off. When will colleges realize that an inade- 
quately prepared student, inadequately taken care of in his first 
year, and ejected with all the pomp and the circumstance of a 
| faculty vote, is an evidence of institutional imbecility rather than 
of student failure? 
We have reached a period of rapid expansion of our secondary 
schools; can we not see broadly enough to organize these great 
institutions so that they shall comprehend all that belongs within 
a single scheme of secondary education? I believe we can and 
shall. The secondary school ought to reach down and take the 
child who is now wasting time in the eighth grade. It ought to 
expand so as to give instruction to the immature students who are 
now working in the first two years of college. Tt ought to render 
the whole organization so much more economical than it is now 
that time shall be saved for the student, while at the same time 
the course is greatly enriched. 
ENLARGING THE AMERICAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL * 
By W. C. Bactey anp Cuartes H. Jupp 
A short preface will serve to indicate the origin and purpose 
of this article. Its authors have from time to time found them- 
selves in disagreement with regard to the junior high school. 
Deliberate consideration of the points of disagreement convinced 
them that there are certain fundamental educational principles 
involved in the organization of the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades to which they can both unreservedly subscribe. They 
have thought it desirable that a joint statement of such funda- 
mentals be drawn up. The following article is the result. They 
are prepared to share alike responsibility for every statement in 
this article. 
There can be no doubt in the mind of any careful student of 
education that there are important changes going forward in 
*The School Review, XXVI, 313-323. May, 1918.
-P-A-G-E-546
  532 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. These changes are re- 
lated in many ways to the fact that much greater numbers of 
pupils than ever before in our school history are passing through 
these grades. The time was, before the studies in retardation, 
when the number of pupils who reached the eighth grade was 
comparatively small, and the entering class in the high school 
contained so small a percentage of the pupils who entered the 
eighth grade that the matter of the transition was a much less 
urgent matter than it is today. Now school officers are making 
every effort to carry pupils forward as far and as fast as possible, 
and the course of study and the organization of the grades are 
being odes with a view to keeping pupils in school. The 
efforts of teachers and principals are being reinforced by social 
agencies outside the schools. The improvement in the economic 
condition of the people in this country has increased the ambi- 
tion of families that their children should go to school beyond 
the elementary grades and has made it possible for children to 
prolong the period of their schooling. 
It is needless to review in this connection the enlargements of — 
the high school which recent years have witnessed. The facts 
are well known and too impressive to be forgotten. From the 
high school downward as well as from the elementary school up- 
ward there has been a reaching across the gulf which in former 
days was set between the eighth grade and the ninth grade. And 
it is well for American education that this should be so. 
The improvement in relations between the eighth and ninth 
grades has served to emphasize the importance of the fact that 
our school system is in theory and is coming to be in practice a 
continuous opportunity for every pupil. Any movement which 
makes for ease of transition from one grade to another should be 
applauded. Any agency which sets up a barrier to divide one 
grade from another is to be condemned without reserve. 
The first principle, then, which we reach in our consideration 
is the principle that all organization within the schools should be 
judged as appropriate to the American system of education just 
in the degree in which it makes for continuous and uninterrupted 
opportunity for every pupil. 
The second general principle is closely related to the first. 
Within each school unit there has been and is appearing in still 
larger measure an enrichment of the course of study and of the 
opportunity offered to the pupil. This tendency shows itself in
-P-A-G-E-547
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 533 
many different ways. The school year in American schools has 
been lengthened. The teachers are better trained each succeed- 
ing year. There is a better and broader collection of textbook 
material; school buildings are better; maps and apparatus for 
demonstration are better and more common. This internal de- 
velopment of all aspects of school operation is in keeping with 
the increasing regard for an education which appears in the busi- 
ness world, in public life, and in the ambitions of individual 
pupils. 
That this enlargement of the educational program should affect 
especially the upper grades of the elementary school and the first 
year of the*high school is by no means surprising. It is just at 
this point in the school that the pupil, made acquainted with the 
fundamental tools of experience in the lower grades, finds him- 
self entering productively into the enjoyment of his achievements. 
Because he has learned to read fluently the child in the seventh 
grade has before him the rich world of history and geography and 
elementary science. He can grasp with more assurance the prin- 
ciples of mathematics and can use with greater nicety the words 
and forms of the vernacular. The period of varied and enlarged 
education has come and the course of study must be enriched. 
No less is it true that the first year of the high school must 
undergo an enlargement. Formerly it was the narrow portal to 
an exclusive course open to the few. Today the ninth grade is 
part of a broad cosmopolitan scheme of education. There is no 
disposition as in days gone by to limit the student’s opportunity 
to a few required subjects. 
Enrichments of the course of study are by no means confined 
to the grades here under discussion, but the lower grades of the 
elementary school from the nature of the case must always con- 
cern themselves chiefly with a comparatively narrow range of 
rudimentary subjects. The upper grades become broader be- 
cause they permit the pupil to pass out of the rudimentary stages 
of his education. Nor should the fact be overlooked in this 
connection that the enrichment of a course of study often con- 
sists in that internal reorganization which frees instruction from 
unproductive by-paths. History can be enriched by taking out 
worthless formal material. Arithmetic and geography must be 
purged of the waste which is now all too common. This internal 
readjustment is quite as important as importation into the course 
of new material.
-P-A-G-E-548
  534 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Especially is it true that the work of each grade should be 
modified so as to eliminate useless repetitions. Reviews are im- 
portant and should not be neglected, but the upper grades of the 
elementary school have sometimes been the scenes of unjustifiable 
waste of the time and energy of the pupils because the consci- 
entious teacher has dragged the bored and sated children through 
review after review. Just because the eighth grade has been 
looked on as a kind of terminus, these reviews have doubtless 
tended to accumulate here. If we learn to think of the educa- 
tional program as continuous, the reviews may be more equitably 
and economically distributed. 
Of large importance in this connection is the character of the 
work in the so-called intermediate grades, especially the fourth, 
fifth, and sixth. Upon the efficiency of the work done here will 
depend in large measure the success of any attempt to reorganize 
the upper grades. Hand in hand with the development of a new 
point of view for the seventh and eighth grades should go a con- 
certed and intelligent effort (1) to insure better teaching and 
a more mature and permanent body of teachers for the middle 
grades, and (2) to formulate principles that shall serve to govern 
the instruction and training of children between eight and twelve, 
at least as satisfactorily as analogous principles are now gov- 
erning the work of the primary grades and the work that has to 
do with the adolescent period. 
The enriched program must have one characteristic above all 
others. It must be appropriate to a democracy. Here we come 
to a point in the discussion where it is easy to fall into disagree- 
ments. The world is still experimenting with democracy. We are 
striving to develop a democracy in our other social institutions, 
as, for example, in our industries. How difficult it is to reach 
a generally acceptable definition of democracy appears if we 
study industries and industrial legislation and note the many 
shades of divergent opinion and conflicting practices. 
Out of the uncertainties which surround this part of our dis- 
cussion we may expect fairly universal assent to three general 
statements. First, the future must see greater emphasis than 
has the past on studies of community life and community needs. 
And the term “community” must not be narrowly defined. The 
course of study must be enriched to include intensive study of 
our nation and its meaning to our citizenship and to the world. 
Secondly, the future must see the enriched course providing a
-P-A-G-E-549
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 535 
broad, sure foundation for the practical life of the individual. 
Again, there must be no narrow limitation of the individual, no 
training for a single type of life. This is not a plea for narrow 
trade training, it is rather an assertion that there must be a 
vigorous effort toward the development of a comprehensive view 
of industry, so that the individual may choose his career after a 
broad view of democratic opportunity. Thirdly, the enrichment 
of the course must aim consciously at the destruction of those 
provincialisms and class prejudices which have worked in the his- 
tory of nations in the past, counter to the interests of democracy. 
Ignorance of other tasks than one’s own breeds lack of sympathy 
and results in the separation of group from group. Intelligence 
regarding others brings with it sympathy and co-operation. 
Each of the three points outlined in the last paragraph invites 
one to compose a chapter on educational possibilities. This is 
not the appropriate place for a full discussion of these matters. 
In order to avoid ambiguity two negative statements must be 
made. 
First, a course of study is not broad or enriched in the sense 
in which the term “enrichment” is used in this article if it is a 
limited course preparing for a trade. Nor is the fact lost to view 
that there is a legitimate demand in the experiences of many 
boys and girls for a trade training. It is, however, contended, 
with unlimited emphasis on the needs of a democracy, that when- 
ever trade training is given it should be accompanied just as far 
as possible by broadening, sympathy-cultivating instruction. To 
give early a limited occupational training will tend (1) to set up 
class distinctions, and (2) to deprive large numbers of children 
of the broad basis of general and liberal training, which is essen- 
tial to successful democracy. Every effort to reorganize the work 
of the upper grades should start from the fundamental principle 
that effective democracy implies the highest possible level of 
trained and informed intelligence in all of the members of the 
democratic group. 
Secondly, there are certain forms of enlargement of the course 
of study which defeat rather than promote the ends of education. 
Thus if more subjects are introduced into the course than can 
be assimilated by the pupils there will follow a distraction which 
will be quite as disastrous as any limitation that could be put on 
the course. Pupils will fail to learn the lesson of concentration of 
attention; thoroughness and mastery will have no meaning for 
 
-P-A-G-E-550

536 SECONDARY nbbediiOns 
them; they will carry away a confused general idea of the mate- 
rials they study, and they will fall into a type of superficial think- 
ing which is one of the perils of the modern course of study. 
Not only so, but there is danger in the enlargement of the 
course of study that subjects will be introduced which are in form 
far beyond the maturity of the pupils. The old-fashioned course 
of study undoubtedly made the mistake of assuming too little 
capacity on the part of pupils. The new and more ambitious 
programs are sometimes reckless in the introduction of advanced 
courses. If, for example, algebra and geometry are to be brought 
down into the elementary grades they must be modified in their 
content and in their mode of presentation as compared with the 
same subjects when taught in the high school. There is no surer 
way to fail in the seventh and eighth grades than to carry back 
without change a high-school course in algebra and attempt to 
administer it in a formal way to immature pupils. These ex- 
amples should serve as warnings against an irrational and ill-con- 
sidered enlargement of the course of study. 
We may turn now to another general principle of education 
which has been subject to a variety of interpretations in the 
course of the reorganization of the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades. It is the principle of individual differences. If there is 
one lesson which has been clearly taught by all of the recent 
investigations in education, it is the lesson that there are wide 
differences among pupils with respect to tastes, abilities, and 
capacities for progress, and that these must be heeded in the 
preparation of the school program. We are confronted here by 
a difficult problem. It is the business of a democratic school to 
see to it that the materials of thought which are presented to 
children shall contain enough common elements so that the think- 
ing of the community as a whole shall be guided along similar 
lines. A school which gives to one class of children one set of 
ideas and ideals and to another class an entirely different set of 
ideas and ideals will make for social distinctions that are danger- 
ous in a democracy. On the other hand, a course of study which 
knows no variations and makes no adaptations of its content to 
individuals of different capacities and different interests is quite 
as dangerous in a democracy as the stratifying course. Individual 
differences appear in the economic life of a democracy and play 
an important réle in providing the community with workers of 
different types. There is the mature man who is interested in  
-P-A-G-E-551
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 537 
engineering problems. On the other hand there is the man of 
literary type wholly unadapted to the practical problems of en- 
gineering but capable of making a contribution to the welfare 
of the community by his attention to letters. In the same way in 
the trades there is the man who has mechanical interests. On 
the other hand there is the carpenter who is more interested in 
the use of hand tools and in the problems of construction. 
Differentiation of occupations is an important outgrowth of 
our present economic system, and no definition of democracy can 
overlook the principle of division of occupations and diversity of 
interests. Our schools no less than our factories must recognize 
the fact that the child as he matures differs increasingly from his 
neighbor. How soon the school should recognize this fact and 
begin to offer diversified opportunities to the children has been an 
unsolved problem in our educational system. Heretofore we 
have adopted the practice of introducing high school students 
suddenly to large opportunities of election. Even this practice 
‘is of relatively recent origin, but during the last decade a very 
wide latitude has been recognized as desirable in high school cur- 
ricula. The elementary school, on the other hand, has been very 
slow in adopting the principle of differentiation and has intro- 
duced it in most systems only in the upper grades, If the ele- 
mentary course is so safeguarded that its content of instruction 
shall give to all children some common central body of ideas, dif- 
ferentiation must be introduced cautiously and with full regard to 
the requirement that universal instruction be given in funda- 
mentals. It is not incompatible with this demand that individual 
differences be recognized to some extent from the very outset of 
school life, although the general principle of individual differences 
begins to assert itself as an important basis of educational organi- 
zation in the middle grades of the school. There ought to be a 
differentiation of such a sort that those pupils who can go for- 
ward rapidly shall have their capacity for more work recognized 
_ and those who mature somewhat more slowly and are able to 
progress only at a slower rate shall be given the type of instruc- 
tion which is adapted to their particular capacities. Such a differ- 
ence in rate of movement will inevitably have an effect upon the 
amount of material which pupils of different grades of ability can 
absorb. The faster pupils will cover a wider range of experiences, 
and it is to be expected that the education which results from 
this widening of the range of experience will mature into differ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-552
538 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ences of taste and preparation for later work that are of major 
importance. There is no more urgent problem at the present 
time in the organization of the elementary-school course than the 
discrimination between those essential types of instruction which 
should be given to all children and the additional types of instruc- 
tion which can properly be offered to children of exceptional 
capacities. 
There can be little doubt that the reading in the sixth grade 
ought to be affected by this consideration. Children ought to be 
allowed to read silently passages of their own selection as a part 
of the regular school work. They ought, indeed, to be encouraged 
to take up material which will carry them beyond the ordinary 
routine of classroom exercises. The teacher’s supervision of the 
children’s reading thus becomes even in the intermediate grades 
a matter of differentiating the content of instruction. 
What is true in reading is also true in the other subjects. The 
range and kind of historical material which is included in the 
seventh and eighth grades will differ according to the capacities 
of the pupils. This does not mean that one child should pursue a 
course in ancient history and exclude all of the material that be- 
longs in the course in United States history. It means, rather, 
that all of the children should have training in the fundamentals 
of the history of their own country, but some children ought to 
be given an opportunity, because of their natural tastes and 
capacities, to go beyond the elementary requirement which is 
imposed upon all students. What is true of history is true also 
of cooking and of manual training. 
The difficulty which arises in the application of this principle 
of individual differences is to be faced by frankly recognizing the 
unsolved problem of our new course of study. In the course of 
the future there must be a common body of material for all 
children and a body of carefully supervised but differentiated op- 
portunities for children of different tastes and capacities. Anyone 
who is disposed to divide the course of study of the seventh grade 
into entirely separate and distinct curricula for different children 
does violence to the fundamental demands of a democratic organi- 
zation. On the other hand, anyone who would hold the course 
of study at any point to rigid and narrow lines does violence to 
the natural demands which express themselves in the differentiated 
interests of the pupils. 
In speaking of interests it should be recognized that by no
-P-A-G-E-553
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 539 
means all of these, either in childhood or in maturity, are called 
forth by economic needs. There has been a tendency in recent 
educational discussions to assume that boys and girls always find 
school lessons formal and stupid unless they see clearly how these 
lessons may be made to bear upon the earning of money. This 
tendency toward economic determinism in educational theory is 
most unfortunate. A premature or excessive appeal to occupa- 
tional and economic motives may easily result in a narrowing of 
the horizon and a closing of the mind to the broader things of 
life. Under the older social order the wider_vision--was essen 
tially a class privilege; it is the task of the schools. of a-democracy— 
to make this privilege universal. And this demands an abundance 
of opportunities and stimulations which the older curriculum is 
too narrow and too inelastic to provide. 
The general principles which have been set forth in the fore- 
going paragraphs are capable in practical organization of many 
different kinds of application. The authors of this article find it 
possible to agree even on certain judgments with regard to the 
practical organizations which can now be observed in the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades. It is a well-known fact that there is 
at the present time no uniformity in the organization of the so- 
called junior high school. “There is the junior high school which 
is nothing but a departmentalized union of the seventh and eighth 
grades. Its course of study is identical with the course of study 
which has been in operation for years past. There is, on the 
other hand, the junior high school which sharply differentiates 
and divides its students into entirely different social castes. Some 
of the latter types of schools have laid great stress on commercial 
or industrial training and have treated the junior high school as 
the device for introducing into public schools a narrow type of 
vocational training at an early stage in the life of the pupils. 
Neither of these extreme types seems to the authors of this 
article to conform to the principles set forth in earlier paragraphs. 
Criticism of the unhappy forms of junior high school organiza- 
tion which have appeared in recent years should be paralleled by 
criticism of the unmodified seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. 
The elementary school has long suffered from the poverty of its 
course of study. There was a time when the sessions of this 
school extended through only a few months in the year. Then 
there was some justification for a course of study limited to the 
rudimentary branches. As the school year has expanded the tra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-554
  540 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ditions of purely rudimentary instruction have in some quarters 
survived. Teachers have been loath to branch out into new and 
productive lines. _They have sometimes been so faithful to the 
limiting traditions of the earlier school that they have spun out 
with the most conscientious industry subjects that did not require 
the time lavishly bestowed on them. 
The foregoing statement of an educational creed cannot be 
closed appropriatély in this day of urgent social problems without 
a word with regard to the opportunity which is here for the mak- 
ing of American schools more truly democratic than they have 
ever been before. Our school system, with its present meaning- 
less distinction between the elementary and secondary fields, grew 
out of European traditions. The elementary school especially 
carries many of the limitations that were imposed on the school 
designed by an aristocratic society for its common people. The 
high school has been and still is the school of privilege. Step by 
step we have been shaking off the restrictions which tradition has 
imposed on the common school. This article is a plea for a united 
effort to complete the task of democratizing American‘elementary 
education. There certainly can be no curtailment in such a 
program. There ought to be nothing but expansion and the elim- 
ination of breaks. Our school system should be in every sense a 
“unit” system. It should reflect at every point the two funda- 
mental and complementary principles of democracy—opportunity 
and obligation, opportunity for individual, development, coupled 
with and paralleled by the obligation of the individual willingly 
to learn the lessons that all must learn in common if our democ- 
racy is to rest on a real community of ideas and ideals. 
EARLY EFFORTS TOWARD REORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN

the last two decades show the existence of tendencies toward

in some instances, into the upper grades of the elementary schools; 
the adoption of departmental teaching in the high school and in 
the older elementary grades; the endeavor to secure greater flexi- 
bility in grading and in promotion; and the introduction of indus- 
trial and vocational training into the schools are the directions in 
which effort has been expended to make more effective a system 
based largely upon tradition. While these tendencies express a 
recognition that the present system is imperfect, the reforms con- 
templated do not necessarily imply a reorganization of our group- 
ing by years, but suggest, rather, an improvement within the con- 
fines of out traditional scheme. The discussions, however, rang- 
ing over such questions as shortening and enriching the elementary 
curriculum, the six-year “high-school college,” the extension of the 
field of secondary education. both upward and downward, the 
shortening of the time for colleges, the establishment of the 
“junior college,” and the substitution of a triennial classification 
for our present quadrennial arrangement, go further and squarely 
demand that our school system be reorganized. 
The first public utterance of weight that called into serious 
question the organization of the school system was that of Presi- 
dent Eliot, at the Washington meeting of the Department of 
Superintendence of the National Education Association in 1888. 
In this address, entitled “(Can School Programmes be Shortened 
and Enriched?” President Eliot asserted that for the past 60 
years the average age of college admission has steadily risen, 
reaching 18 years and 10 months at Harvard, and that the period 
beyond college graduation required for professional training had 
lengthened to three or four years, with the result that “the aver- 
age college graduate who fits himself well for any one of the 
learned professions, including teaching, can hardly begin to sup- 
port himself before he is 27 years old.” In this epoch-making 
address he maintained the desirability of condensing school 
courses to gain time and of increasing the efficiency of instruc- 
tion in order to secure as high an admission standard as formerly. 
He also asserted that this was entirely possible by improving the 
teaching force of the schools through a better tenure of office and 
by raising the proportion of male teachers in the schools; by the 
improvement of school programs, making them substantial and 
interesting; by diminishing the number of reviews, and by never 
aiming at the kind of accuracy which reviews, followed by exam- 
inations, are. intended to enforce; by developing means which  
-P-A-G-E-556
  542 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
will insure a normal rate of promotion from grade to grade, and 
by securing a longer school day and term. 
This question of the steadily increasing age at which students 
enter college was one that seriously concerned the Harvard presi- 
dent and his faculty for many years. As far back as 1872-73 
this tendency had been publicly noted. In his report of that date, 
President Eliot, in discussing certain changes which had been made 
in the admission requirements of Harvard, pointed out that, while 
these had been essentially modified, they had not been made 
more difficult, and he added: 
The average age of admission has gradually risen until it is 
now a little over 18 years, and the college faculty, thinking that 
age to be high enough, do not wish to require for admission any- 
thing more than a boy of 18 of fair capacity and industry may 
reasonably be expected to have learned. 
In his report of 1885-86 President Eliot again referred to this © 
matter, asserting that three years of the discussion of admission 
requirements by the college faculty had resulted in the adoption 
of a compromise measure, which was expected to assist in bring- 
ing down the average age of admission to 18 or thereabouts. He 
added: 
At present about two-fifths of the freshmen are over 19 at en- 
trance—a condition of things which the faculty views with con- 
cern. 
This situation, which was observed with growing alarm by the 
Harvard faculty, led to remedial efforts of four kinds: (1) 
Modifying college entrance requirements; (2) urging the parents 
of prospective college students to send their sons to college as 
soon as the latter were qualified; (3) shortening the college course 
from four years to three years; and (4) persuading the elementary 
and secondary schoolmen generally to condense their courses. 
These proposals, advanced by the Harvard faculty as hopeful 
methods of solving a specific problem which was becoming in- 
creasingly serious, started discussions among educators that 
quickly carried the participants into a critical examination of the 
entire range of the educational system, developing thereby, dur- 
ing the last two decades, a body of educational comment of great 
brilliancy and worth. Influenced partly by Harvard’s example 
and partly by the fact that the problem was common to all, the 
faculties of practically all the American colleges and universities 
took up the discussion of the problems that concerned each, ar-
-P-A-G-E-557
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 543 
riving in course of time at the conclusions and plans of procedure 
which the local needs and traditions respectively determined. An 
examination of the files containing the proceedings of such organi- 
zations as the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools 
of the Southern States, the Association of Colleges of the Middle 
States and Maryland, the North Central Association, and the New 
England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, shows 
that much of the time of the annual conferences of these or- 
ganizations held during the nineties was likewise given over to 
a discussion of similar questions. The first organization of na- 
tional prominence, however, to take up this examination was the 
National Education Association. Through the National Council, 
the Department of Superintendence, and the Department of Sec- 
ondary Education, it made scholarly contributions to the litera- 
ture of the discussion. 
At the suggestion of President James H. Baker, University of 
Colorado (then a high school principal), the National Council 
appointed in 1892:a committee of 10 persons, of which President 
Eliot was made chairman, to arrange a series of conferences be- 
tween the school and college teachers of each of the principal 
secondary subjects in order to determine the limits of each, the 
best methods of instruction, the most desirable allotment of time 
to the several subjects, and the best method of testing the pupil’s 
attainments therein. Nine conferences on as many different sec- 
ondary-school subjects were held, each in charge of a committee 
of 10. While the conferences were ostensibly held to discuss the 
period of secondary education, it was inevitable that many sug- 
gestions should be made respecting the program of the elementary 
schools and of the college period. In consequence, the Report 
of the Committee of Ten covers in many significant respects the 
entire range of the school system. 
While the grouping of eight years in the elementary division 
and four years in that of the high school, now generally followed 
in the United States, had been sharply attacked prior to the pub- 
lication of the committee’s report, yet in all of the discussions 
comprising the report, the traditional grouping is assumed, al- 
though several of the subcommittees demanded an earlier intro- 
duction of secondary-school studies, and all desired to see given 
in the elementary schools broad surveys of their respective sub- 
jects. The Latin conference compared the age at which Latin is 
begun in Europe and in this country, and expressed the hope
-P-A-G-E-558
    544 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
that such a modification of grammar-school courses can be made 
without delay as to render it possible that the high-school course 
—and with it the subject of Latin—may be begun not later than 
the age of 14. 
The Greek conference voted to concur with the Latin confer- 
ence in its recommendations as to the age at which the study of 
Latin should be begun, and asserted that the average age at 
which pupils now enter college should be lowered rather than 
raised. The conference on modern languages recommended that 
elective courses in German and French be provided in the gram- 
mar schools, beginning with the fifth grade. The conference on 
mathematics recommended that a course of instruction in con- 
crete geometry be introduced into the grammar schools, and that 
some familiarity with algebraic expressions and symbols should 
be acquired in connection with the course in arithmetic. The 
conferences on physics, chemistry, and astronomy, and on natural 
history would have the elements of those subjects begun in the 
first years of the elementary division and continued throughout. 
_ The conference on history, civil government, and political econ- 
omy “especially recommends such a choice of subjects as will 
give pupils in the grammar schools an opportunity to study the 
history of other countries.” In the spirit of the foregoing recom- 
mendations relating to an earlier beginning of secondary sub- 
jects the Committee of Ten concurred, in the following language: 
In preparing these programs the committee was perfectly 
aware that it is impossible to make a satisfactory secondary- 
school program limited to a period of four years and founded on 
the present elementary-school subjects and methods. In the 
opinion of the committee several subjects now reserved for the 
high schools, such as algebra, geometry, natural science, and for- 
eign languages, should be begun earlier than now, and therefore 
within the schools classified as elementary; or as an alternative, 
the secondary-school period should be made to begin two years 
earlier than at present, leaving six years instead of eight for the 
elementary-school period. Under the present organization ele- 
mentary subjects and elementary methods, are, in the judgment 
of the committee, kept in use too long. 
Not only did the committee take advanced ground in respect 
to the relation of the secondary schools to the elementary schools, 
but it set forth, with even greater emphasis and distinctness, its 
conception of the relation which should obtain between the sec-
-P-A-G-E-559
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 545 
ondary schools and the colleges, and in so doing it condemned, 
by implication at least, much of our present practice. The com- 
mittee declares: 
The secondary schools of the United States, taken as a whole, 
do not exist for the purpose of preparing boys and girls for col- 
leges. Only an insignificant percentage of the graduates of these 
schools go to colleges or scientific schools. Their main function 
is to prepare for the duties of life that small proportion of all the 
children in the country—a proportion small in number, but very 
important to the welfare of the Nation—who show themselves 
able to profit by an education prolonged to the eighteenth year 
and whose parents are able to support them while they remain so 
long at school. 
And, again, the committee says: 
A secondary-school program intended for national use must 
therefore be made for those children whose education is not to 
be pursued beyond the secondary school. The preparation of a 
few pupils for college or scientific school should, in the ordinary 
secondary school, be the incidental and not the principal object. 
In short, the committee believes that the college should take 
the high-school student who has had four years of strong work 
where it finds him and without regard to the particular subjects 
which have comprised his curriculum, and that this “close articu- 
lation between the secondary schools and the higher institutions 
would be advantageous alike for the schools, the colleges, and 
the country.” 
This unusually able and suggestive report was taken up im- 
mediately by the newspaper and magazine press, by the pulpit 
and platform, and by the foremost writers on education. In con- 
sequence the report commanded from the first an interest so wide- 
spread as to become national in its extent. It is interesting to 
observe, too, that this study of the secondary division of the 
American public-school system, made by the Committee of Ten, 
came at a time when the same division in each of the French, 
German, and English school systems was undergoing sharp 
scrutiny. 
In 1890 both France and Germany appointed national commis- 
sions to study the work of the secondary school, and simultane- 
ously with the final sitting of the Committee of Ten there con- 
vened at Oxford the first national meeting of schoolmasters and 
university professors ever held in England. It is significant that
-P-A-G-E-560
  546 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the questions foremost in debate at Paris, Berlin, Oxford, and 
New York were the same, and that independently of one another 
the conclusions reached were in remarkable accord in important 
particulars. 
- A few months before this report of the Committee of Ten was 
published (1893), the Department of Superintendence of the Na- 
tional Education Association appointed a committee of 15 on ele- 
mentary education that frankly raised for discussion the tradi- 
tional division of eight years elementary and four years high 
school and departmental teaching in the upper grammar grades. 
The members of this committee were divided into three subcom- 
mittees—one on the training of teachers, one on the correlation 
of studies in elementary education, and one on the organization 
of city school systems. Each subcommittee prepared and sent a 
questionnaire to representative school men and women through 
the country, and from the returns a report was prepared that was 
finally presented before the Department of Superintendence in 
1895 at the Cleveland meeting. 
The only subcommittee which developed a discussion bearing 
on the function of the elementary division and on its relation to 
the secondary schools was the subcommittee on the correlation 
of studies, under the chairmanship of William T. Harris. Sev-— 
enteen questions were submitted by it, of which four bore more 
or less directly on function: 
(1) Should the elementary course be eight years and the sec- 
ondary course four years, as at present? Or should the ele- 
mentary course be six years and the secondary course six years? 
(2) Should Latin or a modern language be taught in the ele- 
mentary school course? If so, why (part of question No. 3)? 
(3) Should any subject, or group of subjects, be treated differ- 
ently for pupils who leave school at 12, 13, or 14 years of age, 
and for those who are going to a high school? (4) What con- 
siderations should determine the point at which the specialization 
of the work of teachers should begin? 
The responses to these questions, with a few exceptions, showed 
hesitation at departing in any marked way from current theory 
or practice. The objection to shortening the elementary course 
to six years, held commonly by those replying to the first ques- 
tion, was the fear that such a step would cause many children to 
leave school. Indeed, several would have had the course length- 
ened to nine years instead. In respect to beginning Latin or
-P-A-G-E-561
BELLE EI ee NDS TE SO RC Se RT SCRE ERE ee TNR ere ea 
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 547 
a modern language in the grades, the responses were about 
equally divided between those who considered language study 
profitable and those who hold that the mind is not “mature 
enough to profit by classical training, as now pursued, until 
high-school age.” The question whether or not a subject should 
be treated differently for pupils having different objectives was 
answered almost unanimously in the negative. The tenor of the 
replies was that “the high school must be made to fit the boy; 
the boy should not be made to fit the high school.” In the re- 
plies to the question relating to departmental teaching, no en- 
thusiastic proponents were developed, but on the contrary some 
expressed strong opposition. 
The subcommittee reflected, in its report, the same hesitancy 
and conservation. In referring to the questions relating to short- 
ening the elementary course to six years and the earlier intro- 
duction of secondary studies, the committee reported as follows: 
Your committee is agreed that the time devoted to the ele- 
mentary school work should not be reduced from eight years, 
but they have recommended, as hereinbefore stated, that in the 
seventh and eighth years a modified form of algebra be intro- 
duced in place of advanced arithmetic and that in the eighth 
year English grammar yield place to Latin. This makes, in 
their opinion, a proper transition to the studies of the secondary 
school and is calculated to assist the pupil materially in his 
preparation for that work. Hitherto the change from the work 
of the elementary school has been too abrupt, the pupil beginning 
three formal studies at once, namely, algebra, physical geography, 
and Latin. 
In recommending this earlier introduction of algebra and Latin 
the committee was brought face to face with the question of the 
difference between elementary and secondary subjects. The com- 
mittee pointed out that whereas those subjects which current 
practice has assigned to the secondary division of study have been 
so assigned partly because of tradition, partly because of admis- 
sion requirements of higher institutions, and partly because of 
the intrinsic difficulties of the several subjects, yet there is a 
psychological factor which should determine the division in which 
a given subject is classed, namely, that whatever deals with the 
general form is relatively secondary, and whatever has to do with 
the higher correlations of the facts and relations of natural and 
spiritual phenomena belongs to the division of higher education.   
 
-P-A-G-E-562
  548 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
As to the question whether or not pupils who leave school early 
should have a course of study different from the course of those 
who are to continue on into secondary and higher work, the com- 
mittee was not able to agree. Some contended that those who 
leave early should have a more practical course, and that they 
should dispense with studies of a preparatory character, while 
others held that it was best to have one course in the elementary 
schools for all. This position was urged on the grounds that any 
school education is at best but an initiation into the art of learn- 
ing, and that, wherever the pupil leaves off in his school course, 
he should continue his studies in the public library and at home; 
and, furthermore, that a brief course in higher studies, such as 
Latin and algebra, instead of being useless, is of more value 
than any elementary studies that might replace them. 
In its discussion of the question respecting the introduction of 
departmental work in the elementary school the committee, while 
not enthusiastic in its favor, went further than did the majority 
replying to the committee’s questionnaire, and recommended that 
specialization of the teacher’s work should not be attempted before 
the seventh or eighth year, and then in not more than one or two 
studies. 
The third iraportant study under the auspices of the National 
Education Association during the nineties was made by the Com- 
mittee on College Entrance Requirements, and bore directly on 
the articulation of the secondary division with that of higher 
education. This committee was appointed by the Department of 
Secondary Education in 1895, and submitted its final report at the 
Los Angeles meeting in 1899. The report submitted by the com- 
mittee is positive in general tone; it expresses convictions rather 
than doubts. In respect to the length of the elementary and sec- 
ondary periods, the committee makes the following recommen- 
dation: 
In our opinion it is important that the last two grades that 
now precede the high-school course should be incorporated in it, 
and, wherever practicable, the instruction in those two grades 
should be given under the supervision of the high-school teacher. 
Again, concerning the high-school course, the committee recom- 
mended a six-year course, beginning with the seventh year, on 
the grounds that the seventh grade, rather than the ninth, is the 
natural turning point in the pupil’s life; that an easier transition 
can thereby be made from the one-teacher regimen to the system
-P-A-G-E-563
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 549 
of special teachers; that a larger percentage of students would, 
through this arrangement, be retained in school; and that the 
final result would be a more closely articulated system, with a 
larger percentage of graduates from the high school. 
On this plan the advisory committee on modern languages re- 
ported as follows: 
There appears to be strong argument in favor of this plan. 
It is urged by thoughtful schoolmen that our American high 
school has become congested; that the increased requirements of 
the colleges and the pressing demands of new subjects for “recog- 
nition” have given to the secondary school more work than it 
can do thoroughly in the traditional allotment of time. When, 
as sometimes happens, the colleges are blamed for this state of 
affairs, and it is suggested that they reduce their requirements 
for admission, they are able to reply with much force that present 
requirements, even where they are highest, are none too high, 
unless we are willing to fall far below the standard of the Old 
World. The average graduate of an American high school is of 
about the same age as the average graduate of a German gym- 
nasium, but the latter is further along in his studies and better 
prepared for higher work. We have therefore to consider the 
problem of strengthening the preparatory course, while recog- 
nizing that the ordinary four-year curriculum can bear no further 
burdens, and should, if anything, be simplified. Of this prob- 
lem the obvious solution is to begin the proper work of the high 
school at an earlier date. Instead of dividing our educational 
years into eight primary, four secondary, and seven or eight higher, 
we should divide them into six primary, six secondary, and six 
higher. 
Early in the second decade of the movement toward a func- 
tional reorganization the University of Chicago and the acad- 
emies and high schools affiliating and cooperating with this in- 
stitution took it up, and through the initiative and personal 
force of President Harper the discussion was carried on with 
great vigor. At the general session of the fifteenth conference, 
held during November, 1901, Prof. John Dewey read a paper on 
“Current Problems in Secondary Education,” in which he de- 
clared that among the problems of first importance were those 
relating to the articulation of the secondary school in the edu- 
cational system. In this address he pointed out that the ele- 
mentary school and the college represent distinctly different 
 
-P-A-G-E-564
  550 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
forces and traditions, historically; that the one was created by 
a broad democratic movement, while the other is a response to 
the desire to pass on to a privileged class the wisdom and en- 
lightenment of the past; and that the high school is the product 
of the meeting of these two forces, and upon it, more than upon 
any other part of the school system, rests the responsibility of 
making an adjustment. 
The year following (1902) the conference discussed reorganiz- 
ing the system. of education on the basis of an elementary school 
of six grades, followed by a secondary school of six grades. The 
discussion was summed up by President Harper in the follow- 
ing form: 
A Proposition 
1. To connect the work of the eighth grade of the elementary 
school with that of the secondary school. 
2. To extend the work of the secondary school to include the 
first two years of college work. 
3. To reduce the work of the seven years thus grouped together 
to six years. 
4. To make it possible for the best class of students to do 
the work in five years. 
Such a plan would fit in with— 
1. The necessity, so widely recognized, of lifting the standard 
for admission to the professional schools. 
2. The general feeling that in some way or other time must be 
saved in the preliminary stages of educational work in order 
that men and women may enter upon their life work at an 
earlier age. 
3. The practice, recognized in other countries, of drawing a 
sharp line between the work of the gymnasium or lycée and that 
of the university. 
4. The practice, now in common vogue, of making the first two 
years of college work only an extension of the work in the sec- 
ondary school. 
5. The contention, which seems to be well founded, that much 
of the secondary work of to-day was college work 30 years ago. 
6. The tendency already manifesting itself in some quarters
-P-A-G-E-565
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 551 
in accordance with which high schools are offering postgraduate 
work and universities are accepting this work in lieu of the 
work of the first two years. 
7. The principle that the line of separation at the close of the 
second college year is much more clearly marked, pedagogically, 
than the line at the close of the present high-school period. 
8. The tendency, everywhere apparent, to extend the scope of 
the educational work offered by the State or municipality. 
9. The tendency, already beginning to be noticed among 
smaller colleges, to limit the work offered to that of the pre- 
paratory school and the first two years of college. 
to. The opinion, not infrequently expressed, that the work of 
the eighth grade is in some measure superfluous for certain classes 
of pupils and in some measure injurious to certain other classes. 
11. The belief, more and more generally accepted, that the 
work of the school must be adapted to the needs and possibilities 
of the individual pupil, rather than that pupils should be treated 
in mass. 
12. The principle that a pupil giving evidence of ability to do 
the highest grade of work may profitably be excused from doing 
the same amount of work required of the pupil of lower grade. 
In opposition to such a plan there may be suggested: 
1. The inclination to regard any system actually in use as 
better than a system or policy still to be tested. 
2. The feeling that the reduction of time can be gained only 
by a loss of thoroughness. 
3. The general lack of interest in any proposition to substi- 
tute a well-ordered educational system for the present lack of 
system. 
4. The difficulties involved in adjusting the lower work to the 
higher, on the ground that the great mass of pupils receive only 
the lower, and that the public school system is intended primarily 
for them. 
5. The belief that the State has already gone too far in pro- 
viding public education of a high character. 
6. The opinion that the present college policy, although it is 
the result of a gradual development, has now reached a position 
which it must always occupy. 
7. The fear that the college idea would be injured by the rivalry 
of the new high-school colleges.

8. The desire to see specialism begin at a very early age. 
9. The hesitation with which many would regard the transfer 
of the eighth grade from the realm of elementary to that of sec- 
ondary work. | 
10. The failure, even in these times, to accept the doctrine of 
individualism in. the field of pedagogical work. 
This report closed with the recommendation that the conference 
establish three committees of seven each to consider the general 
problem; the first committee, from the point of view of the ele- 
mentary work; the second, from the point of view of the secon- 
dary school; and the third, from the point of view of the college; 
these three committees to form a joint committee of 21. The con- 
clusions reached by these committees were received by the gen- 
eral conference during its seventeenth annual session, November, 
1903. This commission was instructed to report a year later at 
the eighteenth annual conference, to be held in November, 1904. 
At the appointed time the report, which follows, was submitted: 
Your commission finds, as a result of their study of the sub- 
ject connected with these propositions, that among other ques- 
tions the following require to be investigated, namely: 
1. Is the present policy of differentiation between the elemen-, 
tary and secondary schools desirable; or, should an effort be made 
toward greater unification in method and organization? 
2. Should the elementary school correspond to the period of 
childhood, and therefore should it provide for six years of school 
work from the ages of 6 to 12 years, instead of eight years as at 
present? 
3- Should the secondary school correspond to the period of 
youth, and should it therefore provide for six years of school 
work from the ages of 13 to 18, instead of four years as at 
present? 
4. What revision of the curricula of the elementary and sec- 
ondary schools and what changes in methods of teaching can be 
made that will contribute to economy of time and efficiency of 
work? 
5. In order to secure a well-balanced development and at the 
same time to contribute to the economy of time, can the school 
year be lengthened advantageously and minor vacations be more 
equally distributed?

REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 553 
6. Under what limitations should high schools undertake to 
do the work of the first two college years? 
The student who desires a full account of the early efforts 
toward reorganization of American schools is referred to Dr. 
Bunker’s work. A sufficient amount of this work has been 
quoted to show outstanding features of the reorganization move- 
ment. The questions raised by the Commission of Twenty-One 
have been investigated ever since they were asked in 1904. Al- 
though the educators of this country have, for practical pur- 
poses, answered certain of these questions, most educators would 
now agree that this group of six problems still offers opportunity 
for further investigation and experimentation. 
The need for a definition of the administrative units. of: 
education. Many attempts have been made to define elementary, 
secondary,-and collegiate education. The elementary school has 
been variously defined as offering the undifferentiated training 
required by every one, as including only the minima of indispens- 
able knowledge, as giving the basis for common thought, and 
_gs equipping pupils with the tools of learning. The secondary 
school also has been defined variously as the beginning of differ- 
entiated training, as a continuation of training in common thought 
alongside differentiation of certain courses, and as a socialized 
finishing school for the masses and therefore a people’s specializa- 
tion school. In accordance with suggestions aroused by the fore- 
going bases for defining educational units, collegiate education 
may be defined as chiefly differentiated training and social op- 
portunity for persons who have already completed the undiffer- 
entiated portions of elementary and secondary schools; when so 
defined, collegiate education is understood as being in part voca- 
tional training and in part general training. It is hardly to be 
expected that a student of secondary education will find any one 
of the foregoing definitions satisfactory. The reason for their 
not being satisfactory is that no single definition can at present  
-P-A-G-E-568
554 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
account for three units with so diverse aims and practices as are 
found with each of the units. As Pittenger says: 
Every student of educational affairs is forced at some time to 
ponder over the words “elementary” and “secondary” as applied 
to educational fields and institutions. At first approach the mean- 
ing of the terms seems clear. The elementary school is the first 
school entered by each recruit of the educational army, and the 
secondary school is the next, to be entered when the work of the 
first has been completed. Elementary and secondary education, 
accordingly, should consist of the materials taught and the meth- 
ods employed in each of these respective institutions. 
But a slightly broader acquaintance with the problems and 
literature of his profession convinces the amateur that the matter 
is not so simple as it seemed. He soon becomes aware of a real 
problem. In fact, he discovers that it is not only the novice 
who is troubled; even the “Doctors” disagree. He reads Presi- 
dent Hadley’s confession that one term which has puzzled him 
greatly is “secondary education”; or Monroe’s statements that 
“the views concerning secondary education, as to its purposes, 
scope, curriculum, methods, or organization, are of the most 
diverse character, even among those who are specialists in this 
very field.” And when he passes from these warnings to a perusal 
of the papers which have been written on the issue he is fairly 
bewildered by the diversity of meaning which he finds.” 
Out of the attempts to define secondary education one finds, 
however, reasons for taking an invoice of our institutions. Present- 
day tendencies point to the desirability of defining the elementary 
school as the school which offers undifferentiated training to 
children for the first six grades and the secondary school as the 
school which continues certain forms of undifferentiated train- 
ing and begins training which is differentiated. So long as the 
first two years of collegiate education contain a mixture of two- 
fifths secondary courses and three-fifths strictly collegiate 
courses,® the upper reaches of secondary education will probably

go undefined. The readings which follow are intended to show 
directions in which reorganization has already taken place and 
the new directions in which still further reorganization can be 
expected. The first two readings—those by Shaefer and Fergu-

school, while the readings by Angell, Koos, and John treat the 
reorganization of the later years of secondary education. 
THE SIX-YEAR UNIFIED HIGH SCHOOL VERSUS THE SENIOR 
AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS ° 
By Harry M. SHAEFER 
The term intermediate school, or junior high school, has been 
interpreted in different ways in various localities. For the pur- 
pose of this discussion, intermediate~or”jtnior “high school will 
mean a grouping..of -Gfades VII, VIII, and IX to meet the need 
of the adoléscent through departmental organization, differen- 
tiated courses of study, and other means adopted for passing the 
child who has finished the sixth grade on through three years of 
life and work to the tenth grade. The alleged advantages and 
disadvantages of the following three types of organization em- 
ployed in Los Angeles will be presented. 
Type I. Schools organized on the six-six plan with either the 
entire upper six grades segregated in“one building, or combined 
in a building with the lower six. 
Type II. Departmentalized® seventh and eighth grades in 
schools containing all grades’ of the elementary school and pass- 
ing pupils to the ninth grade in either a junior high school or the 
first year of a four-year high school. 
Type III. Junior high schools which graduate pupils to the 
first year of the“senior high schools or to the tenth year of the 
school course. 
Alleged disadvantages of Type I. There is too great a dis- 
parity of interests and maturity of pupils. An undue amount of 
attention and teaching time is given to Grades VII to IX; costs 
are increased because teachers are of the same salary rating as in 
the main city schools.

Alleged disadvantages of Type II. The failure of this type to 
recognize the needs of the maturing adolescent pupil leads to a 
maladjustment of both the young elementary-school child and 
the adolescent. The advantages claimed for this type are in reality 
disadvantages which block the desirable development of the child. 
Alleged advantages of Type II. The presence of Grades VII 
and VIII gives the elementary school more spirit, vigor, and en-

tering. The break at the end of the ninth year in passing from 
one school to another and from one organization to another is in 
this way made more striking. 
The excess number of subjects together with liberal election, 
puts the pupil ahead of his real ability. Fourteen-year-old pupils 
are combined with sixteen-year-old ones; literature and other 
subjects too advanced for the younger pupil are undertaken and 
the younger individual is forced toward an outlook which is be- 
yond his mentality. He usually passes the subject but fails to 
derive full value from it. This tends to increase the desire on the 
part of the pupil to pass subjects rather than to obtain the maxi- 
mum of training from the pursuit of a given subject, when the on- 
ward urge throws him away from a thorough mastery of the fun- 
damental elementary subjects. Later, when the teacher attempts 
to teach him algebra, she finds it necessary to run back to more 
fundamental arithmetic; or when she endeavors to conduct Latin 
or a modern language, she must spend more time teaching English. 
The much needed discipline for the young person of the adoles- 
cent age is not obtained in the junior high school; much better _ 
results would be obtained under a plan which did not make the 
break at the end of the ninth year. 
Because of a considerable list of electives, the pupil tends to 
overload in the junior high school, and thus undertake excess work 
at the expense of good work. He comes to the senior high school 
attempting to offer additional credits made in junior high school 
in order that he may shorten his senior high school course. 
Alleged advantages of Type III. The junior high school where 
separate from the senior high school, can provide subject mat- 
ter, organization, and methods of teaching which are especially 
appropriate for young adolescents. The interests, attitudes, and 
activities of children aged 11 to 14 differ from those of young 
men and women fifteen to nineteen years of age. All of the 
physiological and psychological differences which have been 
stated by the specialists and which it is not our province to restate 
here, urge such an arrangement. The association of the pupil of 
the junior high school with the senior high school pupil leads to 
the repression of the younger and standards being set by the older, 
said standards being of a type quite unsuited to the need of the 
younger pupil at his state of development. Pupils of the junior 
high school are really boys and girls, while those of the senior 
high school are young men and young women. In their attitude  
-P-A-G-E-572
  558 EECONDARY EDUCATION 
toward life, toward school work, toward all sorts of school activi- 
ties, there is a divergence of interests. The younger enjoy play, 
while the olde are fitted for formal sports. Every speaker who has 
addressed junior high school audiences has been cognizant of the 
youth of the audience, the tendency to “wiggle.” He has found 
that the type of address to which the senior high school student 
will listen intently, will promote restlessness or playfulness when 
given before a junior high school audience. 
The junior high school can give to each child from the ele- 
mentary school a new knowledge of his own special abilities and a 
vision of the possibilities and values of higher education. It is a 
place for both BECO and revelation. Here, too, the adolescent 
forms some idea of that other-mindedness, that altruism, that 
social service so greatly needed in the present-day world. 
The speed of the bright pupil is accelerated. The slow pupil is 
placed in associations more suited to his abilities. Pupils as a 
whole gain time. 
Prevocational training and vocational work are undertaken. 
This reflects A neatries of the locality and links up with the 
life of the community. 
Promotion by subjects becomes a practice easily employed. 
Numbers passing to senior high school are largely increased. 
By retention of ninth grade pupils in junior high school, the 
congestion in senior high school is relieved. Attendance in senior 
high school is more limited to students of like interests, ages, and 
requirements. 
The ninth grade, which has been a source of much anxiety and 
of grave concern, works under conditions better suited to the 
stage of advancement, mentally, morally, physically, and is a 
more satisfactory group in the junior high school than in the 
senior high school. 
Those who are acquainted with the plan and the results ob- 
tained, pupils, teachers, administrators, patrons, are practically 
unanimous int endorsement.

Philadelphia was articulating with the two senior high schools 
to which it sends its graduates. The results of the investigation 
suggested certain problems of articulation that could very well 
arise in any school system instituting the junior high school. Of 
these problems, the following were singled out and made subjects 
for a nation-wide study: the length of time necessary to achieve 
satisfactory articulation between the senior high school and the 
junior high school, the subjects in the senior high school present- 
ing the greatest difficulty for the junior high school graduate, the 
reasons for these difficulties, and the general attitude of the two 
institutions toward each other. 
The immediate practical problem that the junior high school 
graduate faces in the senior high school is the problem of making 
good in the new environment as he finds it. That the senior high 
school is not the sort of institution that the junior high school 
would have it be does not help the pupil in his difficulties. 
Whether the senior high school is progressive or traditional, 
whether it is sympathetic with or antagonistic to the junior high 
school, the fact remains that the junior high school graduate must 
face, in the senior high school, conditions as they are and not as 
they ought to be. Hence the emphasis in the nation-wide inquiry 
was on the difficulties that the junior high school pupil must 
meet, in many cases, in the upper secondary school. 
To get at the facts, both from the angle of the senior high 
school and from the angle of the junior high school, two question- 
naires were prepared. One hundred and twenty-five of these 
questionnaires were sent, for the most part to cities in which the 
junior high school had been established for a relatively long 
period. The senior high school questionnaire was sent to the same 
cities in order to get reactions from the two institutions in the 
same city. Replies were received from 37 junior high school prin- 
cipals distributed through 17 states and from 36 senior high school 
principals distributed through rz states. A total of 73 replies were 
received from principals scattered through 18 states. Analysis 
will be made first of the junior high school questionnaire.

were promoted to the senior high school at the end of the first 
year that your school was in existence as a junior high school 
able to do the work of the senior high school without serious handi-

school before tere was general agreement that its graduates were 
successful in the work‘of the senior high school? One year (un- 
qualified), 15; one year (qualified), 11; two years, 1; three years, 
6; indefinite, 4. The following are some of the qualifications made 
by those answering “one year”: 
“You will never have general agreement until deep-seated 
prejudic pee the junior high school are overcome. This 
will not come until we have a new generation of senior high 
school te: chers.” | 
“At present, ninth-grade pupils receive a diploma admit- 
ting them to the tenth grade.” 
“When our school was first organized, the curriculum was 
identical with that of the seventh and eighth grades in the 
elementary schools with the addition of Latin and German. 
The only difference between these grades in our school and 
the same grades in the elementary schools at that time was 
that we were organized on a departmental basis. Our ninth 
grade was almost identical with the senior high school ninth | 
grade. Since the adoption of our new intermediate curricu- 
lum we have had more difficulty in the articulation. How- 
ever, these difficulties are gradually being adjusted in the 
planning of the new senior high school curriculum.” 
“None, for there was no abrupt establishment, rather a 
gradual evolution.” 
“From the first our pupils were able to do more advanced 
work in mathematics and languages than pupils who had not 
had junior high school training.” 
3. With what subjects have the graduates of your/school had 
the most difficulty in the senior high school? Foreign language, 
18; mathematics, 16; English, 6; commercial subjects, 3; me- 
chanical drawing, 1. 
4. To what do you attribute these difficulties? The following 
comments were made with reference to foreign language: 
if | | 
“Direct ethod in junior high school, grammatical method 
in senior high school.” 
“Refusal of senior high school to credit work done in 
junior high school.” 
“Our difficulty in the field of foreign language has arisen
-P-A-G-E-575
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 561 
from the fact that pupils with low intelligence quotients 
cannot learn a language by means of an academic study of 
its fundamental structure. Their way of learning a language 
is by full and motivated experience with the language. This 
method most high-school teachers are unwilling or unable 
to employ.” 
The following comments were made with reference to mathe- 
matics: 
“General difficulty with mathematics throughout the 
grades.” 
“Textbook.” 
“High-school mathematics is different and difficult. It has 
not been sufficiently adjusted to the needs of the child.” 
The following comments were made with reference to English: 
“Lack of theme preparation. Inability to state thought 
clearly, however simple.” 
“Frequent changes in teaching staff.” 
“Failure to get technical grammar.” 
“English not sufficiently stressed in seventh and eighth 
grades.” 
“Difference in ideals of two schools.” 
“During the first years of the junior high school we gave 
less attention to technical English than was formerly given 
in the grades. All criticism in the senior high schools came 
as a result of this; but our graduates talked and wrote better 
than before.” 
The following comment was made with reference to commercial 
subjects: 
“In the case of typewriting, wrong standards of rating 
students. In shorthand, students lack English background 
and experience.” 
The following general comments were made: 
“Nature of subjects, immaturity of some pupils, lack of 
capacity on the part of some.”
-P-A-G-E-576
562 } SECONDARY EDUCATION 
“Lack of articulation between the senior and junior high 
schools.” \ 
“Same subjects (English and mathematics) were difficult 
in the junior high school.” 
“Lack of judgment as to what should be accomplished and 
no provision for grouping by ability.” 
“Different administrative point of view.” 
“Due purely to lack of careful preparation for such ar- 
ticulation.” 
“Lack of continuity in subject-matter.” 
“The attitude of the principal and faculty of the receiv- 
ing school.” 
“Departmental work is apt to throw responsibility for a 
subject on one teacher. If the teacher of French is poor, 
then all pupils in French receive poor instruction.” 
“Salary schedules.” 
“Hardened teachers in the senior high school.” 
“Shorter periods and more subjects in the junior high 
school.” 
5. What readjustments in curriculum or methods of teaching 
have been necessary in your school to facilitate the success of its 
graduates in the senior high school? 
“Uniform course of study for same grade in all schools.” 
“Stressing algebra in general mathematics.” 
“No readjustment in curriculum, but senior high school 
methods of teaching adopted.” 
“Have limited time devoted to special activities, have 
changed methods in French, and have returned to more rigid 
drill on technical English.” 
“We have had in mind the needs of the child rather than 
preparation for high school. We have tried to select subject- 
matter and modernize our methods.” 
“Compromise with senior high school to some extent by 
putting science and language on a different basis. No read- 
justment of method.” 
“At present a little more emphasis is being placed on gram- 
mar. The recasting of courses in the senior high schools, with 
one exception, has not taken place as it should.” 
“Longer periods. Supervised study.”
-P-A-G-E-577
  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 563 
“More time to algebra. More elective subjects.” 
“Metric system added to mathematics as basis for science 
work in senior high school.” 
“More formal grammar.” 
6. Do you feel that these changes have vitiated any of the fun- 
damental purposes of the junior high school? Yes, 3; no, 19.

pils from both the elementary school and the junior high school

2. (a) In what subjects has the junior high school graduate 
most conspicuously failed? Mathematics, 14; foreign language, 
12; English, 5; commercial subjects, 2. (b) To what do you at- 
tribute these failures? Poor teaching, 5; poor texts, 3; poor 
equipment, 2; differences in objectives, 2; idea of play; imma- 
turity of pupils; too much “try out” and not enough “carry on”; 
lack of reorganization of elementary-school subjects; difference in 
methods; attempting too much; high percentage of dull pupils. 
3. (a) In what subjects has the junior high school graduate 
achieved marked success? English, 4; science, 2; Latin, 1; 
French, 1; hand work, 1; no subject, 11. (b) To what do you 
attribute this success? 
“English—Substitution of literary study for formal read- 
ing lessons. More emphasis on oral composition.” 
“Science—More initiative.” 
General comments.—‘“Junior high school methods.” ‘“So-

Review of work already done. 
“Special coaching of junior high school graduates in Eng-

“We have reorganized our curricula and subject-matter 
and developed the project and socialized form of recitation.” 
“We have changed our French and Latin courses.” 
“We have had to reach down in algebra to help up the in- 
coming students. We believe that too little drill on fun- 
damentals is given in the junior high school.” 
“They (junior high school graduates) have been kept to- 
gether in classes as far as possible.”

6. Do you feel that these changes have lowered or raised the 
scholastic standards of your school? Lowered, 4; raised, 4. 
Replies were received from both junior high school principals 
and senior high school principals in nineteen cities. A study was 
made of the agreement exhibited by the answers of these prin- 
cipals, with the following result: In general: agreement, 17; non- 
agreement, 2. In details: agreement, 15; non-agreement, 4. 
The writer carefully studied the questionnaires returned by the 
senior high school principals for the purpose of determining their 
general attitude toward the junior high school. They grouped 
themselves as follows: sympathetic, 21; unsympathetic, 10. 
The following general comments on the junior high school were 
made by senior high school principals. 
ok would like to see the junior high school continue as a 
two-year school. I think it could do all it now does toward 
 
-P-A-G-E-579
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 565 
the socialization of the child, and the senior high school 
could get him in time to participate effectively in educational 
guidance.” 
“The junior high school has possibilities. The freedom it 
accords to very young pupils is often their undoing. Home 
study is often discouraged. There is too much playing at 
work. They do not ‘dig in’ or lay adequate foundation. 
Much of the work has to be done over again in the tenth 
grade. More concentration—less dissipation—is needed. 
Too many young and inexperienced teachers.” 
One junior high school principal states the problem of articu- 
lation as follows: 
del “There is one thing which is bound to result from the 
operation of such a retention factor as has resulted from the 
junior high school and that is the promotion into the tenth 
grade of a mass of weak human material which heretofore 
has never survived to the senior high school and of whose 
pedagogical characteristics the typical senior high school 
teacher has no understanding whatever. High-school teach- 
ers do not understand that this weakness is not a matter of 
preparation, but rather one of congenital limitation. 
“Those pupils who are of the type that have always done 
senior high school work should do better work than ever be- 
fore. This is the responsibility of the junior high school. 
The other pupils who are new to the senior high school 
should succeed in their work. This is the responsibility of 
the senior high school. With reference to the latter group, 
the junior high school has done its part when it has succeeded 
in keeping them busy and interested to the point that they 
are desirous of going on into the tenth grade.” 
One fact clearly brought out by the questionnaires promises to 
lay the day of satisfactory articulation of junior and senior _ 
high schools in many places. On the one hand, there is an en- 
thusiastic group of junior high school principals so convinced of 
the destiny of the new institution that they cannot see the possi- 
bility of pitfalls ahead. These men are prone to make extravagant 
claims for the junior high school on flimsy evidence. On the other 
hand, there is a conservative group of senior high school principals  
-P-A-G-E-580

who, even if they accept the junior high school, do so in the spirit 
of a “woman convinced against her will.” One of the distin- 
guishing characteristics of these men is that they cannot conceive 
of the junior high school as having any reorganizing influence on 
the senior high school. When these two types appear in the same 
school system, the junior high school begins operations under a 
serious handicap. 
In conclusion, the writer suggests a program of articulation in 
outline form and without comment. Its features contemplate

THE JUNIOR COLLEGE AND THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL *     | | By James R. ANGELL 
The remarkable development of the American high school has 
in the last few years created a considerable number of altogether 
new educational problems. The college and the university are 
often eiree and always indirectly affected by the policy adopted 
by our high schools, and in the present junior college movement 
they are likely to find their own organization and procedure radi- 
cally affected. Responding to various motives occasional high 
schools have ra a great many years past offered work somewhat 
in advance of the college-preparatory work with which the cur-

REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 567 
riculum of most of our high schools in this part of the world comes 
to a close. In certain instances this advanced work frankly un- 
dertook to follow the lines of the work of the Freshman year in 
the ordinary American college, and was organized explicitly with 
a view to supplying this special program. In other cases the con- 
tent of the advanced work was more incidental, if not accidental, 
and materially more limited in amount. Within the past ten years 
we have had several instances of high schools undertaking to 
supply two years of work in advance of the usual four-year high- 
school course, and in this case often calling themselves junior col- 
leges. 
The development of the junior-college high school seems on the 
whole to be so natural a consequence of our general public educa- 
tional system that one can hardly cherish anything but sympa- 
thetic interest in the undertaking and hold one’s self ready so far 
as possible to assist in a wholesome line of growth. Certain obvi- 
ous dangers we must all recognize the moment attention is called 
to them. Not a few high schools are at present unable to do 
thoroughly even four years of secondary work. They lack equip- 
ment both of laboratories and of libraries; they lack adequately 
trained teachers, and they lack financial resources materially to 
improve their conditions in the immediate future. For such 
schools to consider the addition of a fifth and sixth year of work 
is a form of folly which local pride is unfortunately likely to en- 
courage, but which ought to be described by outside disinterested 
parties in the frankest and most unequivocal terms. The result 
of such enterprises is sure to be confusion worse confounded. The 
first obligation of every school is to do thoroughly well its elemen- 
tary work. 
Again, there are many schools in communities of moderate size 
doing with admirable thoroughness the work which they pretend 
to attempt, schools which are little by little adjusting themselves 
more completely to the needs of their own communities, schools 
upon which intelligent and unbiased opinion can only entertain 
one verdict—and that of a thoroughly flattering kind. For many 
such schools the attempt to take on a fifth and a sixth year of 
work, even if there be a modicum of demand for it, is likely to 
prove itself highly ill advised, for it is reasonably sure to mean 
overloading teachers already carrying their full burden of work, 
it is almost certain to involve attempting results for which the 
available facilities are wholly inadequate, and as a consequence

to substitute for a well-organized school doing faithfully and in- 
telligently the thing within its reasonable reach, a shoddy, ill- 
adjusted, and unsuccessful institution exposing itself to legitimate 
criticism and ultimate loss of public confidence. Only on the basis 
of adequate state aid could schools belonging to either of these two 
groups properly enter on junior-college work. 
Contrasted with either of these types of institutions is a con- 
siderable group, for the most part found in the larger centers of 
population, but in a few instances located in smaller but well-to- 
do communities, where the work of a junior college can be well 
afforded by the constituency, and where not a few obvious advan- - 
tages are sure to follow from the establishment of such a school. 
We have become accustomed through the notable example of one 
or two institutions in our own country to the idea that a great 
city may well fort a municipal college or university much after 
the fashion in which state universities are supported. Such insti- 
tutions are undoubtedly likely to be rapidly multiplied, and the 
junior-college high school is presumably in big cities the advance 
agent of this particular kind of educational prosperity. 
Certain desiderata in the organization of the junior college on 
high school foundations may reasonably be formulated as substan- 
tially essential to real success. The first of these without any 
great question is adequate financial support. We have certainly 
learned one bitter lesson in this country, which is that education, 
like other earthly blessings, costs money, and that one cannot 
secure it in its better qualities without being ready to pay the 
market price. Certainly to found a junior college without reason- 
able provisions for the added expenses which must be involved is 
unjustifiable from every point of view. The temptation to a con- 
trary view is subtle and pervasive. In a school not badly crowded 
with students it may seem quite possible by a little rearrange- 
ment of the schedule or possibly by the introduction of one addi- 
tional instructor to free sufficient time of the teacher of mathe- 
matics, the teacher of language, and the teacher of history to give 
courses to a small group of students ostensibly corresponding to 
the Freshman courses in college. No doubt something can be 
done in the smaller schools by rearrangements of this character, 
but if the more advanced courses are really to be given satisfac- 
torily it will be found that the small schools must almost certainly 
add to their facilities of laboratories and libraries, and that the 
advanced courses if they are to be given in a reputable way will

REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 569 
require very considerable inroads on the time of the teacher and 
in some cases will, for their proper conduct, require distinctly 
more advanced training than some of the teachers will have 
received. 
I am not prepared to urge that every junior college based on 
a high school foundation must have its faculty completely occu- 
pied by the work of the college. Indeed, I can see some obvious 
practical advantages in having the teachers who carry the work of 
the fourth year of the high school in direct personal touch with 
the work of the fifth and sixth years. I am quite convinced that 
a very large part of the friction which has been generated between 
the colleges and the high schools has been because the teachers in 
each institution, and particularly the college teachers, were so 
hopelessly unfamiliar with the actual conditions of work in the 
other type of institution. But whatever the decision regarding this 
issue, it is surely not open to question that the professional train- 
ing to be demanded of teachers who do this junior-college work 
should be made distinctly more severe than in actual practice the 
demands have been which high school teachers have had to 
comply with. I note that the California schedule demands that 
the Master’s degree at least shall have been received from a rep- 
utable institution by the teachers who undertake the junior-collge 
work. This seems on the whole a conservative and modest re- 
quirement. The requirement of the University of Illinois is 
similar but not quite so definitely formulated. 
Admission to such a junior college is a privilege restricted in 
some schools to the really high-grade students. In others gradu- 
ation from the fourth high school year is all that is required. To 
discuss the merits of this restriction is impossible at this time. 
Obviously, however, it raises a question very fundamental for the 
ideals of these institutions. 
There certainly should be, and in many of these institutions is, 
a limitation of the number of hours per week that a teacher may 
be called upon to give. Moreover, there should be assurance that 
the methods of instruction are essentially collegiate in character. 
Evidently there are three main groups of interests to be safe- 
guarded in the situation which we have been considering. The 
first is that of the colleges and universities; the second, that of the 
high schools; and the third, that of the general public which 
supports both. It may be thought that such a distinction of in- 
terests is artificial and unreal, but in point of fact it corresponds
-P-A-G-E-584
  570 | Cen EDUCATION 
with a good deal of exactness to the cleavage into mie which 
characterizes educational as well as political life. I have given 
them in inverse order of what I consider to be their intrinsic im- 
portance and directly: in the order of their ability to protect their 
own interests. ‘The colleges and universities are on the whole 
best able to safeguard these interests. The high schools are in 
general exposed to more sources of injury and such as are on the 
whole less easily controlled. The general public is in the long run 
best able to protect itself, but at the outset is least likely to find 
its immediate imerests championed by intelligent and forceful 
leaders. 
It goes id saying that in the last analysis a sane estimate 
of the situation must be based upon the largest and most far-seeing 
considerations. It must be in no narrow sense partisan, it must 
not be provincial, it must not be ignorant. - In speaking, therefore, 
to the three groups of points raised by the distinctions just drawn, 
we are frankly dealing in a purely tentative manner with the more 
obvious and obtrusive angles of the case as they present them- 
selves in terms of our current practices and prejudices. 
Taking the matter from the point of view of the colleges first, 
it is clear that if the junior-college movement in the high schools 
develops with rapidity, there will presumably be a material de- 
cline in the number of Freshmen and Sophomore students in our 
strictly collegiate institutions. This result will be welcomed en- 
thusiastically by the administrative authorities of many of the 
larger institutions, which are literally staggering under the press 
of undergraduates; it will be much less enthusiastically greeted by 
the small and struggling college to which numbers are absolutely 
indispensable for its continued life. We may, therefore, reason- 
ably expect to hear from these latter sources a great deal about 
the indispensable value of a four-year college course, of the unwis- 
dom of interrupting college life abruptly in the middle and sub- 
jecting the student to the necessity of orienting himself afresh in 
a new community; of the undesirability of remaining too long 
in a single institution like a high school, of the unwisdom of fore- 
going the larger atmosphere of the bona fide college, etc. 
It seems not altogether improbable that we may for a time 
meet in an aggravated way the type of criticism now universal in 
every well-bred college where it is good form to complain of the 
poor training with which Freshmen come up from the high schools 
and academies. It seems not improbable that by virtue of the
-P-A-G-E-585
  
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 571 
fact that a considerable number of schools may be tempted into 
this advanced work prematurely, and that they may fail to secure 
reasonable results thereby, we shall have to recognize a great deal 
of such criticism as well founded and just. On the other hand, it 
is to be said that the experience of the University of California 
with the students of a number of the junior-college high schools 
has shown them abundantly able to carry the advanced college 
work. In many instances they have done this even better than 
the students trained immediately on the grounds. Colleges which 
have been receiving students from the Joliet school and from the 
Lane and Crane technical schools would, I am sure, in many in- 
stances give an absolutely identical verdict. The college is of 
course entirely justified in asking that if students are to be re- 
ceived into its advanced courses they should really be abie tu 
carry their work with success. It may well occur that for a 
time, if not indefinitely, the colleges will be justified in regarding 
credentials from these institutions as subject to confirmation by 
the manner in which the later work of the student is conducted. 
This practice obtains in the handling of exchange credentials as 
between institutions of strictly collegiate rank, and need not be 
interpreted as containing any invidious reflection upon the persons 
party to it. It does not appear to the present speaker that the 
colleges have anything to fear from the dangers which are intrinsic 
to the principle of the junior college based on the high-school 
foundations except the loss in student attendance, and this, as 
has already been repeated, is to most of the large institutions a 
welcome and not an unwelcome prospect. Friction of adjustment 
there undoubtedly will be, and the soul of the temperamentally 
conservative kind is sure to be troubled by this new program. 
Others need feel no solicitude, and on the contrary may justly 
welcome the movement as in the line of wholesome educational 
progress, and as one which it behooves the universities to foster 
and aid with wise counsel and kindly sympathy. 
From the point of view of the schools it seems clear, as has 
been earlier indicated, that the addition of one or two years of 
college work is fraught with some dangers unless the financial sup- 
port for the enterprise is reasonably generous, unless the qualifica- 
tions of the teachers are thoroughly sound, unless the laboratory 
and library facilities are adequate, and unless the local demand for 
such an institution is genuine and reasonably energetic. To un- 
dertake such work without adequate equipment of staff and
-P-A-G-E-586
    572 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
teachers is seriously to overstrain the extant resources of the school 
both in personnel and in equipment, is to invite failure or very 
mediocre success, and therefore in the long run is likely to sacri- 
fice public confidence and set back the general movement because 
of shortcomings which are intrinsic to the local situation and in 
no sense to the system as such. 
The interests of the general public are fundamentally touched at 
every point of the situation. Ambitious principals and superin- 
tendents are likely to be injudiciously stimulated to premature 
developments of the junior-college movement in communities 
which are financially not able to afford proper support, and which 
really represent too trifling a demand to justify the necessary ex- 
penditures. On the other hand, phlegmatic or reactionary school 
authorities are likely in some communities to discourage and un- 
duly postpone the development of institutions of this type where 
the community is abundantly able to afford support, and where 
a service of unquestioned value could be rendered both to the 
community and to its young people. Communities may certainly 
demand that institutions of this character be peculiarly sensitive 
to local needs and that the junior college be not simply an ambi- 
tious attempt to copy the first two years of the conventional college 
program. The whole question of the system of taxation by which 
these institutions are to be supported and the relation of that 
system to the support of state institutions requires careful and 
thoughtful consideration. In states with a strong and well-organ- 
ized state university there is no reason why the most intimate and 
helpful co-operation should not exist as between the state and local 
institutions. The one thing which the communities ought most 
strenuously to insist upon, and the one for which it is perhaps 
least likely that there will be intelligent appreciation in advance, 
is the need of thoroughly competent and well-paid instructors to 
carry on this new work. 
It would, in my judgment, be a great mistake to view the move- 
ment as purely an administrative rearrangement of our college 
work. The meaning of the matter seems to me to lie much deeper 
than that. If I mistake not, it is one symptom simply, but one 
fraught with immense potential consequences, of a renascence of 
communal interest in higher education, of which the first great 
wave gave us our noble state universities and our agricultural and 
engineering schools. This, which has been gathering strength for 
several years in the evolution of the high school proper, promises
-P-A-G-E-587
SS, ee ae en ee ee 
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 573 
in a similar way to bring opportunities for advanced vocational 
training to the very doors of thousands of boys and girls previously 
denied them, to offer to thousands of others who really are pre- 
pared to profit by them the various forms of collegiate education, 
and in general to disseminate in the commonwealth more widely 
than ever before the desire for sound learning whose perfect fruit 
is sanity of judgment and sobriety of citizenship. 
The trend of the forces of reorganization in the later years 
of secondary education. In concluding one of the important 
sections of his monograph on the junior college, Professor Koos 
sketches the trend of the forces of reorganization as they affect 
the later years of secondary education.1? Coming as it does from 
the most extensive investigation ever made of the junior college, 
this statement contains a note of authority and prophecy which 
can serve as a guide in formulating principles of reorganization. 
Some of our higher institutions, among them both colleges 
and universities, on account of the grip of tradition and a 
selected persisting clientele, will doubtless be able to withstand 
for a long period the forces of reorganization. It is not unlikely, 
moreover, that there may be a place in the American system for 
a small proportion of institutions of the type that assumes that 
longer period of unapplied training before entering upon the 
work of the professional school. In the face of the apparently 
inevitable tendencies of reorganization shown, however, they must 
come to be regarded as atypical, the prevailing type conforming 
to the trend of reorganization as disclosed. The consummation of 
this type, bringing with it the upward extension of the secondary 
school by the inclusion of junior college years, will go far 
toward justifying those claims of the friends of the new unit who 
insist that it will place in the secondary school all work appro- 
priate to it, will foster the evolution of the public school system, 
will relieve the university, and make possible real university 
functioning. It will at the same time abate in considerable 
measure the present-day college entrance controversy, which is 
the more acute because at present both secondary and higher 
institutions presume to give general training. For the current

University of Minnesota, Education Series, No. 5. 1924.

unequivocally definable preparatory requirements of professional 
and other specializations. 
The future of ia university and of other higher institutions of confusions will f substituted the clarifying influence of more 
polytechnic type in this impending reorganization is much more 
clearly discernible than is that of its sister institutions, the sepa- 
rate four-year college and the normal school or teachers’ college. 
It is doubtless too early to essay prophecy concerning them that 
will approach realization in any significant degree, but at least 
some conjecture can be ventured. As admitted, a small propor- 
tion of the separate colleges, especially those with a ballast of 
endowment and a host of well-to-do and tradition-loving alumni, 
may be able to withstand the inevitable trend and remain insti- 
tutions affording unspecialized training throughout a four-year 
period. Most of them, however, must make further accommo- 
dations to the trend, serving their generation inthe way in which 
it insists upon being served. For the weaker units this will be 
as junior colleges which will draw their students from secondary 
schools in communities too small to warrant offering the work 
on the junior college level. In time, however, these junior col- 
leges must go the way of the private “academy 1 in territory where 
the public high schools have seen a vigorous development. The 
remainder, for the most part in a better state of development 
than those just referred to, can serve in the dual capacity of (1) 
junior colleges and (2) senior colleges in which certain types of 
liberalized occupationalization and specialization are featured. 
Few such institutions will be able to afford the variety of oppor- 
tunities for Tie of universities, but they can devote 
their energies and resources to one or a few, e. g., teaching, com- 
merce, home economics, etc. In the remote future the junior 
college division for the reason given will atrophy and these col- 
leges will then devote themselves exclusively to the senior college 
task. 
If the future form and function of the separate college is 
problematic, that of the normal school or teachers’ college is 
even more so. Perhaps, until standards of teacher preparation 
rise to appropriate heights, the normal school, like the private 
junior college as just predicted, will recruit most of its students 
from communities too small to warrant offering junior college 
work and from among those who desire this type of semi-profes- 
sional training. As these standards are raised it is conceivable 
that the teachers’ college with four- or five-year curricula will
-P-A-G-E-589

REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 575 
come to articulate with the public junior college in such a way 
as to encourage the prospective student to attend there for two 
years beyond the present high school level and to transfer to the 
teacher-training institution at the opening of his third college 
year. It seems reasonable to expect that the general establish- 
ment of junior colleges will, by making the first two years of 
training on the collegiate level more easily accessible, hasten the 
elevation of standards of teacher preparation to the strictly pro- 
fessional level. 
Although one may well question the validity of this prophecy 
of the future of the two types of institution last considered, one 
thing is certain, that the advent of reorganization of secondary 
school and university along lines involving the incorporation of 
the junior college plan will be reflected in them, for the reason 
that they must adapt themselves to the dominant contempora- 
neous organization of the educational system. | 
THE UNIFICATION OF THE BACHELOR’S DEGREE COURSE” 
By Watton C. Jonn 
The first step in unification. When at last the régime of 
prescribed studies broke down for both entrance and college 
requirements, a more effective articulation was developed between 
the entrance and college programs of study. The adoption of 
the elective system in the entrance requirements was the first 
step in bringing into coherent relation the two great agencies of 
higher education. But now the articulation between high school 
and college has reached a state where there exists little oppor- 
tunity for further advance in that respect. In many institutions 
flexibility has reached its limits; unrestricted entrance to college 
may now be gained by the presentation of a certificate from any 
first-class high school. But this flexibility in the high-school 
curricula has been paralleled to a certain extent by the rapid 
expansion of the free elective system in the college. Thus an 
undue flexibility has developed which has taken nearly all back- 
bone out of higher education in many institutions.’*

by undue flexibility in the entrance requirements.  
-P-A-G-E-590
576 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The second step in unification. The next step in unifica- 
tion is the providing of a groundwork of studies which will weld 
the systems of secondary and college education into a whole with- 
out losing the benefits of the elective system. Such a plan must 
provide a broad distribution of fundamental cultural and tool 
subjects from the definite standpoint of a seven- or eight-year 
course. An excellent distribution now exists in the majority of 
schools both for the entrance and college requirements, although 
in some cases it may be possible for students to specialize too 
early at the expense of a broad foundation in liberal culture. 
The (data upon which this discussion is based) show the possi- 
bility of a eed bachelor’s course on the basis of four 
or five of the fundamental subjects which are prescribed both 
for entrance and for the college. English, language, mathematics, 
history (social science), and science are prescribed both for 
entrance and graduation by nearly 4o per cent of the institutions 
listed, the amount of the joint prescription varying from 34 to 
79 per cent of the eight-year period. About 75 per cent of these 
colleges control the prescribed work in at least three fundamental 
subjects, such as English, language, and mathematics, from 27 
to 79 per cent of the eight-year period. In over go per cent 
of the ror colleges of our list the average total requirements of 
subjects prescribed jointly cover over 60 per cent of the eight- 
year period. This unity, as far as prescribed subjects are con- 
cerned, gives a true basis for continuity in the different subjects, 
although in some instances needless duplication results. With this 
evidence of the actual control by the college of the combined 
curricula, it is bia that it lies within the power of the college 
to further determine such distribution and concentration of 
studies over the eight-year period that will insure a thorough 
as well as a broad scholarship. In order that this result may be 
accomplished, both educator and student should conceive of the 
college course as a single unit of seven or eight years. Within 
this period the candidate for the bachelor’s degree should be 
permitted to elect, preferably at the beginning of the eleventh 
grade, a fundamental distribution group of a minimum of four 
or a maximum of six subjects. Students electing the sequences 
recommended by the college would be counted and graded as 
regular candidates for the A.B. degree, while those who follow 
the usual high school program would plan their work in harmony 
with the general or vocational aims of the high school. If a 
student should enter high school, not desiring to become a candi-
-P-A-G-E-591
REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 577 
date for the A.B. degree, and should change his mind in the 
twelfth grade, he would then be obliged to complete the necessary 
sequences in order to be in line for the A.B. degree. While some 
loss of time might be entailed, yet the student would not have 
to lose more than was necessary to give himself a mastery in 
those fundamentals deemed essential by the college. A similar 
delay is often experienced by the candidate for the M.A. degree 
who finds that he has not given enough time to his major subject 
during the four years of undergraduate work to insure gradua- 
tion in one year after receiving the A.B. degree. In such cases 
the candidate must spend a half year or more in supplementing his 
major work. 
The sequences determined by the college are to be as free as 
possible from gaps in order that continuity and concentration be 
insured. Useless duplication of subjects should be avoided. A 
final examination covering the entire ground of each sequence 
might well be required of all A.B. candidates in addition to the 
usual term or annual examinations. 
No great difference exists between the plan suggested and the 
customary plan of the major and minor option. At least one 
major sequence six or seven years in length should be required. A 
second sequence five or six years in length would support the 
first. These sequences should be the basis of professional spe- 
cialization. Two tool sequences from three to four years in 
length ought to begin early in the course so that they might be of 
help to the student in his major studies. 
From the standpoint of distribution the sequences chosen 
should lead to a broad foundation in liberal culture, while from 
the standpoint of concentration they should lead to scholarship 
and professional attainments. 
Suitable sequences may be determined for those who expect 
to be ministers, literary workers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, 
agriculturalists, engineers, commercial leaders, social workers, 
home economists, and the like. If such sequences be properly 
developed there will also be opportunity in each case to develop 
the motor side of higher education, an element often neglected 
in the non-professional courses of liberal arts colleges. The 
knowledge gained by the student in college should have some 
practical tests and applications in real life before graduation day, 
in order that he may not be thrown into the whirlpool of the 
world’s activities with theories and visions only. The entrance 
of the professional aim into the courses would tend to invigorate 
 
-P-A-G-E-592
  578 _ SECONDARY EDUCATION 
the entire program by giving each student important incentives 
based on real interest in the work at hand. The difference be- 
tween the vigor and tone of the work of the liberal arts colleges 
and the professional schools, such as law and medicine, is very 
noticeable. The addition of a lawful stimulus due to professional 
interest should be a powerful element in making for discipline and 
first-class scholarship. While independent and reflective scholar- 
ship must be safeguarded from the mere routine of profession- 
alism, there is great need of more continuous and purposeful 
effort on the part of the students of liberal arts colleges. 
Present tendencies toward « unified eight-year course. For 
a number of years several universities and colleges of high 
standing have taken the initiative in outlining a part of the 
bachelor’s degree course in terms of the entire period (eight 
years). Ohio State University and Ohio University make the fol- 
lowing requirements: 
In high school and college together the student must secure 
credit in at least two languages other than English. For those 
who enter with 6 units in language other than English, the college 
requirement is 8 hours; for those with 5 units, 12 hours; for 
those with 3 units, 20 hours; for those with 10 units, 24 hours; 
for those with 1 unit, 28 hours; for those with no units, 32 
hours. Natural science, social science, and mathematics are 
also dealt with from the standpoint of the 8-year period. (The 
high school unit equals 4 semester hours.) 
The University of California offers a unified course through its 
combined high delloo! and junior college requirements. 
The University of Pittsburgh makes the following requirements: 
Eighteen credits (secondary and college included) must be taken 
in each of the distribution fields éxclusive of specifically required 
subjects; courses in English 1 and 2 are counted in satisfaction 
of major requirement. Likewise 18 credits (semester hours) in 
some foreign language (courses taken in secondary schools to be 
included), or 12 such credits for those who offer 12 credits in 
Latin or Greek; and 12 in some other foreign language. (The 
high school unit) equals 6 semester hours.) Other definite require- 
ments are made for both the A.B. and B.S. degrees on the basis 
of both eon and college work. 
Vanderbilt University states that the required subjects of the 
freshman year are grouped with special reference to the continua- 
tion of the fede subjects offered for admission. 
Teachers College, George Washington University, permits the

substitution of college electives in place of foreign language, 
history, and biology, which are a part of the list of prescribed sub- 
jects, “to the extent that approved secondary school work has 
been done in them.” But “the foreign language requirements must 
fall in one language, while in history it is required that a survey 
of the world’s history be obtained.” 
Beloit College requires that “where 4 units of foreign language 
have been presented for entrance, the student must complete 12 
hours of foreign language work of college grade; where 2 units 
have been presented, he must complete 18 hours; where no 
foreign language has been presented, he must complete 20 hours. 
Any student presenting less than 2 units of foreign language at 
entrance shall be required to complete 132 hours for gradua- 
tion” (8 hours more than the usual requirement). 
Carleton College requires that students must complete for the 
A.B. degree six years in foreign language in secondary school 
and college, of which two years must be in Latin and two years 
must be taken in college. The requirements for the B.S. degree 
are stated in a similar manner, but only four years are required, 
and Latin is not specified. 
The University of Chicago has developed the idea of continua- 
tion to a marked degree. “The attention of students is drawn 
to the fact, as explained below, that certain subjects are required 
which may be taken either in the high school or in the college. 
It is urgently recommended that as many as possible be taken 
during the high-school course. Students who are preparing for 
a professional degree or for specialized work will materially in- 
crease the opportunity for freedom of election by adopting the 
following suggestions for their high-school work: 
“A student is advised to take throughout his last year of high 
school some subject other than English which will form the basis 
of the continuation group of his first year in college. Proper 
subjects for this continuation group are history, Greek, Latin, 
French, German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, physiography, 
and biology. This study may form a part of the principal or 
the secondary group.” 
The college requirements are built upon these continuation 
groups in such a manner as to obtain adequate distribution and 
concentration. 
Harvard University obtains continuity and concentration to 
a considerable extent by stressing the entrance requirements 
in English, French, and German. Students who pass the special

examinations in these subjects on entering college are able to 
pursue their elective subjects with greater freedom. 
The examples just cited show a growing recognition of the 
unity of the bachelor’s degree course. With few exceptions, how- 
ever, foreign language is the only subject that has definite recog- 
nition. When approved sequences in English, mathematics, 
science, social science, and vocational subjects are also prepared, 
it will be possible to unify the college course to a much greater 
extent throughout the entire eight-year period. 
Such sequences in fundamental and tool subjects would tend 
to bring an essential unity into the bachelor’s degree course over 
the entire country. 
Principles derived from a study of the reorganization of 
secondary education. The existence of an educational practice 
is not certain proof of its soundness. The divisions within 
American schools illustrate the use of the trial and error method. 
Unless the present disparity between administrative units 
can be justified by a disparity among local educational needs, 
secondary education should be reorganized so as to meet the 
actual needs. 
Varying lengths of the elementary-school course indicate the 
possibility of effecting economies of time in certain school systems. 
Excessive duplication of required subject matter in successive 
administrative units indicates ineffective organization. 
Differentiated courses within the compulsory attendance period 
are desirable. | 
School courses must be reorganized whether administrative 
units are or not. ‘ 
All organization within the schools should be judged as appro- 
priate to the American system of education just in the degree 
to which it makes for continuous and uninterrupted opportunity 
for every pupil. 
Effective Midhobecey implies the highest possible intelligence in 
all the members of the democratic group. 
A democratic school system must provide enough common ele- 
ments of training so that the thinking of the community can be 
guided along similar lines.

  REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 581 
A democratic school system must provide variations in the 
training offered to pupils of different capacities and interests. 
In order to provide the future members of society with requisite 
common elements of and variations in training, the uniform 
program of the latest elementary grades must be reorganized. 
Any satisfactory articulation of administrative units requires 
that teachers and administrators understand the purposes and 
methods of the units above and below their own units. 
No attempt should be made to establish a junior college until 
the adequate financing of a community’s secondary education is 
provided. 
Whether or not all secondary education is conducted under 
one or more administrative units, such education should be uni- 
fied so as to provide adequate sequences in the major fields of 
instruction. A

1, Why has American development a longer period of prepa- 
ration for secondary schools than foreign countries have? 
2. How do you account for the fact that children of the northern 
states require eight or nine years for the elementary school, while 
children of the southern states require only seven? 
3. What guarantee is there that the reorganization of secondary 
education would remedy the articulatory difficulties ? 
4. What is meant by a basis of common thought? In what courses 
is such a basis developed? 
5. Can a basis of common thought be laid by means of the junior 
high school organization? Discuss by referring to specific elements 
of subject matter and forms of social organization. 
6. Trace the development of junior high schools. 
7. What do we mean by elementary education? By secondary 
education? By collegiate education? 
8. Judging from Shaefer’s account of different plans of reorgan- 
ization, which plan seems most suitable to you? Defend your 
choice. Are there additional advantages or disadvantages for any 
of the types?

CURRICULUM PROBLEMS 
CHAPTER XIV 
THE OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Diverse attitudes toward the curriculum require a clear 
statement of objectives. Foremost among curriculum problems 
are the problems of deriving and formulating adequate objectives 
of high-school education. Earlier discussions in this book have 
implied certain general objectives, but a discussion of curriculum 
problems requires a more specific treatment of objectives. 
Four attitudes toward the high-school program of studies are 
maintained in educational writings and are often exemplified in 
curriculum practice: First, it is maintained that the program 
of studies -needs~frequent~revision so as to—eliminate or add 
certain subjects. This attitude may be classified as radical, 
and in actual practice, may be very radical because it leads to 
the adding or dropping of subjects before sufficient investigation 
of their merits has been made. Second, it is maintained that 
the program of studies has universal value if the subjects are 
presented in a given manner. his somewhat conservative atti- 
tude is sometimes forcefully defended by the excellent practices 
of superior teachers who, by their skill, obtain results which are 
seldom attained by the rank and file of teachers. Third, it is 
maintained that the existing_program of studies consists of sub- 
jects which may be variously treated so as to meet the needs 
of various groups of students by the use of the same content. 
Like. the second, this conservative attitude arises from a strong 
585
-P-A-G-E-600
ee ee ce ee ee REE ee NRCP eR ee mn me Te Te a eee Se ee 
586 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
belief in the skill of teachers. By tending toward a loading of 
the program with traditional subjects this attitud2 may lead to 
neglect of newer and, for certain pupils, more valuable subjects. 
Fourth, it is maintained that the program of studies is valuable 
but insufficient. This progressive attitude has the distinct ad- 
vantage of permitting curriculum makers to hold fast that which 
is good and at the same time be ever alert to find new subject 
matter which will supplement in desirable ways the old. 
The selection of one of these attitudes for adoption constitutes 
a problem which requires analysis and counsel. Such examina- 
tion and counsel should lead one to’review educational objectives, 
the derivation of such objectives, and the utilization of such 
objectives in curriculum making. The counsel which is provided 
in the following pages supplies the advice of four men eminent 
in their respective fields: Colvin in educational psychology; 
Smith in educational sociology; Bobbitt in curriculum making; 
and Charters in activity analysis and curriculum construction.? 
  THE SOURCE OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES? 
By S. S. Corviy 
Education is directed learning. There can be no direction 
without a conscious mind setting before itself an aim or pur- 
pose. Education must be planned, it must have an objective to 
be education. We learn many things, things at times doubtless 
to our advantage, with no conscious goal before us; indeed with 
no conscious goal existing in anybody’s mind. Such learning is 
slow and wasteful. Sometimes it is worse than no learning at all. 
It is this sort of learning that has predominated to a great extent 
* Three types of discussions appear in many of the chapters on educa- 
tional objectives: (1) a discussion of general aims; (2) a discussion of 
indirect values; and (3) a discussion of direct values. The first of these 
types of discussions is omitted because the author has found that any class 
of prospective teachers can readily formulate the objectives for themselves. 
The second and third types of discussions are omitted because such dis- 
cussions are already available in numerous books as cited at the end of this 
chapter.

  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 587 
in the acquisitions of humanity in its struggle up from paleolithic 
man to the civilization of to-day. Great and far-flung objectives 
have not existed; education as far as it has been present has 
been concerned rather with minor purposes and near-by aims 
than with broad and comprehensive ends, compassing generations 
and embracing different nations and different cultures. The 
educative process has been narrow and restricted; the learning 
process has been broad and universal. 
But man, to be man, must gradually extend the educative 
process until it approximates the learning process. Doubtless if 
this ideal were ever achieved in its entirety man would cease to 
be man, and become superman—a being whose vision could 
compass all the ages, whose wisdom could unerringly select the 
true from the false, and whose will could stand constant amid 
the stress of prejudice and the storms of passion to which human 
beings are the heirs. This infinite goal can never be achieved, 
perhaps, but we must progress nearer and nearer to it as we 
raise ourselves above the level of the brute and become more and 
more the man. This I take it is the great difference between 
man and brute, that man alone can be really and truly educated. 
The learning processes of both are in their fundamentals extraor- 
dinarily alike, but the educative process belongs to man alone. 
(To understand the human mind as human mind, we must under- 
stand it from the standpoint of aim, purpose, interest, intent. 
We can not understand it as the mere workings of neurone con- 
nections. These mechanical principles are helpful concepts, but 
they fail to consider the determining principles of the mind’s 
operation. 
The significant history of humanity is the history of its develop- 
ment not merely under the blind impulses and immediate desires 
that have dominated it, the efficient causes that have lashed and 
driven it on, but also under the direction of purposes conceived 
and executed—in a word under the leadership of final causality. 
This history is the story of its culture; this history is the epi- 
tome of its education. The deep, underlying material causes give 
the basis for its struggles, but the causes that are described by 
the word purpose give the vital meaning to its endeavors. Yes, 
man to be truly man must be educated, and to be truly educated 
he must conceive purposes and direct his learning in terms of these 
purposes. 
Education has always set before itself purposes, more or less 
explicit. Sometimes these have been vaguely conceived, uncriti-  
-P-A-G-E-602
  588 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
cally accepted and blindly followed, it is true; sometimes these 
purposes have been woefully narrow, sometimes they have been 
false and misleading—but purposes in some form or other have 
been present. Whence have these purposes—these objectives 
come? That is the problem. 
Religion has been generally closely associated with education 
and its ideals have at times largely determined educational objec- 
tives. Hence these objectives have been looked upon as sacred, 
unchangeable, and eternal. Many of the objectives that religion 
has furnished have been worthy and highly commendable, but 
since they are alleged to be supernatural in their origin and 
since their validity is for all time and all circumstances, such 
objectives are barriers to progress and do not allow sufficiently 
for the continuous development of human knowledge and skill. 
Religion too frequently has decided what is the final truth, what 
is the ultimate moral code and has demanded that this particular 
truth and this explicit code shall be taught in all times and for 
all peoples. Now the intent of religion in all these instances 
has been high, its motive sincere and I grant that objectives 
determined by religious beliefs are far better than no objectives 
at all, and frequently better than objectives obtained in other 
ways, but the point I wish here to make is that such objectives 
are partial, one-sided and too inelastic to permit their absolute 
acceptance. 
Recently we have witnessed a re-emphasis of the state as the 
final source of educational objectives. The teaching of “patriot- 
ism” is urgently demanded and the individual is thought of in 
terms of his value in contributing to the national life. Some- 
times this idea of the individual as merely an instrument for 
the realization of the purposes of the state has resulted in turn- 
ing the schools into means for the attainment of a narrow and 
selfish nationalism. In the days before the Great War Ger- 
many was the outstanding example of this mistaken use of edu- 
cation to serve its peculiar national ends. This tendency in its 
most terrible forms we to whom freedom is still more than a 
word abhor, yet in the milder and more subtle forms we endure 
and at times apparently welcome. Well-meaning and patriotic 
people in our own land demand that our texts in history and 
similar subjects contain this or that and exclude this or that. 
The patriot of this type would have us believe that neither col- 
lectively nor individually can the people of this country do any 
wrong in their attitudes and actions toward other nations; or
-P-A-G-E-603
ee OE I Se ET Se eee re oe eR re er ee pe eee 
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 589 
if we admit that wrong may exist, then it is thought that we 
should do all in our power to suppress the facts. 
Granted that it is possible to maintain this attitude when other 
nations are concerned, we at once find ourself in a greater diffi- 
culty when we try to adjust ourselves to a national patriotism 
within our own borders. Writers of history texts must have an 
eye to that part of the country in which the book is to be used. 
History must be taught somewhat differently south of the Mason 
and Dixon line than it is taught north. The facts are not the 
important things, but what the children are taught to believe 
as facts. So are emphasized sectional misunderstandings; so are 
perpetuated blind, unreasoning prejudices. 
Even more dangerous to our democracy than national and sec- 
tional prejudices embodied in educational objectives is the attempt 
of various classes in our social organism to impose on our schools 
their own peculiar aims and purpose, thus creating a divided and 
distrustful people—class against class, loyalty against loyalty. 
Such a division when carried to its logical extreme means the 
destruction of democracy either with resulting anarchy or with 
the dictation of the ultimately dominating class in a tyranny more 
hateful than that of an oriental despotism. As Dewey has well 
pointed out, the test of a true society is found in an organiza- 
tion of groups each with its own particular loyalties, but each 
capable of a sympathetic understanding of all other groups and 
each with a higher loyalty for society as a whole. A class- 
consciousness that is turned in on itself, that seeks its own ad- 
vantage at the expense of all else, that has no common humanity, 
will ultimately end in its own destruction, but will like a poison- 
ous growth destroy the whole social organism with it. These 
class prejudices have no place in our schools. They cannot be 
allowed to enter in to determine objectives in our American 
education. I dread the formation of every special and exclusive 
school—the school for the aristocrat and the school for the 
toiler, the school for the sectarian and the school for the free- 
thinker. The children of the American people must be educated 
in a common school, supported by the entire people and attended 
by the children of the entire people. Special schools set up to 
realize special objectives and to inculcate into the mind of the 
young special propaganda cannot spread without bringing social 
ruin in their trail. We must fashion our education on the basis 
of our common understandings and agreements, not on our mis- 
understandings and contentions.

590 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
When Rousseau changed the emphasis in education from con- 
formity to the adult standard to that of the child he set the 
scheme of things educational topsy-turvy./ His doctrine and that 
of his followers contain implicitly two assumptions, one of which 
is fundamentally true, the other, I believe, fundamentally false. 
The first is: if we are to teach the child properly we must 
understand the child and we must adapt our educative methods to 
his nature, considering his abilities and his interests. This point 
of view has found, various concrete expressions and has worked 
itself out beneficially in many ways. 
The second implicit assumption is: if we understand child nature 
we shall discover not only the methods to be followed but the 
aims to be sought) This second assumption, I believe to be 
largely false, and generally misleading. The child’s interests 
must be appealed to if he learns properly and economically. This 
is a self-evident statement. It is not true, however, that in the 
child’s immediate interests the objectives of the educative process 
can be found and formulated. Again, in all learning self-expres- 
sion is desirable, but it does not follow from this that self-expres- 
sion as such is a supreme educational objective. Neither does 
the truth of the statement, “Purposive activity is one of the 
greatest motives in leading the child on in his studious endeavors,” 
justify the further statement that the aim of education is ta 
lead the child eternally from one purposive activity to another 
or that purposive activity is the final goal of the educative process. 
Child study has served to accomplish great results in our 
methodology, but it has been barren in giving us any ultimate 
educational objectives. Sometimes its results when translated 
into terms of objectives have been not only barren but strange 
and misleading. In the days when the Recapitulation Theory 
held sway it was thought by some that the child must go through 
all of the real and fancied experiences of his savage forebears 
and his pre-human ancestors in order to be properly educated. 
To-day we are sometimes led to believe that pure spontaneity is 
in itself the educational goal, irrespective of where that spon- 
taneity leads. The ship set adrift will catch the winds in its 
sails, will set for itself a brief and ever-changing course, but at 
length it will lie stranded on the beach or grind itself to pieces 
on the jagged reef. The child must be understood in order that 
he may be guided. 
I am sure that you will agree that education has failed to 
find its ultimate objectives in the nature of the child, although 
 
-P-A-G-E-605
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 591 
it cannot gain its objectives without understanding the interests 
and purposes of child nature. In recent years an attempt has been 
made to set up educational objectives in a somewhat different 
manner and by a method that has in it a good deal of plausibility, 
but an ultimate fallacy. It is argued that the child must be 
educated to conform to his environment, hence the environment 
must be studied to find in it those elements that shall be the 
ends of the teaching process. After the analogy of the job- 
analysis a survey is made of the life in the world about the child 
to find in it those items of importance for the present and future 
activities of the child. What words should the child learn to 
spell? Answer, those words in the common written vocabularies 
of children of his age and grade, with just a few added year by 
year as he progresses toward adult life. He surely will be called 
upon to write frequently the thousand most common words in 
the English language; hence he must be taught to spell these 
words. In a similar way his knowledge and skill in arithmetic 
must be measured by his present needs and his probable future 
needs. Unusual processes and difficult and relatively useless 
skills are not to be taught for they will not function. It is 
maintained that these unusual and useless elements must be 
determined by studying the most common arithmetical practices 
in school, then excluding from the curriculum those elements that 
are uncommon. In the same way the important facts and prin- 
ciples in geography, social science and in the physical sciences 
are to be discovered and formulated into educational objectives. 
This is all very plausible, and within certain carefully set limits 
entirely legitimate. 
These objective determinations of educational values by the 
use of statistical methods is again illustrated in connection with 
the present widespread movement to measure educational prod- 
ucts through standard tests. These educational scales and 
measurements have been largely derived from a study of the 
achievements of school children under present conditions. The 
standards are determined by the prevailing practice. It is found 
that the median performance of children of certain ages and 
certain grades is this or that and this performance is taken as 
the desirable achievement without any consideration whatsoever 
beyond the results obtained. So it is happening that the stand- 
ards set up by these tests are being accepted as the desirable 
objectives of teaching without any further proof of their validity 
than that offered by the test results themselves. Thus the safe
-P-A-G-E-606
  592 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
way of procedure is being entirely reversed. Tests are valuable 
only in so far as they measure the achievement of a worth-while 
educational end already established. They are grossly misleading 
and even dangerous when taken themselves as educational 
objectives. 
Here is a new variety of educational determinism, just as 
subtle and just as undesirable as that pointed out recently by 
Professor Bagley in his searching analysis of the assumptions 
some have made as to the nature of mental testing. Bagley 
argues that by an unwise use of mental tests individual children 
may be condemned to a type of education that denies them a 
real participation in the spiritual heritage of the race. An un- 
wise use of educational tests (extremely valuable when properly 
employed) may condemn the entire school system of the United 
States to a standard that limits attainment in terms of itself 
and makes progress toward better methods and better results 
extremely difficult if not impossible. To know what is has great 
importance, to be satisfied with what is precludes all hope of 
development. 
In the above review of the various sources of educational ob- 
jectives I have kept in mind the fact that while they all possess 
a certain validity not one in and of itself is capable of setting up 
completely trustworthy and desirable goals of educational en- 
deavor. Each possesses value, but that value is partial, and when 
considered by itself may be completely misleading. The claims 
of religion and of the nation must be evaluated and given their 
due weight in the formulation of educational objectives. The 
aspirations of various social groups must be taken into account 
and the purposes of various philanthropic and patriotic societies 
recognized. But the attempt from without to frame the educa- 
tional aims of the schools cannot be yielded to completely with 
safety. Neither can the attempts from within so far referred 
to be considered.as having really solved the fundamental problem 
of what should be taught to the child. Those who seek the com- 
plete answer in an analysis of child nature and in a blind follow- 
ing of the child’s desires and purposes are sailing the educational 
sea without chart or compass, while those who hope to determine 
educational aims by an analysis and standardization of what is 
offer no method of directing the educative process toward more 
ultimate and desirable ends. Educational objectives must be 
determined from within by a sound philosophy of education. In
-P-A-G-E-607

this way, and in this way alone, is it possible to set up worth 
while and relatively permanent educational objectives. 
It is the business of a philosophy of education to evaluate 
human experience, and to discover those values most significant 
in human attainment and progress. It is not the function of 
educational philosophy merely to step in where disputes in the 
theory of education arise and settle these disputes. Educational 
philosophy must act on its own initiative. It must act con- 
structively. At times it may serve as an umpire, but this is 
merely one of its minor offices, not its chief business. 
In evaluating human experience it must make certain necessary 
assumptions among which the following seem to me to be par- 
ticularly important: 
1. The final aim of education is to adjust the individual to his 
environment, not only present and real but future and ideal. 
This means that the child is to be brought in contact with 
reality, but not a narrow and immediate reality. He is to know 
not only life, but how to grow and live in the broadest sense of 
the word. 
2. The way in which the child is to be adjusted to reality is 
by teaching him the truth in regard to reality, and in inspiring 
him with a desire to find the truth. 
3. Since all truth can not be compassed by any human being, 
no matter how great his intelligence or how persistent his efforts, 
and since truths vary greatly in their human values, the philosophy 
of education must select among these many truths those that are 
most significant and practical. 
4. Those elements in human nature that are the most funda- 
mental, the great instinctive tendencies, have an intrinsic value 
that must be recognized. We may transcend instinct but never 
eradicate it. Any scheme of education that does not give place 
for those eternal values, either actually or vicariously, is 
incomplete. 
5. The permanent achievements of the race, those won through 
countless ages of toil and suffering, must be accepted as valid 
until they can be proved unworthy and until a substitute for them 
can be provided. Education must be largely the transmission 
of the culture of the adult generation to that of the child. Not 
all things can be doubted, every attainment set aside. Youth can 
Mot dictate, it must follow. An age which seeks its philosophy. in

6. Those things are most valuable in human life that con- 
tribute to sympathies and understandings; that stand against 
narrow prejudices and blind hates. The world to-day is 
threatened as never before with class prejudices and national 
hatreds. These menace the very foundations of civilization. 
7. Human freedom is a necessity for real living. Educational 
objectives must lead to the development of individuals who can 
live their lives in self-restraint, and mutual cooperation, free from 
petty laws and artificial social restrictions, who shall be laws 
unto themselves not because they are above law, but because they 
have comprehended and intelligently accepted the fundamental 
laws of human nature and society. 
8. These great truths of human life and experience when 
recognized and comprehended must be the final objectives of 
education. From these down to the lesson of the particular day 
lead mediate objectives and immediate aims. They determine the 
subject matter of the curriculum and the emphasis that shall be 
placed on its various elements. The facts that are here em- 
bodied are to be taught as they are, not as we would like to 
have them. The will-to-believe must be banished from the class- 
room, all propaganda as such removed. It is the teacher’s sole 
business to teach to the child things as they are. This is the 
purpose that should dominate the teacher and the pupil alike— 
the purpose of seeking the truth and knowing the truth. So, 
since truth is never complete but always in the making, the spirit 
of teaching and of learning will be one of constant endeavor and 
unending progress. What is known will be accepted until it is 
set aside by some higher and more complete knowledge. Facts 
will be important until disproved by other facts. Hence there 
will be stability in change. The world will be real but always a 
bit new, and purpose will develop into further purpose not for 
the sake of purpose, but for the sake of truth which the learning 
mind purposes to find and comprehend. 
THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL AIMS* 
By W. R. Smirz 
Sociologists are in the habit of proclaiming that the central 
field of knowledge of most worth and the human characteristics 
most needed in our modern highly differentiated society are social. 
> American Journal of Sociology, XXIV, 81-95. 1918. Abridged.
-P-A-G-E-609
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 595 
They likewise insist that increased recognition be given to socio- 
logical principles as the basis of efficient institutional management. 
If these propositions are to be maintained, the sociologist must be 
prepared to accept increasing responsibilities for showing how 
these social qualities may be developed and for applying the 
principles of his science to the clarification of institutional 
problems. 
An analysis of the specific purposes of our present educational 
system will show at least three things: first, how far the present 
directors of our schools are from an intelligent sociological view 
of education; second, some of the steps already taken by our 
most progressive educators to introduce socialized materials and 
methods; third, the urgent need of sociological aid in further 
elaborating ways and means of developing social-mindedness 
through school training. To get at the problem it is necessary 
to analyze the social aspects of the four specific objectives enter- 
ing into our present educational aims, that is, the development 
of physical vitality, of cultural attainment, of vocational effi- 
ciency, and of social service. 
Some aspects of physical training. With regard to the first 
- objective of education, the development of physical vitality, the 
individualistic conception alone has prevailed. A sound mind 
in a sound body, or more specifically a sound body for the sake 
of a sound mind, has been the avowed purpose of the educator. 
In order to attain organic soundness, physical fitness, and good 
health for each individual we have established gymnasiums, taught 
physiology and hygiene, condemned injurious habits, outlawed 
petty vices, and built up a medical profession. In the pre- 
liminary stages of all these the welfare of the individual was 
practically the sole aim. If the welfare of the social group 
entered into the public mind at all, it was only in a hazy and 
indefinite sort of way. 
In recent years, however, as the intimacy of social contact 
has emphasized mutual dependence, there has been a growing 
tendency to think and talk about the public health, that is, to 
consider physical well-being from the standpoint of the social 
group. It is realized that individual health and strength is no 
adequate defense against unsanitary conditions, monotony and 
overstrain in industry, or epidemics of contagious diseases. Some- 
thing more than personal hygiene and individual fitness is 
required. We must have a social hygiene and social health 
control.   
‘
-P-A-G-E-610
  596 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
In pursuance of this new attitude we have developed an exten- 
sive body of regulative laws limiting the physical freedom of the 
individual for the physical protection of the group. Laws have 
been enacted establishing the eight- or nine-hour day, prohibiting 
child labor, requiring sanitary shops, forbidding the sale of 
impure food and drugs, enjoining vaccination, and supervising 
medical practitioners. Constructive social health measures are 
taken in the opening up of municipal and national parks, in pro- 
viding public playgrounds and amusement centers, in establish- 
ing quarantine regulations, in draining swamps, and in con- 
structing sewers. Public hospitals exist in every center of popu- 
lation, physicians are compelled both by social pressure and by 
statute law to attend to the needs of the poor, and it is scarcely 
an idle dream to look forward to the time when the whole field 
even of curative medicine will be socialized. 
Still more social in its outlook is the plea for a sound physical 
heredity. We are evolving a program of eugenics which has 
been up to date primarily concerned with efforts to guarantee to 
coming generations a better physical foundation on which to build 
an efficient society. Marriage laws are being more carefully 
drawn, social diseases are being scientifically attacked, and efforts 
are being made to see that dependents, defectives, and delin- 
quents have less opportunity to multiply their kind. While some- 
thing is being done, and much more might be done to advance 
such a program by developing a sense of individual responsibility 
for guarding heredity, the classes of people who need to be pre- 
vented from reproduction cannot be reached by an individu- 
alistic appeal. Social regulation alone can attain the results 
desired, and this regulation must be based upon a social intelli- 
gence and a social conscience which do not now exist and probably 
never will exist until we have a more social type of education. 
To lay an adequate foundation for this new field of legisla- 
tion and to develop efficient social control over physical well- 
being it is necessary to begin with the young. As our school 
day and year lengthen and the average number of years of 
schooling increases, the school becomes a greater force in deter- 
mining the social attitudes as well as the intelligence of our 
citizens. It therefore becomes increasingly important, not merely 
to develop sound bodies in our individual pupils and to teach 
personal hygiene, but to develop sane ideas of preserving the 
health of the larger group and to teach social hygiene. The 
youth must be trained, not merely to develop and conserve his
-P-A-G-E-611
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 597 
own strength, but to safeguard that of his fellows. Just as proper 
habits or health are essential to individual welfare, so proper 
obedience to social health measures is essential to social welfare. 
Moreover, a mere knowledge of social hygiene will not accomplish 
the desired results. A social consciousness must be built up that 
will respond to public regulation, and a social consciousness 
must be developed that will recognize and protect the rights of 
others. Since in the long run no law can be more effective than 
public opinion requires, it is necessary to see that individual will 
is reinforced by group imperatives. Health legislation and social 
hygiene will remain comparatively impotent until they have the 
support of a trained public mind, and the chief agency for 
developing that must be the public school. 
That educators are beginning to recognize this is quite evident 
in their changed attitude toward physical training. Social 
hygiene is being emphasized even in the primary grades. Organized 
play is superseding the calisthenics and spasmodic semi-indivi- 
dualistic play of the past. Team games are succeeding individual 
contests. Quarantine regulations are being more strictly en- 
forced. Public-school physicians, dentists and nurses are taking 
the place of the individual medical attention formerly received. 
The textbooks in physiology and hygiene are embodying much 
social material. Teachers are recognizing more fully their obli- 
gations to the public and are emphasizing the social responsi- 
bilities of the citizen in maintaining the public health, Many 
schools are models of sanitation, and certain cities, such as Gary, 
are looking after sick pupils better than they would be looked 
after at home. All of these things and many more have been 
started in our highly socialized schools, but to make them still 
more effective and to universalize them it is necessary to inbue 
all educators with social ideals. 
Social aspects of culture. With regard to the second objective 
of education, the attainment of culture, public opinion is scarcely 
less individualistic than with reference to the development of 
physical vitality. The education of the past has striven to pro- 
duce cultivated individuals. When analyzed, the popular notion 
of culture breaks up into three parts—esthetic taste, refinement 
of manner, and moral idealism. Thus the cultivated individual 
has been expected to appreciate and know something of literature, 
music, and art, to possess some degree of grace, good manners 
and self control, and to have wholesome impulses, refined senti- 
ments, and ethical attitudes. Nor can we question that the
-P-A-G-E-612
    598 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
attainment of these things is a desirable end of cultural educa- 
tion. But it is not the only end. There is a social aspect of culture 
above and beyond these things. One might possess all of these 
individual characteristics and still fall short of cultivated citizen- 
ship. Since the school is a public institution, mere polished per- 
sonality can never satisfy its cultural demands. Individual culture 
may be subjective and passive, social culture must be objective 
and active, and the culture for which a social institution stands 
must eventuate in social activities. (The graduates of our schools 
should not merely exemplify individual culture; they should 
become active agents of group culture through institutional 
channels. 
The weakness of mere individualistic culture may be shown 
with reference to each of the elements mentioned above. With 
regard to the zsthetic nature one may possess excellent indi- 
vidual taste and yet show execrable social taste. He may have 
artistic ideas of dress and yet array himself in barbaric quixotism. 
Fashion may dictate a costume that will exaggerate the defects 
and conceal the beauties of a society leader possessing unim- 
peachable personal taste. Likewise a housekeeper may have a 
sane natural taste in furniture and household decoration and yet 
follow a crude fad in her own home. A painter may have sound 
ideas of art, a writer a sound appreciation of literature, or a 
musician a sound love of music, and yet each of them follow 
some fantastic school into artistic absurdities. Individualistic 
taste in itself is not an adequate defense against the tyranny of 
fashion, fad, style, and conventionality. If education is to 
render effective aid in developing esthetic sanity it must be 
social enough to provide constant group training where diverging 
ideals clash in a struggle for survival bitter enough to produce 
compromise. Azsthetic progress demands freedom for exercising 
individual taste, which can only be brought about in the atmos- 
phere of friendly criticism and artistic tolerance. 
Moreover, social welfare demands a social use of esthetic 
taste and artistic appreciation. Civic art must have sponsors, 
public libraries must have promoters, and community music must 
have leaders. In a crowded world everyone with an artistic 
accomplishment is needed in social capacities. Where each one’s 
work is narrow and specialized and often burdened with drudgery 
it is necessary to have public entertainment, social diversion, 
and mutual cultural inspiration. A painter may hoard his 
treasures, a potential literary master may lack the social incentive
-P-A-G-E-613
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 599 
to write, or an exquisite violinist may refuse to share his musical 
joys with others. It is no less a function of education to give 
this social direction to the spread of the fine arts than it is to 
produce individual artists. 
As the possession of personal taste is no guaranty of artistic 
social service, so the possession of refined manners and individual 
self-control is no proof of refined public attitudes and social 
self-control. No amount of individual self-control will stop 
a panic in an army or a financial crisis. In other words, social 
self-control, or self-control under social pressure, is a somewhat 
different thing from individual self-control, and its development 
demands a different kind of training. 
Likewise social morals are separate from, and supplementary to, 
individual morals. Some men with personal honesty do not 
hesitate to engage in an essentially dishonest business. Others 
who would not think of committing murder will deliberately 
make and sell poisoned drugs or adulterated foods. The ordinary 
man with plenty of public spirit will fail to aid justice by inform- 
ing public officers of violations of the law, and a group of repu- 
table business men will knowingly overvalue a bit of personal 
property taken under the law of eminent domain by their city 
or the state. In a similar way a social organization composed 
of honest individuals will fail to pay its debts, a church may stoop 
to gambling devices to raise money, a political party composed 
of patriotic citizens will defraud the public, and a group of 
sincere reformers will over-ride the rights of a large body of 
citizens. Dr. Ross has well shown that the great sins of the day 
are the results of a lack of a social conscience that will sense the 
indirect consequences of personal acts and carry over personal 
morals into social morals. 
If the facts in the foregoing analysis show that personal culture 
and social culture are not identical and that an individual may 
possess the one and not the other, it is worth while to inquire 
how they may both be developed. In our present society edu- 
cation is the basis of culture. If the education is individualistic 
we may expect an individualistic culture. Only a social educa- 
tion where group ideals of art and conduct and morals are 
emphasized can result in social culture. Self-control under group 
pressure will never be established until people are trained to 
react. sanely toward social suggestions from their youth up. A 
public morality that will approach private morality in effective-
-P-A-G-E-614
600 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ness must wait for a school training which will call for constant 
moral decisions in self-determining groups. 
Social aspects of vocational efficiency. The third of our educa- 
tional objectives, vocational efficiency, is also usually thought of 
from the individualistic standpoint. (The purpose of vocational 
education as ordinarily expressed is to enable the individual to 
increase his income or tg enable him to make a better living 
for himself and his family. } But such a view shows a narrow vision. 
In our highly organized industrial society economic rewards are 
reciprocal. The income of any individual in any particular oc- 
cupation depends in the long run upon the prosperity of his 
particular group, or even of the whole economic fabric of which 
his occupation forms only a part. Individual income is no more 
important than social income, and from the larger viewpoint the 
wage of a particular laborer or occupation group is no more 
vital a concern of the vocational educator than the general wage 
scale or the proper direction and control of vocational effort. 
That every occupation has its social as well as its individual 
aspect may be made evident by specific applications. 
Capital is the result of surplus effort and saving. The enor- 
mous increase in the productive power of the individual laborer 
of the present over the laborer of the past is due quite largely 
to accumulated supplies of capital goods with which he may 
work. This supply of productive capital has been built up largely 
because each worker in a useful occupation produces an economic 
surplus. It is the sum total of individual production that creates 
the social dividend which in the long run, in spite of a crude 
system of distribution, somehow accrues to the advantage of all 
workers. Productive agencies are so bound together in reciprocal 
service that whatever an individual adds to the total benefits not 
only himself but others as well. 
There is also a reverse side to the record. If a vocation be 
non-productive or individually and socially injurious the whole 
economic fabric is weakened. A business failure is not merely an 
individual calamity—it is a social calamity. Any large percentage 
of business failures discourages industry and undermines general 
prosperity. The bungler or the slacker in his work not only 
lowers his own income, but casts discredit on his occupation, 
injures his fellow-laborers, and weakens the productive capacity 
of allied industries. Even more do the parasite and exploiter 
undermine general economic efficiency. An occupation may re- 
turn individual profits and be honestly managed, but may in itself
-P-A-G-E-615
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION _ 6or 
be destructive. The dive-keeper, the bucket-shop manager, and 
sinecure office-holder are examples. Any sort of vocational 
efficiency must tend to eliminate such occupations. Moreover, 
most vocations have certain elements of hypocrisy and graft that 
need to be curbed. Good lawyers stimulate doubtful litigation, 
excellent physicians encourage useless calls, reputable ministers 
preach insincere sermons, efficient manufacturers produce worth- 
less goods, honest real-estate dealers foster false booms, con- 
scientious artisans conceal faulty workmanship, and energetic 
day-laborers kill time. None of these things is more individually 
culpable than socially harmful, yet the general condemnation of 
such practices imputes the whole guilt to the individual who 
indulges in them instead of sharing it with the community which 
endures them. If a cure is to be effected it must come as much 
through a change in the social attitude toward work as through 
improvement in the individual attitude. Social motives must 
be made to reinforce individual motives. 
Another phase of vocational efficiency is seen in the necessity, 
under our latter-day methods of conducting business, of securing 
a spirit of cooperation in the worker. A high grade of efficiency 
demands that one be, not. merely efficient in his own special 
field, but able to coordinate his work with that of his fellows. 
This requires an intelligence which can comprehend the whole 
process if it be in manufacturing, or the whole business if it 
be retail merchandising, or the whole institution if it be a pro- 
fession. It further requires more than individual adaptability; 
it demands a willingness to sacrifice certain self-ends to the 
needs of the group or social ends. If labor organization is to 
benefit labor as a whole, not only must the individual workman 
join it, but he must own an allegiance that will reach beyond his 
special occupational union into the larger federations. 
That we are beginning to recognize the social aspects of voca- 
tional training is quite evident in professional education. The 
minister is trained, not merely to look after the interests and 
increase the size of his flock, but to labor for the upbuilding of — 
the whole community. The lawyer is urged by his law pro- 
fessors not only to win his cases, but to become an agent of social 
justice. We are demanding that the physician be a sponsor for 
social hygiene even at the expense of his own professional income. 
The virile teacher is expected to go beyond the confines of his 
school routine and carry his intellectual leadership into the 
community. Trainmen must keep trains loaded and moving,
-P-A-G-E-616
  602 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
miners must keep up the supply of coal, and steel workers and 
shipbuilders must keep the machinery of their trades busy. In 
every phase of our industrial system we are pleading the neces- 
sity of co-ordinated efforts and demanding the recognition of* 
group needs as an important basis of individual labor. 
If education is to be directed toward the increase of vocational 
efficiency, and all education is to some extent vocational, it is no 
safer to neglect its social aspects than its individual aspects. 
Just now we are in the midst of a campaign to vocationalize more 
specifically our public schools, and whatever may be our indi- 
vidual feelings we may be sure that it will partially succeed. The 
greatest danger in the process of vocationalization is that it shall 
be too narrow and technical in its aims. The only guaranty 
against this weakness is to see that social motives are instilled 
along with individual motives and that socializing methods are 
as much in evidence as individual instruction. We must main- 
tain a broad enough curriculum to develop intelligent builders 
who take pride in their work, as well as efficient carpenters. We 
must increase industrial knowledge as well as train ingenious 
mechanics. We must make our teachers technically efficient, 
but not less must we make them broad-minded educators. We 
need skilled physicians and lawyers, but not less do we need 
organizers of health control and reformers of our clumsy legal 
machinery. 
Individualistic v. organized social service. The final objective 
of education, social service, is the only one which is generally 
recognized as having special social implications. Even here the 
individualist in education still maintains his individualistic point 
of view. Social service may be looked at from the standpoint 
either of its subjective value to the individual or of its objective 
value to society. From the individual standpoint its purpose is 
primarily to develop personality or to fulfill one’s personal duty 
to help others. From the social standpoint its purpose is to 
increase the effectiveness of social organization or to fulfill an or- 
ganization’s duty to help society. The essential divergence comes 
from the direction of the vision, whether one looks at himself 
as a component part of a group or at the group as a specialized 
part of himself. It is the same difference that exists between 
egoism and altruism as motives of human action. We give 
higher ranking to altruistic than to egoistic motives, even though 
they may, and often do, result in the same type of conduct. In 
the same way social service inspired by group motives is on a
-P-A-G-E-617
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 603 
higher plane than the same service performed through individu- 
alistic motives. This may be made clear by specific applications. 
The basis of philanthropy is human sympathy. One may 
express his sympathy by aiding the individuals he knows or 
alleviating the misery he comes in contact with; or he may work 
through institutional channels, giving his aid to the organized 
agencies for human betterment. It is quite possible for one to 
be sympathetic and helpful, and all of us know people of this type, 
without being willing to contribute freely to organized charities. 
But we also know the weakness and dangers of purely personal 
charity. It is based on elemental feeling and is likely to degen- 
erate into mere almsgiving. Organized philanthropy is superior 
because it is more likely to be constructive and is usually adminis- 
tered by trained workers whose sympathy is guided by intelligence 
and whose group loyalty keeps them from being led astray by 
unworthy personal appeals. Personal charity begins with the 
individual, while institutional philanthropy always proceeds from 
the group outward. Institutional service properly directed is not 
impersonal in the sense of losing the personal touch, but it does 
call for a higher type of devotion and demands for its support a 
more socially minded clientele. It is social service par excellence, 
and before it can be universalized requires an impersonal social 
sympathy and an educated social conscience. 
In the same way civic service may proceed from either personal 
or social motives and be made either an individual or a group 
enterprise. A citizen may work for political betterment because 
it will improve his citizenship and give him a greater personal 
following, thus opening up a means of political preferment, or 
he may do the same work for the good of his city, his state, or 
his nation. While the results may be essentially the same the 
impulse to service is essentially different. It takes a higher 
type of personality to respond to the group or social motives 
than to serve from individualistic motives. We glorify patriot- 
ism because the patriot thinks first of his country and later 
of himself. Likewise in business a man may work with an 
eye single to the success of his own establishment or with an 
added conscious effort to promote business efficiency. 
If we are to increase and improve through education the type 
of social service which springs from social-mindedness we should 
develop an educational system that will train our citizens as 
directly as possible for social activities. The only system of 
education that will do this is the one which emphasizes social
-P-A-G-E-618
  604 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
studies and gives continual practice in assuming group responsibili- 
ties. No past age has ever offered such a variety of institutional 
memberships and opportunities or has been able to stimulate 
through social organization such breadth of social-mindedness 
as we have in the United States today. It is the public 
school alone which seems to possess the breadth of purpose 
properly to co-ordinate social activities and to reach the child 
while he is plastic enough to make its teachings effective, that 
promises an adequate development of this necessary social- 
mindedness. Nor may we expect its possible service to be even 
approximately realized until it is more highly socialized in its 
teaching personnel, its curriculum, and its methods than it is 
at present. 
We have pointed out the special need of social hygiene.as well 
as of individual health instruction, the demand for social-esthetics, 
social_ self-control, and social ethics-as well as for individual 
artists, individual self-control, and personal morals, the _value- 
of vocati msiveness and idealism as well ‘as of vocational 
efficiency, and the superiority of organized social service inspired 
by group. loyalty over egocentric social service inspired by indi- 
vidual impulse and ambition. 
THE OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION‘ 
By Franxuin Bossitt 
In the world of economic production a major secret of success 
is predetermination. The management predetermines with great 
exactness the nature of the products to be turned out, and in 
relation to the other factors, the quantity of output. They 
standardize and thus predetermine the processes to be employed, 
and quantity and quality of raw material to be used for each type 
and unit of product, the character and amount of labor to be 
employed, and the character of the conditions under which the 
work should be done. Their predetermination of the finance is 
called their budget. The business world is institutionalizing fore- 
sight and developing an appropriate and effective technique. 
There is a growing realization within the educational profes- 
sion that we must particularize the objectives of education. We, 
too, must institutionalize foresight, and, so far as the conditions 
of our work will permit, develop a technique of predetermination 
*The School Review, XXVIII, 738-749. December, 1920. Abridged.
-P-A-G-E-619

OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 605 
of the particularized results to be aimed at. We are awakening to 
the obvious truth that when a long journey is to be taken, one 
of the most necessary things to know before setting out is the 
destination. 
The administrative awakening to the need of determining with 
definiteness the goals of public education is coming surprisingly 
late. In the world of economic production: it is axiomatic that 
nothing can be done until it is decided what products are to be 
turned out; but in the field of public education we have in large 
measure been building and organizing our huge plants and operat- 
ing them full blast without having definitely predetermined the 
kinds of products which we are going to turn out. Exceptions, 
of course, must be made in the case of a few things, such as the 
ability to read, to write, to spell, to compute, to read maps, to 
express one’s self in clear and correct English, and a few others. 
These matters are mainly taken care of upon the elementary 
level. The high schools for the most part have not particularized 
their objectives in terms of human activities or human well-being. 
The situation is well stated by Dr. Snedden: 
“The great problems of secondary education today are, of 
course, problems of aim. The concrete, immediate aims which 
control the large majority of our administrative and peda- 
gogic procedures in the American high school (and how very 
concrete and definite and exacting many of them are) are of 
quite unknown value. We have not defined them in terms 
of human-good; /we seem unable to estimate the value of the 
results achieved in our efforts to realize them. We teach 
our prescribed algebra strenuously and with some very definite 
objectives, but we flounder pitifully when we try to prove 
that these objectives are really worth while. We have re- 
fined and standardized our immediate objectives in teaching 
physics and chemistry, but what we actually attain by it all 
in terms of human well-being remains concealed in the ob- 
scurity of vague phrase and inadequate generalization. We 
drive our boys and girls hard up the steeps of Latin, French, 
and German, but we are forced to fall back on mystical and 
uncertain faiths in the endeavor to justify our driving of par- 
ticular youths up these particular steeps. 
“We have in reserve, of course, large, splendid aims which 
are alleged, finally, to guide the evolution and destinies of 
our secondary schools. Do we not freely use such terms as

‘Character formation,’ ‘mental discipline,’ ‘self-realigation,’ 
‘social efficiency,’ ‘culture,’ ‘citizenship,’ ‘leadership,’ ‘intel- 
lectual power,’ and a score of other unanalyzed general 
phrases, as expressive of our ultimate goals? And in 
these are there not summed up most of the purposes that 
really count in this life? It must be admitted that we do still 
live largely in a maze of faith (and fable) as regards educa- 
tion. . . . For, after all, our great fine aims in secondary edu- 
cation, expressed in tenuous even though aspiring phrase, are 
in reality only faith aims; in practice they rarely actually 
guide us in choice of ways and means; and we seldom stop 
to measure the tangible results of our teaching against the 
shadowy and ever-varying interpretations of these aims as set 
forth in books and journal articles.” ® 
During the five years since Dr. Snedden’s statement appeared, 
much, very much, has been done. The National Education Asso- 
ciation Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education 
in its “Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education” has pre- 
sented a statement of seven groups of educational objectives which 
should dictate the work of high schools. For each field they 
present a few examples of particularized objectives. A similar 
type of task is being undertaken by many superintendents, prin- 
cipals, and professors of education. The realization of the need 
is well expressed by Dr. Hollister in a letter to the high-school 
principals and teachers of Illinois: 
5 “Tt is very desirable that, before we consider the time and 
place to be given to various subjects and activities in the 
school curriculum, we should determine clearly what our 
objectives are to be. By this means only shall we obtain any 
reliable basis for weighing the various subjects as determined 
by the relative importance of each in attaining such objec- 
tives.” 
“In most discussions of the objectives, certain shortcomings are 
painfully evident. To mention one, the objectives are usually 
too general for the guidance of actual procedure. For example, 
the National Education Association Commission recommends the

following seven: (1) health, (2) command of fundamental proc- 
esses, (3) worthy home membership, (4) vocation, (5) citizen- 
ship, (6) worthy use of leisure, (7) ethical character. 
This is a genuine contribution; but it can have little value in 
the guidance of practical labors until these general terms are 
broken up into their specifics. To aim at health, for example, in 
a vague, general way is scarcely to aim at all. We need an 
itemized statement of the specific habits which condition good 
health and which, therefore, are to be developed in men and 
women during their formative years; an itemized statement of the 
attitudes and valuations which lie back of and support these 
habits; equally specific statement of the definite powers of judg- 
ment to be developed; statement of the bodies of information 
needed for guidance, control, and the intellectual support of habits, 
valuations, etc.; statement of aspects of physical development in 
which the individual’s pride should be awakened; and a number 
of other things. 
Let us illustrate by presenting a sample list of specific health 
abilities at which education might aim:

ning games, fencing, folk dancing, fishing, hunting, canoeing, mo- 
toring, camping, athletic events, etc. 
5. Ability to engage in a variety of unspecialized productive

and physical upbuilding and maintenance. 
38. Ability to perform one’s civic functions in co-operating with 
and in the social support and control of all public agencies 
engaged in promoting the general physical welfare. 
If the educational objective agreed upon by the profession is 
simply the general matter of health, it is possible for the cur- 
riculum-maker to miss a considerable or even a large portion of the 
field without even knowing it. If, however, we have a full and 
detailed list of the abilities required, then the curriculum-maker 
is guided in the formulation of a complete and well-proportioned 
program. The foregoing list will probably not require many 
additions to be relatively complete. It was formulated from the 
suggestions of several hundred experienced professional workers. 
It is the judgment of the writer that our profession should draw up 
<o-operatively as early as practicable an authoritative list to be 
used for guidance in curriculum-making. 
An ability is a complex or composite thing. Each of the fore- 
going objectives can be broken up into further specifics. Each 
one of them requires certain habits, valuations, attitudes, interests, 
tendencies, desires, items or bodies of information, powers of 
judgment, impelling faiths, social sensitiveness and responsive- 
ness, pride of physique, etc. We are not ready really to formu- 
late the curriculum until we have taken each several ability and 
thus broken it up into its specifics and laid them out before: us 
for our guidance in formulating pupil-experiences. Education 
will not aim at the development of the abilities in a merely general 
way. It must aim definitely and accurately at the development 
of each of the specific ingredients which make up the abilities. Let

Many other items should be added to the list before it is even 
reasonably complete. Enough are here given to illustrate the pro- 
fessional task which lies before us. It seems that not only should 
we co-operatively formulate a full and authoritative series of 
abilities to be developed, but we should likewise co-operatively 
formulate for each one of them a reasonably complete and authori- 
tative series of the specific ingredients to be aimed at. With 
such lists before the curriculum-maker in any specific situation, 
he has full and secure guidance. 
Such a list is imperative because of professional prejudices and 
predilections relative to the so-called content of education. The- 
oretically, we value much besides information; but practically, 
leaving aside fundamental processes and certain language abilities, 
emphasis everywhere is upon information and informational tech- 
nique. The foregoing list shows information to be a necessary 
component of the educational structure; but equally evident are 
habits, attitudes, valuations, desires, interests, tendencies to ac- 
tion, sense of responsibility, etc. In spite of what we say relative 
to the values of these latter things, we do not actually aim at them 
with the precision and persistence that we employ in the case of 
 
-P-A-G-E-627
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 613 
information. For most of them we have no properly developed 
and actually operative technique. We are not likely to have such 
until we have more fully clarified our ideas relative to objectives 
of non-informational type. When we realize that they are as 
important as information, then we shall develop the necessary tech- 
nique of training. 
Let our profession co-operatively develop these general and 
detailed lists of objectives of physical efficiency, and we shall 
have performed the first task in the development of scientific 
education in this field. As a matter of fact, we are not prepared 
rationally to perform the other tasks involved in physical educa- 
tion until this has been done. It is the objectives and the objec- 
tives alone, as conditioned by child-nature and opportunity, which 
dictate the pupil-experiences which make up the curriculum. It 
is then these in their turn which dictate the specific methods to 
be employed by the teachers and specific material helps and 
appliances and opportunities to be provided. These in their turn 
dictate the supervision, the nature of the supervisory organization, 
the quantity of finance, and the various other functions involved 
in attaining the desired results. And finally, it is the specific ob- 
jectives which provided standards to be employed in the measure- 
ment of results. We are trying to introduce scientific methods 
into every aspect of the field; but, quite clearly, the interrela- 
tionships of these factors are such that we can never develop scien- 
tific procedure throughout the field until we have laid a secure 
foundation in the careful determination of the objectives. The 
later educational procedure cannot be regarded as very scientific 
if it must ail be based upon initial vague and fragmentary guesses 
as to the objectives. 
The first step of scientific procedure is predetermination of the 
outcomes. 
To avoid misapprehension, we must say that there can be no 
series of physical education objectives applicable equally every- 
where and to all individuals which can be the basis of universally 
uniform courses of training in the field. The objectives actually 
aimed at within any school system must differ from region to 
region according to the specific needs of the population; they must” 
differ from individual to individual according to the specific na- 
ture and needs of the beneficiary; they must differ according to 
the teaching, supervisory, and material resources of the commu- 
nity; they must differ in some measure according to the social
-P-A-G-E-628
614 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
character and attitudes of the laymen in different communities; 
they must differ according to the degree of parental and com- 
munity co-operation which can be secured; and for othér reasons. 
There is probably little or no danger in the co-operative task 
here recommended resulting in the uniformization and mechani- 
zation of the physical-training program. It is when we are aiming 
in vague and general ways that it appears possible to have a uni- 
form program. When we reduce our objectives to specifics and 
look at the children from the point of view of those specifics, then 
not only the undesirability but the impossibility of holding to-uni- 
form programs of training becomes clearly evident. 
The absurdity of our uniform courses of training has long been 
theoretically evident; but practically our technique of curriculum- 
making has tended to encourage and retain this vicious uniform- 
ity in our courses of training. Before we can eliminate the evil, 
we must change our technique of curriculum-making and find 
methods which encourage the exact adaptation of the curriculum 
to the needs of individuals, classes, and regions. The particulari- 
zation of our objectives is undoubtedly one major feature of such 
individualizing technique. 
ACTIVITY ANALYSIS AND CURRICULUM CONSTRUCTION ° 
By W. W. CuarTers 
There are two clear-cut theories concerning the relation of the 
curriculum to the activities of the individual. The theory upon 
which current curricula have usually been constructed maintains 
that the content of the curriculum should come from the specialist 
and be applied by the individual to the activities in which he 
engages after he has learned them. The specialist in chemistry, 
for instance, constructs a course in that subject which presents 
the fundamental facts and principles of the science as the chemist 
uses them. The same material is taught to chemists, engineers, 
farmers, doctors, housekeepers, and laymen, with the expectation 
that each will apply such of it as he may need, to the activities 
of his vocation or his leisure. The lexicographer selects the 
spelling list for the school and thereby specifies what he considers 
to be the fundamental spelling vocabulary. This list the indi- 
vidual learns and of it he uses those words which he may need in 
writing letters, articles, speeches, or reports. To these illustrations 
* Journal of Educational Research, V, 357-367. May, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-629
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 615 
may be added the curricula in history, botany, zoology, physics, 
design, mathematics, grammar, sociology, and others. In all of 
them the theory of specialistic determination holds that the fun- 
damental content of the subject taught in the schoot-is-determined 
by the specialist; and that the learner, after acquisition, uses 
what he needs. 
The other theory, which is the natural outgrowth of the theory 
of evolution, maintains that the content of a school subject is de- 
termined by the use to which it will be put. \ It quite willingly 
grants that the chemist shall determine thecontent of chem- 
istry courses for prospective chemists but it emphatically main- 
tains that the same right shall be granted for the use of the engi- 
neer, the doctor, the housekeeper, the farmer, and the layman. 
The theory of evolution holds that a structure which functions 
successfully in one situation may be beneficially modified when 
placed in another situation. The supporters of the theory of ac- 
tivity analysis, to apply the parallel with evolution, hold that the 
situation of the specialist as described in terms of his activities, 
duties, and problems, is not identical with that of the engineer, 
the doctor, or the layman whose problems and duties are different 
and that, therefore, the structure of the curriculum may well be 
modified more successfully to cope with the differences of each. 
But the method of activity analysis advances beyond the law 
of natural selection which operates rather blindly in the field of 
biological life in preserving useful accidental variations. A bio- 
logical organism changes its structure through accidental varia-: 
tion so that when it comes into possession of characteristics which 
are of superior efficiency in controlling a type of situation in which 
it is placed, it tends to retain the useful modifications thus more 
or less accidentally thrust upon it. Rational beings, however, 
in developing social organisms, such as the curriculum is, can ad- 
vance a step beyond the law of natural selection by first making 
an analysis of the situation to which adjustment is to be made and 
~ then developing an organism which meets these conditions in a 
superior way. i 
This is primarily what activity analysis attempts to do in the 
field of curriculum construction. The activities in connection 
with which a subject may be used are analyzed to discover exactly 
what the individual is to do and then the subject material neces- 
sary to assist in the performance of these activities is collected 
and organized. For instance, one situation in which the learner
-P-A-G-E-630
  | 
616 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
Fe é i | woe finds himself is concerned with the communicating and recording 
of facts. Specifically, the layman writes letters, and children com- 
pose original themes. To analyze this situation a count is made of 
words—in personal letters and in the writing of children. The lists 
so obtained become the spelling vocabulary for the elementary 
school, which is the school for laymen. For the spelling curricu- 
lum of the business college in which stenographers and typists are 
trained, the same method is used but applied to a different situa- 
tion in which word counts of business letters are made. Arith- 
metic for the layman may be determined by a collection of 
arithmetical problems which the layman meets. Mathematics for 
chemists is determined by an investigation of the mathematics used 
by chemists. The chemistry used in food courses is obtained by 
derivation from the content of food courses. The grammar neces- 
sary for the correction of errors is secured after an analysis of 
grammatical errors of school children. The English composition 
needed by engineers is disclosed by an analysis of the uses to which 
engineers put the subject. The sociology needed by the layman 
is obtained by an examination of the social problems which con- 
front the layman, just as the sociology needed by the sociologist 
is determined by the problems encountered in the field of soci- 
ology. 
In all cases the theory of activity analysis holds that the struc- 
ture of a subject varies with its function and its content with its 
use. It leaves a place for the specialists’ organization of the cur- 
riculum by allowing that the function of the subject for him is one 
of many functions while it opposes the claim that the structure 
which is best for the conditions of the specialist meets all other 
situations equally well. 
The method of activity analysis is profoundly significant and is 
so incompletely understood that the writer has taken the liberty 
of presenting some of the problems which have to be met in its 
use. For clarity these will be listed and described as dichotomous 
situations in which the selection of one or another of pairs of con- 
siderations modify methods of analysis and of curriculum con- 
struction. 
Parenthetically, it may be said that an activity analysis is the 
analysis of both the mental and physical activities which are 
carried on by individuals. Used in this broad sense, activities in- 
clude not only what people do but what they think, and feel, 
or will. In its most complicated form, the analysis is concerned
-P-A-G-E-631
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 617 
with a broad range of physical actions, feelings, and purposes, as 
in the analysis of the activities of women made for the purpose of 
constructing a college curriculum for women. In its simpler forms, 
it involves the analysis of definite operations, to which the term 
job analysis is applied, as in the analysis of the operations in- 
volved in running a machine. Between these two extremes are 
activities displaying all gradations of complexity and requiring all 
degrees of analytical ability. 
The first dichotomous situation which causes a modification of 
methods is contained in the distinction between sequential and 
non-sequential activities. By a sequential operation is meant one 
in which the constituent activities normally follow each other in 
regular order. Most personal routine duties are of this sort, such 
as dressing in the morning and baking a cake, or as in machinery 
operations in production plants and annual calendars of animal 
husbandry. Non-sequential activities, on the contrary, are ar- 
ranged in no regular order in the performance of any operation. 
Specifically, communication of ideals through spelling, writing, and 
language is non-sequential because there is no regular order ob- 
served in the occurrence of words or rules of syntax since their 
use is dependent upon the demands of varying situations. A job 
analysis of salesmanship, in which all the activities or duties are 
to be listed, is much more difficult than the job analysis of cabi- 
net making. A job analysis of home making deals with duties 
some of which are routine and sequential but most of which are 
irregular and non-sequential in their appearance. 
This leads to very marked differences in methods of analysis. 
For sequential jobs, the usual procedure followed by the job 
analyst is to obtain from each of several operators in separate in- 
terviews a list of his duties, to combine these, to resubmit the list 
to them, and to have it checked by the foreman. In non-sequen- 
tial jobs the same procedure is used as a basis but from knowledge 
born of experience, the analyst finds that he needs to make a 
supplementary analysis by long continued personal observation 
of the operations and in some cases by a long continued perform- 
ance of the job. A case in point is that of the analysis of sales- 
manship which was made by us last year. Interviews were-held 
with many salespeople for the purpose of obtaining a list of their 
difficulties; to this were added interviews with several managers 
and superintendents; but so little was obtained from these 
sources that a member of our staff with competent experience in 
   
-P-A-G-E-632
ee ee ee 
618 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
| selling, had to be detailed to watch salespeople at work daily for 
: three months before we felt that we had a reasonably accurate list 
of the duties of retail selling. In other words, the analysis of non- 
sequential jobs is much more difficult than that of sequential 
activities and requires a more elaborate technique. 
A second bifurcation of methods is necessary according as the 
analyst wishes to make an activity analysis or a difficulty analysis. 
For instance, a spelling vocabulary based upon analysis may list 
either the words most frequently used in correspondence or those 
most frequently misspelled. In the former case the top words 
are such as: in, all, and, as, and for. While in the latter the 
words which lead the list are: separate, which, there, and their. 
While theoretically every learned activity at some time or an- 
other is a difficulty, with the result that eventually the two lists 
are identical, there are practical situations in which the activity 
analysis is not as efficient as the difficulty analysis. For in the 
first place, operators are often unable to report what they do be- 
cause many of their duties have become submerged habits, while 
they may easily be able to recognize the duties with which they 
have difficulty because difficulties require the focusing of attention. 
In the second place, if the analysis is made after activities have 
been partially learned it is extremely important to know those with 
which the learner now has difficulty in order that special attention 
may be given to them. So, in the study of language in the school, 
to which children come with some proficiency in speech, it is less 
important to know the rules they use than the rules they break. 
For practical purposes, in this case, it is unnecessary to teach 
them rules which they cannot break while obviously it is of first 
importance to teach them rules whose observance will eliminate 
error, When the operations have been carried along to a posi- 
tion of partial mastery, difficulty analysis becomes a necessary 
method in the construction of a training curriculum. 
This is the fundamental position of Bobbitt in his theory of cur- 
riculum construction, though it can be demonstrated in opposi- 
tion to this position that it will hold only where activities have 
been partially learned and is, therefore, not of sufficient breadth 
to determine all the activities which should be included in a school 
curriculum. These can be determined only by an activity analysis, 
to which a difficulty analysis is a necessary supplement in the 
later stages of learning. 
A third distinction of sufficient importance to be mentioned
-P-A-G-E-633
  ’ 
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 619 
is that between what may be called gross analysis and detailed 
analysis. If the analysis is made sufficiently minute it is pos- 
sible so objectively to determine the content of the curriculum 
that the work can be performed in the laboratory; but if the 
analysis ceases before working units are obtained, it becomes 
necessary to supplement the findings of the analyst by confer- 
ence with faculty committees. For instance, a study of the 
mathematics used in chemistry by Williams is carried to suffi- 
cient detail for not only the operations but their range of com- 
plexity to be determined with such exactness that a review 
course may be worked out in detail. At no point in the study 
is any item a matter of opinion. So, also, the spelling lists 
obtained by word counts are sufficiently detailed to establish 
objectively the actual content of the spelling curriculum. On 
the other hand, the job analysis made by Strong of the duties 
of executives, as the basis for a curriculum in commercial engi- 
neering, was so complicated and the pressure of time so great 
that only the broad outlines of the content of the derived courses 
could be determined, with the result that for the completion of 
the work committees of teachers of all subjects concerned be- 
come a necessary part of the method. 
Gross analysis, then, is not so objective as detailed analysis, 
ahd requires the use of consensus and conference while a 
detailed analysis makes opinion an unnecessary part of the 
methods of curriculum construction. The goal of all curriculum 
construction is the elimination of as much of the subjective 
element as possible, though this cannot be entirely accomplished. 
A fourth distinction in the use of activity analysis arises from 
divergent uses of the analysis. The employment departments 
of commercial and industrial organizations make analyses to 
obtain job specifications while the training departments use 
them for curriculum content. For job specification, it is neces- 
sary to list only what is to be done by an operator in a specific 
position so that when the employment office is called upon to 
select a person for the position he will know the nature of the 
job. For curriculum construction, it is necessary to supplement 
this information about what is to be done with additional infor- 
mation as to how the operations are to be performed. For these 
reasons the job specification is much less detailed, and as a 
matter of fact it is usually found that the curriculum cannot be 
based upon the employment department’s job specifications. New 
 
-P-A-G-E-634
a eee Oe SPT ES ap GY ee gee kee coe ce” Ops Oa 
620 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
analyses have to be made by the training department with much 
greater attention to the details of the operations. Theoretically, 
the job specification is the proper basis for the training pro- 
gram; but because of these differences i in function those job spec- 
ifications found in employment offices will not usually suffice. 
This leads naturally to a fifth distinction which may be stated 
in the form of a question. Shall training departments teach the 
installed methods of job performance or the best methods? The 
obvious alternative is the latter, but practical considerations 
may cause a change of opinion. For instance, if in the training 
of operatives in the correspondence division of a large depart- 
ment store the management asks the training department to 
make a change in the system as well, it is in effect asking it not 
only to teach but to reorganize. So, because of the expense 
and time involved, it may be advisable for the training depart- 
ment to teach the imperfect installed procedure rather than to 
effect a more efficient procedure before the training program is 
begun. Yet, it may be said parenthetically, that in business the 
tendency is toward placing both training and organization on 
the shoulders of the training department, especially when a 
radical reorganization is not required. 
Nor are the schools free from this problem. Superficially, it 
seems self-evident that only the best methods of performing 
activities should be taught in the school. But in practice it is 
often a question whether this is wise. Is it advisable, for 
example, to advocate the best methods of solving social and 
political problems (the best being determined by the judgment 
of conscientious teachers) if it is not practically possible to make 
the necessary reorganization of social institutions which will 
permit the most efficient methods to be used? In these difficult 
cases the wise teacher modifies his best in such a way as to make 
it the best possible under existing conditions and teaches his 
students the methods by which reorganization of social insti- 
tutions may be effected. But in either case the curriculum is 
affected by the point of view which is chosen. 
The sixth consideration is the distinction between ideals and 
activities. An activity analysis is not sufficient to determine 
the curriculum unless standards of performance are set up by 
which to make a selection of methods. This is done by the 
determination of ideals, which dominate the performance of the 
activities. This is recognized informally in the selection of 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-635
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 621 
men in business by the inclusion in the job specification of both 
the duties to be performed and the personal qualities desired. 
Some positions require courtesy, others demand scholarliness, 
and all require honesty and conscientiousness. So in building 
a curriculum it is necessary to determine both activities and 
ideals. For instance, a secretary may have the duties of answer- 
ing the telephone and of meeting callers. These may be done in 
several ways but obviously the ideal of courtesy is so important 
that only courteous methods of answering the telephone and of 
meeting callers will be selected.. Merely to perform these duties, 
or to perform them with wrong ideals, will not lead to efficiency. 
Consequently in school as in business the determination of 
standards in the guise of ideals is an essential part of all cur- 
riculum construction. So important is this procedure that 
faculties should conscientiously and reflectively determine the 
ideals whose stamp their graduates shall bear and then apply the 
appropriate ideals as standards for the selection of alternative 
methods of performance. Long and laborious as this procedure 
is, it is the only method by which the curriculum can be built 
or can be acquired. In all curriculum construction, the ideals 
must be determined before the methods for performing the activi- 
ties obtained by analysis can be selected. 
Of a somewhat different sort is the seventh bifurcation. This 
lies in the distinction between primary subjects and derived sub- 
jects. To clarify this distinction an illustration may be given. 
When in the major job analysis made by Strong the duties of 
the executives of certain industrial organizations had been ascer- 
tained and the information necessary to perform them had been 
listed, there was found to be a large amount of English, of 
psychology, and of economics, but only a very short list of the 
principles of physics. So far as the primary subjects, that is 
those discovered in the analysis, were concerned physics was 
judged to be relatively unimportant; but this did not mean that 
no other items of physics were necessary. For, when the primary 
subjects, such as mechanics, were examined, it was found that 
physical laws were necessary for their mastery. So, to obtain 
a full curriculum in physics it was necessary to list all the items 
of physics revealed in the primary analysis and to derive from 
the other subjects the additional items of physics necessary to 
understand them. 
This means that the so-called fundamental service subjects 
 
-P-A-G-E-636
  622 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
of mathematics, chemistry, physics, sociology, or history are 
essentially derived subjects rather than primary subjects revealed 
in the analysis, It may be said in passing that this explains in 
part the statement of professional men that they do not use 
their fundamental subjects and explodes the claim sometimes 
made that because they do not use them, they should not learn 
them. For, obviously, at one time it was necessary for them 
to learn the fundamental subjects in order to understand methods 
which they now use; and it is legitimate to forget items once the 
basic use for them has ceased. However, this does not mean 
that the method of specialistic determination is to be followed. 
It is still necessary for the.fundamental service subjects to be 
derived by activity analysis so as to include only what must 
be understood; but it is not a matter for alarm if later they are 
forgotten after use for them has disappeared. 
Finally, a distinction needs to be made between the voca- 
tional elements and the extra-vocational elements in the curri- 
sulum of the vocational school. The vocational portions of the 
curriculum can be obtained by the analysis of vocational activi- 
ties and the material may be collected under the domination of 
selected ideals. But just as the doctor or the engineer is some- 
thing more than a mere doctor or engineer because he has extra- 
vocational responsibilities and interest in his family, his friends, 
and his civic problems, so the curriculum of the vocational school 
must include more subject material than is obtained from a job 
analysis of the vocation. 
Two analyses are necessary, a vocational analysis and an 
extra-vocational analysis. The activities and interests of extra- 
vocational life, those problems and interests which all men have, 
irrespective of vocation, must be analyzed by the same methods 
as are used in the vocational analysis. 
At present the extra-vocational content is determined nega- 
tively. A few hours are set aside in the course of study for 
so-called cultural subjects and the selection of courses to fill 
them is largely left to chance. What we advocate is a positive 
approach to the question through an activity analysis of extra- 
vocational life from which can be definitely determined what will 
be of most use for the individual in furthering those interests 
and needs which are not directly connected with the vocation. 
Other considerations might be presented to illustrate the 
‘problems of curriculum construction but enough have been men-
-P-A-G-E-637
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 623 
tioned to show the possibilities and the difficulties of activity 
analysis. 
In conclusion, the foregoing considerations demand that when 
activities are analyzed, ideals and standards must be set up to 
aid in the selection of subject material; that in analyzing acti- 
vities, difficulty analyses may supplement activity analyses; and 
that in all cases the analysis should be as detailed as possible 
in order to secure the largest measure of scientific objectivity. 
Non-sequential jobs are difficult of analysis but the task is neither 
impossible nor impractical. The content of subjects may be of 
direct use in activities or may be derived from subjects which 
are of direct use, as the basis upon which they rest. Finally 
all courses of study in vocational schools must include not only 
vocational but also extra-vocational content, both obtained by 
the analysis of activities—the former by an analysis of the 
vocation and the latter by an analysis of extra-vocational life. ee

well-known classroom ways. The academic objectives have 
rarely been the abilities which should currently function in 
everyday life. Rarely has education looked to the life of the 
community by way of discovering its specific objectives. 
The Los Angeles labors assumed that textbook information is 
a means, not an end; that it is not a thing merely to be memorized 
without looking beyond; but that it must look forward to abilities

and personal qualities actually needed by the men and women 
of the city. 
We, therefore, first undertook the task of drawing up a com- 
prehensive list of human abilities and characteristics which 
appear to be generally needéd by the ns of Los Angeles. It 
was not-supposedthat the schools would systematically attempt 
to develop each of the many characteristics and abilities. It 
was obvious that many of them are of such a simple nature that 
they can be developed by observing and participating in the 
general community life. The presumption, however, was that 
if we had a complete series of the generally needed abilities and 
characteristics, from this comprehensive list we could select those 
which were so complex and difficult as to require the labors of 
the educational profession. This portion of the total list would 
comprise the objectives of education. The mode of procedure 
in preparing a list of objectives was as follows: _ 7 
1. The writer placed before the organization a suggestive list 
of abilities and characteristics which had been drawn up co- 
operatively in his classes of graduate students in the University 
of Chicago, numbering several hundred in the aggregate, most 
of whom were high-school teachers, elementary- and high-school 
principals and supervisors, superintendents, and normal-school 
and college instructors. This list of abilities was, therefore, a 
carefully winnowed and organized list which had resulted from 
several years of actual labors. It would have required the 
teachers in Los Angeles a long time to work out from the begin- 
ning so finished a list. 
While we refer to it as being relatively finished, as a matter 
of fact it must be remembered that it represented but the empiri- 
cal judgments of several hundred professional men and women; 
it did not represent the fruits of any scientific studies in the 
field of education. It is a pioneer formulation which is yet upon 
the level of hypothesis. For the reason just given, there was no 
thought of imposing this list upon the Los Angeles situation as 
a thing prescribed. There was also the further reason that in 
many respects the city of Los Angeles is differently situated and 
has different problems from those of the Mississippi Valley from 
which most of the graduate workers had come who were con- 
cerned in formulating this original list. 
For the teachers in Los Angeles, therefore, the list was intended 
to be an illustration of the kind of thing they needed; to show   
-P-A-G-E-639
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 625 
the kind of details of which such a list should be made up; to 
save labor on their part by suggesting a large number of things 
which it was obvious they would themselves suggest. 
2. The second step was for the twelve hundred high-school 
teachers in Los Angeles to formulate a list of the human abilities 
and characteristics which in their judgment“Wweére advisable or™ 
desirable for the men and women of that city—irrespective of 
whether the schools were to adopt them as their objectives or 
not. The method of accomplishing this task is indicated by the 
following questions which relate to the long series of abilities 
and characteristics which was at that time placed in their hands. 
To citizens, school officials, and teachers of Los Angeles: 
1. Which of the following human characteristics and abilities 
appear to be generally desirable, and therefore legitimate objec- 
tives of education? 
2. Which ones are frequently, but not generally, desirable? 
3. Which ones are probably undesirable, and therefore not 
legitimate objectives of education? 
4. Which ones are at least questionable? 
5. Which ones should be amended in statement? What 
amendment would you suggest? 
6. What additional abilities and characteristics, not here sug- 
gested, are also desirable, which should be added to the lists 
by way of completing them? It is for completing an acceptable 
series of lists that we are particularly anxious to receive 
suggestions. 
7. Which of the following statements of ability are not clear 
in meaning? 
In replying to any of these questions, except the sixth, the 
abilities can be referred to by number. 
The questions were designed to discover the abilities already 
assembled which the majority could approve for the entire popu- 
lation; those which they could approve for a portion of the 
population; those which they would cast out as undesirable or 
illegitimate; those which should be carefully studied because of 
their questionable nature; those which should be amended in 
content or mode of statement; and finally, they’ were asked - 
to suggest any ability or characteristic desirable in the men and 
women of the city which was not included in the list. This gave 
them for formulating the desirable abilities and characteristics 
a plan which provided absolute freedom to formulate whatever  
-P-A-G-E-640
626 - SECONDARY EDUCATION 
list they would, and to do it with the greatest possible economy 
of labor. 
The original list of abilities and characteristics exactly as sent 
out to the schools is not here reproduced. Instead, we present 
in this chapter the slightly revised and extended list which resulted 
from our several labors. Practically all of the items of the origi- 
nal list were approved. A few were eliminated because of dupli- 
cation. In a few cases two or three were combined into a single 
one for the sake of simplicity of statement. The list was found 
already so complete that relatively few additional ones were 
suggested and most of these were really already included by 
implication in the list. About twenty additions were made. 
It might be urged that the list of abilities and other personal 
qualities should result from a careful scientific analysis of com- | 
munity needs by trained investigators. Doubtless this is the | 
case. But where are the trained investigators who possess the 
technique, and who are otherwise prepared to do the work? They 
do not yet exist. Of course, there is any number of persons who 
could take the lists of abilities here presented, or others similarly 
drawn, and go to the society and gather facts by way of proving 
them. We should discover what we already know. Take, for 
example, the ability to read. So far as the writer is aware, there 
has never been any scientific investigation which proves that 
this is a needed ability. When the proofs are about us on every 
hand, so convincing and so incontestable, it is a work of superero- 
gation to take the trouble to prove it. Of course we could send 
out scientific investigators to assemble the proofs. But it is 
needless. The common judgment of men, where opinion is so 
undivided, is a sufficient basis for practical action until the con- 
trary is proved. 
In the same way, most of the fundamental abilities included 
in our lists—we do not here refer to the minor ones—represent 
the common judgment of thoughtful men and women. Science is 
needed in some cases for making them quantitatively exact; but 
not often for proving their need. 
There is another reason for not awaiting the results of 
scientific research. The schools are now in operation. The 
objectives are needed at once. Every subsequent step in cur- 
riculum-making is dependent upon them. The best practicable 
method that will provide them immediately should be employed. 
The practical man values science for guidance; but where it does
-P-A-G-E-641
OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION § 6277% } 
not exist, he must get on with the best substitute available. In © 
the absence of science, the best hypothesis that can be formulated 
provides the safest guidance. 
The abilities and characteristics. Man’s activities lie in many 
fields. Different modes of classification are possible. It seems 
best, however, to employ as nearly as practicable, the common 
classifications of everyday life. It is believed that the following 
ten pee cover the field: 
I. Social intercommunication, mainly language 
II. The Development and Maintenance of One’s Physical 
Powers 
III. Unspecialized Practical Labors 
IV. The Labors of One’s Calling 
V. The Activities of the Efficient Citizen 
VI. Activities Involved in One’s General Social Relation- 
ships and Behavior 
VII. Leisure Occupations, Recreations, Amusements 
VIII. Development and Maintenance of One’s Mental Effi- 
ciency 
IX. Religious Activities 
X. Parental Activities, the Upbringing of Children, the 
Maintenance of the Home Life. 
There are probably few desirable human activities which will 
not fall within one or another of these several categories. The 
activities then point to ten classes of abilities which men need. 
Under these ten headings, therefore, we have grouped the abilities 
and characteristics sanctioned by the teachers of Los Angeles 
as desirable for the men and women of the city. It must be noted, 
however, that in some cases the abilities are considered desirable 
for the entire population; in other cases they are considered 
desirable for only a portion of the population. Some of the things 
are needed by certain social or ability classes and not by other 
classes. Some of the things are appropriate for men, and some 
of the things for women, although the great majority of them are 
desirable for both. Ultimately it will be desirable to draw up 
a separate list for each of these population groups. For the 
immediate labors this general list sufficiently serves the purpose. 
‘The teachers of-literature went through the comprehensive 
series of abilities and selected those which should be kept in 
view as the goals of the work in literature and general reading. rs

After they had thus pointed out the abilities to be aimed at, 
a statement of literature objectives which involved the more fun- 
damental ones chosen was drawn up and submitted to the teachers 
for their consideration. The following list includes the funda- 
mental objectives as they were chosen. 
1. The ability, disposition, and habit of abundant and greatly 
diversified reading as a means of enjoyable and fruitful indirect 
observation of men, things and affairs, and of vicarious participa- 
tion in those affairs. 
2. The ability through reading to enter into and participate 
in the varied, but especially the serious, thought-life of the 
world. 
3. A proportioned intellectual apprehension, such as one’s 
native capacity will permit, of men, things, and affairs; together 
with the necessary normal interests, emotional accompaniments, 
etc. Specifically, such as the following: 
(a) The nature of man, types of men, social classes, etc. 
(b) Human institutions. ‘ 
(c) Manners and customs. 
(d) Special human groups and their specialized situations, 
activities, duties, problems, etc. (This includes occupation 
groups.) 
(e) The genesis of man and his institutions, customs, arts, etc. 
(f) Man’s creations of myth, legend, and folklore. 
(g) The world of technology. 
(h) The world of fine arts. 
(i) Man’s physical and geographical habitat: (1) The world 
of plant life; (2) world of animal life; (3) world of chemical 
phenomena; (4) world of physical phenomena; (5) the geologi- 
cal world; (6) the astronomical world. 
4. A mind enriched with the world’s great literature. 
5. A “human race,” “brotherhood of man,” “large-group” social 
consciousness. Sympathetic and intelligent social attitudes and 
reactions—to things local, state, national, and international. 
6. Language abilities which in part result normally from abun- 
dant and diversified reading: 
: (a) Ability to read with proper ease, speed, and comprehen- 
sion. 
(b) Ability to spell the words of one’s writing vocabulary. 
(c) Command over an adequate reading, speaking, and writ- 
ing vocabulary.
-P-A-G-E-643
  OBJECTIVES OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 629 
(d) Ability to use English which is grammatically correct. 
(e) Ability to organize and express one’s thoughts effectively. 
(f) The ability to get the essential thought of books or 
articles quickly with a minimum amount of reading. 
(g) Ability to read a foreign language. 
(h) A proper character and degree of language-mindedness. 
(i) Amateur ability to do literary production of different 
kinds. 
This tentative list may be modified. The foregoing objectives, 
however, were accepted with such unanimity that it is improb- 
able that any of them in substance will be rejected. Further 
changes are likely to be in the mode of a statement; and by 
adding others to the list. 
With the foregoing objectives before them the next task of 
the teachers was to formulate a statement of pupil activities and 
experiences necessary for achieving each of them. For Objective 
I, for example, they were to draw up a list of which the follow- 
ing is only a beginning. 
Literature Objective I. 1. The pupil will read literature 
several hours each week in ways and under conditions as normal 
as possible. 
2. He will read books, stories, articles, etc., appropriate to his 
level of maturity and degree of achievement. 
3. He will himself, with the advice of, and within the limits 
set by his teachers, choose the books that he will read. 
4. He will read literature that reveals life and institutions in 
the different countries of the earth. 
5. He will read literature which reveals human life and affairs 
at different periods in the world’s history. 
6. He will do most of his reading at home. (Except where 
home-life is abnormal.)

both juvenile and adult.

conditions permit, rapidly.

which can be dignified by the name of principles. The only 
thing possible at present is to set up certain general assumptions, 
which are admittedly tentative, but which can serve until some- 
thing better can be provided. In large measure, they are but 
hypotheses. But nine-tenths and more of the practical work of 
education proceeds on the basis of hypothesis. The science of 
education is to be derived in time through the testing out of 
these hypotheses,

tion. The objectives of education must be stated with reference 
to, if not in terms of, pupils’ nature, abilities, and interests, 
and with reference to sound principles of teaching. What pupils 
are to learn is not, however, fully revealed by their own narrow 
and immediate interests. 
Human experience in general as well as pupils’ narrow and 
immediate interests must be examined to discover the values 
which are most significant in human attainment and progress. . 
«fhe final objective of education “is to adjust the individual to 
his environment, not only present but future and ideal.” 
The curriculum-maker must select from among all truths those 
which are most significant and practical. 
The existence of certain objectives or practices is me a certain 
proof of their justifiability.

to enable educators to supplant individualistic aims by social 
aims.

“The structure of a subject varies with its function, and its, 
content with its use.” 
Actual human activities and needs should be examined in 
order to find out objectively ‘and specifically what the schools 
should attempt to do. 
As a source of objectives, activity-analysis must be accompanied 
by an analysis of required standards of performance so as to dis- 
cover the ideals which dominate performance. 
Activity analysis should be supplemented by difficulty analysis. 
A survey of local conditions is necessary because the objectives 
must vary from place to place, from individual to individual, and 
they must: vary according to the equipment of the school, the 
character of the population, and other social conditions. 
“Every item in a curriculum is but a means to an end; it is 
necessary, therefore, to know what these various ends are.” 
Characteristics of practical educational objectives are concrete- 
ness, clearness and simplicity of meaning, and adaptability to 
the time and place in which they are proposed as guides.

CHAPTER XV 
Tur RECONSTRUCTION OF CURRICULA AND SUBJECT MATTER 
Adapting work to pupils. Modern educators have attempted 
to adapt school work to pupils’ needs and capacities. Certain 
attempts at adaptation are still in experimental stages; other 
attempts seem already to have led to satisfactory readjustments 
of work. 
Leaders in the reorganization of any established forms of pro- 
cedure ordinarily meet opposition from various sources. Leaders 
in educational reorganization have been no exception to this 
principle. Many proposed changes in educational practice have 
met with bitter opposition because of the way in which the 
changes have been proposed or introduced into schools. For 
example, the elective principle in choosing subjects has been 
applied in such an uncontrolled, haphazard manner as to dis- 
credit in certain schools the whole principle of election of courses. 
Again, courses in general science have been “taught” by inferior 
teachers of art, civics, or foreign languages, and, as a result of 
slight returns from the courses, general science itself has been 
discredited with certain observers. Examples of this sort might 
be multiplied, but the point is already clear that poor results 
from a new policy may show absolutely nothing about the merits 
of the policy itself. Persons who are very prone to criticize 
adversely whatever is new should bear in mind the fact that cer- 
tain old policies and courses are sometimes rendered quite as 
worthless as anything new. For example, unenlightened, groping 
souls without hope or purpose are at this moment trying to 
teach traditional mathematics, and in doing so are convincing 
: 635

    636 _ SECONDARY EDUCATION 
certain talented pupils that no good can come from the science 
of measurement. 
The purpose of this chapter is not to present readings which 
will convince students of the desirability of all proposed forms 
of reorganization. Instead, the purpose is to provide readings 
which show certain directions already taken in the reorganization 
of subject matter. These readings are typical of the best dis- 
cussions of plans for reorganization. Final judgment cannot be 
passed upon many of the issues involved in these readings until 
schools have given the new plans a thorough trial under favor- 
able conditions. If students will follow the history of any one 
of these lines of educational reorganization they will find that it 
is common for the leaders in such reorganization to be the sever- 
est critics of it. 
The general problem of reorganization of subject matter is 
set forth in the article by Briggs. The article by Glass shows 
a number of directions which experimentation is taking in the 
junior high school. The résumé of the Elyria survey shows how 
the survey method can be utilized in the reconstruction of an 
entire high-school program of studies. The discussion of mathe- 
matics illustrates one of the comprehensive attempts at the re- 
construction of courses of study.t 
It is of more than passing interest that the school teachers and 
officers are taking the initial steps in the progressive activities 
described in this chapter. This condition indicates that a signi- 
ficant change has occurred, for until recently many educational 
changes were initiated by persons or organizations outside the 
schools. For example, Jessup shows that 
The pressure which brought about the introduction of music 
was generated by the organization of public sentiment by people 
outside the school. The rapid introduction of drawing can be 
traced to the influence of the public opinion directed by the manu-

facturers of Massachusetts and elsewhere. Economic and humani- 
tarian forces united in consciously creating a pressure which 
resulted in the introduction of manual training and domestic 
science. The sudden rise in interest in physical education in 
the early nineties was due to the organized activities of the 
German Turners, The Christian Association and private munifi- 
cence. All of this is a striking commentary on the character of 
the school as a public institution and on its responsiveness to 
public opinion and certainly points clearly to the conclusion that 
these modifications in the curriculum have largely come from 
without rather than from within the school group.” 
CURRICULUM RECONSTRUCTION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL* 
By Tuomas H. Briccs 
The problem of secondary-school curricula manifests its full 
scope and difficulty only if the term is expanded from its present 
technical restrictive sense to include the details of instruction. It 
is evident on a moment’s thought that any judgment as to the 
proper combination of studies leading to graduation must be 
superficial and tentative unless there is full knowledge of just 
what each subject proposes to teach and how. This discussion,, 
therefore, will use the term “curriculum” as comprehending | 
not only a systematic grouping of subjects butalso.the details) included in each subject i 
The~obstacles*to a thorough revision of our secondary-school 
curricula, the need of which every thoughtful student of educa- 
tion recognizes, are three. First, there..is.the normal human 
satisfaction with what is. Probably the great majority of 
people, especially those to whom original, independent thinking 
is difficult and unusual, are content to continue without serious 
questioning practices that have been inherited from the past, 
practices that to an unanalytic and uninformed mind seem 
generally to have produced satisfactory results. This majority 
are given a complacent confidence by the definiteness of existing 
programs as contrasted with the indefiniteness and lack of 
agreement in new proposals, especially when the former are set

up as requirements, often by those who are laudatores temporis 
acti. The old program apparently produced them; therefore, it 
must be good for all. 
A second obstacleis the lack of clear definitions. of-ends or aims 
and consequent fundamental~principles... Everyone approves 
of “education,” “the good life,” “democratic citizenship,” but 
we may search in vain for any “analysis of these ends that is at 
all definite, extensive, and commonly accepted. As a matter of 
fact, there is a wide divergence of opinion as to just what are 
the desirable elements in any one of these commonly stated ends 
of education. Nothing could do more to give direction to: the 
efforts at curriculum reorganization than a clear analysis of the 
essential elements of democracy and citizenship, an analysis 
made by representative publicists of many types and school 
men working together. Lacking this, each worker in education 
must make his own analysis and his own formulation of funda- 
mental principles. In attempting this many have been forced 
back and back, from the earth to Atlas, from Atlas to the sup- 
porting terrapin, from the terrapin to the eagle hovering in the 
void, until they despair of the tremendous task of erecting a 
structure on an indefinite foundation. The only practical pro- 
cedure at present is to ascertain the elements that seem to make 
for effectiveness on different levels of life and then to propose what 
the school can do to achieve these most successfully in its pupils. 
A third obstacle _that-deters~students.-of..curriculum.revision 
is the conviction that any reasonable set of principles consistently 
applied to the construction of appropriate courses of study 
would result in a program so different from that generally fol- 
lowed as to make it impossible of anything like application with 
the organizaton, equipment, and personnel of our teaching staffs. 
This conviction necessitates compromises that often weaken the 
original intentions into mere tinkering. This should not be con- 
demned, however, for it is indubitably leading to improvement, 
however slow the process may seem to impatient theorists, that 
manifests itself in syllabi and textbooks, which can take only 
short steps in advance of the general convictions and desires of 
those who are to use them. 
These obstacles can be measurably overcome and progress 
accelerated toward better curricula if there is agreement on a 
plan of procedure. Such a plan, consisting of eight steps, is now 
to be proposed. Whether accepted as stated or as modified,
-P-A-G-E-653
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 639 
such a plan followed by a number of investigators, working sepa- 
rately or in committees, should insure progress toward a more 
reasonable body of subject-matter better organized for achiev- 
ing commonly desired ends. 
1. The first step is the riddance in our minds, so far as possible, 
of the idea that anything—organization, departmental division, 
details, or method—is, merely because of its existence, essential 
in the new program. Much of the old, as provided later, will be 
incorporated into the new scheme, but only after being subjected 
to accepted principles and justifying its right. Let one tem- 
porarily imagine himself miraculously bereft of all memory 
of conventional practices and extraneous requirements but still 
possessed of his knowledge, attitudes, and habits, however ac- 
quired. This is proposed merely to enable each one to attack the 
problem fairly without the stifling effect of unconsidered tradition. 
2. With openness of mind, one is ready to take the next step: 
the formulation of guiding principles. If the task is seriously 
undertaken,-one-must set forth principles that are clearly con- 
ceived, comprehensive, and determinant of action. In this 
matter, at least, everyone must be a thorough pragmatist: any 
proposed principle that does not aid in answering the questions 
involved in formulating the new curriculum must be passed 
by as non-existing. 
In a discussion of this type there is space merely for the pre- 
senting, without argument or adequate justification, five prin- 
ciples of the kind considered necessary. 
(a) Public education is an investment by the state that it 
may perpetuate itself and promote its own interests. This prin- 
ciple being accepted, it follows that every detail proposed for 
the new curriculum must contribute in one or another definite 
way to the perpetuation or the improvement of such social and 
political life as we consider desirable. The school man must 
frequently put himself in the place of the supporting state and 
ask about any detail, “Does this give a reasonable promise of 
such profit that I am justified in supporting it?” bearing in mind 
that any detail accepted excludes another competing for a place 
in the program, 
(b) The first duty of the school is to teach pupils to do better 
the desirable things that they will do anyway. This assumes 
that the school man can decide, as inevitably someone must do, 
which of the activities of life are desirable. Lacking any authori-
-P-A-G-E-654
  640 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
tative list of such activities, which will, of course, to some extent 
differ from one community to another and even from one indi- 
vidual to another, the school man must take the responsibility 
for making tentative decisions and for modifying his list as new 
factors are discovered. Then he must ascertain the ways in 
which each of the most important desirable activities may be 
performed better. This principle is more or less accepted in 
practice by all makers of syllabi and textbooks. It needs to be 
more consciously and consistently applied as one of the major 
criteria of worth. 
(c) Another duty of the school is to reveal higher activities 
and to make these both desired and to an extent possible. To 
insure progress we must go beyond the preceding principle: we 
must ascertain or, using our best judgment, postulate for each 
group of pupils the desirable activities on the next higher levels, 
and we must from the competing items select those which can 
be so presented that the pupils will recognize their value and gain 
a reasonable degree of mastery over them. Revelation alone is 
not sufficient. A vision, acceptance, seeking, success—all are 
necessary. 
(d) It is wiser to seek positive constructive ends than negative 
destructive ones. Adolescents will have developed a number of 
bad attitudes or habits, most of which the adult feels impelled 
to attack directly. Occasionally it may be necessary to cam- 
paign for their destruction, but this principle proposes that for 
the most part they be driven out by developing positive right 
attitudes and habits. 
(e) Because of the indeterminate persistence in secondary 
schools of pupils after the end of the period of compulsory edu- 
cation, every course, especially in the lower years, should be so 
organized that it is of the maximum worth to the extent to 
which it is pursued. At first thought this principle may seem 
impossible of acceptance, especially in some of the older and 
more formalized subjects; but reflection will show that already 
it has wide application. Most of the work in hygiene, physical 
education, appreciation of music, pictorial art, and literature, 
English expression, both written and oral, general science, civics, 
and economics, is valuable whether the pupils drop out of school 
immediately or not. As pupils become more certain of their 
futures and sufficiently matured to appreciate relations, values 
may be gradually deferred with assurance that at need they will
-P-A-G-E-655
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 641 
be real; but there is still a vast amount of improvement in the 
secondary-school curriculum which can be effected by a serious 
attempt to apply this principle as extensively as possible. 
3. When these or similar principles are accepted, one is ready 
for the third major step in the procedure, the making of an 
inventory, as comprehensive as possible, of the knowledge, atti- 
tudes, ideals, prejudices, acts, and habits desirable in citizens 
of a democracy. Beginnings of such inventories have here and 
there been made in special fields, such as spelling and arithmetic; 
but consideration needs to be given to all phases of living. Cer- 
tainly we must record desirable personal relations, co-operative 
efforts for commonly desired ends, and the like as extensively 
and as thoroughly as we have in the past the details of the logical 
organization of the academic subjects. Education in accordance 
with the principles proposed under step No. 2 concerns all of 
life. The details inventoried might as naturally be grouped under 
home membership, the use of leisure time, and civic duties as 
under mathematics, biological science, and music. 
4. The fourth step in the procedure toward a better curriculum 
is a tentative selection from the inventoried details of those for 
teaching. This would involve, first of all, the selection of those 
for which the schools assume responsibility, leaving the others 
to the home, the church, or to other agencies likely to be effec- 
tive. To the retained details must then be assigned relative 
values. This task is another one that demands common-sense 
decisions, since we lack definitive criteria. And from the evalu- 
ated details one must choose those most likely to be of value to 
local as well as to larger social units. 
5. After having progressed so far by independent thinking, 
one is ready to take the fifth step, the consideration of curricula 
as they exist in our schools today. These contain many details 
as valuable to some youth in America now as they were to others 
in Europe centuries ago when they became a part of the 
secondary-school pabulum; and they contain, too, other details 
that have ceased to have great importance if any at all. Every 
detail now in the curricula must pass the tests as do those newly 
proposed. As Flexner says, every detail accepted for the pro- 
gram must have a positive case made for it. In this matter 
prejudice attends either age or youth. With these details must 
be considered also school buildings and equipment now existing; 
the teachers in service and prospective, as they are and as they
-P-A-G-E-656
642 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
may be trained; and the textbooks available. It is believed that 
leadership and encouragement by principals and supervisors will 
carry many teachers far in the reorganization of the curriculum 
and that textbook writers will improve their product as rapidly 
as the demand justifies. 
6. The sixth step is assigning the details to the grades in which 
there is a probability of their being of maximum value according 
to the principles proposed, the achievements already made in the 
lower years, and the maturing power of assimilation by the pupils. 
Such assignments can in the beginning be made only tentatively, 
of course. So far as details have been previously taught, ad- 
vantage should be taken of old experiences; but new items must 
be assigned according to the best combined judgments available, 
with the understanding that they will be freely shifted as experi- 
ment reveals the need. 
7. As we are very generally agreed now that subject-matter 
and method are closely interrelated, the seventh step is the pro- 
posal of appropriate methods of organization, of presentation, of 
providing motives, and of directing individual or group work. 
Several of the principles under the second step concern methods 
of work as well as subject-matter; and it is here urged that 
effective methods of work be as seriously sought and as soundly 
implanted in general habits as the mastery of facts or principles. 
(8) The eighth and final step proposed is the trial of the 
developed curriculum under varied conditions, the careful 
measurement of results, and subsequent modifications for im- 
provement. It should go without saying that, however developed, 
an ideal curriculum can never be static and permanently fixed; 
rather, it must be dynamic and constantly adapted to varying 
needs of pupils and to varying conditions in the local and larger 
social groups. But there will doubtless be for each generation a 
more or less fixed core, both in the courses of study and in the 
curriculum, the term here being used in its technical sense of a 
group of studies leading to graduation. 
This proposal briefly outlines a theoretical plan for attacking 
the curriculum problem. No principal and faculty planning for 
next year’s announcement can find in it a satisfactory answer 
to all of the questions that are involved; indeed, it would require 
the concentrated and undivided attention of many able minds 
for years. Neither does any enlightened program for developing 
moral character give immediate, definitive, and final answers to
-P-A-G-E-657
SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 643 
all of the questions of conduct. But just as the Golden Rule 
guides us in determining moral actions and moral attitudes, 
which we hope become higher and better with development, so 
it is hoped that these principles of procedure, or similar better 
ones, will make their contribution, here a little and there a little, 
to the guidance of a series of actions all leading toward a distant 
ideal constantly becoming higher as our vision grows clearer. 
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES FOR 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL* 
By James M. Guass 
1. Variation of curriculum practice. In all sections of the 
country the conviction is spreading that the outstanding char- 
acteristic of a real junior high school is a reorganized program of 
studies which shall be a composite of elementary and secondary 
courses, which shall articulate elementary and secondary educa- 
tion, and which shall “help the pupil to explore his own aptitudes 
and to make at least provisional choice of the kinds of work to 
which he will devote himself.” > 
Experimentation in the administration of the curriculum is 
today characteristic of practically all junior high schools organized 
for a period of two or more years. Widespread experimentation 
inevitably leads” to vartatton in] practice equally~as~widespread. 
Variation leads t6"unavoidable temporary confusion, differences 
of opinion, and all of the helpful discussion from which, in 
every educational movement, come progress and achievement. 
(It seems desirable) that no definite check should be placed on 
experimentation but that the prevailing curriculum practices 
should be studied, with the objective at a later date, to sum- 
marize these practices and to formulate a plan of curriculum- 
making with the background of experimentation and of the survey 
of typical curriculum administration. 
2. Experimentation needed in the process of evolution. The 
present situation in the widespread experimentation with junior 
high school courses of study is dynamic; it has already been 
productive of much progress and is prophetic of greater progress 
yet to come. I am confident that I reflect the judgment of all

Education Bulletin No. 35, 1918. P. 18.  
-P-A-G-E-658
  644 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
junior high school men and women actively participating in the 
movement when I say that the situation must continue as plastic 
as it is today. Experimentation must not cease; differences of 
opinion and discussion in the selection of materials and methodol- 
ogy must continue unhindered; tentative must remain as the char- 
acteristic modifier of each junior high school course of study; 
and the process of evolution must continue until both partici- 
pants and critics of the reorganization of the program of studies 
recognize and acclaim the present period of evolutionary experi- 
mentation as the single most healthful symptom of the junior 
high school movement. We must curb our impatience and await 
the slower and surer gains which will come from lapse of time, 
deliberate judgment, and scientific experimentation. 
A generation of educational experimentation is time brief 
enough for the achievement of the far-reaching objectives which 
confront the transitional unit of the public schools. Briefer 
time might suffice were the objectives of the junior high school 
confined to its own sphere as a distinct and isolated unit of or- 
ganization. But the strategic position of the junior high school 
as the intermediate school of transition involves a reaction on the 
elementary school and the senior high school which is now 
demanding, and will increasingly demand readjustments in the 
entire public school system. 3 
3- Coordination of administrative units needed. The isola- 
tion of administrative units, particularly the elementary-school 
and the high-school units, was the chief indictment of systems of 
schools preceding the 6-3-3 plan. The primary objective of the 
junior high school, as the unit of transition, is articulation. Until 
the junior high school ceases to be regarded exclusively as an 
isolated unit of organization and of educational experimentation, 
there cannot be that unanimity of mutual understanding which 
alone can bring the united efforts of elementary and secondary 
schools into focus for a concerted solution, not merely of junior 
high school problems, but of the greater problems of an articulated 
public-school system. 
What is chiefly needed today is recognition on the part of 
school administrators, supervisory officers, elementary-school 
faculties, junior high school faculties, and senior high school 
faculties, of their common obligation to participate in the solu- 
tion of the curriculum problems of the transitional school, because 
of its strategic relation to the whole system of schools and its
-P-A-G-E-659
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 645 
inevitable reaction on curriculum practices in the schools adjoin- 
ing it as its inlet and its outlet. 
The continued evolution of the junior high school program of 
studies must soon close the chapter under the caption “The 
Reorganization of the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Grades” and 
open another far more important chapter under the caption “The 
Coordination of the 6-3-3 Plan of School Administration.” 
Emphasis must ultimately be shifted from curriculum reorganiza- 
tion on horizontal or isolated levels of the public school system, 
viz., the elementary school, the junior high school, and the senior 
high school, to the vertical or continuous administration of the 
curriculum. In this shift of emphasis will come to all three 
administrative units a common purpose, greater than any single 
unit can assume, to coordinate courses of study throughout the 
elementary a and secondary fields. 
It is entirely appropriate that the junior high school as the 
unit of transition recognize this need and propose to the elemen- 
tary school and to the-senior high~school a concertéd effort to 
articulate courses of study with vertical or continuous develop- 
ment in each subject of instruction. The junior high school 
recognizes, after a decade of curriculum experimentation in its 
horizontal or isolated level of administration, that its own courses 
of study in English, mathematics, social studies, natural science, 
fine and practical arts, school health, guidance, and secondary- 
school electives are inadequate to the degree that they have 
failed to secure articulation and continuity with the elementary- 
school course of study or with the senior high school course of 
study or with both. This first stage of an isolated reorganization 
of curriculum practice in the intermediate or transitional unit 
must inevitably lead to a second stage infinitely more important, 
viz., the coordinated reorganization of each course of study 
throughout the whole range of the school system. At the same 
time the senior high school is free to concentrate on the responsi- 
bility which it shares with the other units to complete the social 
integration of all pupils, however differentated in their individual 
educational and vocational objectives. 
The senior high school program of studies is increasingly 
developing a body of social-science materials, English and litera- 
ture, mathematics, science, and fine and practical arts, which are 
the common need of all of the differentiated groups. The senior 
high school, if free to concentrate on intensive specialized courses
-P-A-G-E-660
. 
  646 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
and a core curriculum of constants, will consummate the socially 
integrating influences of the elementary school which are now 
continued in a modified form in the junior high school program 
of studies and administration. 
4. Causes of delay in curriculum reorganization. By force of 
urgent necessity, the junior high school has been confronted with 
problems of organization and administration which have too 
frequently absorbed exclusive attention or delayed progress in 
curriculum reorganization. The demands of a new type of school 
plant and fixed equipment would tolerate no postponement. The 
administrative problems of the classification of pupils of ability 
groups, the use and interpretation of intelligence tests, subject- 
promotion with all of its problems of remedial and preventive 
measures for retardation, home-room organization, organized 
school activities, adoption of guidance plans, differentiation of 
electives, and the development of a technique of adminstrative 
records—all of these problems and many kindred needs demanded 
immediate solution and smooth operation, and in the early years 
of the junior high school movement partially prevented concen- 
tration on the more vital need of a reorganized program of studies. 
5. Development of the junior high school program of study. 
Thus far the discussion has been restricted to the present 
need of co-operation on the part of the three units of the school 
system in articulating all courses of study. We wish also to 
direct your attention to the already extensive development within 
the junior high school itself of a reorganized program of studies. 
The junior high school inherited its program of studies in 
- part from the elementary school and in part from the high 
school; a third source was the industrial and commercial fields 
and the home; a fourth contribution, which the junior high school 
together with the senior high school deliberately sought, was 
received from the rapidly expanding field of social-science ma- 
terials and social and civic activities to the end of socializing the 
content and method of all courses of study and of giving to 
adolescents “a self-conscious social adjustment.” 
These inheritances came chiefly as isolated and unassimilated 
units of instruction, From the elementary school came the 
common branches—English composition, technical language, 
reading, literature, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, geography, 
history, music, drawing, physical education, some manual train- 
ing and home economics, some social science or civics, and some
-P-A-G-E-661
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 647 
nature study. From the senior high school came the constants 
in English, mathematics, and social studies, and the extensive 
array of secondary-school electives—Latin, French, Spanish, and 
the intermittent German, algebra, geometry, biology or general 
science, ancient history and European history, commercial courses 
in bookkeeping, typewriting, commercial mathematics, and busi- 
ness practice, the general shop or practical arts courses, the 
general home economics courses, and the vocational types of both 
the last two. 
The introduction of such a formidable array of isolated units 
of instruction into the junior high school program of studies led 
to a great variety of courses which many non-constructive critics 
of the junior high school have advanced as the chief objection 
to the junior high school on the ground, perfectly defensible at 
the beginning of the movement, that it involved a scattering 
snap-shot exposure of pupils to a hodgepodge program of studies. 
Serious reflection on the development of the junior high school’s 
administration of its curriculum will convince any fair-minded 
student of the movement that the introduction of these varied 
and unassimilated units of instruction was not only unavoidable 
but even desirable in order that there might be created in the 
minds of administrators, supervising agencies, and junior high 
school participants a clear consciousness of the magnitude of the 
problem of articulating elementary and secondary courses of study. 
From the inception of the junior high school, efforts have been 
continuous to consolidate unassimilated subjects of instruction 
into larger and more comprehensive groups. Gradually, prac- 
tice has developed a few comprehensive units of study within 
which the unassimilated subjects inherited from the elementary 
school and the high school have been articulated, e.g., English 
and languages, mathematics, social studies, natural science, fine 
and practical arts, school health, and one option among a group 
of electives in the latter half of the junior high school. Electives 
have been differentiated as the initial choices within the academic, 
the commercial, the technical, the vocational, and the fine-art cur- 
riculums. The questionnaire submitted by the subcommittee last 
year revealed a large preponderating vote in favor of six one- 
clock-hour periods; four of these periods are distributed to the 
major branches which persist as constants through the junior 
high school, viz., English, social studies, mathematics, and science; 
one period is devoted to fine and practical arts; and the sixth
-P-A-G-E-662
  648 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
period is given to school health; organized school activities and 
guidance become part-period work. The reduction of the time 
allotment to the constants provides for the introduction of elec- 
tives in the latter half of the junior high school period. 
It is significant to note that the four major constants and fine 
and practical arts, school activities, school health, and guidance 
are becoming in many junior high schools continuous throughout 
the entire junior high school period. This is a modification of 
former practice, which gives much hope that the ninth grade is 
becoming more closely articulated with the seventh and eighth 
grades or that the practice of looking upon the ninth grade as 
the first year of the high school is being discontinued in favor 
of a greater purpose to make it an integral and coordinated part 
of the junior high school itself. The principle of continuity of 
courses of study throughout the three-year period must eventually 
eliminate previous distinctions of demarcation between the seventh 
and eighth grades and the ninth grade. 
The very nearness of the junior high school to its own move- 
ment prevents a clear conception of its progress toward more 
comprehensive or general courses of study which have gradually 
replaced the assorted units of instruction which were bequeathed 
to it a decade ago. Elementary and secondary courses of study 
have been and will continue in the process of articulation; through 
this process the transitional unit of the public-school system, by 
reason of its freedom from educational tradition, has been able to 
undertake, through effective coordination, the elimination of gaps 
between elementary and secondary education. 
Witness the evolution of social studies or social science in the 
junior high school program of studies—an articulation of ele- 
mentary-school history, geography, and elementary civics with 
secondary-school ancient history, European and modern history, 
community civics, vocational civics, and economic civics. The 
junior high school lays no claim to the solution of this problem, 
but it does maintain that, by initiating the consolidation of 
these unassimilated units, it has taken a vital step toward effec- 
tive articulation of elementary and secondary courses in the social- 
science field. 
Witness again the evolution of a course in general mathematics 
which is articulating elementary-school arithmetic with secondary- 
school algebra, geometry, and numerical trigonometry. Again, 
the experiment of general or composite mathematics must extend
-P-A-G-E-663
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 649 
over a period of years to evolve its own content and method. 
The significant fact, however, is in the effort to articulate elemen- 
tary and secondary courses of study for the sake wholly of 
adolescents who must make the shift from one to the other and 
who can make the transfer more readily through the articulation 
of elementary arithmetic with secondary mathematics than 
through the former abrupt transition from exclusive arithmetic 
to exclusive algebra. 
Witness also the development of a general course in science 
which is articulating the nature-study of the elementary school 
with the biology, physics, chemistry, and physiography of the 
senior high school. No brief decade of experimentation can ade- 
quately solve the problem of the articulation of nature-study with 
the cross-sectioned courses in science in the high school. But 
the significant fact in this instance is that an articulated general 
course in science, vitalized throughout by constant contact with 
the life and environmental experiences of early adolescent youth, 
is the only course in science which can be given to pupils too 
immature for the pure science studies of the senior high school. 
It will be a contribution of incalculable value to this modern age 
of scientific life and achievement if the junior high school suc- 
ceeds in establishing science as one of the required constants in 
the program of studies in secondary education. 
Witness also the evolution of vocational or trade-training courses 
of industrial education into the present wide-spread general shop 
course in home economics as a constant for all girls through the 
three years of the junior high school. The fact that 85 per cent 
of these girls are destined to become home-makers is ample justi- 
fication for this development. 
Witness the introduction junior business training as a required 
subject in the junior high school program of studies to survey the 
field of commercial education to help pupils to discover aptitudes 
for commercial training, and to reveal to them the wide range both 
of commercial education and of its rapidly expanding vocational 
opportunities. Junior business training or any similar introduc- 
tory commercial course assures to all pupils a knowledge of the 
principles and practices prevailing in the commercial world—a 
knowledge which should be an educational heritage of every 
adolescent youth. 
Witness the continuation of music and art as required con- 
stants in the junior high school program of studies. The pur- 
 
-P-A-G-E-664
  650 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
pose of the elementary school to make the esthetic and cultural 
values of music and art the common right of all pupils has been 
accepted by the junior high school, which in turn is discovering 
for many pupils the vocational values of the fine arts. Time alone 
can reveal the readjustment in the senior high school program of 
studies which will be undertaken when the present required and 
elective courses in music and art in the junior high school have 
become more firmly established. The vertical or continuous 
supervision of music and art through the school system which pre- 
vails in most cities will accelerate the extension of music and 
art as required and elective courses in both secondary schools, 
probably far beyond the extension of such courses today, signi- 
ficant as the present fine arts courses are in comparison with 
the almost total absence of such courses a few years ago. 
There has long been a need of articulating the school-health 
program of the elementary school for all pupils with the athletic 
program of the secondary school too frequently restricted to the 
few in least need of physical training. The school-health pro- 
grams of both the junior high school and the senior high school 
are being formulated today on principles which receive the sanc- 
tion of the medical profession and which, by reason of the far- 
sighted vision of many superintendents, are receiving the direc- 
tion of specialists in school health. The rapid evolution of 
health and hygiene education, as well as physical and athletic 
training, is evidenced by the adoption of a greater time allotment 
for school health in many junior high schools, varying from a 
minimum of two-clock-hour periods a week to four and five periods 
a week, 
The isolated and unassimilated units of instruction which the 
junior high school inherited are being articulated into more com- 
prehensive subject groups designated as English, general social 
science, general mathematics, general science, general home eco- 
nomics, general shop, school health, and other better articulated 
courses of study. The marvel is, not that more has not been 
accomplished, but that so much has been achieved to fulfil the 
primary mission of the junior high school in the public school 
system, viz., the welding together of its three units by the articu- 
lation of elementary and secondary education. Any educational 
agency or institution which can within a decade reveal a develop- 
ment from unassimilated to coordinated courses of study may 
be permitted to ignore non-constructive critics and assume the
-P-A-G-E-665
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 651 
prerogative of inviting the constructive and co-operative aid of 
the elementary school and the senior high school in the further 
extension of coordination. 
6. Guiding principles for further reorganization of courses of 
study. Each junior high school course of study should (1) pro- 
ceed by natural, transitional, and progressive stages to the arti- 
culation of elementary and secondary education; (2) develop 
from “simpler aspects” ® characterizing the junior high school 
toward “refinements”? characterizing the senior high school; 
(3) provide a survey of the subject field for the discovery of 
individual aptitudes and for the revelation of educational and 
vocational opportunities; (4) deal with the life, environmental 
experiences, and the immediate needs of early adolescent pupils 
that “school may be life, not merely preparation for life,” 1? (5) 
conserve the interests of those who drop out and of those who con- 
tinue by unit organization in each year of its development to the 
end that each year of work may be of definite value to those 
who go no farther; and (6) assure an apperceptive basis for later 
cross-sections of the general courses of study when specialization 
in subdivisions of each subject field is undertaken in the senior 
high school and higher institutions. 
7. Summary. The junior high school program of studies 
should continue, with modifications, the single curriculum of the 
elementary school. Through its general courses of study, it 
should expand the single curriculum into an enriched and varied 
curriculum. In a gradually increasing degree, it becomes the 
initial stage of all secondary-school curriculums. It should become 
the source of an apperceptive basis for later senior high school 
courses; it should “reveal higher types of activities, make these 
both desired and to an extent possible.” ** It should offer assur- 
ance of intelligent educational choice and wise educational place- 
ment. It should make possible a tentative or provisional choice 
of electives. It should increase the probability that pupils will 
persist through the initial stages of secondary-school courses in

the junior high school and thus also increase the probability that 
they will continue these courses and complete the specialized 
curriculums of the senior high school. 
The survey as a basis for reconstructing the program of 
studies. During the academic year of 1916-1917, an educational 
survey of Elyria, Ohio, was conducted under the direction of the 
United States Commissioner of Education. The report of this 
survey of a city with an estimated population of 20,000 to 25,000 
illustrates a plan or technique which can profitably be pursued 
as a whole or in part in other communities. The following account 
which is adapted from the report upon the high school program 
of studies ** illustrates the utilization of sociological data in the 
reconstruction of school curricula. 
The program of studies of the high school at Elyria, Ohio, is 
divided into three curricula—the classical, commercial, and in- 
dustrial. The classical curriculum is described as “a straight 
road to the college of arts. Colleges generally require four to 
six credits of foreign languages, Latin or German, or both, one 
or two of history; two of science, two or three of mathematics 
and three of English; the remaining units may be elected, as 
shown below, making a total of 15.” The commercial curriculum 
aims “to give a practical business course and to broaden the 
mental horizon by valuable supplementary academic studies.” 
The industrial curriculum, according to the printed course of 
study, leads “directly to such technical schools as Case, Ohio 
State, or Boston, which will accept four credits in manual train- 
ing. Without looking forward to the university it fits the student 
for more effective work in various industrial lines.” The three 
curricula follow: 
The distribution of the pupils among the several curricula is 
as follows: 
“Adapted from pp. 76-92 of the Educational Survey of Elyria, Ohio. 
United States Bureau of Education Bulletin 1918, No. 15. The portion of 
the survey report from which this adaptation was made was conducted by 
William F. Russell.

The principle upon which these curricula were formed is obvi- 
ously a good one. There is not a wide elective system, trusting 
the work of the pupil to the varied whims and unfounded choices 
of the pupils. An effort has been made to group the courses of 
study in an organized series leading to certain specific types of 
work to be followed after leaving school. 
To test the efficiency of this distribution certain questions must 
be answered: (1) Are too many curricula offered, dissipating the 
energies of the school? (2) Are too few curricula offered, sacri- 
ficing the interests of any considerable numbers of pupils? (3) 
Are the curricula as they are arranged at present composed of 
the wisest selection of courses possible under present conditions? 
(4) Are the pupils receiving adequate guidance in their selection 
of the particular curriculum which they wish to pursue? 
1. Are too many curricula offered? 
There are two valid reasons why, under certain circumstances, 
a very few curricula should be offered. In a small school where 
there are very few teachers the multiplication of sections dissi- 
pates the energies of the school. In a school where all the children 
come from families of the same class and are bound for similar 
occupations, multiplication of sections and curricula is unneces- 
sary. Elyria High School fulfills neither of these conditions, 
because (a) the school is large enough to give many more cur- 
ricula without dissipating its energies, and (b) the school draws 
its pupils from such a variety of homes that wide variation in its 
program of studies is highly desirable. A questionnaire was 
addressed to the pupils of the high school, asking each for the 
occupation of his father. The types of occupations rank in the 
following order:

2. Are too few curricula offered, sacrificing the interests of any 
considerable number of pupils? 
It is of course out of the question to provide under a system of 
group instruction the very best possible curriculum for every 
student. The question is whether or not the classical, commercial, 
and industrial curricula as they now stand are taking care in the 
most efficient way of all the large groups of pupils who are likely 
to engage in similar work after leaving school. The ideal way to 
test this would be to procure the history of all the children who 
had entered the high school during the past 10 years, trace 
their experiences after leaving school, and upon that as a basis 
obtain an idea of the experiences which it is probable the pupils 
now in school will have after they leave. So far as the investi- 
gator was able to determine, no such information is available.

of members to warrant consideration:

Under the present conditions, choices of curriculum are made 
for widely varying reasons. All pupils who plan to go to college or 
normal school (except the engineers) select the classical course. 
Those who are undecided select the classical course. A smaller 
number that have other fairly definite ambitions, go into the other 
lines. There are more significant groups of pupils than there are 
curricula provided. This brings us to our third question: 
3. Are the curricula as offered as efficient as they might be in 
meeting the future needs of the pupils therein registered? 
The classical curriculum enrolls those who are planning to go to 
college (except the engineering students) and those who think 
that there is some slight probability of their going on to further 
academic work. It enrolls boys and girls who are planning to go 
to the conservatory of music, girls planning to teach, with or with- 
out additional training. It also enrolls a group of doubtful 
students. 
The commercial curriculum enrolls but one significant group 
of students, those who plan to enter business as clerks, bookkeep- 
ers, or stenographers. It appears that a few students are taking 
the commercial and other curricula with the idea of going to a 
business college. Why is this?
-P-A-G-E-673
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 659 
The industrial curriculum enrolls a variety of groups. They 
include boys planning: To enter the engineering or scientific 
courses in college, to enter; industry, to become farmers, market 
gardeners, and dairymen; and girls planning to specialize in vari- 
ous phases of home economics or art work, or to conduct homes 
of their own or to help at/home. The curriculum as at present ar- 
ranged is not sufficiently diversified to meet all these needs. Those 
preparing for the engineering schools need a certain distinct dis- 
tribution of courses. | 
More than 80 boys in the Elyria High School live in rural com- 
munities. Nearly oné-fourth of the older brothers of these chil- 
dren, who at least entered high school, are farming. A separate 
curriculum is needed for this group. 
On the basis of the experience of previous classes, it seems that 
a large percentage of girls should have more work in home eco- 
nomics, and that a complete curriculum designed to prepare for 
homemaking should be devised. The value of mathematics, such 
as algebra and geometry, for girls preparing to be home makers 
is doubtful; chemistry and physics, more adapted to the needs of 
. girls, should be introduced. Where there are four sections of 
physics and two of chemistry, one section in each might well be 
specially adapted to the needs of girls. 
In particular the course is weak in failing to provide as much as 
possible for the boys and girls who are forced to drop out of 
school. The teachers and administrators of high schools must 
keenly realize that less than one-half of the children who enter 
as freshmen will ever graduate. 
The group. that seems to be treated with the least consideration 
is the group which leaves school before graduation; those pupils 
receive the smallest return for their efforts, in proportion to time 
spent. This group must of necessity be more or less neglected. 
Any plan, however, which will strengthen and make more vital 
the work of the earlier years will improve the arrangement of the 
program of studies. The commercial curriculum and the agri- 
cultural phase of the industrial curriculum especially sin in this 
particular. No vital commercial work is given in the first year, 
nor is there any in agriculture; yet of the older brothers who are 
farmers, 11 graduated and 11 did not; and of the older brothers 
who are in business, 10 graduated and to did not. Of 52 older 
sisters engaged in office work, only 32 graduated.

4. Do the pupils receive adequate guidance in their choice of a 
curriculum? 
The organization of studies is into a series of curricula, each de- 
vised to meet some definite need in an effort to steer between the 
elective system and the system of hard and fast requirements. It 
seeks to avoid random and aimless selection of courses of the one 
and at the same time to eliminate the hard and fast nature of the 
other, which has its only justification in poverty or in a belief in 
formal discipline. Under the curriculum plan each pupil has free 
choice of the general line which he wishes to pursue, but having 
made this choice, he is compelled to follow that specific line of 
work for the rest of his years in high school that he may achieve 
the results which follow thoroughness and continuity of attack. 
It is exceedingly important for the success of this system, however, 
that the pupils receive just, impartial, and adequate guidance in 
their selection of a curriculum. 
It is necessary that Elyria High School take more vigorous steps 
in this direction in the future. At present a little booklet giving 
the curricula offered, the words of description quoted, and certain 
other rules and regulations is distributed to the children of the 
eighth grade shortly before they are ready to enter high school. 
The city superintendent visits each eighth-grade class and makes 
a little talk. The teachers try to help. This guidance is insuffi- 
cient. There are several reasons for this. The teachers in the 
grades are not in possession of sufficient information to guide 
their children wisely. One teacher told the investigator, with 
some pride, that nearly all of her children had elected the clas- 
sical course, so that they might enter college. Upon being asked 
if she knew which colleges in northern Ohio demanded such prep- 
aration she admitted that she did not know, but “supposed that 
they all did.” Too many of the children, in answering the ques- 
tionnaire previously mentioned, were indefinite and vague in their 
statement of the reasons which prompted them to enter a par- 
ticular course. This is natural, since they had never been put in 
possession of sufficient facts to warrant a satisfactory judgment. 
Further, the parents need enlightenment in this matter. Too often 
the children are advised by parents who have not sufficient facts 
at hand to know which curriculum a child ought to elect. Still 
further, children need to be protected from the propaganda ad- 
vanced by alert, intelligent, but too often misguided and partial 
teachers. Too many children have been enticed into classical or
-P-A-G-E-675
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 661 
industrial curricula by organized campaigns carried on by teachers 
of these subjects. The only remedy is to acquaint teachers, par- 
ents, and pupils alike with such facts as have been determined. 
It would be highly desirable for the board of education to have a 
booklet prepared giving each curriculum in detail, just what it 
leads to, just what preparation is needed, what the rewards are 
likely to be, what modifications, if any, can be made. Some of 
the history of previous classes could well be introduced, and the 
probable experience of present classes in this light could be pre- 
dicted. Distributing this material well in advance of entrance to 
high school, encouraging discussion of it in class, at home, and at 
parent-teacher meetings, and eliminating scattered and casual 
recommendation, would help to prevent misfits, to put square pegs 
in square holes, and round pegs in round holes. At least serious 
discussion of this problem should occupy several faculty meet- 
ings. It can not be hoped that every child will be served with 
equal adequacy, but only that more children will be served effi- 
ciently than at present. 
The following recommendations are therefore made: 
1. That the present three curricula be expanded and molded more 
directly with certain results in mind. The following is sug- 
gested as a minimum: 
a. The classical course entrance curriculum, preparing for 
Oberlin and Kenyon. 
b. The general curriculum, preparing for other colleges of arts. 
c. The scientific college preparatory curriculum, preparing 
for Case School of Applied Science, Ohio State, and the 
like. This course should also provide for most of the boys 
preparing for industry. 
d. The commercial curriculum, arranged substantially as at 
present. 
e. The agricultural curriculum, giving more thorough work in 
agriculture. 
f. The home economics curriculum, giving a definite line of 
work for home makers, eliminating abstract mathematics, 
and including science work better designed for the needs 
of girls. 
2. That the authorities consider the need of a curriculum better 
adapted than these to the needs of prospective teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-676

662 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
3. That the authorities consider whether there is sufficient facility 
and demand to warrant a special course in arts and crafts. 
4. That every effort be made to put more vital work in the earlier 
years of the high school. 
5. That the board of education, in codperation with the high- 
school faculty, publish a booklet giving much more detailed 
information about the courses offered and probable demands 
and results, in order that more adequate guidance may result; 
_and that the high-school faculty consider this problem with 
care. 
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF MATHEMATICS * 
To the end that all pupils in the period of secondary education 
shall gain early a broad view of the whole field of elementary 
mathematics, and, in particular, in order to insure contact with 
this important element in secondary education on the part of the 
very large number of pupils who, for one reason or another, drop 
out of school by the end of the ninth year, the National Commit- 
tee recommends emphatically that the course of study in mathe- 
matics during the seventh, eighth, and ninth years contain the 
fundamental notions of arithmetic, of algebra, of intuitive geom- 
etry, of numerical trigonometry, and at least an introduction to 
demonstrative geometry, and that this body of material be re- 
quired of all secondary school pupils. 
Careful study of the later years of our elementary schools, and 
comparison with European schools, have shown the vital need of 
reorganization of mathematical instruction, especially in the 
seventh and eighth years. The very strong tendency now evident 
to consider elementary education as ceasing at the end of the sixth 
school year, and to consider the years from the seventh to the 
twelfth inclusive as comprising years of secondary education, gives 
impetus to the movement for reform of the teaching of mathe- 
matics at this stage. 
A discussion of mathematical education, and of ways and means 
of enhancing its value, must be approached first of all on the basis 
of a precise and comprehensive formulation of the valid aims and

in Secondary Schools. A report by the National Committee on Mathe- 
matical Requirements under the auspices of the Mathematical Association 
of America. J. W. Young, chairman. 1923. 
 
-P-A-G-E-677
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 663 
purposes of such education. Only on such a basis can we approach 
intelligently the problems relating to the selection and organiza- 
tion of material, the methods of teaching and the point of view 
which should govern the instruction, and the qualifications and 
- training of the teachers who impart it. Such aims and purposes 
of the teaching of mathematics, moreover, must be sought in the 
nature of the subject, the rdle it plays in the practical, intellectual, 
and spiritual life of the world, and in the interests and capacities 
of the students. 
Before proceeding with the formulation of these aims, however, 
we may properly limit to some extent the field of our enquiry. 
We are concerned primarily with the period of secondary educa- 
tion—comprising, in the modern junior and senior high schools, 
the period beginning with the seventh and ending with the twelfth 
school year, and concerning itself with pupils ranging in age 
normally from 12 to 18 years. References to the mathematics of 
the grades below the seventh (mainly arithmetic) and beyond the 
senior high school will be only incidental. 
Furthermore, we are primarily concerned at this point with what 
may be described as “general” aims, that is to say aims which are 
valid for large sections of the school population and which may 
properly be thought of as contributing to a general education as 
distinguished from the specific needs of vocational, technical, or 
professional education. 
I. The aims of Mathematical Instruction 
With these limitations in mind we may now approach the prob- 
lem of formulating the more important aims that the teaching of 
mathematics should serve. It has been customary to distinguish 
three classes of aims: (1) Practical or utilitarian, (2) discip- 
linary, (3) cultural; and such a classification is indeed a conveni- 
ent one. It should be kept clearly in mind, however, that the 
three classes mentioned are not mutually exclusive and that con- 
venience of discussion rather than logical necessity often assigns 
a given aim to one or the other of these classes. Indeed, any 
truly disciplinary aim is practical and, in a broad sense, the same 
is true of cultural aims. 
Practical aims—By a practical or utilitarian aim, in the nar- 
rower sense, we mean then the immediate or direct usefulness in 
life of a fact, method, or process in mathematics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-678
  664 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
1. The immediate and undisputed utility of the fundamental 
processes of arithmetic in the life of every individual demands our 
first attention. The first instruction in these processes, it is true, 
falls outside the period of instruction which we are considering. 
By the end of the sixth grade the child should be able to carry 
out the four fundamental operations with integers and with com- 
mon and decimal fractions accurately and with a fair degree of 
speed. This goal can be reached in all schools—as it is being 
reached in many—if the work is done under properly qualified 
teachers and if drill is confined to the simpler cases which alone 
are of importance in the practical life of the great majority. Ac- 
curacy and facility in numerical computation are of such vital im- 
portance, however, to every individual that effective drill in this 
subject should be continued throughout the secondary school 
period, not in general as a separate topic, but in connection with 
the numerical problems arising in other work. In this numerical 
work, besides accuracy and speed, the following aims are of the 
greatest importance: 
(a) A progressive increase in the pupil’s understanding of the 
nature of the fundamental operations and power to apply them in 
new situations. The fundamental laws of algebra are a potent in- 
fluence in this direction. (See 3, below.) 
(b) Exercise of common sense and judgment in computing from 
approximate data, familiarity with the effect of small errors in 
measurements, the determination of the number of figures to be 
used in computing and to be retained in the result, and the like. 
(c) The development of self-reliance in the handling of numeri- 
cal problems through the consistent use of checks on all numerical 
work. 
2. Of almost equal importance to every educated person is an 
understanding of the language of algebra and the ability to use 
this language intelligently and readily in the expression of such 
simple quantitative relations as occur in every-day life and in the 
normal reading of the educated person. 
Appreciation of the significance of formulas and ability to work 
out simple problems by setting up and solving the necessary equa- 
tions must nowadays be included among the minimum require- 
ments of any program of universal education. 
3. The development of the ability to understand and to use such 
elementary algebraic methods involves a study of the fundamental 
laws of algebra and at least a certain minimum of drill in algebraic
-P-A-G-E-679
SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 665 
technique, which, when properly taught, will furnish the founda- 
tion for an understanding of the significance of the processes of 
arithmetic already referred to. The essence of algebra as distin- 
guished from arithmetic lies in the fact that algebra concerns itself 
with the operations upon numbers i general, while arithmetic 
confines itself to operations on particular numbers. 
4. The ability to understand and interpret correctly graphic 
representations of various kinds, such as nowadays abound in 
popular discussion of current scientific, social, industrial, and po- 
litical problems, will also be recognized as one of the necessary 
aims in the education of every individual. This applies to the rep- 
resentation of statistical data which are becoming increasingly im- 
portant in the consideration of our daily problems, as well as to 
the representation and understanding of various sorts of depend- 
ence of one variable quantity upon another. 
5. Finally, among the practical aims to be served by the study 
of mathematics should be listed familiarity with the geometric 
forms common in nature, industry, and life; the elementary prop- 
erties and relations of these forms, including their mensuration ; 
the development of space-perception; and the exercise of spatial 
imagination. This involves acquaintance with such fundamental 
ideas as congruence and similarity and with such fundamental 
facts as those concerning the sum of the angles of a triangle, the 
Pythagorean proposition, and the areas and volumes of the com- 
mon geometric forms. 
Among directly practical aims should also be included the 
acquisition of the ideas and concepts in terms of which the quan- 
titative thinking of the world is done, and of ability to think 
clearly in terms of those concepts. It seems more convenient, 
however, to discuss this and, in a broad sense, the same is true ot 
cultural aims. 
Disciplinary aims—We would include here those aims which 
relate to mental training, as distinguished from the acquisition of 
certain specific skills discussed in the preceding section. Such 
training involves the development of certain more or less general 
characteristics and the formation of certain mental habits which, 
besides being directly applicable in the setting in which they are 
developed or formed, are expected to operate also in more or less 
closely related fields—that is, to “transfer” to other situations. 
The subject of the transfer of training has for a number of years 
been a very controversial one. Only recently has there been any 
   
-P-A-G-E-680
  666 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
evidence of agreement among the body of educational psycholo- 
gists. We need not at this point go into detail as to the present 
status of disciplinary values since this forms the subject of a 
separate chapter. It is sufficient for our present purpose to call 
attention to the fact that most psychologists have abandoned two 
extreme positions as to transfer of training. The first asserted 
that a pupil trained to reason well in geometry would thereby be 
trained to reason equally well in any other subject; the second 
denied the possibility of any transfer and hence the possibility 
of any general mental training. That the effects of training can 
transfer from one field of learning to another is now, however, 
recognized. The amount of transfer in any given case depends 
upon a number of conditions. If these conditions are favorable, 
there may be considerable transfer, but in any case the amount of 
transfer is difficult to measure. Training in connection with cer- 
tain attitudes, ideals, and ideas is now almost universally admitted _ 
by psychologists to have general value. It may, therefore, be 
said that, with proper restrictions, general mental discipline is a 
valid aim in education. 
The aims which we are discussing are so important in the re- 
stricted domain of quantitative and spatial (i.e., mathematical or 
partly mathematical) thinking which every educated individual is 
called upon to perform that we do not need for the sake of our 
argument to raise the question as to the extent of transfer to less 
mathematical situations. 
In formulating the disciplinary aims of the study of mathe- 
matics the following should be mentioned: 
(1) The acquisition, in precise form, of those ideas or concepts 
in terms of which the quantitative thinking of the world is done. 
Among these ideas and concepts may be mentioned ratio and meas- 
urement (lengths, areas, volumes, weights, velocities, and rates in 
general, etc.), proportionality and similarity, positive and nega- 
tive numbers, and the dependence of one quantity upon another. 
(2) The development of ability to think clearly in terms of 
such ideas and concepts. This ability involves training in— 
(a) Analysis of a complex situation into simpler parts. This 
includes the recognition of essential factors and the rejection of 
the irrelevant. 
(b) The recognition of logical relations between interdependent 
factors and the understanding and, if possible, the expression of 
such relations in precise form.

   (c) Generalization; that is, the discovery and formulation of a 
general Jaw and an understanding of its properties and appli- 
cations. 
(3) The acquisition of mental habits and attitudes which will 
make the above training effective in the life of the individual. 
Among such habitual reactions are the following: a seeking for 
relations and their precise expression; an attitude of enquiry; a 
desire to understand, to get to the bottom of a situation; concen- 
tration and persistence; a love for precision, accuracy, thorough- 
ness, and clearness, and a distaste for vagueness and incomplete- 
ness; a desire for orderly and logical organization as an aid to 
understanding and memory. 
(4) Many of these disciplinary aims are included in the broad 
sense of the idea of relationship or dependence—in what the 
mathematician in his technical vocabulary refers to as a ‘“func- 
tion” of one or more variables. Training in “functional thinking,” 
’ that is, thinking in terms of and about relationships, is one of the 
most fundamental disciplinary aims of the teaching of mathe- 
matics. 
Cultural aims—By cultural aims we mean those somewhat less 
tangible but none the less real and important intellectual, ethical, 
esthetic or spiritual aims that are involved in the development of 
appreciation and insight and the formation of ideals of perfection. 
As will be at once apparent the realization of some of these aims 
must await the later stages of instruction, but some of them may 
and should operate at the very beginning. 
More specifically we may mention the development or acquisi- 
tion of— 
(1) Appreciation of beauty in the geometrical forms of nature, 
art, and industry. 
(2) Ideals of perfection as to logical structure, precision of 
statement and of thought, logical reasoning (as exemplified in the 
geometric demonstration), discrimination between the true and 
the false, etc. 
(3) Appreciation of the power of mathematics—of what Byron 
expressively called “the power of thought, the magic of the 
mind” ** and the réle that mathematics and abstract thinking, in 
general, have played in the development of civilization; in par- 
ticular in science, in industry, and in philosophy. In this con-

-P-A-G-E-682
  — 668 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
nection mention should be made of the religious effect, in the 
broad sense, which the study of the infinite and of the permanence 
of laws in mathematics tends to establish.** 
II. The Point of View Governing Instruction 
The practical aims enumerated above, in spite of their vital im- 
portance, may without danger be given a secondary position in 
seeking to formulate the general point of view which should gov- 
ern the teacher, provided only that they receive due recognition 
in the selection of material and that the necessary minimum of 
technical drill is insisted upon. 
The primary purposes of the teaching of mathematics should be 
to develop those powers of understanding and of analyzing rela- 
tions of quantity and of space which are necessary to an insight 
into and control over our environment and to an appreciation of 
the progress of civilization. in its various aspects, and to develop 
those habits of thought and of action which will make these pow- 
ers effective in the life of the individual. _, 
All topics, processes, and drill in technique which do not di- 
rectly contribute to the development of the powers mentioned 
should be eliminated from the curriculum. It is recognized that 
in the earlier periods of instruction the strictly logical organiza- 
tion of subject-matter ** is of less importance than the acquisition, 
on the part of the pupil, of experience as to facts and methods of 
attack on significant problems, of the power to see relations, and 
of training in accurate thinking in terms of such relations. Care 
must be taken, however, through the dominance of the course by 
certain general ideas that it does not become a collection of iso- 
lated and unrelated details. 
‘Continued emphasis throughout the course must be placed on 
the development of ability to grasp and to utilize ideas, processes,

and principles in the solution of concrete problems rather than on 
the acquisition of mere facility or skill in manipulation. The ex- 
cessive emphasis now commonly placed on manipulation is one of 
the main obstacles to intelligent progress. On the side of algebra, 
the ability to understand its language and to use it intelligently, 
the ability to analyze a problem, to formulate it mathematically, 
and to interpret the result must be dominant aims.- Drill in alge- 
braic manipulation should be limited to those processes and to the 
degree of complexity required for a thorough understanding of 
principles and for probable applications either in common life or 
in subsequent courses which a substantial proportion of the pupils 
will take. It must be conceived throughout as a means to an end, 
not as an end in itself. Within these limits, skill in algebraic 
manipulation is important, and drill in this subject should be ex- 
tended far enough to enable students to carry out the essential 
processes accurately and expeditiously. 
On the side of geometry the formal demonstrative work should 
be preceded by a reasonable amount of informal work of an in- 
tuitive, experimental, and constructive character. Such work is 
of great value in itself; it is needed also to provide the necessary 
familiarity with geometric ideas, forms, and relations, on the basis 
of which alone intelligent appreciation of formal demonstrative 
work is possible. 
The one great idea which is best adapted to unify the course is 
that of the functional relation. The concept of a variable and of 
the dependence of one variable upon another is of fundamental 
importance to everyone. It is true that the general and abstract 
form of these concepts can become significant to the pupil only as 
a result of very considerable mathematical experience and training. 
There is nothing in either concept, however, which prevents the 
presentation of specific concrete examples and illustrations of de- 
pendence even in the early parts of the course. Means to this end 
will be found in connection with the tabulation of data and the 
study of the formula and of the graph and of their uses. 
The primary and underlying principle of the course should be 
the idea of relationship between variables, including the methods 
of determining and expressing such relationship. The teacher 
should have this idea constantly in mind, and the pupil’s advance- 
ment should be consciously directed along the lines which will 
present first one and then another of the ideas upon which finally 
the formation of the general concept of functionality depends. 
 
-P-A-G-E-684
  670 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The general ideas which appear more explicitly in the course 
and under the dominance of one or another of which all topics 
should be brought are: (1) The formula, (2) graphic represen- 
tation, (3) the equation, (4) measurement and computation, 
(5) congruence and similarity, (6) demonstration, 
III. The Organization of Subject Matter 
“General” courses——We have already called attention to the 
fact that, in the earlier periods of instruction especially, logical 
principles or organization are of less importance than psychologi- 
cal and pedagogical principles. In recent years there has devel- 
oped among many progressive teachers a very significant move- 
ment away from the older rigid division into “subjects” such as 
arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, each of which shall be “com- 
pleted” before another is begun, and toward a rational breaking 
down of the barriers separating these subjects, in the interest of 
an organization of subject-matter that will offer a psychologically 
and pedagogically more effective approach to the study of mathe- 
matics. 
There has thus developed the movement toward what are vari- 
ously called “composite,” “correlated,” “unified,” or “general” 
courses. The advocates of this new method of organization base 
their claims on the obvious and important interrelations between 
arithmetic, algebra, and geometry (mainly intuitive), which the 
student must grasp before he can gain any real insight into mathe- 
matical methods and which are inevitably obscured by a strict 
adherence to the conception of separate “subjects.” The move- 
ment has gained considerable new impetus by the growth of the 
junior high school, and there can be little question that the re- 
sults already achieved by those who are experimenting with the 
new methods of organization warrant the abandonment of the 
extreme “water-tight compartment” method of presentation. 
The newer method of organization enables the pupil to gain a 
broad view of the whole field of elementary mathematics early in 
his high-school course. In view of the very large number of pupils 
who drop out of school at the end of the eighth or the ninth school 
year or who for other reasons then cease their study of mathemat- 
ics, this fact offers a weighty advantage over the older type of or- 
ganization under which the pupils studied algebra alone during the 
ninth school year, to the complete exclusion of all contact with 
geometry.
-P-A-G-E-685
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 671 
It should be noted, however, that the specific recommendations 
as to content given in the next two chapters do not necessarily 
imply the adoption of a different type of organization of the ma- 
terials of instruction. A large number of high schools will for 
some time continue to find it desirable to organize their courses 
of study in mathematics by subjects—algebra, plane geometry, 
etc. Such schools are urged to adopt the recommendations made 
with reference to the content of the separate subjects. These, in 
the main, constitute an essential simplification as compared with 
present practice. The economy of time that will result in courses 
in ninth-year algebra, for instance, will permit of the introduction 
of the newer type of material, including intuitive geometry and 
numerical trigonometry, and thus the way will be prepared for the 
gradual adoption in larger measure of the recommendations of this 
report. 
At the present time it is not possible to designate any particular 
order of topics or any organization of the materials of instruction 
as being the best or as calculated most effectively to realize the 
aims and purposes here set forth. More extensive and careful 
experimental work must be done by teachers and administrators 
before any such designation can be made that shall avoid undesir- 
able extremes and that shall bear the stamp of general approval. 
This experimental work will prove successful in proportion to the 
skill and insight exercised in adapting the aims and purposes of 
instruction to the interests and capacities of the pupils. One of 
the greatest weaknesses of the traditional courses is the fact that 
both the interests and the capacities of pupils have received in- 
sufficient consideration and study. 
Required courses—The National Committee believes that the 
material described under IV, 1, below should be required of all 
pupils and that under favorable conditions this minimum of work 
can be completed by the end of the ninth school year. In the 
junior high school, comprising grades seven, eight, and nine, the 
course for these three years should be planned as a unit with the 
purpose of giving each pupil the most valuable mathematical train- 
ing he is capable of receiving in those years, with little reference 
to courses which he may or may not take in succeeding years. 
In particular, college entrance requirements should, during these 
years, receive no specific consideration. Fortunately there ap- 
pears to be no conflict of interest during this period between those 
pupils who ultimately go to college and those who do not; a course 
 
-P-A-G-E-686

672 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
planned in accordance with the principle just enunciated will 
form a desirable foundation for college preparation. 
Similarly in case of the at present more prevalent 8-4 school 
organization, the mathematical material of the seventh and eighth 
grades should be selected and organized as a unit with the same 
, purpose; the same applies to the work of the first year (ninth 
grade) of the standard four-year high school, and to later years in 
. which mathematics may be a required subject. 
In the case of some elective courses the principle needs to be 
modified so as to meet whatever specific vocational or technical 
purposes the courses may have. 
The movement toward correlation of the work in mathematics 
with other courses in the curriculum, notably those in science, is 
as yet in its infancy. The results of such efforts will be watched 
with the keenest interest. 
IV. Suggested Arrangements of Material 
In approaching the problem of arranging or organizing this 
material it is necessary to consider the different situations that 
may have to be met. 
1. The junior high school—tIn view of the fact that under this 
form of school organization pupils may be expected to remain in 
school until the end of the junior high school period instead of 
leaving in large numbers at the end of the eighth school year, the 
mathematics of the three years of the junior high school should be 
planned as a unit, and should include the material recommended 
| in the preceding section. There remains the question as to the 
order in which the various topics should be presented and the 
amount of time to be devoted to each. The committee has al- 
ready stated its reasons for not attempting to answer this ques- 
tion. The following plans for the distribution of time are, how- 
ever, suggested in the hope that they may be helpful; but no one 
of them is recommended as superior to the others, and only the 
large divisions of material are mentioned.   PLAN A 
First year: Applications of arithmetic, particularly in such lines 
as relate to the home, to thrift, and to the various school subjects; 
intuitive geometry.

Second year: Algebra; applied arithmetic, particularly in such 
lines as relate to commercial, industrial and social needs. 
Third year: Algebra, trigonometry, demonstrative geometry. 
By this plan the demonstrative geometry is introduced in the 
third year, and arithmetic is practically completed in the second 
year. 
PLAN B 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in plan A); intuitive geom- 
etry. 
Second year: Algebra intuitive geometry, trigonometry. 
Third year: Applied arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, demon- 
strative geometry. 
By this plan trigonometry is taken up in two years, and the 
arithmetic is transferred from the second year to the third year. 
PLAN C 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in plan A); intuitive geom- 
etry, algebra. 
Second year: Algebra, intuitive geometry. 
Third year: Trigonometry, demonstrative geometry, applied 
arithmetic. 
By this plan algebra is confined chiefly to the first two years. 
PLAN D 
First year: Applied arithmetic (as in plan A); intuitive geom- 
etry. 
Second year: Intuitive geometry, algebra. 
Third year: Algebra, trigonometry, applied arithmetic. 
By this plan algebra is confined chiefly to the first two years. 
PLAN E 
First year: Intuitive geometry, simple formulas, elementary 
principles of statistics, arithmetic (as in plan A). 
Second year: Intuitive geometry, algebra, arithmetic. 
Third year: Geometry, numerical trigonometry, arithmetic. 
2. Schools organized on the 8-4 plan —lIt cannot be too strongly 
emphasized that, in the case of the older and at present more
-P-A-G-E-688

674 SECONDARY EDUCATION 
prevalent plan of the 8-4 school organization, the work in mathe- 
matics of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades should also be 
organized to include the material here suggested. 
The prevailing practice of devoting the seventh and eighth 
grades almost exclusively to the study of arithmetic is generally 
recognized as a wasteful marking of time. It is mainly in these 
years that American children fall behind their European brothers 
and sisters. No essentially new arithmetic principles are taught 
in these years, and the attempt to apply the previously learned 
principles to new situations in the more advanced business and 
economic aspects of arithmetic is doomed to failure on account of 
the fact that the situations in question are not and cannot be made 
real and significant to pupils of this age. We need only refer to 
what has already been said in this chapter on the subject of 
problems. 
The same principles should govern the selection and arrange- 
ment of material in mathematics for the seventh and eighth grades 
of a grade school as govern the selection for the corresponding 
grades of a junior high school, with this exception: Under the 
8-4 form of organization many pupils will leave school at the end 
of the eighth year. This fact must receive due consideration. 
The work of the seventh and eighth years should be so planned 
as to give the pupils in these grades the most valuable mathe- 
matical information and training that they are capable of receiv- 
ing in those years, with little reference to courses that they may 
take in later years. As to possibilities for arrangement, reference 
may be made to the plans given above for the first two years of 
the junior high school. When the work in mathematics of 
the seventh and eighth grades has been thus reorganized, the 
work of the first year of a standard four-year high schoo] should 
complete the program suggested. 
Finally, there must be considered the situation in those four- 
year high schools in which the pupils have not had the benefit of 
the reorganized instruction recommended for grades seven and 
eight. It may be hoped that this situation will be only temporary, 
although it must be recognized that, owing to a variety of pos- 
sible reasons (lack of adequately prepared teachers in grades seven 
and eight, lack of suitable textbooks, administrative inertia, and 
the like), the new plans will not be immediately adopted and that, 
therefore, for some years many high schools will have to face the 
situation implied.

SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 675 
In planning the work of the ninth grade under these conditions 
teachers and administrative officers should again be guided by the 
principle of giving the pupils the most valuable mathematical in- 
formation and training which they are capable of receiving in this 
year with little reference to future courses which the pupil may or 
may not take. It is to be assumed that the work of this year is to 
be required of all pupils. Since for many this will constitute the 
last of their mathematical instruction, it should be so planned as 
to give them the widest outlook consistent with sound scholarship. 
Under these conditions it would seem desirable that the work 
of the ninth grade should contain both algebra and geometry. It 
is, therefore, recommended that about two-thirds of the time be 
devoted to the most useful parts of algebra, including the work 
on numerical trigonometry, and that about one-third of the time 
be devoted to geometry, including the necessary informal intro- 
duction and, if feasible, the first part of demonstrative geometry. 
It should be clear that owing to the greater maturity of the 
pupils much less time need be devoted in the ninth grade to certain 
topics of intuitive geometry (such as direct measurement, for ex- 
ample) than is desirable when dealing with children in earlier 
grades. Even under the conditions presupposed, pupils will be ac- 
quainted with most of the fundamental geometric forms and with 
the mensuration of the most important plane and solid figures. The 
work in geometry in the ninth grade can then properly be made to 
center about indirect measurement and the idea of similarity 
(leading to the processes of numerical trigonometry), and such 
geometric relations as the sum of the angles of a triangle, the 
Pythagorean proposition, congruence of triangles, parallel and 
perpendicular lines, quadrilaterals, and the more important simple 
constructions. 
Principles of the reconstruction of curricula and the subject 
matter of different courses. The existence of a subject in the 
program of studies indicates but does not guarantee the worth of 
the subject. 
All subjects proposed for the program of studies must con- 
tribute to the perpetuation or improvement of such social and 
political life as we consider desirable. 
“The first duty of the school is to teach pupils to do better the 
desirable things that they will do anyway.”  
-P-A-G-E-690
: 
676 SECONDARY EDUCATION } 
, The school should reveal higher and higher activities and make 
| them “both desired and to an extent possible.” 
The school should strive to develop positive constructive ends 
rather than negative destructive ones. 
“Every course, especially in the lower years, should be so or- 
ganized that it is of the maximum worth to the extent to which it 
has been pursued.” 
An inventory of the desirable characteristics of citizens is neces- 
sary in curriculum construction. All courses should be defensible 
in terms of this inventory. 
The grading of subject matter should be considered in curricu- 
lum reconstruction. 
The curriculum should not be regarded as fixed but should be 
tegted from time to time by careful measurement of the results 
tained by it. Changes should then be made in the curriculum 
if the results warrant them. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY AND DISCUSSION 
1. What reasons, other than a desire to make high-school ork 
easier, can be given for reducing specific requirements in standard 
subjects ? * 
2. Cite personal observations to illustrate at least two of the three 
obstacles to curriculum revision as mentioned by Briggs. 
3. In what respects, if any, are the “eight steps” of Briggs in 
agreement with the principles formulated by Bobbitt and Charters 
in Chapter XIV? 
yt 4. How can a progressive system of education conform with the 
ae notion that education must perpetuate and promote the interests 
: of the state? 
5. What two fundamental forms of reconstruction of the program 
of studies have taken place in the junior high school? Illustrate 
each, 
6. What is a school survey? What practical results can such a 
survey yield? 
7. Which of the forms of curriculum construction described by
-P-A-G-E-691
  SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER 677 
Charters in Chapter XIV is exemplified in Russell’s account of the 
Elyria survey? 
8. After reading the account of Elyria survey, formulate a simple 
plan for a survey such as a teacher might profitably conduct ina 
small town or village. 
g. It is sometimes alleged that the reconstruction of high school 
subjects has made them very easy but has shorn them of their 
fundamental values. Examine the plan for the reconstruction of 
mathematics and evaluate the suggestions for reconstruction in the 
light of this criticism. 
10, Early in the discussion of mathematics, aims are set up with 
reference to which the course in mathematics is reconstructed. Try 
‘to show that such objectives as Bobbitt or Charters advocate would 
also support the reorganized form of mathematics. 
11. Evaluate the principles at the end of this chapter.

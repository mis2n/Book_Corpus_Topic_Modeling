GENERAL EDITOR'S PREFACE 
[HE Cambridge Handbooks for Teachers are designed 
to meet the requirements of “specialist” teachers, more 
particularly the less experienced, who desire to inform 
themselves of the recent developments in the modes of 
teaching their own subjects. They are written by teachers 
who are conversant with the best thought and practice, 
and whose chief purpose in writing is to be of assistance 
in the every-day tasks of the form-room. A school time-" 
table to-day includes many subjects. Keeping that fact 
in mind, the authors of the various books in the series aim 
at combining the scholarly with the practicable. While 
treating their own subjects with the required thoroughness, 
they will not forget that these are members of a curriculum, 
that time is also necessary for other studies and that there 
are associations between the various subjects which con- 
stitute any wisely planned course of studies intended to 
educate.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE 
INCE the beginning of the present century a great 
deal has been written on the subject of the teaching 
of history in schools. This volume is intended to provide 
the teacher with some information as to the directions in 
which improvements in method have been suggested by 
various authorities, and to indicate the points where recent 
experiments have accomplished an acknowledged advance 
on previous practice. 
A practical teacher cannot avoid developing a certain 
bias in favour of some ideas and against others, but it has 
been attempted in this volume to present the case for each 
school of method with as much fairness as possible. No 
attempt has been made to produce a stereotyped syllabus 
or universal code of rules of method, as it is far too early 
to decide what will be the ultimate product of the very 
conspicuous reform movement which is at present in course 
of development among teachers of history.

INTRODUCTION 
Way should we teach history in our schools? The question 
is one which the teacher will surely be called upon to answer 
at some time or other, very likely as the result of the enquiry 
of some dissatisfied and unenthusiastic pupil. Many writers 
have provided answers to the question, and the answers are 
not by any means similar in all cases. History teaching 
has been justified on many grounds, some more real and 
important than others. 
The best answer to the question is that a knowledge 
of history interprets and illumines the whole of human 
life. We know that the state of affairs which exists in the 
World at the present day has not always existed; we know 
that the institutions, the ideas, the States of to-day have 
not been handed down to us unchanged from time imme- 
morial; and the intelligent mind must from time to time 
be led to ask how the present state of affairs grew into 
being and what form the development of human organi- 
sation has taken. In a primitive community, such as a 
tribe of Eskimos or New Guinea savages, there is hardly 
any need for historical knowledge, for life and manners, 
institutions and surroundings are much the same now as 
they were fifty, a hundred, five hundred, a thousand years 
ago. But in a highly developed State like our own, the 
need for a knowledge of history is evident, if we are to 
use our intellectual powers to the utmost. We must know 
at least how the inhabitants of these islands came to be 
grouped together as a single organised community, how the 
present system of common action and mutual protection 
AY L

  2 The Teaching of History 
grew up, how we became possessors of our oversea dominions, 
why we have been drawn into conflict with other peoples; 
we shall be led on from this to make similar investigations 
into the story of the other peoples of that World in which 
our lot is cast. 
This is the main reason why we should teach history 
in our schools. It adds to our knowledge of the existing 
state of the World a knowledge of the way in which human 
society and institutions have grown up,a knowledge without 
which a modern education can hardly be said to be complete. 
The same idea lies at the root of two justifications for 
history teaching with which we often meet. History is 
said to “broaden the mind” by showing us the conditions, 
habits and ways of thought of former times, thus not only 
adding to our store of information but attacking insular 
prejudices and local conservatism. Again, it is suggested 
that a knowledge of history explains and illuminates the 
multitudinous historical allusions that crop up in the news- 
paper, in literature and elsewhere. It thus opens up a 
fresh pleasure in literary reading and even in the trivial 
perusal of the daily news-sheet, not to mention such things 
as monuments, buildings and street names. The more 
history a person knows, the greater the results to be looked 
for in this direction. 
Having indicated in general terms what history teaching 
can claim to effect, we must turn aside for a moment to 
mention some false and shallow “justifications” of history 
teaching which, though they are widely asserted, have no 
sound strength and consequently tend rather to weaken 
the really unimpeachable claims of history as a cardinal 
subject of modern Education. A school history-course 
does not provide a training in citizenship; it does not 
constitute a course of training in the study of human nature
-P-A-G-E-11

or applied psychology: and it does not make a suitable 
basis for ethical and moral instruction. 
An intelligent voter certainly needs to know something 
of the past, and a great many psychological phenomena 
can be studied with more or less profit in the detailed 
history of certain episodes of the past, but for the political 
training and psychological exposition derivable from history 
to have any substance, it is necessary to study the subject 
in far more minute detail than anyone could possibly find 
time for in any elementary or secondary school. And from 
the ethical point of view, there are so many examples of 
violence, treachery, lying and self-seeking securing temporal 
gains at the expense of the better moral qualities that to 
produce a satisfactory effect on the pupil’s mind our only 
course would have to be to adopt the questionable advice 
by which Plato of old wished to suppress the baser national 
legends of Hellas and Carlyle in the last century twisted 
the Machiavellian Frederick the Great into a paladin of 
Christian virtue. It is not on these grounds that a school 
study of history is to be based. 
The chief complaints that have been raised against the 
study of history in schools. have been provoked. by the 
exceedingly injudicious selection of the matter presented to 
pupils by the teachers and text-book writers of the past. 
The pitiable absence of the sense of proportion, the tendency 
to concentrate on the one hand upon the trivially curious 
and on the other hand upon the dry summary of names 
and dates have rendered the old-fashioned history lesson 
a meet object for ridicule. But present day writers and 
teachers are gradually being weaned from their affection 
for the old traditional collection of “facts which mustn’t 
be omitted because they always have appeared in history 
text-books,” and the contents of our modern text-books 
1—2
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 The Teaching of History 
are beginning to take a form more consistent with a 
reasonable sense of proportion. The names of Edward IT's 
favourites, the adventures of Richard Cceur-de-Lion in the 
East, and the domestic chronicle of the palace of Henry VIII 
are still to be found there, but they appear less on account 
of their own intrinsic importance than as illustrating the 
constant struggle between the mediaeval Crown and the 
Baronage, the great Crusading movement and the great 
religious struggle between the Protestant Reformers and 
the old Catholic faith. 
Having decided on what grounds, and on what grounds 
only, history teaching is to be approved, we must next 
consider the question of what history is to be taught. 
Now it is impossible to lay down a cast-iron syllabus and 
declare that it and it alone must be adopted in every 
British school. Local differences, the time at the disposal 
of the teacher, the controlling influence of public examina- 
tions, the facilities for the study of local history, the 
opinions of boards of governors and headmasters, the 
social positions of the pupils, all these things will necessarily 
modify a school history syllabus. All that can be done 
is to sketch a general outline and put forward certain 
principles which may be applied according to local cir- 
cumstances. 
What do we want to teach our pupils? First we must 
deal with the history of our own country. Then, if the 
time allows, we can extend the syllabus to include local 
history and more general history, European or World 
history. In any case an extension of the syllabus should 
be made on a logical basis; there is no place for such 
studies as the history of France, Western Europe, the 
Severn valley; such divisions represent no definite com- 
munities to which we ourselves belong. We are Britons 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  Introduction 5 
and Europeans, we may be Kentishmen or Cornishmen or 
Londoners or Liverpudlians, we all share in a common 
World-History, but we are not Frenchmen or “ Western 
Europeans” or “Severn Valleymen.” 
Local history, besides often illustrating rather vividly 
the operations of movements of national importance, is 
useful for giving local knowledge, and there are not many 
who seriously oppose its study. European and general 
history have been more severely attacked, but the school 
of opinion which declared them to be irrelevant to English- 
men is by now all but extinct, and we need hardly waste 
time in refuting this obsolete theory. 
There are two methods employed in teaching European 
history as part of a school course. One is to allot special 
time to it as a separate section ; the other is to introduce it 
casually into the English history course. The latter is 
objectionable in several ways. It interrupts the course of 
the English history lessons, it gives only a very spasmodic 
and distracted account of European development, it leads 
to a good deal of mental confusion, and it tends to per- 
petuate the old-fashioned idea of England being the only 
country whose history has been of real importance in the 
World. To understand European history it is necessary 
to trace the development of Europe as a whole, and the 
scrappy method of dealing with it involved in the latter of 
these two systems is fatal to an intelligent conception of 
the elements of the subject. If lessons on European history 
are intercalated with the general English course, such 
lessons should be kept separate and should form a con- 
tinuous series related to one another as well as to the 
English history lessons. 
It is advisable, then, to include if possible a series of 
European history lessons in our syllabus, and perhaps in
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 The Teaching of History 
addition a series devoted to local history. It is hardly 
advisable to insert into school courses such sectional studies 
as constitutional history, military history, or the history 
of political ideas; we cannot afford time for special treat- 
ment of these subjects in an elementary or a secondary 
school. 
The syllabus must be graded according to the capacity 
of children to grasp the meaning of historical facts. We 
cannot talk of the State to children who do not appreciate 
what that institution means. Young children who have 
not reached their teens rarely have much idea of institutions 
beyond their immediate personal reach. They know the 
family, the town, the village, the shop, the tradesman, the 
post-office, the policeman, the place of worship, the regiment, 
perhaps also the tax-collector and the election canvass ; 
they know of the existence of important persons like the 
King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Prime Minister, 
the leading generals and admirals. But these all seem 
separate and concrete things in the child’s mind; they have 
little connection with each other, and it is difficult for him 
to grasp how all these things are bound up together in the 
organisation of the State. 
For the younger pupils, up to the age of eleven 
or twelve, we can suggest a course more in keeping with 
the child’s knowledge of his environment and his love of 
the romantic, a course partly social and partly biographical. 
Some aspects of social history will appeal to the very 
juvenile mind:—dress, manners, food and drink, sports and 
pastimes, houses, means of communication, police and the 
punishment of crime, weapons and military equipment and 
the development of cannon and ironclads. A great deal of 
the matter which appears in our social histories is admirably 
suited for this stage. If a pupil has received a year or two’s
-P-A-G-E-15
  Introduction 7 
instruction in this elementary school history before he 
comes to the age when the more serious history begins, 
he will be in an immeasurably superior position to the 
pupil who knows nothing of the social life of the past. 
Those absurd anachronisms which so frequently make us 
laugh in reading elementary history “compositions” will 
thus be reduced to a minimum; we shall no longer hear of 
Saxon farmers smoking pipes over fires where turnips are 
boiling, of mediaeval monarchs sending telegrams to 
Scotland Yard for policemen, or of cavaliers and puritans 
exterminating each other with lyddite shells and magazine- 
rifles. 
On the biographical side, too, much can be done. 
All boys and girls love a good story, and if that story 
centres round a single individual so much the better. 
Numerous examples could be given of biographies suitable 
for this stage of instruction:—Julius Caesar, St Augustine, 
Alfred the Great, Harold son of Godwin, William the 
Conqueror, Thomas Becket, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, the 
Black Prince, Richard II, Sir Walter Raleigh, Oliver 
Cromwell, Bonnie Prince Charlie, Nelson, Wellington, 
George Stephenson. These are only a few of the more 
important historical characters whose biographies, simplified 
and toned down, may well be laid before a class of children 
of twelve, eleven, ten, nine, or even eight years old. The 
success or otherwise of these biographies will depend, more 
than ever, on the faculties of the teacher; it seems hardly 
necessary to add that such advanced and difficult points 
as Richard II’s Shrewsbury Parliament, Cromwell’s “In- 
strument of Government” or Wellington’s strategy in the 
Peninsular war will beomitted from these simple biographical 
stories. The examples quoted above are all taken from 
British history, but there is no reason why other parts of
-P-A-G-E-16
8 The Teaching of History 
the world should not supply their quota to our collection 
of romantic celebrities; France can give us Joan of Arc 
and Napoleon, Germany will provide Charlemagne and 
Martin Luther, Russia Peter the Great, Sweden Gustavus 
Vasa and Charles XII, Italy St Francis of Assisi and 
Garibaldi. Ancient Rome and Greece may furnish us with 
a score or more of characters, Pizarro and George Washing- 
ton may be brought from across the Atlantic, while those 
who happen to be at all conversant with Japanese history 
may even find a place for Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Saigo 
Takamori. 
The aims and objects of this twofold social and bio- 
graphical course are, firstly, to raise a preliminary interest 
in history, and secondly, to provide the pupil with some 
slight background upon which he can place knowledge ac- 
quired later. One point should be most carefully borne in 
mind; the child should not be taught in a history lesson 
things that he will have to unlearn at a later stage. Bio- 
graphies can be simplified without being falsified, and if 
legendary or doubtful material is introduced, it should be 
very clearly explained that it is legendary or doubtful. The 
effect of teaching things that have to be unlearned is par- 
ticularly harmful, as it encourages the opinion that “History 
is mainly lies.” Though we have the authority of so eminent 
a man as Mr Charles Kingsley for the truth of this doctrine, 
we need not pay very much attention to this shallow and 
rather cheap piece of cynicism. If boys and girls find that 
what they have learnt as History in the lower forms is largely 
fictitious, they will naturally be led to wonder whether when 
they getup to thetop of the school they will be told that their 
lessons in the middle forms were largely composed of ima- 
ginative material. Pupils take a keen delight in discovering 
errors of fact in presumed authorities—they will feel them-
-P-A-G-E-17
  
Introduction 9 
selves quite superior to Byron and Wolfe when they are 
told that Napoleon’s cannon could not be heard booming 
through the night before Waterloo and that Sir John Moore 
was not buried by torchlight—and we do not want to en- 
courage them to shower the same sort of contempt on His- 
tory as a whole. 
We now turn to the work for pupils of somewhat higher 
age, boys and girls of twelve, thirteen and fourteen, the 
upper forms in an elementary school and the middle forms 
in a secondary school. Here we can go a stage further and 
tackle some more serious history. But we cannot yet set 
off on a full-blown study of the development of the State. 
Though our lessons may now take a strictly chronological 
sequence, we cannot attempt a continuous narrative of the 
history of the English State. This is undoubtedly a 
breach with usual practice and tradition. But it may be 
suggested that many of our difficulties and failures have 
arisen from an attempt to teach too much in these years. 
When we ask our pupils of twelve and thirteen to learn the 
continuous narrative from the days of the Ancient Britons 
to the reign of George V we are asking too much from them. 
The idea of History that we should give pupils of these ages 
is that of a series of interesting episodes and situations, not 
that of a continuous development, for the juvenile mind has 
not yet reached the stage at which continuous developments 
extending over decades and centuries can be properly ap- 
preciated. Impersonal things, too, make as yet little im- 
, pression, and we shall have to confine our outlook to the 
human element. Thus such things as parliaments, ecclesi- 
astical synods, local government, political ideas, in fact the 
whole constitutional side of history may be relegated to 
the future course of study. 
Tosay that we cannot at this stage attempt a continuous
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 The Teaching of History 
narrative of the history of the English State does not mean 
that we should either omit to bring out the chronological 
relationship of the topics selected for lessons or fail to refer 
back to past lessons for information bearing upon present 
ones. A rough time-chart ought certainly to be made from 
time to time to indicate the relative position in time of the 
events dealt with. And great use can be made of references 
to things learnt about in previous lessons which help to 
explain or clarify later events. Thus, in a lesson on Henry 
VIII and Pope Clement VII which introduces the class to 
the opening of the Reformation in England occasion may 
be found for calling to mind things which were discussed in 
past lessons on the Lollards and on Becket; in a lesson on 
Joan of Arc we may refer to previous lessons on Agincourt 
and Crecy; in a lesson on the Indian Mutiny to what we 
had to say about Clive and Warren Hastings. We must 
certainly see to it that our pupils do not get the radically 
false idea that each historical event is something isolated 
and independent, though it is rather too soon at this stage 
to attempt to supply that continuous connective tissue which 
in older forms carries the historical narrative on from point 
to point as the serial story of one great drama—the develop- 
ment of the nation. 
When a one year’s or two years’ course of this type has 
been given—two years for preference—the pupil will have a 
historical background which will lend reality and colour to 
the more advanced work in higher forms of secondary schools. 
Should the scope of history be extended before this advanced 
stage? As regards European history certainly not, except 
as illustrating and assisting English history; European 
history is too broad a subject to allow of the minuteness 
of detail and the wealth of colour here given to English 
episodes and characters. But there is some scope for local
-P-A-G-E-19
  
Introduction 11 
history at this stage, and we may well include, either 
separately or as illustrations of the lessons on English 
history, some lessons on the antiquities and the associations 
of the local town or countryside. 
When our pupils have reached the age of fourteen or 
fifteen, we can commence a third stage of instruction. In 
this we are able to turn our attention to the more serious 
study of historical development. Such a study is only suit- 
able for the higher forms of a secondary school, and can 
hardly be introduced at all into the elementary school. 
The course here begun may be made to cover two or three 
or even four years according to the circumstances of each 
particular school. 
Now there are two distinct methods of dealing with the 
subject in these upper forms. Thereis thecontinuousmethod 
and there is the concentric method. In the former we start 
with the earliest times and work steadily forward term after 
term and year after year until at the top of the school we 
arrive at the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the 
latter we cover the whole course of English history each 
year, but in each form we give special attention to some 
particular aspect of history, political conflicts one year, wars 
and foreign policy another year, constitutional developments 
another year. Both these methods have their disadvantages. 
The chief complaint against the former is that the story of 
the nation becomes so long and dragged out that pupils on 
arriving at its conclusion have forgotten the earlier chapters. 
Again, it is argued that a mixture of all types of history, 
political and social, foreign and domestic, secular and eccle- 
siastical, constitutional and military, leads to some confusion 
~ of thought and treatment, and that a strict separation of 
the various sections of history will vastly facilitate learning. 
Further, it is well known that pupils are impatient to get 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
12 The Teaching of History 
on to modern times and learn about the history of the genera- 
tion in which they have been born, and it is said that when 
contemporary history is relegated to a distant future much 
of the eagerness of anticipation is removed. 
On the other hand there are great flaws in the concentric 
system. ‘Classes become tired of being kept to one aspect 
of history for a year, particularly when they come to the 
more prosaic constitutional section. It is urged that the 
separation of history into watertight compartments gives 
the pupil a totally false idea of the subject. The constant 
covering of the same ground, too, robs the later terms of 
the course of that air of complete freshness and novelty 
which are some inducement to interest. 
Though there are some ardent supporters of the con- 
centric system, on the whole it must be said that the 
advantages of the older method are preponderant. The 
complaint that pupils will forget the early period of the 
continuous course applies with partial cogency to the early 
subjects of the concentric course. The impatience of the 
pupil to reach the contemporary period is a small matter. 
The confusion and difficulties arising from the mixture of 
all sorts of historical information is great, no doubt, but 
there is a way out of this maze which does not follow the 
line of complete concentricity. This way out may be said to 
follow a line of partial concentricity, and it is in the details 
of the course and not in its general outline that the con- 
centric method can be used with the greatest effect. Within 
the limits of a single term the concentric system is of great 
value. An example of its application may be given in the 
history of the period 1603—1689. Now one of the greatest 
difficulties—if not the greatest difficulty—adherent to the 
study of this period is the intermixture of two main threads 
of development, the religious struggle of High Church and
-P-A-G-E-21
  Introduction 13 
Low Church and the political struggle of Crown and Par- 
liament. Herewe have two separate questions being thrashed 
out forthe greater part of a century. Shall the national 
religion be Puritan, Roman Catholic or Elizabethan Angli- 
can? and Shall the Sovereign or the Houses of Parliament 
exercise the dominant share of the rule over the country? 
The questions in themselves are quite distinct and separate, 
but as they were both being disputed and fought over at 
the same time and by the same men their history is neces- 
sarily very closely intertwined. A very much clearer concep- 
tion of the permanent results of this important period can 
be obtained by a separate consideration of the two main 
channels of religion and the Constitution than by a con- 
tinuous narrative of the whole contents of the period. But 
to pursue this method as far as to slice the entire subject 
of English history down along its whole length into separate 
strips is both unnecessary and inadvisable. The course 
pursued must resemble, not so much the rapid ebb and flow 
of a succession of high tides, as the steady recession and ad- 
vance of the waves of one strong and slow tide. 
The apportionment of the subject to the various terms 
must of course depend upon the time at the disposal of the 
individual teacher and the arrangements made for the intro- 
duction of other historical material. Where possible, 
European history should be introduced at this stage, to 
run concurrently with the contemporary English history. 
On the other hand, as has already been mentioned, local 
history finds a rather more appropriate place in the course 
allotted to the middle forms of secondary schools. 
The most satisfactory provision is for a three years’ 
course of English history, for pupils of the approximate 
ages of fourteen, fifteen and sixteen respectively. The 
division into three periods must be to a certain extent
-P-A-G-E-22
14 The Teaching of History 
arbitrary, but there do undoubtedly exist two great dividing- 
places in our history. The first comes at the great breach 
with mediaeval tradition at the end of the fifteenth century, 
corresponding roughly with the reign of Henry VII; the 
second comes at the great industrial revolution of the end 
of the eighteenth century and thebeginning of thenineteenth. 
No exact date can, of course, be fixed for the commencement 
of a great historical era, and we shall find ourselves inclined 
in some cases to relegate to the earlier period things which 
did not happen until the more recent period was well ad- 
vanced, Asregards the first dividing-point, the old-fashioned 
1485 is hardly satisfactory, as it excludes from the earlier 
period the Star Chamber and the suppression of the baronial 
liveries and liberties which make the last chapter of the 
great mediaeval struggle between the Crown and the Baron- 
age. 1509 or even 1529 are more suitable dates of division; 
perhaps if we fix the boundary at the close of Henry VII’s 
reign in 1509 we shall have hit the most suitable and con- 
venient place for it. 
In the later period the division proves more difficult, 
for though the forces that were to characterise the new era 
were already vigorously at work much earlier, the outward 
forms and policies of the old era were well maintained down 
to the second and third decades of the nineteenth century. 
In this case it will probably prove advisable to deal with the 
old factors mainly in the earlier period and to reserve the 
newfactorsalmost entirely for consideration in the later period. 
Thus the political struggles of the first twenty or thirty 
years of the nineteenth century, down to the sudden bursting 
in of parliamentary reform to the centre of the political 
stage in 1830, really belong to the earlier period, and the 
same can be said for the military and naval events of the 
Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. But the development
-P-A-G-E-23
  Introduction 15 
of the new mills, factories and forges, the first great ac- 
tivities of the Industrial Revolution, the building of Telford’s 
roads and Brindley’s canals, and the early agitation for 
Parliamentary Reform really belong to the new period. 
Perhaps the most convenient dividing-point is the year 1815, 
for up to that year the national interest was concentrated 
on old-fashioned politics and Continental wars similar in 
character to those of the past century, while it was on the 
termination of the great struggle with Napoleon that the 
new political influences engendered by the Industrial Revo- 
lution first began to make themselves really felt. While 
fixing our boundary, then, at the year 1815, we can include 
in the earlier period some events which fell after that date, 
whilst we can postpone some matter usually introduced into 
the history-books before the Great French Wars for con- 
sideration in the succeeding part of our course. 
This gives us three periods for a three years’ course:— 
To 1509, 1509 to 1815, and 1815 onwards. For a two years’ 
course perhaps the most convenient division would be 1603, 
although this leaves rather more to be got through in the 
second year than in the first. For those who are enabled 
and inclined to indulge in the luxury of a four years’ course 
perhaps the most harmonious division would be:—To 1509, 
1509 to 1689, 1689 to 1832, and 1832 onwards. But a four 
years’ continuous course of English History is not so suit- 
able to school pupils as the shorter and more compact 
three years’ course above outlined. 
The apportionment of the details of the history syllabus 
will be a matter of individual taste. But in its main out- 
lines it ought to follow the general principles here outlined, 
the division into graded stages, for lower, middle and upper 
forms, the variation of the type of work done at each stage, 
and the final attainment of a fair knowledge of the evolution
-P-A-G-E-24
16 The Teaching of History 
and development of the history of this country. One 
word as to a complaint often heard among parents and 
others. It was formerly a reproach to the teaching of 
History in this country that a schoolboy never learnt about 
anything more recent than the battle of Waterloo. Of 
course no teacher would be so foolish nowadays as to adopt 
a syllabus which would stop at 1815; and if, by leaving 
school before they reach the top form, boys and girls miss 
that part of the course of instruction which deals with the 
most recent period of History, the fault will now lie with 
the parent who takes them away and not with the school- 
master. 
Let us turn to the consideration of the question of the 
selection of material for English history lessons. For it 
is a most important thing that the teacher should be able 
to discern the proportional importance of the facts and 
features of the national history. Far too little attention 
has as yet been devoted to this question, as a rapid perusal 
of the numerous text-books published during the last 
fifteen years will show. Historical writers and teachers 
have for long been content to repeat the system and state- 
ments of older writers of text-books, and conservative 
tradition has held firm sway. There is a great temptation 
to attach importance to a question or a fact because we 
ourselves learnt about it in our own young days. To give 
a few examples :—Ranulf Flambard is not a character of 
first-rate importance in the national history, but he regularly 
makes his appearance in the text-book; Raleigh’s Guiana 
voyage and Prince Charles’ visit to Madrid were hardly 
events of lasting importance, but few books omit them; the 
great fire of London really belongs to local history but 
no writer likes to omit it from the history of England ; 
the various Wilkes incidents are all rather trivial, but a
-P-A-G-E-25
Introduction 7 
great deal of space has usually been allotted to them. It 
is necessary to revise our historical material with a rather 
strong critical attitude, in order that we may appreciate 
the essentials of history and eliminate whatever is of trivial 
importance. 
It will be as well here to enter in some detail into the 
outlines of English history as they present themselves to 
a broad and general survey. Such a discussion may seem 
perhaps unnecessary to many teachers, but if we are to 
judge by the text-books of the present day and by the 
almost universal practice in the modern schools it can hardly 
be said that history teachers as a whole have formed any 
clear conception of the general framework of the subject. 
Our history begins with a period of preparation, a 
period during which forces are operating to bring about 
the ultimate establishment of a united English State. In 
one sense the history of England as a State begins with the 
establishment of the overlordship of Egbert of Wessex in 
827, in another sense it begins with the adoption of the 
title “ King of the English” by Edward the Elder in 900. 
But in neither case do we have the creation of a really 
centralised State; for all practical purposes England 
remains a confederation of principalities until 1066. The 
ease with which the realm was divided between Canute 
and Edmund Ironside in 1016, and between Harold and 
Hardicanute in 1036 points to the imperfect realisation of 
national unity as late as the eleventh century. It is not 
until the establishment of the strong centralised government 
of the Norman kings that the country obtains anything 
really to be described as unity. Even so the organisation 
of the feudal estates tended to perpetuate local separatism, 
and under a weak king there is a marked reaction towards 
the federal idea, but 1066 certainly does mark a very 
HR 2
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 The Teaching of History 
pronounced, if not decisive stage in the unity of the 
State. 
Here then is our first historical channel of events. The 
main question in this period is How did the English 
State come to be formed? We take the earliest founda- 
tions. A Celtic people, in a low state of civilisation, is 
brought under the rule and influence of the Roman Empire. 
This Celtic race, Romanised by three and a half centuries 
of Imperial rule, is partly driven out and partly conquered 
by a Teutonic people, the Anglo-Saxons, and Great Britain 
becomes divided into two parts, a Teutonic eastern part 
and a Celtic northern and western part, each part being 
subdivided for political purposes into a number of separate 
states or principalities which are soon engaged as often in 
war with their neighbouring kinsmen as with the racial 
enemy in the other part of the island. ‘The Anglo-Saxons 
succeed in establishing their rule over the best and most 
fertile part of the country, and there follows a gradual 
development of unity and concentration of interests among 
the various Teutonic states. The chief factors in this 
process are firstly the influence of the Christian Church of 
Rome, secondly the pressure of the invasions of the North- 
men, and thirdly the common subjection to the Norman 
conquerors from across the Channel. 
The purpose of this brief summary is to indicate 
how, by following a logical plan instead of a merely casual 
chronological arrangement, we can base our history lessons 
on a reasonable system. The usual method of treating this 
period is entirely chronological. To take an example from 
the latter part of it, we usually find the following method 
of presentment :—St Augustine’s Mission, Edwin and 
Paulinus, wars of Mercia and Northumbria, St Aidan and 
the synod of Whitby, Northumbrian culture, Mercia under
-P-A-G-E-27
  
  Introduction 19 
Offa, Egbert’s supremacy, raids of the Northmen, reigns 
of Ethelwulf and his sons, Alfred the Great, Edward the 
Elder, the Danelaw, Athelstan, the battle of Brunanburgh, 
Edmund, Strathclyde and the King of Scots, Edred and 
Edwy, Dunstan, Edgar the Peaceable, Edward the Martyr, 
Ethelred the Unready, Danish raids, Edmund Ironside and 
Canute, Canute’s pilgrimage to Rome, Godwin, Harold and 
Hardicanute, Edward the Confessor, Godwin’s expulsion 
and return, Harold’s usurpation, Stamford Bridge, Hastings, 
William the Conqueror. Now this arrangement of leading 
topics has one advantage, that of chronological simplicity ; 
we can jog along through the centuries without having to 
look before and after. But unless the facts herein presented 
are organised, the real meaning of the history of this period 
is lost. The true presentment of the history of these 
centuries will unfold itself more or less on the following 
lines :—Forces tending to national unity (the Church, the 
Danish raids, the Norman Conquest); how the Church 
established itself in England, conflict of two rival Churches, 
Synod of Whitby, organisation of the English Church, 
unifying effects of a single Church; how the Northmen 
came to England, the raids develop into conquests, the 
climax of the struggle under Alfred, establishment of the 
Danelaw, its reconquest by Edward the Elder, a period of 
peace, renewal of the invasions under national direction, 
the conquest of England by Canute, the collapse of Danish 
rule, general effects of the period of Danish invasion; the 
development of the idea of a Norman invasion, Harold’s 
accession provides the excuse, the invasion, diversion at 
Stamford Bridge, Hastings, submission of the country, 
suppression of English revolts and completion of the 
conquest, unifying and other effects of the Norman Conquest. 
We are here pursuing a definite logical plan; the story is 
2~2
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  20 The Teaching of History 
no longer a disjointed series of successive reigns and notable 
occurrences, it is an organic whole; it is not a string of 
beads but a solid and connected piece of work; it resembles 
no longer one of those worms that can be cut up into a series 
of separate and still living worms, but a vertebrate animal 
whose backbone cannot be severed without vital injury. 
To proceed, we come to the period of the later Middle 
Ages. Now in this period we have five main channels in 
which our history flows. First we have the channel of 
feudalism, which forms the basis of what we generally term 
mediaeval society; then we have the great contest between 
centrifugal and centripetal tendencies, the struggle of local 
separatism against national unity, the conflict between 
Crown and Baronage—the most important factor in the 
domestic history of this country and of many other countries 
during the Middle Ages; thirdly comes the adjustment of 
the claims of Church and State; fourthly we have the 
development of the Constitution; and lastly there is the 
expansion of English power beyond the limits of the 
Kingdom. We are at the present day removed by so many 
centuries from the Middle Ages that we can review them as 
a whole, and when we do so these five main channels of 
history are discernible. Now there may be some consider- 
able difference of opinion as to whether it were better to 
take each of these channels or threads separately, and follow 
them throughout their entire length or to proceed more 
strictly in chronological order and take, for instance, first 
the initial stage of the Crown and Baronage contest, 
then the Anselm phase of the ecclesiastical struggle, and 
then the Norman structure of the Constitution. Different 
teachers will doubtless come to different conclusions on this 
question, but it is hoped that it will not be considered too 
revolutionary if it is boldly suggested here that in this case
-P-A-G-E-29
Introduction 21 
the concentric method should be applied to the whole 
history of the later Middle Ages. That period is so far 
removed from us that we can safely teach it in this way 
without seeming to get too far ahead with one aspect of 
our subject. It would hardly be safe to suggest that the 
four centuries following the year 1509 could be so intelligibly 
taught in this manner, but the four centuries or so preced- 
ing that date can be more briefly summed up as constituent 
parts of a more or less distinct and homogeneous age. 
If we take the Middle Ages in this manner, we shall 
then proceed to follow out the course of the five main 
channels here outlined. The subject of feudalism comes 
first. Here we must begin by explaining why and how 
feudalism first sprang up; we must then proceed to an 
account of its organisation under the Norman Kings, the 
agricultural and economic system of feudalism, the financial 
system of feudalism, the judiciary system of feudalism, 
and the military system of feudalism. The advantage of 
dealing with these important questions as a whole, as 
compared. with the old method of taking them point by 
point as they happen to crop up in the chronologicas 
narrative, Domesday Book, Flambard’s extortions, Henry I’s 
Charter, scutage, etc., is obvious. We can then go on to 
discuss the causes which led to the decay of feudalism, the 
growth of the spirit of nationality, the organisation of the 
new mercenary army, the centralisation of the courts of 
justice, the growing centralisation of the Constitution 
generally, the economic changes produced by the catastrophe 
of the Black Death, the advent of new ideas in the fifteenth 
century. The devotion of our first lessons on the Middle 
Ages to some such survey as this will make the comprehen- 
sion of the rest of mediaeval history infinitely easier. 
The struggle between Crown and Baronage comes next.
-P-A-G-E-30
22 The Teaching of History 
It resolves itself into four main stages. First we have the 
period when the Crown is fighting a defensive battle against 
the aggressions of the nobility, this stage lasts until the 
great revolt of the barons in 1173 and 1174. Then comes 
a long period during which the Crown tends to be in the 
ascendant and when the Baronage entrenches itself behind 
the ramparts of precedent and constitutionalism, fighting 
a defensive battle against the Crown. With the conclusion 
of the first part of the Hundred Years’ War there begins 
a third stage; the Baronage has got into its hands that 
powerful instrument of offence, the Livery system, and from 
1377 to 1485 the monarchy is a mere creature and plaything 
of the great nobles. The advent of licence to the feudal 
aristocracy gives rein to internecine feuds which end only in 
the Wars of the Roses, and this paves the way for the fourth 
period when, by the aid of the Star Chamber, the Tudor 
monarchy finally puts an end to mediaeval baronialism. 
The affairs of the Church are more suitably awarded 
a different method of treatment. The position, aims and 
claims of the great Catholic Church should first be taught. 
Then we can summarise the different grounds on which 
Church and State came into collision, concerning the 
appointment of ecclesiastics, the trial of clergy, the taxation 
of the clergy by the State, the taxation of the laity by the 
Church, and soon. These can be further exemplified in detail. 
The Constitution, too, will demand asectional treatment. 
We can take the Crown first, and outline its prerogatives. 
Wecan investigate the important question of the succession, 
and trace the conflict of the opposing theories of heredi- 
tary descent, baronial election, ecclesiastical sanction and 
parliamentary disposal. Then there is the Parliament, 
the original Witan of the Saxon kings becoming the 
Magnum Concilium of the Normans; we can trace how
-P-A-G-E-31
Introduction, 23 
the membership of this body came to be narrowed down 
to an oligarchical group of nobles and how its doors were 
opened again by new creations to the peerage. Again, we 
have the King’s Council as a committee of the Great 
Council, and the whole organisation of the civil service. 
The origin and development of the Commons will be next 
presented, the increase in their nominal prestige under the 
Lancastrian and Yorkist kings, and their gradual rise to 
the position of a regular and necessary part of the national 
Parliament. Some space can here be given to the judicial 
system and to local government. 
Finally we have the foreign policy of the realm, which 
will be found to resolve itself into four great aggressive 
movements, aggression in Wales, aggression in Scotland, 
aggression in Ireland, and aggression in France. In each 
case a consideration of the general course of our mediaeval 
foreign policy will be found to impress the pupil far more 
deeply than the jerky treatment of these matters usually 
followed. If, for instance, Owen Glendower’s rising can be 
presented in its proper logical place, as a late consequence 
of Edward I’s conquest of Wales a century or more before, 
and if Edward IIT’s Scottish wars can be connected with the 
earlier struggle of which they form merely the later part, 
the old-fashioned aim of storing the memory with a long 
series of disconnected facts will have been replaced by one 
based on the real meaning and significance of scientific 
history. 
This brings us to the end of the Middle Ages, and we 
now embark upon the period from 1509 to 1815. There is 
some difficulty in finding a suitable appellation for this 
period, for since the great historians of the eighteenth 
century devised the names Ancient, Mediaeval and Modern 
to express the eras which had passed over the human race 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
24 The Teaching of History 
up to their own time, there has been a revolution in the 
conditions of life which has brought about a greater change 
in things than occurred between the Ancient and the 
Mediaeval eras or between the Mediaeval and the Modern 
eras. Perhaps, in default of other suggestions we may 
describe the period we are now entering upon from 1509 to 
1815 as the Modern Period, while we refer to the age since 
the latter date as the Recent Period. 
Here we come to an age which cannot quite so easily 
be divided lengthwise. For whereas the great questions 
of the Middle Ages, the value of feudalism, the balance of 
power between Crown and Baronage and between Church 
and State, the national unity of England, the expansion 
of English power, remain under discussion during the whole 
age, the great questions of the Modern Period are often 
either settled half way through the era or not commenced 
until half way through. For instance, the religious conflict 
virtually ends in 1689, for the feeble flickerings of Jacobitism 
never really imperilled the country. The contest between 
Crown and Parliament, too, is definitely settled in the same 
year. The expansion of England across the ocean, on the 
other hand, does not begin until the end of the sixteenth 
century and the great series of English interventions in the 
Continental wars does not begin till the close of the seven- 
teenth. 
Broadly speaking, we have the following elementary 
channels of English history during the Modern Period:— 
The Reformation and its ultimate religious settlement, the 
conflict of the Crown with Parliament, and the building up 
of the Empire. The first of these takes us from the breach 
with Rome under Henry VIII, through the vicissitudes of 
. Edwardian Protestantism and the Marian Catholicism to 
the medial settlement of Elizabeth, then on through a long
-P-A-G-E-33
Introduction 25 
stretch of Catholic and Puritan suppression and intrigue to 
the outbreak of the great religious war in the seventeenth 
century; there follow the Puritan triumph, the Anglican 
reaction, and the Church settlement of the Restoration ; 
the settlement is then threatened once more from the 
Catholic direction, and this leads up to the upheaval of the 
Revolution of 1688, after which the Anglican Church 
emerges as the undisputed ecclesiastical establishment of 
the nation. There is really no great harm done in teaching 
the whole of this sequence of religious events before going 
back to the Tudor monarchy and the struggle between 
Crown and Parliament, though many teachers will un- 
doubtedly prefer to make a break at the establishment of 
the Elizabethan Settlement in order to avoid too long a 
series of lessons on ecclesiastical history; for altogether 
about a third of the History of England during this 
“Modern Period” will be found to be connected with 
ecclesiastical concerns. 
Then comes the Constitutional question of the relative 
powers of Crown and Parliament. By the overthrow of the 
feudal Baronage and the subjection of the Church to royal 
control the power of the Crown is elevated to a high pitch. 
There follows a period of personal despotism unknown at 
any other period of our history, during which the claims 
of Parliament begin to be heard. The accession of an alien 
to the throne in the person of James VI of Scotland puts 
Parliament on its mettle, and there follows a long period 
of combat between Crown and Parliament, complicated by 
the contemporary ecclesiastical disputes. The question does 
not reach a definite solution until 1689, although the acts 
of the Long Parliament in 1640 and 1641 mark a definite 
stage of progress. Again it may be suggested that this 
subject should be dealt with in an organised form, and that
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 The Teaching of History 
we should take the purely constitutional, the financial, the 
judicial and the military questions under dispute separately 
and summarise the results obtained by Parliament in each 
of these fields of action up to 1689. 
With the advent of the eighteenth century the centre 
of interest shifts to foreign politics. But before we embark 
on the wars of Imperial expansion it is necessary to outline 
the system under which the country was governed during 
the period of Parliamentary aristocratic rule. We have to 
outline the constitution of the House of Commons, the 
position of the House of Lords, the attacks upon the Revo- 
lution Monarchy by the Jacobites, the rise and progress of 
the Cabinet system and of political parties. 
The wars of Imperial expansion may be prefaced by an 
account of the early American settlements and the Dutch 
wars of the seventeenth century; it is far more logical that 
they should come in here than that they should be dragged 
in chronologically to disturb the narrative of the consti- 
tutional and religious struggles of that time. The Dutch 
wars can be followed by the change of policy towards the 
Netherlands owing to the growth of the power of Louis XIV 
of France. We then proceed to outline the main causes of 
what Sir John Seeley calls the second Hundred Years’ War 
with France, which we can then follow up in some detail, 
until we at last reach Waterloo and the termination of the 
long struggle. 
The history of the Recent Era now begins. The starting 
point for this era must necessarily be at the Industrial 
Revolution. Before this period can be approached it is 
necessary to devote some time to the story of the develop- 
ment of the great modern inventions and the consequent 
effects upon industry and commerce. It will be found that 
this introduction to the period will take much less time to
-P-A-G-E-35
Introduction 27 
present than its importance might suggest, for it is a 
simpler matter to sketch the broad general factors of history 
than the lesser and more changeable which arise out of 
national, party and personal politics. When this intro- 
ductory sketch of the Industrial Revolution and its effects 
has been given, we may proceed to the two main channels 
of our history during the Recent Era—the growth of 
democracy and the building up of the British Empire. 
Democracy can be taken first; we outline the causes of 
the growth of the doctrine, its effects on English political 
life, and its gradual assertion in the affairs of the country. 
The three Reform Acts lead up to subsidiary measures, 
such as the Municipal Reform and County Councils Acts, 
the abolition of purchase of commissions in the Army, the 
opening of the civil service to competitive examination. 
There may perhaps follow a brief account of political parties 
since the Reform Act of 1832. Then come questions con- 
nected with religion and with education, questions of special 
importance to the working classes, such as the Workers’ 
Compensation Acts and the Insurance Act, and measures 
of more general utility such as the Penny Post and the 
Drainage Acts. Irish questions can be dealt with to ad- 
vantage separately and continuously. Foreign policy since 
1815 too, should be kept separate as far as possible from 
the complication of domestic developments. 
Finally we have the growth of the Empire. We can 
briefly recapitulate the growth of our oversea dominions 
and the development of the Imperial idea. The loss of the 
American colonies can be dealt with either here or in con- 
nection with the French war of 1778 in an earlier part of 
the course. The chief colonies and British possessions can 
then be taken in order, and their recent history briefly 
outlined : Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 The Teaching of History 
India. A sketch of the most recent factors of Imperial 
consolidation and co-operation may fittingly conclude this 
outline. 
Now the foregoing synopsis of the leading features of 
our history has no intention of pretending to be infallible 
or prescriptive. It merely suggests the method by which 
history may be presented to the pupil as a logical and 
reasonable subject. It displays history as a study in evo- 
lution, and its parts fit as clearly and easily one into the 
other as the various stages of a course in geography, lan- 
guage or mathematics. If some such plan is followed there 
will no longer be complaints that history teaching presents 
no real or serious objective or that the study of history 
has no value. 
The preceding remarks have been relative to English 
history, but the same idea holds good for European 
history as well, and with even greater cogency. For if the 
intermixture of all varieties of historical matter in an 
English history lesson be confusing, what shall we say of 
a method by which the domestic and foreign policies, not of 
one country, but of all the countries of Europe, are thus 
perplexingly intertwined. If the chronological method has 
been a failure in English history, still more will it be a 
failure in European or World history. Perhaps an example 
of the more logical method as applied to one period of 
European history will illustrate its use in this field. 
The recent period in European history presents great 
difficulties to the student. But these difficulties can be solved 
if areasonable method of dealing with the subject is adopted. 
Recent history begins with the Industrial Revolution in the 
economic world and the French Revolution in the political 
world. Before embarking on the history of the nineteenth 
century the Industrial Revolution should be studied and
-P-A-G-E-37
Introduction 29 
its meaning appreciated. After the violent effusion of the 
French revolution and the turmoil caused by the outburst 
of military vigour which accompanied it, Europe settled 
down into apparent tranquillity after the battle of Waterloo 
and the Congress of Vienna. Thenceforward European 
history has been directed and controlled by the operation 
of three great forces, Democracy, Nationalism and Inter- 
national Rivalry. In teaching this period, the three forces 
should be kept apart as far as possible. The progress of 
democracy can be sketched first of all generally, and then 
as it occurred in the greater nations of Europe. Similarly, 
after outlining the aims and ideals of the Nationalist move- 
ment, its progress should be traced in large countries such 
as Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary and the Turkish 
Empire, with perhaps some reference to its effects in Poland, 
Finland, Norway and Belgium. To study the subject in this 
way is to understand it far more readily than under the old 
method. Even with international relations we need not 
stick to a strictly chronological arrangement. We may deal 
in turn with the great questions which have distracted the 
Powers during the last century, the Eastern Question, the 
French danger, the colonial rivalries, the German danger. 
However much we may ultimately be able to appreciate a 
continuous narrative of the story, in learning the elements 
of the subject this simpler method is virtually essential. 
Both in arranging his syllabus and in arranging his 
lessons the teacher should never lose for an instant the 
general idea of the plan on which he is working. Prominence 
will be given to the important main channels of history 
and everything that is unnecessary and irrevelant will be 
either cut entirely away or used merely as illustrative 
material. The teacher and the student alike should be 
able to appreciate what are the essentials of history.
-P-A-G-E-38
I. THE PRESENTATION OF HISTORY 
Havine discussed why we are to teach history and what 
history we are to teach, it is now possible to proceed with 
the methods of teaching the subject. ‘There has been, 
perhaps, no subject the methods of teaching which have 
given rise to more discussion during recent years. All 
varieties of method are “in the air,” and nobody yet has 
propounded a universally accepted system. While a great 
deal of this uncertainty has arisen from the inability to 
appreciate the initial facts of what history is really to be 
taught, another reason for confusion is that many of our 
well-known history teachers have devoted their attention, 
and with it their enthusiasm, to some particular section of 
history, such as social science, source-work, or European 
history, and have turned their energies into a partial and 
sectional channel. The ordinary student and teacher will 
find that to adopt the attitude and policy of a “trimmer” 
and give due consideration to the claims of all sorts and 
conditions of historical methodologists will be, not a source 
of weakness, but the best possible security for a reasonable 
outlook on the subject. 
In former days there were two main methods of pro- 
cedure. There was the formal study of the text-book, 
which usually resolved itself into merely “learning” the 
names and dates. There was also the historical lecture- 
lesson. These were the methods of assimilating facts ; 
reproduction took the form of oral question and answer, 
written answer, and lengthy composition. Now all of these 
old-fashioned methods had their use, and if uninspiring,
-P-A-G-E-39
  The Presentation of History 31 
in the hands of a good disciplinarian they led to some 
results. They hada good old English hard-working flavour, 
and as such they compare favourably with some more 
modern plans. This is not the place for a general dis- 
quisition on educational theory, but it may be noted that 
history teaching has suffered recently from the excessive 
wave of reaction against the grinding methods of our 
fathers. A school of teachers, mostly of the rising genera- 
tion, has appeared which aims principally at “increasing 
the interest” of the work. This school of opinion has in 
many cases devised some excellent aids to effective history- 
teaching, but in its practice of teaching it has led to some 
lamentable failures. 'The excursion to the abbey or the 
picture gallery, the cinematograph film, and the reading 
from the historical novel will no doubt be vastly appreciated 
by the pupils, but when the end of the term comes, unless 
stringent steps have been taken to consolidate and preserve 
the knowledge thus acquired, the class may be found pitiably 
ignorant of the period it has been “studying.” It might 
be casually observed that the thick sugaring of subjects 
like history and geography is a little unfair to the teachers 
of the more prosaic but equally necessary subjects like 
mathematics, as it gives the pupil a “spoilt” desire for 
amusement which will detract from his attention to these 
other subjects. 
The aim of school teaching is not to amuse, nor is it 
to interest, if that interest is going to be merely ephemeral; 
in our subject interest must always be a means to an end— 
the end of gaining a good and lasting knowledge of the 
outlines of history. Seeing that this must be our obvious 
aim, our method of teaching must be designed to effect 
this in the most secure and satisfactory manner. Now it 
is apparent that the more the brain is exercised over a
-P-A-G-E-40
  a] The Teaching of History 
subject the more lasting will be the impression produced 
by that subject; hence we must make our pupils use their 
brains as much as possible in their work. These last 
remarks are of course platitudes, but it is just as well for 
some history teachers to be reminded of them. 
The main object of the study of history being the 
acquisition of the knowledge of certain important facts 
relative to the development of the human race, and of our 
own nation in particular, we must first enquire what are 
the most efficient means by which this knowledge can be 
acquired. The main facts of history can be obtained by 
reading or by hearing ; the text-book and the word of the 
teacher are the two main factors of instruction in these 
elementary particulars. Of these two factors the most 
efficient will be the text-book. An oral lesson may make 
a considerable impression at the time it is delivered, but 
the human memory is erratic, and a week or month after- 
wards the remembrance of the facts learnt will become hazy 
and blurred. But though facts learnt from a text-book are 
liable to the same process of distortion and disappearance, 
the text-book remains as the lasting and visible witness 
and a source of reference after the teacher's words have 
become mingled with the air. During an oral lesson, too, 
individual pupils, through distraction, laziness or absence, 
may miss some or all of the matter, but with a text-book 
the same work can be made up after the original lesson is 
over. The text-book, as containing the essence of the 
matter under consideration, should be continually kept on 
the desk in front of the pupil, except, of course, during 
tests of memory and knowledge. It is important, too, that 
where possible the school text-book should be carried away 
by the pupil at the end of the school course, to act as a 
constant source of reference for historical questions that
-P-A-G-E-41
  The Presentation of History on 
crop up in the future, or to form the first volume of a 
historical bookshelf of the pupil’s own. 
It would be invidious to offer any suggestions relative 
to the merits or demerits of any of the numerous text-books 
on the market. A few brief remarks on the points that 
one should look for in a good text-book are all that can 
be put forward on the subject. It used to be a sort of 
maxim at one time, “Small boy, small book.” But as a 
matter of fact, in the history class at least, it is not by 
any means advisable to proportion the size of the volume 
to the size or age of the pupil. In truth it might almost be 
said that we must work here on lines of inverse proportion. 
It is only an older boy or girl that can grasp the more or 
less dry facts in a historical summary; your young pupil 
wants a good thick padding of details and explanation to 
make his history look intelligible. Generally speaking, 
then, we should avoid placing a bald summary in the 
hands of our younger pupils. In the youngest forms, if a 
text-book is used for social and biographical studies, it 
should be one that is filled with chatty, descriptive and 
brightly coloured details. The same applies to the text- 
book for the middle forms of secondary schools, where the 
history of England is best taken as a series of remarkable 
incidents and events; there are very few books yet published 
which provide a satisfactory basis for the work in these forms. 
In the upper forms of secondary schools the selection of a 
suitable text-book will be a matter of very great importance. 
It must contain all the important facts, but it must not be 
too long and prolix. It must clearly bring out the relative 
importance of the facts it contains. It must make some 
attempt to indicate where the main channels of History 
lie, and therefore it must not too slavishly follow the 
chronological system. It must be up to date; antiquated 
HL 3
-P-A-G-E-42
34 The Teaching of History 
views about important historical events or institutions 
must not be perpetuated in its pages. It must be brightly 
and intelligently written, and not such as to repel the 
interest of the reader. When a new text-book has to 
be selected in any school, it is always advisable for 
the teacher to make personal enquiries at some large 
educational bookseller’s and examine a good many volumes 
before making a final decision, Historical exhibitions, such 
as that held in the summer of 1914 at King’s College, 
London, afford also a good opportunity for teachers to get 
into touch with the latest productions in the way of text- 
books. 
When a good text-book is in use, the class should be 
allowed to use it as much as possible, that is to say, where 
information may be obtained from the book, the teacher 
will not provide that information out of his own mouth. 
The book may be read aloud round the class or studied 
silently ; perhaps the first method is the better, as op- 
portunity is given for an explanation of any words that 
are unfamiliar to the pupil and for an elucidation of any 
reference that may be difficult to grasp. The less satisfactory 
the book, the more call will there be for such commentaries 
and explanations. It is just as well that before proceeding 
to any further discussion or illustration of the points dealt 
with, the matter presented in the text should be thoroughly 
learnt and mastered, test questions, either oral or written, 
being given to ascertain that the work has really been done. 
The task of learning may appear somewhat unpleasant and 
dull to those whose main idea is to turn a school into a 
paradise of pleasure, but if anything approaching good 
results are to be obtained, a good solid grind at the elements 
is essential. 
It may be observed here that it is advisable to give the 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
The Presentation of History 35 
pupil a far more thorough acquaintance with his book than 
is usually done. Boys and girls seldom know the title, 
author, arrangement, or even the index of their history 
books. In this last particular it is important that the 
pupil should receive some instruction. Where it is possible 
to find out where a thing is by simply referring to the 
index, the teacher should never tell the pupil on what page 
it is to be found. It may even prove useful sometimes to 
set an exercise which will involve an intelligent use of the 
index ; the class may be told to collect all the references to 
London in the history-book, or to find out on what 
occasions an English army has invaded Scotland or Ireland, 
exercises which will accustom the pupil to the use of the 
index. Ofcourse every pupil should know the difference be- 
tween an index and a table of contents; a good many do not. 
It has been indicated that it is desirable to use a text- 
book which attempts to organise the facts of history on a 
more intelligible system than that pursued by the chrono- 
logical volumes. But in many schools where there is 
already an established text-book, where books remain 
school-property, and where there are no funds available for 
renewing the supply of text-books, it will be found necessary 
to make the best of the old ones, most of which follow the 
chronological arrangement. Here there is scope for some 
interesting class-work, for: the facts may be selected and 
sorted from the storehouse of the book, and finally arranged 
in a systematic order in notes. Thus the class can collect 
all the material relating to the Church in the Middle Ages. 
They may summarise each paragraph relating to this 
subject, and from these notes may be drawn up a compact 
analysis of the chief causes of dispute between Church and 
State in the Middle Ages and a statement of the result of 
those disputes.

  36 The Teaching of History 
There are some who believe that this method is superior 
to that of studying the organised facts ready arranged in 
a modern text-book. But although this sort of work no 
doubt exercises the brain very considerably, it consumes a 
very large amount of time, and if pursued to any extent it 
will leave the syllabus time-table in the lurch. There is a 
certain school of educational theory that advocates an 
excessive devotion to the “find out” method. In history 
they are represented by the Source-book enthusiasts; in 
geography by the Mapping specialists, in Science by the 
Experiment advocates. A little exercise in primitive 
enquiry and in the methods of the advanced student is 
useful at some time or other in nearly all school courses, 
but to make empirical research the main feature of a school 
training in any subject is, with its unavoidable sacrifice of 
time, to throw away the birthright of the rising generation 
as “the heir of all the ages.” 
When the selected lesson or subject has been thoroughly 
mastered from the text-book we can go on to further 
sources of instruction. Some teachers prefer to test the 
knowledge acquired from thé book by setting questions 
which require longer or shorter written answers; others 
will prefer the oral method of question and answer. Asa 
matter of fact the former is more thorough as providing 
the means of testing the knowledge of each individual 
member of the class in the whole of the matter learnt. 
Where questions are asked round the class, the fickle 
goddess Fortune often plays an important part in the 
allotment of marks for answers. 
Now comes the question of how far the teacher may be 
allowed to provide information out of his own mouth. The 
solid backbone of the facts should, as we have said, be 
obtained from the book. But a very great quantity of
-P-A-G-E-45
  
The Presentation of History 37 
expansive and illustrative material can now be provided 
by the teacher. This may take many different shapes. 
Throughout, however, the teacher must bear in mind that 
such information as he gives must be mainly illustrative 
and should continually refer his observations to the points 
dealt with in the book. Lecture-lessons, as such, should 
only be given occasionally; they cannot but be a relaxation 
of effort for the pupil, and hence they ought to be the 
exception and not the rule. It has been somewhat cynically 
remarked that whereas in the old-fashioned school the 
pupil learnt the lesson and the teacher heard it, in the 
modern school the teacher learns the lesson and the pupil 
hears it. This was never so true as in the case of many 
modern history-teachers. Oral information should be 
given in small doses ; and where a lengthy lecture-lesson is 
necessary, it should be broken at intervals for the taking 
of dictated or other notes on the subject under discussion, 
preferably by way of recapitulation of what has been said. 
A good deal of interesting information which combines 
enlightenment on the subjects under discussion with an 
addition to the interest of the lessons, can be given by 
reading quotations and extracts from books. There are 
many forms of literature which can be pressed into service 
for this sort of thing. First there are the large historical 
volume, the historical monograph, and the biography ; 
guide-books, magazines and newspapers occasionally furnish 
their quota of information; and then there is the historical 
novel, old or new. A good history-teacher should keep in 
touch with all forms of literature likely to be of service to 
him in the teaching of his subject. 
An example or two may be given of the effective use 
of literary sources. A lesson on the Black Death can be 
added to by a discussion of the subject conducted by the
-P-A-G-E-46
> BG ea ae eo le ee a 
38 The Teaching of History 
teacher, the reading of Thorold Rogers’ account of the 
plague in his “Six Centuries of Work and Wages,” the 
reading of the introduction to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s 
“Sir Nigel,” which gives a somewhat impressive sketch of 
the calamity, the “Statute of Labourers” of 1351, and 
extracts from the article on Bubonic Plague in the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica. A lesson on the battle of 
Waterloo may be discussed with the additional information 
provided by the personal reminiscences to be found in Sir 
Edward Creasy’s “Decisive Battles,” by the well-constructed 
letters of the Tubney contingent in C. R. L. Fletcher’s 
“Introductory History of England,” of the extracts relative 
to the conduct of Napoleon in Dr Rose’s “Life of Napoleon,” 
and the vivid narrative of Erckmann and Chatrian in 
“ Waterloo.” 
The teacher who makes a point of frequent historical 
reading will be able to produce extracts and quotations 
and to provide information from his memory on almost 
every important event of English history. It is in this 
respect that the advantage of the history specialist becomes 
apparent. Given a really good text-book, any intelligent 
teacher may be able to “keep a page or two ahead” of the 
class; but when it comes to those discussions and illustrations 
and exercises upon which the attractiveness and the success 
of the subject so much depend, the need of a specialist is 
at once felt. Though some unpractical and “faddist” 
specialists have failed to produce as good results as a 
prosaic instructor of all subjects, every secondary school 
that wishes to produce satisfactory results in this subject 
will find it essential to employ the services of a specialist 
teacher in history.
-P-A-G-E-47
APPENDICES 
A. HISTORICAL EXERCISES 
WE must now consider what forms of historical exercise 
can be given to pupils who have had the main outlines of 
the subject laid before them. These exercises can be of 
many kinds, and each particular historical subject will 
probably suggest some particular form of exercise suited 
to it. A wide-awake teacher will always be on the lookout 
for fit subjects for exercises, though he must always keep 
such exercises well within the bounds of his general scheme. 
First we have the old-fashioned composition. This is 
by no means to be rejected on account of its antiquity. 
In some schools lengthy compositions have been very con- 
siderably reduced in late years, with the effect that the 
arts of writing, spelling, punctuation and the construction 
of sentences have fallen off very considerably. It is very 
important, for the general purposes of education, that the 
art of composition should not be allowed to fall back. In 
higher forms, where one or more of the public examinations 
are the goal of the school year, frequent practice in com- 
position is essential. In this case, the teacher will do well 
to obtain beforehand copies of the recent history papers 
set in the examinations in question. The past papers of 
most of our public examinations can be purchased, and a 
study of a few consecutive years’ questions will give a very 
good idea of the sort of answers that will be required. In 
the modern public examination in history the questions 
almost always demand an answer of the composition type, 
and if pupils are previously trained in the way of readily 
putting their knowledge on to paper in the form of intel-
-P-A-G-E-48
MS EE Se ee ee ote Meee 
40 The Teaching of History 
ligible sentences, their chances of success in these examina- 
tions will be considerably increased. 
The composition, then, both for its own sake and with 
a view to public examinations, will form an important 
element in historical work for schools. The composition 
may take several different forms. The higher classes 
may devote their attention to the straightforward essay 
type of exercise. In the junior forms it is often an advan- 
tage to give the work a rather more romantic and personal 
interest by turning it into an exercise in which the imagi- 
nation may have fuller play. A few examples of this type 
can be given. There is the description written from the 
standpoint of an actor in the events described. Pupils can 
be asked to write an account of the battle of Hastings from 
the point of view of one of the soldiers engaged in it, to 
write from the standpoint of a member of Parliament a 
description of the visit of Charles I to the House of Commons 
to arrest the Five Members, to write the experiences of 
an English soldier in the war against the Bengalese in 
1757 or against the Zulus in 1879. Sometimes it may be 
possible to allow the members of a class to decide for 
themselves on which side they will range their imaginary 
writer ; we can tell them to describe either a Puritan from 
the Cavalier point of view or a Cavalier from the Puritan 
point of view, or to write about the battle of Bunker Hill 
from the standpoint either of a loyalist soldier or of a rebel 
volunteer. Occasionally it is a good idea to ask for both 
points of view in succession, one in one composition and 
one in another. Such exercises, in which the powers of 
imagination are drawn upon and the pupil to a certain 
extent gets inside his history and for a moment “lives” 
in the past, are of enormous value in impressing the subject 
on his mind and stimulating a further liking for it.
-P-A-G-E-49
Historical Exercises 41 
Proceeding further, we can devise compositions which 
do not merely wear the aspect of accounts written by 
persons who took part in historical scenes but which are 
written as though they were actual contemporary docu- 
ments. ‘The easiest form of transition into this realm is 
the imaginary letter, where an incident is told or a 
description given in the form of correspondence. Or a 
letter, fictitious or real, can be written on the black- 
board and the class may be asked to write an answer to it 
from the person or from one of the persons to whom it is 
addressed. Some of Cromwell’s shorter letters demanding 
stores and giving instructions, taken from Carlyle’s 
“ Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell,” may be used 
in this way. Or one can write up an imaginary letter, say, 
from Burke to Chatham advocating the cession of inde- 
pendence to the American colonies; or from Disraeli to 
Peel, accusing him of desertion of principle in adopting 
Free Trade in corn, while we ask the class to write an 
answer to it as they would think the characters concerned 
would have answered. 
Further, from imaginary letters we can proceed to 
imaginary speeches. Many suitable exercises can here be 
given:—A speech of Simon Langton to the barons at 
Runnymede, an oration of Pym’s on the Star Chamber 
or Ship Money, Marlborough to his English troops at 
Blenheim, Pitt on the reasons for the war of 1793, Lowe 
on the Reform Bill of 1867. Again, we can ask for pro- 
clamations, an appeal for Royalist or Puritan recruits at 
the outbreak of the Civil War, a Jacobite declaration of 
1715 or 1745, or a Chartist manifesto of the forties of last 
century. It has even been found effective in some cases to 
set as a light optional homework exercise the drawing of a 
cartoon illustrating some political incident of past centuries.
-P-A-G-E-50

42 The Teaching of History 
These and such-like exercises will of course be more 
frequent in the junior than in the senior forms. All such 
work must be very carefully corrected, anachronisms 
pointed out, suggestions for improvement made, falsities 
and irrelevancies struck through. Pupils must be encour- 
aged to bring into their work of this sort as many refer- 
ences to contemporary events and ideas as possible. It is 
really surprising how a few exercises of this description 
will stimulate a class, for, particularly in the case of younger 
pupils, it will be found that a closer and more “ personal” 
contact with historical events will make its members 
actually keenly excited in passages of history which have 
formerly left the pupils undisturbed and uninterested. 
The next form of exercise that comes to the mind is 
the mapping exercise. It has been frequently urged upon 
historical students that one cannot understand political 
history without having an atlas at hand for frequent 
reference. It is the same with school work. Good maps 
must be at hand to explain the movements of political 
history. We may ask here if it is necessary to have such 
books as historical atlases for use in class. Now the 
answer to this question depends entirely on one thing, 
whether the text-books in use contain sufficient and satis- 
factory maps to explain the matter presented in the text. 
As a matter of fact it ought to be very easy to get all the 
historical maps that are necessary from a text-book. The 
names of places mentioned in the course of a year’s 
history lessons are not too manifold to include in a short 
series of maps in the text-book itself. Where European 
or general history is taken, the same remark applies. But 
some text-books do not supply adequate maps, and in that 
case a historical atlas may be said to become necessary. 
There are several fairly inexpensive historical atlases on
-P-A-G-E-51
  Historical Exercises 43 
the market ; these may no doubt be obtainable for exami- 
ation on application at any large bookseller’s. 
Besides having his attention frequently drawn to 
the map, the pupil should have constant exercise in the 
reproduction of historical maps, both as a relief from the 
more usual work of reading, listening, answering and writing, 
and as an aid to the retention of historical facts. Large 
numbers of pupils will soon forget the whereabouts of 
the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms unless they draw a map 
of them, and the same applies to many other things in 
history. One important observation may be made with 
regard to historical maps. They should not contain any- 
thing which is not needed for the appreciation’ of the facts 
they are intended to illustrate. As always, we must look 
for the essential. It is a prevalent fault of historical maps 
that they are overloaded with irrelevant details, while they 
often at the same time omit really important features. 
For instance, in an ordinary political map to show the 
extent of States at different periods, it is not necessary to 
fill in a network of rivers, roads and hills nor to pack in a 
crowd of towns. Places that are not mentioned in the text, 
unless they are so important in themselves that they 
absolutely command insertion, are not required to encumber 
a text-book map. It is, in fact, often advisable, in maps 
which merely indicate boundaries or the positions of places 
unconnected with military movements, to omit physical 
features almost altogether. In a geographical exercise this 
would of course be an unpardonable fault, but for illus- 
trating the history text-book it cannot be called to the 
same account. On the other hand, maps illustrating 
military movements do require a considerable insertion of 
physical features, dependent as all military movements are 
upon the nature of the ground over which operations are
-P-A-G-E-52
44 The Teaching of History 
being conducted. History books have hardly yet attempted 
to make use of the modern system of contour-shading for 
their military maps, yet it is barely possible to understand 
most campaigns without a contour-map of some sort. This 
fault is perhaps a little more excusable for general surveys 
of history which do not go into details of military cam- 
paigns, but it is one which is carried into more detailed 
historical volumes. In any case the maps drawn by our 
pupils should fulfil the conditions of omitting irrelevant 
details and including those features which are necessary to 
the proper realisation of the facts under consideration. 
There is a number of maps which must almost of 
necessity be drawn by pupils—Anglo-Saxon England, the 
dominions of Edward III and Henry V in France, Scot- 
land to illustrate the Edwardian wars, England to illustrate 
the Civil War. But many others will suggest themselves 
both in English and in general history. For local 
history, too, maps are important, as they help to make 
the pupil acquainted with his own town and district. One 
suggestion may be offered in regard to maps which illus- 
trate a continuous narrative, such as that of a military 
campaign. Instead of making the entire map at one sitting, 
the pupil should be allowed to build it up as he goes along. 
Thus in making a map to illustrate England during the 
Civil War, the outline alone should first be drawn, and 
then, when the various campaigns are learnt, the places 
mentioned in each should be inserted, for it will be quite 
legitimate to interrupt a lesson for the purpose of putting 
in the name of a place that has some bearing on the 
narrative. 
Map exercises are very numerous, and can be used at 
the discretion of the teacher. Besides general maps, we 
can have special local maps to illustrate certain campaigns,
-P-A-G-E-53
Historical Exercises 45 
plans of battles, plans of towns and districts for local 
history, and compound maps to illustrate comparisons. 
Of the latter type we may suggest such exercises as the 
following :—Show on one map the different parts of France 
held by our mediaeval kings, or, from a table of statistics 
show which counties of England gained members and which 
lost members under the Reform Act of 1832. 
After map exercises we come to other forms of the 
historical exercise. The question of source-work has be- 
come one of great interest at the present time, so much so 
that it demands a separate chapter to itself. Then there 
are modified forms of source-work which are useful. A few 
examples may be quoted. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 
gives in considerable fullness the names of the places raided 
in various years by the Danes; a list of these may be given 
to the class, and with the names and dates before him, 
the pupil may be asked to produce either a composition 
or a map on the subject of Danish encroachments in 
England. A study of the genealogical trees of the royal 
families may be made the basis for a series of questions on 
the succession—When has the hereditary succession been 
broken? When has female succession influenced the descent 
of the crown? Compare the value of the Yorkist and 
Lancastrian claims. An account of the battle of Waterloo 
may be written from the point of view of one of the 
combatants by the aid of a large-scale map of the battle- 
field. 
It is impossible to mention all the varieties of exercise 
which can be utilised in the history class, but a few sugges- 
tions may be made which will no doubt lead to others. A 
great quantity of work is provided in the study of the feudal 
village. The land system provides scope for a map of the 
common fields. A lesson on feudal tenures opens up an
-P-A-G-E-54
RE re ee 
46 The Teaching of History 
opportunity for the construction of a rent-roll of an 
imaginary manor; the names of imaginary tenants may be 
put down in a list, their status as socman, tenant by knight 
service, tenant by petty serjeanty, villein, may be indicated, 
and their rents or services put down in another column. 
In connection with the military system of feudalism, we 
can construct orders for the assembly of the military tenants, 
and notices of the place of marshalling; the local law- 
court will allow of more exercises in composition, summaries 
of plea-rolls, lists of fines, notices of days of meeting, and 
so forth. The position of the Church may suggest other 
exercises; minutes of proceedings at an arrest of a local 
“cleric” by a lay official, notes on a quarrel about the pre- 
sentation to the living of the parish, instructions for the 
collection of ecclesiastical levies and taxes. If, in the course 
of a short series of lessons, junior pupils can be got to 
appreciate in this manner the characteristic incidents in the 
life of a feudal manor, much will have been done towards 
the acquisition of the spirit of history. 
Let us take another subject—the Revolution of 1689. 
We may devise all sorts of letters, from King James to 
Tyrconnel, from Tyrconnel to James, from Sir Edward 
Hales to his coachman, from Hough to Compton, from 
Judge Jeffreys to Father Petre. Then we can have a sketch- 
map showing William of Orange’s advance on London, a 
genealogical table of the royal personages concerned, and a 
chronological table of the chief events of the Revolution. 
Proclamations in favour of King James II, William of 
Orange and Monmouth may be composed, the various 
suggestions for the settlement of the crown and the distri- 
bution of royal power set forth and analysed, and the various 
reforming changes brought about in the succeeding years 
by Act of Parliament summarised and tabulated. An
-P-A-G-E-55
  Historical Exercises 47 
analysis and: commentary on the Bill of Rights may be made 
to occupy one or more lessons according to taste. 
Another example may be given. The subject under con- 
sideration is the Crimean War. First there are the maps, 
including the Black Sea area, the Crimean peninsula and 
the environs of Sebastopol. A detailed plan of the Redan 
can be made, and then may form the basis for a descrip- 
tion written by one of the British soldiers who stormed it. 
A series of bulletins and despatches can be constructed, 
illustrative of the progress of the winter siege, leading 
articles may be written condemning or defending the 
Government at home. A composition may be set asking 
for a comparison of the Sebastopol siege with the siege of 
the Dardanelles fortifications in 1915, and an abstract of 
the Treaty of Paris may be made. 
The foregoing examples have been introduced merely 
to illustrate the various sorts of exercise which can be set 
in the course of a series of English history lessons. The 
same sort of thing will be done in European history lessons, 
where there are similar opportunities for work of varied 
character. No better idea of the extent of the Roman 
Empire can be gained than from the following exercise:— 
An outline map of the Roman Empire is compared with a 
modern map of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin; the 
class is then directed to make a list of all the modern 
countries of Europe which have once formed, either entirely 
or in part, provinces of the Roman Empire. Again, a few 
extracts from the historical portion of Machiavelli’s “Prince” 
may form the basis of exercises on the condition of Italy at 
the end of the Middle Ages. It may also be remarked 
that short passages from this book form excellent “texts” 
upon which illustrative history compositions of a general 
character can be set in senior forms. As an illustration
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 The Teaching of History 
of the variety of exercises to be obtained in this sphere we 
may quote a few that have been used in connection with 
the “year of Revolutions,” 1848. A series of despatches, 
sent from each of the capitals of France, Prussia, Austria, 
Sardinia and Naples, may be constructed to illustrate what 
was passing in those places, a letter may be written “from 
Metternich in exile to Prince William of Prussia in exile,” 
and an idealised map of the “free peoples of the Austro- 
Hungarian confederation” can be drawn. 
In fact, the teacher of history will find it advantageous 
to keep his eyes always open for opportunities for effective 
exercises of one sort or another. Yet he must never rush 
at new ideas merely for the sake of novelty; the good old- 
fashioned composition must still take a prominent place in 
the work, and care must be exercised that the work done 
does have some real effect upon the historical knowledge of 
the pupils. Variation and novelty must, as always, serve as 
a means to an end, not as an end in themselves.
-P-A-G-E-57
B. SOURCES 
Ove of the most recent developments in history teaching 
has been the study of historical sources. In the course of 
the past fifteen years several books have appeared con- 
taining series of extracts from records and documents 
intended for use in schools. This branch of our subject has 
been specially promoted in a number of American schools, 
and there also exists in this country a school of teachers 
who have been made converts to the method of elementary 
research. Now although there is much to be said for this 
method, like everything else it has been overdone in some 
quarters, and it is necessary to go beneath the surface of 
the subject and ascertain the basis on which it rests. 
First it is urged that the source method gives an insight 
into the methods by which history has been built up. 
This is undoubtedly true. Secondly it is argued that the 
study of sources and the extraction of information therefrom 
exercises the brain in a very effective manner. This also is 
true. Thirdly it is said that if we use source-work in lan- 
guages when we adopt the foreign dictionary, and in 
geography when we study maps, we should likewise adopt 
the same system in history. 
It will be seen, however, on consideration, that the last 
argument is somewhat fallacious, What are the methods 
pursued when we use the dictionary and the atlas? The 
dictionary is the final product of the labours of a large 
number of individuals who, delving among the original 
material of the language in question, eventually bring forth, 
separated, sorted, classified and polished, a more or less 
A. 4

50 The Teaching of History 
complete list of the words in use in the language under con- 
sideration. The atlas, again, is the final product of the 
labours of another large collection of individuals who, 
starting with the original soil, rivers, hills, seas and towns, 
eventually reduce their manifold observations to an orderly 
and harmonious whole in the shape of a map. When a boy 
or girl turns to the dictionary to discover the meaning of 
some Latin or French word, it is not a case of original 
research but of utilising the research of a considerable 
number of other people. When the atlas or the large-scale 
map is set as the basis of a geographical exercise, no research 
work is being done in the true sense of the term, for the 
source of the information discovered in this way is the 
result of the compound efforts and labour of a thousand and 
one surveyors and cartographers. 
Very different is the method pursued by the historical 
source-worker. He takes as his pabulum a few absolutely 
original documents, and except for the services of the tran- 
scriber and the printer he is indebted to no one for any 
organisation of the facts. Sometimes spelling is simplified 
or a foreign tongue translated, but the document remains 
essentially what it was at first, a bedrock source. From this 
source the pupil is asked to build up a certain small 
fragment of history. The work really resembles rather the 
tackling of a difficult “unseen” than the simple dictionary- 
method, rather a taste of elementary surveying than of map- 
reading. The historical document presents only one tiny 
glimpse into the past, it resembles the photograph of some 
particular view, and though some documents (such as 
the Grand Remonstrance of 1641) like views taken from 
mountain-tops, embrace larger areas of history than others, 
the majority only illuminate and illustrate certain special 
incidents and episodes. The true comparison with dictionary 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  Sources 51 
and map work would be found when not the source-book 
but the history text-book forms the subject of research, for 
here as in the other cases the pupil is using the combined 
results of the labour of many historical students and writers. 
But just as an experience of elementary surveying is 
good in a geography course, and “unseens” are useful in a 
Latin course, so may source-work be said to fulfil a useful 
purpose ina school history course. It is only the extreme 
claims of the source-book enthusiasts that must be put aside; 
they would like to make school history teaching mainly a 
matter of exercises on original authorities, and this is going 
too far—tfar too far. An exercise based on a contemporary 
document may be occasionally useful, the reading of an 
extract from some contemporary work or document may be 
often advantageous, but it is not desirable, either from the 
point of view of time, of the difficulties of archaic and legal 
language, or of the scrappy and fragmentary nature of such 
a course, to base our teaching on the system. 
A few examples of the good use to which the source-book 
method may occasionally be put will now be considered. 
In the “ Ancient Laws and Institutes of England,” edited by 
Benjamin Thorpe, will be found a number of extracts from 
some of the laws written down in the days of Alfred. These 
laws, some of which have been quoted in one or two recent 
sourcé-books, provide a rough table of “bots” or compen- 
sations for physical injuries sustained by assault. These 
may be worked out in a tariff by the class, and an exercise 
may be set on the reasons for the severity of some of the 
fines and on the justice or otherwise of the comparative 
“bots.” Similar exercises may be set on other extracts from 
this very interesting work, notably on the subject of ordeals, 
which never fails to elicit eager commentaries from pupils. 
Nothing, perhaps, will give one a better idea of the low state 
4—2
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 The Teaching of History 
of civilisation of the English of the early Middle Ages than 
the reading of the laws and regulations contained in this 
book. 
Domesday Book provides us with a very large amount 
of material for source-work. It is, however, remarkable how 
few teachers avail themselves of the published translations 
of the various sections of this wonderful historical document. 
If the pages dealing with the particular locality, in which 
the school in question stands, be sought out and copied 
down, it will generally be found that the teacher is pro- 
vided with quite a quantity of excellent material for in- 
teresting source-work. It is even worth while spending as 
much as a dozen lessons on the local survey, for besides 
stimulating interest in local history it will give an un- 
commonly good opportunity for an appreciation of some of 
the elementary facts relative to mediaeval society. 
The life and death of Thomas Becket always forms an 
attractive subject for school-pupils. Here we have a very 
remote historical episode on which we happen to be par- 
ticularly well informed. In the Rolls Series we shall find a 
number of large volumes containing a selection of “Materials 
for the History of Archbishop Becket,” and, though the 
investigator will have to translate from the Latin, a number 
of quotations may be obtained to lay before classes. Asa 
summary of the series of events which led to the murder, 
the chapter on Becket in Dean Stanley’s “Memorials of 
Canterbury” forms an excellent guide. Incidentally it may 
be observed that the subject of Becket makes an admirable 
subject for a school historical play—and there are really 
very few such suitable incidents for dramatisation in the 
earlier period of the Middle Ages. 
Magna Carta provides an almost endless series of exer- 
cises on a variety of constitutional points. The Church,
-P-A-G-E-61
  Sources 53 
scutage, justice, reliefs, wardship and marriage, the position 
of the Jews, the mediaeval parliament, merchants, London, 
in fact a vast number of subjects crops up here for discussion 
and illustration. One firm of publishers has recently under- 
taken a cheap reprint of Magna Carta, along with other 
important documents of English History, and, with the aid 
of the very full and scholarly monograph of McKechnie, 
it should be possible for the teacher to devise a great number 
of varying exercises on this subject. Hitherto the great 
majority of school text-books have slavishly followed the 
old traditional ideas of Magna Carta as a “bulwark of 
popular liberty”; it is really necessary that a senior class 
should have an opportunity of looking through the docu- 
ment and seeing what sort of a charter it really was. It 
will not do merely to tell our pupils that the old conception 
of Magna Carta was wrong, they must be made to see, by 
a perusal of the document itself, that it was wrong. 
To break into the realms of poetic literature, the 
Prologue to Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” provides some 
excellent and well-known portraits of typical characters of 
the laterfourteenth century. These extracts, whether merely 
read to a class or used as the basis for exercises, may be 
profitably combined with other extracts from the more or 
less contemporary “Piers Plowman” of Langland. Later 
mediaeval poems of historical significance may be found in 
Wright’s “Political Poems,” and in the various publications 
of the Percy Society. 
More’s “Utopia” provides several extracts which can be 
used as bases for questions and exercises, particularly those 
passages relating to the development of sheep-farming and 
the decay of agriculture, while there is also a lengthy and 
instructive passage relative to the foreign policy of France 
and some of the other States of Western Europe. The en-
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 The Teaching of History 
closure question may also be illustrated by a well-known 
sermon of Latimer’s, and other extracts from contemporary 
writers may be found. in the pages of our various modern 
source-books. For the later Tudor period there is the excel- 
lent series of documents reprinted and edited by Prothero, 
continued into the Stuart period; and this is followed up 
by Gardiner’s volume of documents relative to the reign of 
Charles I and the period of the Commonwealth. 
“Cromwell’s Letters and Speeches,” edited by Carlyle, is 
another well-known collection of original sources, and may 
be frequently used for exercises of this description; these 
volumes are now published in a cheap series, whilst it is also 
now possible to obtain cheaply the Memoirs of Colonel 
Hutchinson and an abridgement of Bishop Burnet’s “ History 
of his Own Time.” An almost endless list might be given of 
readily-obtainable volumes of original authority, while the 
various source-books and series of source-books ought most 
certainly to find a place in the school historical library. If 
access can be gained to Wellington’s “Despatches” and 
Napoleon I’s “Correspondence” much interesting material 
may be collected for school source-work. 
The above illustrations will sufficiently indicate the 
variety of work that can be obtained from the use of sources; 
it must still always be borne in mind that such works must 
be kept in subordination to the main course of the syllabus. 
It will be found that there are very few original 
authorities that can with any satisfaction be laid before a 
class of junior pupils. Even older ones are often perplexed 
by the obscurity of the legal language in which the more 
formal documents are couched and by the archaic or un- 
familiar words that make their appearance in the records of 
earlier centuries. It will often be found advisable to simplify 
the language considerably and to strike out whole passages
-P-A-G-E-63
Sources 55 
as being incomprehensible, dull or irrelevant, though care 
must be taken that this sort of informal editing does not 
alter the real meaning of the original words or help to con- 
vey a false impression; an indiscreet erasure of important 
passages and statements may alter the meaning of an extract 
as completely as Bismarck’s blue pencil altered the meaning 
of the Ems telegram. 
The same sort of occasional exercise on sources may be 
given in European history lessons. Here the original sources 
are harder to get at, though a start has already been made 
by the publication both of collections of documents relating 
to European history and of history books of European 
scope which contain extracts from contemporary writers. 
Within a year from the outbreak of the great European 
war in 1914 there appeared, for instance, a really excellent 
collection of documents relative to the European history 
of the last century, particularly to those events leading 
up to the outbreak of the great German war. There were, 
at the same time, the various White, Green and Orange 
Books of the Governments at war, providing excellent 
material for eliciting facts from records. 
The foregoing suggestions relate entirely to original 
authorities, but there is another form of source-work that 
is extremely profitable. This is where the source of informa- 
tion used is not a first-hand authority, but the work of later 
writers and historians. This corresponds more closely to 
geographical map-work than does the exercise on original 
authorities. Let us take a few examples of this kind of thing. 
First there is the simpler form of exercise in which each pupil 
does the same work. Some well-known and easily accessible 
historical author is cited, and the pupils are given a fortnight 
or so to “get up” certain pages. As an example of such an 
exercise, Macaulay’s essay on Clive may be chosen, or a
-P-A-G-E-64
56 The Teaching of History 
selection from Cromwell’s Letters, and a chapter of Froude’s 
History. From the detailed narrative obtained here the 
pupils are asked either to write up an abstract, or to answer 
certain special questions on the work thus done. The dis- 
advantage of this method is that when the available number 
of copies of the book in question is small, much time will 
have to be allowed in the preparation of the work for the 
volumes to be passed on from pupil to pupil. 
Another and perhaps better method is to work on the 
following lines. The teacher makes a list of books relating 
to some particular historical subject—the Peninsular War, 
the loss of the American colonies, or the Revolution of 1689. 
Having done this, he allots passages in each of these volumes 
for the perusal of various members of the class, and then 
asks for a written résumé of the work each pupil has done. 
Several lessons can then be devoted to building up a his- 
torical summary of the episodes under investigation in con- 
cert with the class, using only the material supplied by the 
class. 
A variation on the above method has been attempted 
at times with rather good results. Using the advantages 
offered by the proximity of a good public library, the older 
pupils may be told to look up the actual records of a debate 
in the House of Commons on some particular subject, the 
American War, the Reform Bill, the Corn Laws. The 
teacher will, of course, first make himself acquainted with 
the debate, and will allot parts to the pupils who are to 
look up materials; he will decide upon what speeches shall 
be prepared by the individual members of the class. Each 
pupil will then read up in the records the speech allotted 
to him, and, after making an abstract of notes, will prepare 
the same speech in miniature to be delivered from his notes. 
When the work has been all prepared, the “debate” is held;
-P-A-G-E-65
  
Sources 57 
the “members” rise one after the other in the historical 
order and a rough representation of the discussion in ques- 
tion is thus provided. Needless to say, the amount of trouble 
and work required for the preparation of a piece of work 
like this forbids its adoption more than once or twice in a 
school year. 
There is yet another form of source-work which can be 
used in schools, which is at once the most pretentious, the 
most interesting, and the most time- absorbing. It can only 
be managed by those teachers who have the time and the 
patience to devote a part of their holidays or spare time to 
research work. This is nothing less than to build up a 
piece of history from all available historical authorities. 
Now the selection of a suitable topic will give rise to some 
perplexity, for we must take something about which there 
is neither a dearth nor a superfluity of records. For instance, 
if we chose the mission of St Augustine we could write 
down all our available materials in a very short space, while 
if we selected the Repeal of the Corn Laws or the siege of 
Sebastopol we should never be able to cope with a quarter 
of the sources at hand in our libraries. It is better to choose 
some definite episode, and not a continued series of episodes, 
rather the last year of Becket’s life than the story of 
Henry II’s relations with Becket, rather the battle of Mar- 
ston Moor and its preceding military operations than the 
Civil War in 1644, rather the Gordon riots than the story 
of Catholic emancipation. The more spread out the subject 
chosen the more numeréus and difficult to hit on will be 
our original authorities. When an episode has been selected, 
and one of some real historical importance should be taken, 
the teacher will take up the task of the historical investi- 
gator and will search out, copy, or translate all the relevant 
material he can lay hands on. The work is interesting, but
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 The Teaching of History 
consumes a great amount of time, and it would be well if 
any teacher who carries out a piece of work of this descrip- 
tion would endeavour to secure the permanent benefit of his 
labours by the publication of the documents and extracts 
thus collected. 
When a collection of this sort has been got together, it 
is best that the documents should be copied out for the 
hectograph or cyclostyle duplicator, so that each pupil of 
the class should be able to have a copy. From the sources 
thus presented the history of the episodes chosen can be 
built up at first-hand, and scope is given for a series of very 
interesting lessons in the methods of obtaining the truth 
about the past. Of course, these lessons must not occupy 
too much time, and the work done should also if possible 
fit in with the general programme of work set out in the 
syllabus adopted by the teacher. 
We have thus briefly surveyed the possibilities contained 
in source-work, and it is evident that there is much to be 
done with this type of exercise. It will by no means, how- 
ever, be considered advisable to adopt the extreme claims 
of the source-book enthusiasts and make our lessons nothing 
more than a long series of exercises on original authorities. 
Like many other special methods, it can be followed up 
ad nauseam, and a class will make far more progress on a 
balanced syllabus than on one which is too heavily weighted 
in one particular direction.
-P-A-G-E-67
C. DRAMATISED HISTORY 
Ir is remarkable to what a small extent history teachers 
have hitherto availed themselves of opportunities for using 
dramatic work as an aid to the teaching of their subject. 
In those schools in which dramatic work is attempted, it 
usually forms part of the training in literature or in the 
English language; but as a means of assisting and en- 
couraging the study of history it has great possibilities. 
There is a very general complaint among pupils that 
continuous application to the text-book and the exercise 
becomes dull. It is true that when the novelty of a new form 
of exercise or of a new text-book has worn off, the interest 
of some members of a class is bound to show signs of flagging. 
It will be said that a first-rate teacher will not allow this 
reaction to take place, that by his energies and his enthu- 
siasm for his work he will keep his classes up to the mark all 
through the year, that a slackening of interest will be a 
token of partial failure, and so on. But the teacher need 
not altogether reproach himself if something of this sort 
makes itself apparent in his classes. A young teacher will 
often become quite mortified and embittered if he finds his 
enthusiastic efforts treated with scant respect and no grati- 
tude by his less industrious pupils, but even the best of 
teachers has difficulties which he cannot get over but which 
he has to get round as best he can. 
A really serious study of history is quite difficult for 
younger pupils, and even in the senior forms the more 
scientific aspect of the subject can only be tackled with an 
effort on the part of many boys and girls. It has been even
-P-A-G-E-68
60 The Teaching of History 
argued that the real importance of historical matter varies in 
inverse proportion to the amount of superficial interest it 
evokes. It need only be remembered that our pupils nearly 
always prefer those pages of history which deal with the 
petty detailsof biographies, military actions and social habits 
and customs. An average class will be keenly inquisitive as 
to the personal peculiarities of Becket, Queen Elizabeth or 
Napoleon, without showing the remotest desire to enquire 
into their influence on the people of their country or the 
world in general. The reason why Crecy and Agincourt are 
better remembered than Halidon Hill and La Rochelle is 
that the former are usually given in our text-books in full 
and picturesque detail while the latter are at best dismissed 
in a couple of lines. The games.and table manners of the 
Middle Ages are remembered long after the Guild System 
and the Curia Regis have faded from our pupils’ minds. 
This interest in the trivial can hardly be blamed; it is 
quite natural that the mind should be attracted mainly by 
those things which can be readily visualised, and that the 
broader conceptions of history should make comparatively 
little impression. We must utilise to the fullest extent the 
power of attraction possessed by the trivial. While keeping 
guard against introducing picturesque trivialities as an end 
in themselves, the teacher will do well to play upon them, 
especially with younger pupils, in order to lead up to and 
illustrate the more important factors in history. 
At the present time there is little use made of dramatised 
history in our schools, The main reason for this is, perhaps, 
that lessons in which the pupils move about the room and 
act require a good deal more skilful organisation and 
management than lessons in which the class remains at the 
desks. It is not every teacher that can manage a lesson of 
this sort without allowing the additional freedom of move-
-P-A-G-E-69
  Dramatised History 61 
ment and action to degenerate into disorder and breaches 
of discipline. Another reason is the extraordinary dearth 
of good historical plays suitable for boys and girls. The 
Shakespearian dramas, and those classic historical plays 
which appeal to adults, are usually too difficult in language 
and ideas for young pupils to understand, whilst the poetic 
dramatist rarely adheres very closely to historical accuracy. 
Though the great Duke of Marlborough is supposed to 
have got all the history he ever knew from Shakespeare’s 
plays, they are not very satisfactory sources for the modern 
student. 
The best historical school-plays are those which are 
more or less extemporised; the class discusses the possibility 
of acting a little scene to illustrate some point connected 
with its history lessons, it then discusses what characters 
are to be introduced, what they are to do, and what speeches 
are to be made. It is impossible to indicate in greater 
detail the way in which the crude idea of a bit of historical 
acting will develop into the finished article—a properly 
constructed scene or set of scenes acted by the class. As 
far as possible the scenes should be written by the pupils 
themselves, and if the teacher who wishes to experiment in 
this direction is in need of suggestions, he may be referred 
to Mr Caldwell Cook’s “ Play Way” and to the section on 
Dramatised History in “The New Teaching” edited by 
Professor John Adams. 
Before leaving this topic, it may not be considered 
as exceeding the limits of our subject if we revert for a 
moment to the question of Shakespeare’s “ Histories” as 
suitable subjects for historical acting. Although the plays 
of Shakespeare are frequently acted by school pupils, and 
the staging of Shakespeare is rightly considered a mark 
of good taste in the school teacher, it may perhaps be
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 The Teaching of History 
doubted if the acting of these poetic works has as much 
really good effect on the pupils who act them and listen to 
them as on the “parents and guardians” who are sometimes 
fortunate enough to be admitted to witness the final produc- 
tions. The genuine appreciation of the wonderful, unparal- 
leled dramatic poetry of William Shakespeare can only 
come from a highly developed and imaginative mind. What 
steps can be taken to inculcate a taste for such works as 
his plays must be decided upon by those who have devoted 
their attention to specialising in the teaching of English 
literature, but for the purposes of a history course it 
must be said that Shakespeare’s plays cannot be used effec- 
tively except in the very highest forms. The difficulty of 
the phraseology, the obsoleté and rare words, the poetic 
digressions and metaphorical allusions of the Shakespearian 
play are altogether above the average pupil of middle and 
lower forms, and it is a mistake to try and force him to 
grapple with these things. Such an effort may perhaps be 
called for in the literature class, where the works of our 
great writers are being dealt with for their own sakes, but 
in the history class, where the play is used as a means to 
an end, there are few passages that can be quoted at length 
without such copious explanation and comment as will lead 
us to outrun the time at our disposal. And when we come 
to consider the advisability, not merely of quoting them, 
but of acting them, the same remarks apply with even greater 
force. To attempt to simplify or alter their language would, 
of course, be a piece of literary vandalism which could not 
be tolerated for a moment. 
The possibilities which lie behind the adoption of some 
attempts at the dramatisation of history have now been 
briefly indicated. The work demands the utmost attention 
of the teacher, and will prove one more source.of the
-P-A-G-E-71
Dramatised History 63 
invasion of his time. If it cannot be done with real 
enthusiasm and energy on the part of the teacher, it had 
best not be done at all. But for those whose bent lies 
somewhat in the direction of the drama, it will prove one 
of the most interesting and pleasant parts of the history 
course, and we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that, 
whilst giving rise to a very considerable amount of pleasure 
to all who are concerned in the work, we shall also be most 
decidedly contributing to the consolidation of the historical 
knowledge of our pupils, and to the stimulation and 
development of a further interest in history. 
In concluding this chapter it may be as well to note 
that there are quite a number of good historical plays 
going the round of British theatres. Some of these plays 
are of long standing, others are new, and there will doubtless 
be some good new ones brought out ‘each year. The 
teacher’s all-devouring intelligence department should take 
cognisance of these, and, when the school happens to lie 
within easy reach of the theatre, arrangements can usually 
be made with the manager for the admission of a party of 
pupils at reduced rates, an opportunity which should be 
used by the teacher and by as many of the pupils as can 
afford the necessary expense.

D. LOCAL HISTORY 
Ir has been mentioned that it is desirable to include in a 
school course a certain number of lessons on local history, 
lessons which are fittingly introduced into the syllabus for 
middle forms. Now local history may be utilised in 
several ways. In the first place we can attempt to trace 
the development of the particular city, town or county in 
which we happen to find our school situated, outlining its 
progress as a unit of local government. Secondly we can 
find out what incidents of more national importance have 
taken place in the neighbourhood and devote some time to 
the description of them. Thirdly we can illustrate our larger 
national history by references to what actually or putatively 
happened in one particular district. All three of these 
methods are useful from the point of view of the teacher. 
There will naturally be a very great difference in the 
opportunities for the study of local history in different 
parts of the country. If a school is situated in an old city 
or town rich in historical incidents and records, such a place 
as London, Canterbury, York, Norwich, Bristol or Exeter, 
there will be a plenitude of materials on which to draw for 
lessons ; if on the other hand the school is situated in a 
small town of little historical importance, or in the middle 
of some rural district, there will be a dearth of such 
materials. There are some places which may be said to 
have virtually no local history. Again, there are some 
parts of the Kingdom which, owing to their remoteness 
from the centres of agricultural, industrial and commercial 
activity have been little affected by the great upheavals of
-P-A-G-E-73
  Local History 65 
history and have witnessed no great national events in 
their immediate neighbourhood. In cases of this sort we 
shall have to fall back almost entirely on the third method, 
for no matter where our school is situated, it will be found 
to have been in some degree affected by those greater 
movements which pervaded the whole nation, movements 
like the Reformation and the Civil War, the Industrial 
Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution. 
There is a variety of material to be found in libraries 
for the study of local history. There is usually a fair 
number of books on the subject, some old and some new. 
For some counties there is the Victoria County History. 
Almost every shire in England has its collection of topo- 
graphical and historical volumes. Then there will be 
more detailed books on particular cities and towns. It 
will nearly always be found that there exist maps of the 
district in past times; some towns and counties are par- 
ticularly rich in this respect. .An examination of the 
catalogues of local libraries supplemented by consultation 
with the librarians will often bring to light much useful 
material. There is also, for most parts of England, 
Domesday Book, which should certainly not be neglected. 
A word may be said as to the use of local guide-books. 
These are of very varying standards of value; a few have 
been compiled with genuine attention to historical authen- 
ticity, but by far the larger number bear the marks of 
having been hastily and carelessly written up for the sole 
purpose of providing something superficially interesting 
for the ordinary tourist irrespective of authenticity or 
accuracy. For the purposes of school work, the popular 
local guide-book may very well be taken as a starting-point, 
provided that the teacher takes care to verify its statements 
and correct its errors. on A.
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 The Teaching of History 
From the authorities mentioned above it will be possible 
for the teacher to prepare a series of lessons on local 
history. If the school is situated in a town, the pupils 
should know how that town has grown, or in a few cases 
shrunk, to what date the various quarters of the town can 
be assigned, the age and history of the celebrated buildings, 
the history of the organisation for local government, the 
names and careers of the local celebrities. In connection 
with this last subject, there is another field for work opened 
up. In a junior biographical course room should most 
certainly be found for the lives of men and women of the 
locality who have distinguished themselves in national 
history, and also for the lives of others who have by their 
actions brought fame to the particular locality in which 
the pupils reside. 
Great national events which have taken place in our 
own district should be treated in some detail, and perhaps 
may be studied on the actual ground on which they took 
place. Thus the pupils of schools in and near the city of 
York should be made acquainted with as many details as 
possible of the battles of Stamford Bridge, Towton and 
Marston Moor; the pupils of schools in Bristol should 
learn particularly about the setting forth of John Cabot, 
of the siege of 1643, and of the Reform Bill riots. 
Thirdly there is the presumptive or authentic local 
history which can be deduced from the great movements 
of the national history. Even if there is a scarcity of 
material for other sorts of local history, even if there are 
no materials available at all, it should still be possible to 
give quite a long series of lessons of this sort. Every part 
of southern Britain must have felt the presence of the 
Romans, most of the English counties must have seen 
severe fighting when the Jutes, Angles and Saxons came
-P-A-G-E-75
  Local History 67 
here. Again, the preaching of the Christian missionaries 
must have been heard in every district, and the ravages of 
the Northmen too must have been felt almost everywhere. 
All these events can be made to fit in with a course of 
local history, and if authentic local facts can be obtained to 
illustrate these movements, so much the better. 
The feudal organisation presents the next means of 
illustrating local developments ; we can trace the probable 
effects of feudalism in our own locality. Then there are 
the Crusades, which probably drew at least one or two 
volunteers from the neighbourhood, while it may be that 
we are situated on an estate belonging once to some great 
baron who rebelled against his royal suzerain. The Livery 
system probably had its effect locally, and the Wars of the 
Roses may usually be found to affect the neighbourhood 
in some way or other. Coming to more modern times, we 
have the various changes of the Reformation, and later on 
the great struggle between Anglican and Puritan. The 
Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution, the 
agitation for Democracy and the reform of local govern- 
ment will also be found to affect every part of the realm. 
Some places are fortunate enough to possess in their 
neighbourhood a castle or an abbey either in a good state 
of preservation or in ruins. These survivals from the past 
should be utilised to the utmost. If possible, maps should 
be drawn to illustrate the arrangement of the buildings 
at the time they enjoyed their palmiest days; models 
of them may even be constructed. The monastery, with 
its chapel and dining-hall, its buttery and bakery, its 
dormitories and scriptorium, may be made to live again; 
the same may be done with the castle; keep, inner ward, ° 
outer ward, flanking towers, moat, portcullis and draw- 
bridge may be reconstructed from the surviving remains.

  68 The Teaching of History 
The manner in which the castle or the religious house 
affected the life of the surrounding district may also be 
indicated. 
Of course those schools which are situated in the 
metropolis enjoy an advantage in respect to local history 
higher than those of any other place. Yet there is a special 
problem connected with the history of London which only 
presents itself elsewhere when the town in which a school 
is situated is of very large size indeed. As there are some 
thousands of teachers who are giving instruction in history 
in London, it may be worth while to turn for a moment 
to consider the problem in relation to this great city. 
London is so vast a place as to suggest rather a collec- 
tion of towns than a single city. It spreads for miles in 
every direction around the little city of the Middle Ages. 
People living at one extremity of it are often in total 
ignorance of the quarters at the other end, and even of the 
central districts too. A century ago, the local history of 
places like Hampstead, Tottenham, Bow, Woolwich, 
Sydenham, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Paddington 
would have been quite distinct from the local history of 
London, for London was a more or less remote city whilst 
these places were country- villages or towns. But at the 
present day these places all form part, if not of the County 
of London, at least of what we term Greater London, and 
their inhabitants would not dream of calling themselves 
by any other local name than Londoners. As Londoners 
they naturally claim the history of London as that of 
their own homes. It will therefore be advisable and almost 
necessary to teach the history of the City of London to 
pupils in districts which are in many cases some miles away 
from the old municipal boundaries, and to pupils who have 
in many cases never been to the City or to Westminster at
-P-A-G-E-77
Local History 69 
all. Only a few years ago, at an elementary school in the 
north of the Borough of Lambeth, the pupils were given 
a series of questions on their personal migrations. It was 
found that more than a score had never crossed over to the 
north side of the Thames, and that three had never even 
seen that river, though it flowed within four hundred yards 
of the school in question. 
Our difficulties in a case like this are very great. In 
the first place it is necessary to make our pupils acquainted 
with the topography of the central parts of London as 
they stand at the present day. It will be worth while 
to set up a little correlation between the history and the 
geography classes in this respect. Geography teachers do 
frequently overlook the claims of local topography, largely 
perhaps because the modern development of scientific 
geography teaching has placed mere topographical de- 
scription at a discount. If the pupil could get some topo- 
graphical knowledge of central London in his geography 
lessons it would be a great help to the study of local 
history as well as an advantage for its own sake. Of course 
maps will be frequently drawn to illustrate the growth of 
the city at various periods, and the leading thoroughfares 
may be marked on these maps. Also, when a school visit 
is made to any building or place of interest or to any 
central theatre, care must be taken to point out the main 
streets through which the class may happen to go. 
Thus for the London teacher local history has a double 
significance, the history of the parish or the borough and 
the history of the City and of central London. The 
latter, of course, provides an endless theme for lessons, and 
may frequently be illustrated by maps, pictures and school 
visits to places of historical interest in the central districts 
of the metropolis.
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 The Teaching of History 
There is another aspect of local history that may be 
remarked. This is the study of street-names; often a 
most enlightening study. A large percentage of our town 
street-names have an historical significance. In the old 
central parts of an historical borough they indicate in many 
cases the topographical features of the mediaeval town. 
In London we have Cheapside, the Old Bailey, the Poultry, 
Fleet Street, the Strand, Northumberland Avenue and 
Bankside as examples; in Leeds we have the Briggate, 
Kirkgate Marsh, and the Calls; in Nottingham we have 
Greyfriars Gate, Fletcher Gate, Chapel Bar and Lean Side; 
in Edinburgh we have the Canongate, the Lawn Market, and 
Candlemaker Row. There is another large section of street- 
names that commemorates local worthies and national 
celebrities, while the names of modern battles and sieges 
like Waterloo, Alma, Sebastopol and Ladysmith usually 
indicate the period at which the streets so named were 
built. 
In connection with local history we may deal with the 
subject of school visits. It is good to arrange an occasional 
visit to some place of historical importance, a castle, church, 
abbey or museum. The number of pupils under the direc- 
tion of a single teacher should not be too large, one class 
at a time will usually be found enough. These school visits, 
like everything else connected with teaching, require con- 
siderable and careful preparation. It is not enough to take 
the class round the run of sights and extemporise remarks 
on them. The teacher should first make the excursion 
himself and arrange exactly what things are going to be 
seen, find out all he can about them, and make up his 
mind what he will say about them. Some teachers will 
prefer to reserve all remarks of this sort until the actual 
excursion or visit, but it will appear to some more satis-
-P-A-G-E-79
  Local History vA 
factory to prepare a short series of notes beforehand and 
to let the class have these and discuss them before the visit 
is made. Sometimes, with an older class it may even seem 
good to allow individual pupils to attempt the talking and 
explaining, while the teacher merely corrects and adds and 
summarises. Again, the work should not end with the visit; 
a composition or summary of what has been seen should 
most certainly form the usual sequel of a school visit. 
Otherwise the impression made will be somewhat unsub- 
stantial and fleeting. Finally it may be pointed out that 
on no account should an historical excursion be looked on 
as a mere “ outing” for purposes of amusement, especially 
if it is carried out in school hours; it must be considered 
by both teacher and pupils as a regular working lesson, 
although more or less in partibus. 
The study of local history is of real importance, and 
should most certainly find some space, however small, in 
the school history syllabus. For besides bringing home 
to the pupil in vivid fashion the various historical move- 
ments which have affected the nation, it lends an air of 
interest and romance to otherwise dull and colourless local 
surroundings, and it helps to bring home to the pupil, by 
everyday contact with historical scenes, names and buildings, 
the sense of the development which his country has under- 
gone, and removes his thoughts from time to time away 
from the present to the contemplation of ages that are 
passed.
-P-A-G-E-80
E. EUROPEAN AND GENERAL HISTORY 
Ir local history may be considered a fitting accompani- 
ment to the middle-form course of English history, 
European and general history will be most conveniently 
taught in conjunction with the more scientific course of 
the upper forms. It has already been pointed out how 
essential it is that some lessons on European history should 
be introduced into the school course and also that such 
lessons should be kept as far as possible separate from the 
English history lessons. Now the question that will 
immediately arise is, How much general history shall we 
teach? The vastness of the subject has in fact terrified 
many teachers into refusing to touch it at all; it has been 
relegated to the sphere of the university, or left to private 
reading, or even ignored altogether. But the chief point 
to remember is that without some reference to the main 
outlines of European development our own history remains 
incomplete and unbalanced; nobody would for one moment 
suggest that our geography lessons should be limited to 
the study of the British Isles, or even of the Empire; with- 
out some knowledge of the greater physical features of the 
globe our own local geography would be equally incom- 
plete and unbalanced. It is, then, absurd to bury our 
heads in the sand of insular exclusiveness and shun a con- 
flict with the question of teaching European history. 
But the great question of time is undoubtedly one 
which affects our position in regard to European history. 
In a recent conference of history teachers, when the various 
specialists in different branches of our subject rose and
-P-A-G-E-81
  European and General History 73 
delivered their intensely interesting suggestions for im- 
proving this and that branch of the teaching of history, 
there was always an undercurrent of impatience among the 
audience at the apparently endless demands that were 
being made in lecture after lecture on the time at the dis- 
posal of the average instructor. Now this feeling arose 
from the fact that the great majority of the members were 
all-round teachers of history while many of the lecturers 
were enthusiasts in some particular branch of history 
teaching. It is natural that an enthusiast should like to 
push the claims of his particular speciality to the utmost 
extent possible, but many of the audience failed to make 
this allowance when they listened to the speakers’ sugges- 
tions. The duty of the history teacher is to hear and 
consider all suggestions, and after making the due allow- 
ances it will be found possible and indeed advantageous to 
introduce some element of all the different types of his- 
torical study into our course. 
In European history this problem of time is certainly 
a most pressing one. For we shall certainly not be able to 
devote more than a small number of lessons to the subject, 
perhaps half a dozen or so during the term. There is a 
call, therefore, for a very careful selection of material, so 
as to make sure that we get the really essential and do not 
waste time over minor topics. It has already been indicated 
how we should proceed in this respect, how local and petty 
matters must be subordinated to broad views and general 
outlines, how the national histories of the various States 
are to be utilised only as illustrating broad and extensive 
movements. 
A very brief survey of the great movements of Euro- 
pean history may perhaps give some suggestion of the 
method most suitable for application. The extent of the
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 The Teaching of History 
Roman Empire, its system of centralised government and the 
causes of its overthrow should certainly be known. Then 
there comes the reconstruction of western Europe under the 
Barbarian Kings. The origin and spread of Mohamme- 
danism come next, and we must trace the advent of the 
wave of Saracen conquest into Europe, turned back by 
Leo the Isaurian at Constantinople, but sweeping over the 
Spanish peninsula into the plains of Gaul. The rise and 
the supremacy of the Franks in western Europe must next 
be outlined, the conflict of Eastern and Western civilisation 
on the plains of Tours, and the forcing of the Orientals 
back over the Pyrenees, Then comes Charlemagne with 
the revived Roman Empire of the West, which splits 
asunder under the influence of its own inherent weaknesses 
and the pressure of the Northmen from outside. This 
naturally leads up to the organisation of the feudal method 
of self-defence, aided by those eastern and southern counter- 
parts of the Northmen, the Magyars and the Saracen pirates. 
This brings us to the period when western Europe settled 
down as a feudally-organised civilisation, still divided into 
large and more or less national units, but effectively dissected 
into a vast conglomeration of petty lordships and republics. 
Behind this reticulated collection of mediaeval feudal 
lordships looms the fading shadow of Imperial Rome. Its 
claims are represented by two powers, the secular arm of the 
Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation and the 
Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Church. The internecine and 
suicidal strife between the successor of Caesar and the 
successor of St Peter must be briefly explained, while our 
attention is then drawn off westwards to the achievement of 
national unity by France and Spain under the influence of 
foreign warfare, in the first case with the English, in the 
second case with the Moors. Then comes the invasion of the
-P-A-G-E-83
European and General History 75 
Turks, and the collapse of all that was left of the old Roman 
Empire of the East. The Renaissance and the age of dis- 
covery can now be briefly dealt with, and this naturally leads 
on to the Reformation and its extension. The results of the 
Reformation may be outlined in their relation to France, 
Spain, Germany, Holland, and other countries; this involves 
brief and cursory glances at the Huguenot persecution, the 
Inquisition, the Thirty Years’ War, and the establishment 
of the independent United Provinces of the Netherlands. 
The development of international politics next demands 
our attention. First we must sketch the greatness of the 
power of Spain under Philip II, the causes of its rise and 
the causes of its fall, The greatness of Spain gives place 
to the greatness of France, as we trace the rise of the latter 
Power from Henry IV to Richelieu, from Richelieu to 
Mazarin, from Mazarin to Louis XIV. The theory and 
practice of the Balance of Power can here be explained and 
illustrated. The eighteenth century brings us to the rise 
of the two new eastern Powers, Prussia and Russia. Then 
come the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, 
and the great European war against regenerated Republican 
France. When we have briefly sketched the characteristics 
‘and the results of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, 
we can turn aside to review the map of Europe as settled 
by the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. Here we embark upon 
the most recent period of European history. As already 
indicated, the best method of dealing with this period is 
to take in turn the three great series of movements which 
have proved to be the most important and determining 
factors in the development of the Continent during the 
past century—democracy, nationalism and international 
rivalry. 
We have thus scantily indicated those great leading  
-P-A-G-E-84
76 The Teaching of History 
movements of the history of Europe which ought to form 
the basis of our lessons on the subject. The course may, if 
the general plan indicated in the chapter on the syllabus 
be followed, be spread out over three, or if necessary over 
four years of study. 
In planning our lessons, we should never lose sight of 
the main threads of history or be led aside into petty detail 
of no illustrative importance. One or two examples of 
suitable lessons in European history may be given. 'The 
subjects we will choose as examples are the Empire and the 
Papacy, the Thirty Years’ War, and the conquests of 
Napoleon. It will be seen that in each case the subject has 
to be organised as a harmonious whole before presentation 
to the class. In dealing with the struggle of the Empire 
and the Papacy we must first outline the position and claims 
of the two forces. The Empire represents the traditional 
sway of the Caesar, the secular power of the Roman 
Empire. The Church inherits the power of Rome in the 
spiritual sphere, and the Pope increases his influence by 
utilising the Scriptures and the Christian Fathers to show 
the necessity of all Christians submitting to the overlordship 
of the successor of St Peter. When Charlemagne took the 
crown from the hands of Leo II, he inaugurated a union 
of Empire and Papacy in which the former was the dominant 
partner. For two centuries or more this arrangement holds 
together, but the pretensions of the Papacy are gradually 
growing. Hildebrand develops the doctrine of papal 
supremacy; he equips the Church of Rome with a mag- 
nificent centralised organisation, and claims the lordship of 
all princes. There followed a great struggle between the 
Empire and the Papacy, but there were underlying forces 
which gave force and variety to the struggle. In one way 
this struggle was a conflict between Germans and Italians,
-P-A-G-E-85
  European and General History 77 
though there are certain exceptions to be made. Many 
German feudal barons took the side of the Pope to serve 
their own purposes, while many Italian nobles, afraid of 
the consequences of an over-mighty Papacy so near their 
own estates, joined the Emperor's party. The struggle need 
not be outlined in any detail. Henry IV, Frederick Bar- 
barossa, Frederick II, may be mentioned as leading cham- 
pions of the Imperial party; Hildebrand, Alexander III, 
and Innocent III as the chief figures on the other side. The 
humiliation of Canossa should certainly be introduced, as 
also the scheme for uniting Naples with Germany. Finally 
we should attempt to summarise the causes of the ultimate 
papal triumph, the exhaustion of the military resources of 
Imperial and feudal Germany, the successful intrigues and 
rebellions of the German barons, the defensive patriotism 
of the Italians, the elastic invincibility of the Roman 
Catholic dogmas. 
Taking another example, we may outline the treatment 
to be recommended in the case of the Thirty Years’ War. 
This was a religious war between the Catholics and Pro- 
testants of Germany; it passed through four phases, in 
which the dominant party of the Catholics, led by Austria, 
overcame the Protestants and their foreign allies. The first 
phase is purely German, and is soon settled by the conquest 
of Bohemia, the leading Protestant State, and the victories 
of the Catholic troops. The second phase begins with the 
entrance upon the scene of King Christian of Denmark as 
the ally of the defeated Protestants, and ends in a second 
great Catholic victory. The third phase sees Gustavus 
Adolphus of Sweden enter the lists as Protestant champion, 
but after several victories he is killed at the battle of Liitzen 
and the Swedes are thenceforward gradually driven out of 
Germany. The fourth phase brings on the stage the sinister
-P-A-G-E-86
78 The Teaching of History 
figure of Cardinal Richelieu, a Catholic and a persecutor of 
Protestants at home, but abroad the ally of the Protestants 
who are going to serve French national interests. The 
Catholics cannot beat the powerful forces of the French 
monarchy, and the Peace of Westphalia is arranged, by 
which the Protestants keep most of their land and their 
religious independence, while Richelieu’s policy secures 
Alsace for France. 
The subject of Napoleon’s foreign conquests will provide 
us with a third example. Having described how Napoleon 
organised France under a strong centralised despotism with 
himself as the keystone of the edifice, we proceed to the 
expansion of his sphere of influence beyond the borders of 
France. First we may take the districts actually annexed 
to the Empire itself. The Directory had secured Belgium 
and the Rhine frontier; he proceeded to conquer still 
further provinces. There is Holland, first made a dependent 
republic, then a kingdom for Louis, finally absorbed into 
the Empire. There is the north-western district of Germany 
annexed in order more effectively to prevent the entrance 
of British goods to the Continent. There is the great slice 
of north-west Italy, and there is the north-east province of 
Spain. Then we have the outlying Illyrian provinces east 
of the Adriatic. We can next go on to indicate the subject 
States, Jerome’s Westphalian kingdom, Murat’s Neapolitan 
kingdom, Joseph’s Spanish kingdom and the Emperor’s own 
kingdom of Italy, with the Swiss Confederacy, the Grand- 
Duchy of Warsaw and the Confederation of the Rhine. 
Then we take Prussia, garrisoned by French troops and 
bound hand and foot to the French alliance, and Austria, 
less under Napoleon’s heel but still part of the great 
Napoleonic hegemony, Sweden ruled by a Napoleonic 
Marshal as Crown-Prince, Denmark friendly and Portugal
-P-A-G-E-87
European and General History 79 
in process of conquest. Finally we have Russia, still free 
but agreeing to arrange her commerce to suit theconvenience 
of the French Emperor. There is no need to trace the steps 
by which these conquests were made. The names of a few 
leading battles like Austerlitz and Wagram should be given 
in a brief sketch of Napoleon’s talents as a general, but for 
a school-course further detail is unnecessary. 
Wherever possible the teacher should elicit comparisons 
between the events abroad and similar or corresponding 
events at home. Thus the Roman Empire may be illus- 
trated from the province of Britain, the Anglo-Saxon in- 
vasion can be compared with the contemporary barbarian 
invasions on the Continent, and the conflict of Popes and 
Emperors quoted in reference to the conflicts of Henry I 
and Henry II with Anselm and Becket. Similarly, in a later 
period, we can compare the Thirty Years’ War with our 
own religious Civil War, the democratic movements of the 
continental states with our own democratic movements, 
and the nationalist question in Austria~Hungary or Poland 
with the nationalist question in Ireland. 
In the teaching of European history frequent use should 
be made of the map. It will take a long time for the pupil 
to get accustomed to the look of the old maps of the Con- 
tinent, and therefore map-exercises should be fairly frequent. 
The following is a selection of maps, most of which should 
be drawn by the pupils: The Roman Empire, the Bar- 
barian Kingdoms, Europe in 800 a.p., Europe in 1500, 
Europe in 1789, Europe in 1812 and Europe in 1815. 
Some knowledge of the political configuration of the Con- 
tinent at these periods should certainly be obtained. Other 
maps, such as one of Italy to illustrate the Union, or one 
of the Ottoman Empire and its subject races, will suggest 
themselves as suitable subjects for exercises.
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 The Teaching of History 
We must turn for a moment to the rather difficult ques- 
tion of how far we ought to widen the European course to in- 
clude the history of the other continents. In modern times 
the non-European peoples have had little influence upon 
our own and the European peoples, except inasmuch as they 
have offered a tempting opportunity for aggressive colonial 
expansion. Of most of them it is enough to indicate in a 
few words the general state of civilisation they had reached 
when they came into contact with the white race. The 
colonial expansion of the European Powers should certainly 
be briefly outlined, but as the other races of the modern 
world have influenced us so slightly, it is hardly worth 
while attempting to enter into their rather uninspiring 
history. One exception deserves special mention. The rise of 
modern Japan merits its inclusion in the history course, as a 
striking example of the influence of our own civilisation on 
the civilisation of a distant and different race, and as showing 
the possibilities which lie before the non-European States 
if they choose to imitate Western methods. Forty years 
ago Japan was considered by the English as a curious 
and absurd oriental kingdom fit only to be the subject of 
a comic opera; at the present time Japan holds her head 
high among the nations, and the British have been proud 
to hail her as an ally. 
But there is another collection of communities which 
demand attention, the white communities that have broken 
off their political allegiance to the European States. We 
teach the history of the English colonies on the Atlantic 
coast of America down to the point when they secured their 
independence at the Treaty of Versailles. But should we go 
on to indicate the lines of development pursued by the 
United States after that event? It seems that we should 
have omitted something of importance if we neglected to
-P-A-G-E-89
European and General History 81 
give two or three lessons to the subject of the United States 
and their problems. Again, there exist in America more 
than a dozen independent republics, some of them of very 
considerable size, ruled by the Spanish and Portuguese 
peoples. These republics have risen in some cases to a 
position of importance in the world, and it gives rather 
a false balance to modern history if we omit all reference 
whatever to these new States. Mexico, Brazil and Argen- 
tina are too big to be neglected, and when we come to our 
recent period in European history, time can certainly be 
found for one lesson, or perhaps for two, in which we can 
indicate their historical existence and their chief political 
characteristics. 
A further question remains. History goes back to ex- 
tremely early times, and general history includes the story 
of some great nations of remoteantiquity. Are wetoattempt 
to go back into these early times and teach our pupils the 
history of the great civilisations of antiquity? They are 
important even from the present-day point of view, for we 
get our days of the week, our alphabet and many of our 
literary and artistic ideas from these early civilisations. But 
here at least we must call a halt. A few words on the 
subject of the older civilisations may be introduced when 
we speak of the Roman Empire, but the details of their 
institutions and their works must be left out altogether. 
Their history does not run, like mediaeval and modern 
European history, parallel with our own English history; 
their influence on us at the present day is largely indirect 
and remote, and they are not to be considered as absolutely 
essential to the understanding of the history of our own 
country. Greek and Roman history may perhaps be worked 
in as part of the classical course, but we cannot find a place 
for ancient history in the ordinary school history course.

F. RECENT HISTORY 
Tuere have occasionally been discussions on the question 
how far it is possible and desirable to teach in schools the 
history of the last few decades. This period is often neg- 
lected in the school history course, perhaps largely because 
of the difficulties which lie in the way of teaching it in a 
satisfactory manner. Why is it that the Victorian era is so 
much neglected in history teaching? Perhaps the first 
reason that will enter the mind is that the period is by no 
means so attractive to young pupils as are the more remote 
ages. At a first glance the Victorian era appears an age of 
frock-coats, parliamentary debates, social problems and 
party politics; and however interesting these matters may 
be to the adult student, it can hardly be expected to appeal 
to the young pupil in quite the same way as the violent 
and bloodthirsty Middle Ages or the adventurous days of 
Queen Elizabeth, or even the age of Wellington’s redcoats 
and the three-bottle school of statesmen of Pitt’s day. 
But when we come to consider the question, is it really 
true that the recent period is as devoid of action and colour 
as is usually taken for granted? There is plenty of pic- 
turesque and stirring detail to be found in the history of 
the Indian Mutiny and the Crimean War. And in more 
recent times still the development of our distant colonies, 
the details of the Boer war, the Fenian agitation and other 
topics can be made as attractive as any episodes in our his- 
tory. As a matter of fact, most of our text-books concen- 
trate far too much on the warlike activities of the Middle 
Ages and far too much on the constitutional measures of
-P-A-G-E-91
  
Recent History 83 
the modern period; the mediaeval constitution and the 
building up of our colonial empire are both capable of far 
more systematic and thorough treatment than they usually 
receive either in the books or in class. 
In any question relating to the teaching of recent history 
the “bias” difficulty inevitably springs up. There have been 
long discussions as to how far partiality is to be condoned 
in a teacher of history. There are some who hold that par- 
tiality cannot be avoided, a few who hold that it ought not 
to be avoided, and others who recommend and demand the 
strictest impartiality in the teacher. 
As a matter of fact, no real grasp of history can be ob- 
tained unless the student makes his enquiries in a spirit of 
impartiality. The man who goes to history to find proofs 
of political or religious theories, which he has already ac- 
cepted, runs the danger of altogether failing to understand 
the events and movements about which he reads. Apart 
from the promptings of conscience, which will probably 
influence most of those who are not violent partisans, the 
desire to approach their subject in a level-headed scientific 
manner ought to prevent the history specialist from erring 
in this respect. Where there are complaints of bias in school 
history teaching, it will usually be found that it is the teacher 
of general subjects, and not the specialist, who turns the 
history lesson into an opportunity for preaching his own 
political or religious theories. 
The conscientious and scientific history teacher will 
attempt to do justice to both sides of the questions at issue 
in recent history, and so to deal with controversial topics 
that the strong points on either side are brought into pro- 
minence. There are always reasons to be found for and 
against any policy; where parties differ it is because each 
lays different degrees of emphasis upon the various factors 
6—2  
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  84 The Teaching of History 
to be considered in the question at issue. The historian has 
to point out what these factors were and which factors 
received special emphasis in the ideas of each political or 
religious party. The main duty of the historian is to show 
how human society has developed through the ages, not to 
set himself up as a moral critic of the rights and wrongs 
of political factions and religious sects—far less of rival 
statesmen and politicians. 
There is, however, a great field of recent history that 
does not lay itself open to any great extent to party treat- 
ment. Though the “Opposition” of the day has had much 
to say about the abominable way the Government of the 
day has conducted the wars, one can deal with most of our 
foreign and colonial contests with outside enemies during 
the last century with comparative detachment and impar- 
tiality ; or, if there is any partiality, it will probably be of 
a patriotic sort, and that is not so harmful. Though Im- 
perialism and Little Englandism have in the past had some 
very nasty conflicts, the wonderful development of our 
Empire should provide a theme on which much useful in- 
formation can be given without bias. This part of English 
history—the development of our oversea dominions during 
the last century—has been one of the most neglected of the 
chapters of history taught in our schools, though it is surely 
of enormous importance. Few school pupils have been told 
of the foundation of Rhodesia, Louis Riel’s rebellion, the 
Klondyke gold rush, the convict disputes in Australia, the 
Eureka stockade, the Maori wars, how Perim was occupied, 
and a hundred other important and really interesting topics 
of colonial history. 
As a matter of fact, it is really more important that a 
pupil should master some knowledge about the last century 
than that he should know about the earlier ages. Of course,  
-P-A-G-E-93

the more history he can learn the better, if it is of the 
right quality; but if the history of the last two generations 
is to be neglected while the Hundred Years’ War and the 
career of Cromwell are to be studied in detail, then some- 
thing is decidedly wrong. Teachers should not forget to 
allot a sufficiency of time in the syllabus to the most recent 
decades of history, and, in the hands of thoughtful and 
tactful men and women, there should be no serious difficulty 
either in avoiding political partiality or in investing the 
subject with a living interest. 
It may, perhaps, here be pointed out that a number 
of really good and useful exercises can be set on points of 
recent history. Again a few examples may be given. A class 
may be provided with a summary showing the chief features 
of the three Home Rule Bills of 1886, 1893 and 1912. The 
class may then be asked to compare the three and to point 
out in what particulars the three bills differ. Again, statistics 
of the number of Catholics and Protestants in the different 
counties of Ireland may be given, and a map of Ireland 
drawn to show, by shading, which counties are mainly under 
the influence of the former, and which of the latter. In the 
next lesson the class may make a similar map showing 
political representation, Unionist and Nationalist, and a 
comparison of the two maps may follow. The King’s Speech 
on the opening of a parliamentary session may be read from 
the newspaper, and a series of questions given on references 
in the speech. The Budget revenues may be written on the 
blackboard and questions set; perhaps the figures and items 
may be compared with those of an eighteenth century Bud- 
get. An abbreviation of someof Sir John French’sdespatches 
may be read to a class—perhaps those relating to the retreat 
from Mons in 1914—a map can be made by each pupil to 
show the route pursued. Two war despatches, “German
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 The Teaching of History 
official” and “Russian official,” may be read, describing some 
particularly important operations in the Great European 
War, with the aid of a sketch-map on the blackboard. They 
may be compared, the chief points taken as notes, and an 
account of what happened written up from a comparison 
of the two. The navy lists of the Powers of Europe in a 
given year may be compared, and a diagram can be drawn 
showing the comparative number of battleships or sub- 
marines. These are merely examples of many exercises that 
will suggest themselves to the teacher. 
Though we may not perhaps wish to encourage our school- 
boys and schoolgirls to become newspaper-readers, it is cer- 
tainly necessary to prepare them for the time when they will 
become such, and if we do not equip them in some measure 
with the mental background that will enable them to un- 
derstand and to appreciate the columns devoted to domestic 
and foreign political intelligence, they will be inclined, when 
they begin to read newspapers, to regard them as interesting 
only for the sports results and for the police-court column. 
Foreign political intelligence has always occupied a fair share 
of space in the columns of our daily press; it obtained a 
special interest and even a predominance with the outbreak 
of the Great European War. It should be part of the duty 
of the history course to provide for this very practical aim, 
to train British citizens to make intelligent use of the 
material laid before them daily by the British Press. History 
teachers would be doing a good service to their senior 
pupils if they were to indicate the fact that important aid 
towards an understanding of contemporary history may be 
obtained from a perusal of the big Reviews. Many, perhaps 
most of our pupils leave the secondary schools without any 
idea of what sort of matter is contained in such volumes as 
the Nineteenth Century, Blackwood’s, and The Round Table. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  Recent History 87 
Ill-informed as the British daily papers often are on 
foreign political affairs, it is essential that a student should 
have the means of consulting the more accurate and balanced 
articles of the reviews as a corrective to the superficial and 
often misguided opinion of “ our special correspondent” in 
the foreign capital. The occasional reading of a French 
or German newspaper or review, too, is surprisingly illu- 
minating to those conversant with the foreign language. 
When, at the outbreak of war in 1914, many teachers 
found themselves planning and giving lessons on the 
European situation and its causes, it was often borne in 
upon their minds in a striking manner how remarkably 
ignorant they had allowed their senior pupils to remain in 
matters connected with the great factors of recent world- 
history. To the average school pupil Germany was a 
country whose history, so far as it was known at all, 
terminated with the production of Bliicher as a deus ex 
machina on the field of Waterloo. Even the Franco-German 
war was unknown to many of our pupils. The Russians 
were a race whom we had fought at Balaclava and Inkerman, 
and who wanted to take India away from us; while Japan 
had no history at all. Vague traditions of great deeds 
and events, picked up from the conversations of parents 
and other adults, suggested that there had been a battle 
of Sedan, an Emperor Napoleon III, an Armenian massacre, 
some riots and murders in Russia, an American Civil War, 
and asiege of Port Arthur. Our school course of instruction 
in history should be planned so as to include some means 
of giving to these airy nothings a local habitation and a 
name. 
The last half-century, important though it is for the 
present generation, is still sadly neglected in our schools, 
and one reason for this is to be found in the fact that
-P-A-G-E-96
88 The Teaching of History 
teachers often spend so much time over the earlier part of 
the year’s syllabus that there is no time to complete it. We 
should not forget the injunction: Respice finem. We should 
keep our eye on the calendar, and if we find that we are 
slipping behind in our scheme of lessons, we should speed 
things up (even at the expense of the earlier decades) in 
order that we may have full time to deal with the later. 
The school pupils of past generations were generally like 
Gilbert’s Major-General, whose knowledge, while embracing 
every detail of Caractacus’ uniform, did not extend beyond 
the beginning of the nineteenth century. But with a proper 
care for the interests of recent history, we may hope to 
educate boys and girls who will regard history, not as the 
record of a dead past, but as a continuous chain whose 
newest links we ourselves are helping to forge.
-P-A-G-E-97
Il. HISTORY AND ALLIED STUDIES 
Ir was formerly the custom for framers of the school 
curriculum to keep the various subjects apart as much 
as possible. There was to be no conscious co-operation 
between the teacher of history and the teachers of geo- 
graphy, English and other subjects. During the last dozen 
years, however, an opposite tendency has made itself mani- 
fest, and the educational world has been almost satiated 
with schemes of correlation. One set of extremists, indeed, 
goes so far as to lay down the principle that, all learning 
being one, the various lessons of the school, at least of the 
elementary school, should receive no separate names on 
the syllabus, each being considered part and parcel of a 
general course of instruction in elementary knowledge. 
Now history, being so wide and diverse a subject, has 
many points of contact with other subjects, for since it is 
the science of human development and progress it must 
necessarily concern itself with almost all branches of 
knowledge. It brings us into contact with geography, 
with literature and language, with science, with engineer- 
ing, with art, and to a certain extent with astronomy, 
with mathematics and with physiology. These subjects 
are connected with history in two distinct ways. Firstly, 
we can take, in all these cases, the history of the subject 
in its development as a science or as a study, Thus we 
have the history of the English language, the history of 
mechanical invention, the history of mathematical research, 
Secondly, each of these subjects at times is found to exert 
some sort of influence on the development of mankind.
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 The Teaching of History 
A few examples of this may be quoted. The poems of 
Langland and Chaucer undoubtedly exerted some influence 
on public opinion in the later fourteenth century. The 
discoveries of Kepler and Galileo had not a little to do 
with the promotion of distant exploration and with the 
spread of the Protestant Reformation. The physical 
features of Great Britain vastly affected the course taken 
by the Anglo-Saxon conquest. The discoveries of Watt 
and Stephenson and Fulton were the mainspring of the 
Industrial Revolution. The climate of Russia was the 
decisive factor in Napoleon’s Moscow campaign. 
We must devote some space to the discussion of the 
question how we can best establish the relations of these 
varied subjects with history. Are we to let them remain 
separate and disconnected, leaving it to the common 
intelligence of the pupil to trace the connecting links 
between them, or are we to work consciously to the end 
of establishing a connection? It will not be denied that 
there is much exercise for the mind provided in frequent 
cross-reference from work in one subject to work in another. 
It will add, too, to the interest felt in one subject if it can 
be shown to have some bearing on another. There isa 
danger in the system of watertight compartments—the 
danger that pupils will begin to look upon school subjects 
as mere learned sciences and studies, unconnected with 
human life and revolving in little orbits of their own. If 
we wish to make the importance of a knowledge of history 
impress itself on the minds of our boys and girls, we must 
not only constantly refer past developments and events to 
those of our own day, but also show on every possible 
occasion the bearing of history on other subjects. The 
same applies to these other subjects as well. 
As for the history of the development of each particular
-P-A-G-E-99
  History and Allied Studies 91 
science, it will probably be best if the instructors in each 
subject are left to provide the necessary information. 
Thus the chemistry teacher will teach the development of 
chemical research, the mathematical teacher will deal with 
the great mathematicians of history, and the English 
teacher will trace the history of language, metre and style. 
But there is much scope for correlation of the other type. 
History teachers will find very frequent cause to bring in 
references to other subjects, and other teachers will find 
many occasions on which it will be useful and necessary 
to illustrate their lessons by historical allusions. 
Now this form of mutual assistance requires very careful 
organising, and is a far more difficult matter than may 
appear at first. The history teacher, were he on the spot, 
would know the exact moments when historical information 
might be given during lessons on other subjects, and the 
exact information necessary on each occasion. In most 
elementary schools, and in those other schools where one 
teacher takes several subjects, this difficulty does not usually 
arise. But in any school which has adopted the specialist 
system, progress in this respect is far more difficult, for in 
most cases the specialist instructor is so wrapped up in his 
own subject that he rarely inclines to allow consideration for 
others. This accusation, of course, holds good with history 
specialists. Unless there is some conscious effort, we shall 
find that we shall tend to forget that there are opportuni- 
ties of bringing in good references to other subjects of the 
school curriculum. This is one of the evils of specialisation. 
But we are living in an age of specialisation, in educational as 
in all other matters, and we must do our best to remedy the 
defects of a system which in its main points is undoubtedly 
far superior to the old system of all-round form-teachers, 
at any rate in the case of secondary schools.
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 - The Teaching of History 
What is to be done to remedy this defect? There must 
be a united effort. It will not do for one teacher only to 
attempt a system of correlation. Cases have been known 
where the energy of one teacher has impressed the stamp 
of his special subject on a whole school; where, for instance, 
mathematics, manual training, drawing, geography, and 
languages have all been reduced by the machinations of an 
enthusiastic history specialist to the position of handmaids 
to his own subject. An instance of this sort, of course, is rare. 
If, as should be the case, the majority of the staff are keen 
upon their own subjects, concessions and compromises will 
be necessary, and there must be frequent mutual discussions 
on the syllabus of each subject. Whether these discussions 
will result in any satisfactory system of correlation will 
depend on the general ability and common-sense of the staff 
as a whole; all that can be hoped for is that some manner 
of compromise may be devised by which the natural relation- 
ship between the different subjects may be brought out 
without provoking any teacher to ill-will with the idea that 
he must give more than he is allowed to take. 
Very intimate indeed is the connection between history 
and geography. The great physical features of the world 
have formed the setting for the development of the drama 
of human progress, while in certain cases the activities of 
the human race or even of individuals have contributed to 
considerable alterations in the physical appearance of the 
surface of the earth. Once more, however, we shall find it 
necessary to take up arms against the overmighty pretensions 
of the sectional specialist. There has appeared a school of 
historical thinkers who attempt to apply to the details of 
human history the grand principle that geography controls 
and directs everything. Now these opinions are based on 
an undoubted truth, namely that physical features do exert
-P-A-G-E-101
  History and Allied Studies 93 
a profound influence upon human energy, human character 
and human activities. But the most extreme of the cham- 
pions of this school of thought, by carrying their deductions 
too far into the details of human development, rob their 
theory of much of its force. By asking too much they 
challenge a reaction which will act unfavourably upon it. 
Yet it is fairly obvious that history cannot be properly 
understood without some knowledge of geography, while 
geography frequently finds a knowledge of history. ex- 
tremely conducive to its ready interpretation. 
The development of any country depends to a great 
extent on its climate, its natural resources, its proximity 
to trade-routes, its seaboard and its frontiers. Climate, 
scenery and meteorological phenomena have a great deal to 
do with the beliefs and religion of a people. Physical 
features are a pre-eminent factor in all military operations. 
Conversely, human effort and energy have in some cases 
affected and altered the geographical configuration of a 
country. With the piercing of the Alpine railway tunnels 
the great central European mountain-system ceases to act 
as a formidable bar to commerce and communication. The 
draining of the marshes of the Welland, Nen and Great 
Ouse has entirely altered the physical appearance of a 
million acres in the east of England. The construction of 
the Suez and Panama Canals has revolutionised trade-routes. 
The Roman Campagna is no longer a pestiferous death-trap 
to its denizens, and this is entirely due to human causes. 
We can emphasise the relationship of geography and 
history in many ways. Let us quote a few examples. 
Consider the military geography of the United Kingdom. 
The barrier of the Pennines and the importance of its gaps 
is apparent in several instances of historical consequence, 
notably in William the Conqueror’s celebrated march to
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 The Teaching of History 
Chester and in Prince Rupert’s northern campaign of 1644. 
The two main roads into Scotland have to be mentioned 
a score of times in the course of our history. The Essex 
Forest and the Weald profoundly influenced the history 
of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms of Essex and Sussex. The 
Severn river-basin must be described if we deal with Offa’s 
contest against the Welsh, Buckingham’s rebellion of 1483, 
or the Worcester campaign of 1651. Some knowledge of 
Trish geography is necessary to understand the campaign 
of Aughrim. An appreciation of the centres of mineral 
wealth and manufacturing industry must underlie any 
understanding of the Reform Bills of 1832, 1867, 1885 
and 1917. 
It is also important to know the geographical reason 
for the establishment of important historical cities and 
towns. It makes an interesting lesson to trace the reason 
for the existence of the Roman towns of Britain in the 
particular places in which they are to be found. The 
military position of a fortress like Carlisle or Guildford or 
Reigate may be easily explained with the aid of geography; 
the same thing will apply in the case of places of European 
consequence like Belfort, Liége, Verona and Cracow. 
Another very interesting study is that of place-names. 
Of course this cannot be carried out at all systematically 
either in history or in geography lessons, but very im- 
portant pieces of information may often be elicited from 
a place-name. Thus it may be discovered that Stamford 
marks the crossing of the River Welland by the “Stone” 
road of the Romans, that Carisbrooke is the “Burh” 
of the Wiht-gara—the dwellers in Wight, that Castle 
Richard in Herefordshire marks the site of one of the first 
stone castles in England, built by one of Edward the 
Confessor’s Norman friends, and that Chelsea and Battersea 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  History and Allied Studies 95 
preserve the memory of the days when the Thames at 
London was a broad and marshy tidal river studded with 
islands that rose above the fens. The settlements of the 
Danes can be very well indicated by marking on a map the 
places now bearing names that terminate in -by and -thorpe. 
It will prove, perhaps, impossible to devise a satisfactory 
correlated syllabus for history and geography, though in 
some schools the experiment has been tried. A syllabus 
that works in the geography of Spain for the convenience 
of the Peninsular War or that arranges lessons on 
Edward I’s Scottish wars to coincide with the teaching of 
Scottish geography is bound to be artificial and distorted. 
We can hardly twist our senior history course far out of the 
broad chronological path, and when the history syllabus 
is comparatively rigid, we can hardly expect teachers of 
geography to make all the sacrifices in order to benefit the 
sister-subject. Correlation will more usually take the form 
of frequent cross-reference and allusion. 
Thus when the history teacher is dealing with English 
history, he should make frequent use of the map and the 
lessons to be drawn from its study; in dealing with India 
he will not forget to mention frequently the physical 
features and climate of the country. The same applies to 
America, Australia or wherever the course of the history 
lesson happens to take him. In a similar way, the geo- 
graphy teacher should be always ready to call attention to 
historical events and developments which have taken place 
in the areas with which he happens to be dealing. In 
this way both subjects will mutually feel the benefits 
conferred by the study of the one upon the study of the 
other. 
The relationship which exists between history and 
literature is obvious, The literature of a nation is an ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 The Teaching of History 
pression of its thoughts, its ideals and its aims. No thorough 
idea of the spirit of a period of history can be obtained with- 
out a perusal of the literary products of that time. Though 
we cannot hope to present to our pupils, or even to get 
them to read, a very large quantity of the literature of 
past ages, we should, if possible, see that they get a slight 
acquaintance with one or two examples of such productions. 
It is, however, fairly obvious that the time at the dis- 
posal of the history teacher will not allow him to do more 
than occasionally quote short extracts from contemporary 
writers. Whatever larger effort is made in this direction 
must depend on the willing co-operation of the teacher of 
English. 'The English teacher will probably be taking with 
his classes certain long works for more or less complete 
reading and study, and if it can be arranged that such 
works shall in some cases be of historical interest and 
importance and shall also in some cases fit in with con- 
temporary periods being studied at the same time, so much 
the better. It will depend, however, upon the circumstances 
guiding the English teacher, how far this form of co- 
operation can be carried. Where the functions of history 
teacher and English teacher are combined in the same 
person there will, of course, be no difficulty in arranging 
a slightly correlated syllabus. 
It would be possible to fill a vast number of pages with 
suggestions of works which would fulfil the purpose of con- 
necting history and literature. It will be sufficient to 
indicate a few examples. For the Middle Ages we have 
Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales,” the Prologue of which is of 
priceless value for the history of the fourteenth century, and 
Langland’s “Piers Plowman,” from which suitable passages 
may be taken. The Shakespearian plays provide material 
for the Tudor period, with the works of Spenser, Latimer  
-P-A-G-E-105
History and Allied Studies 97 
and More. Much good will come from a study of a portion 
of Hakluyt’s “ Voyages,” now published in a cheap series. 
Selections from the“ Tatler” and the“ Spectator” can enliven 
the reign of Queen Anne, just as Milton can be brought 
in to illustrate the Puritan movement. The social history 
of the eighteenth century may be illustrated by Cowper’s 
“Task,” by Goldsmith’s “Deserted Village,” by the works of 
Lamb and Crabbe, the last of whom, in his“ Parish Register” 
and “Tales of the Borough,” gives many interesting side- 
lights on the conditions of his time. 
There are also numerous works of literary value which, 
though not strictly contemporary, may be used as an aid 
to the remembering of historical events. A few examples 
of these may be given. There are poems like Burns’ stirring 
“Scots wha hae,” Drayton’s “ Agincourt,” Scott’s ““Flodden,” 
‘Tennyson’s“ Revenge,” Macaulay’s“Armada” and“ Naseby,” 
and Palgrave’s “Trafalgar.” There are historical novels like 
Scott’s “Ivanhoe” and “Kenilworth,” Defoe’s “Journal of 
the Plague Year,” Dickens’ “Barnaby Rudge” and 
Thackeray’s “Esmond.” If a novel of this kind is read 
through even once only by a class, it will give a very vivid 
idea of the living force of history. 
We now turn to the subject of the correlation of history 
with woodwork and drawing. This again must depend 
upon the willingness of the other instructors to adopt 
historical subjects as models for their work. Though we 
have little to offer in exchange for assistance thus rendered, 
it may sometimes be found not inconvenient for drawing 
and woodwork instructors to adopt historical models. 
In the way of woodwork and modelling there are 
numerous historical subjects which can be taken. Models 
of clay can be made to illustrate viking ships, mediaeval 
weapons, cannon and other objects. Wooden models can 
HL at
-P-A-G-E-106
    
98 The Teaching of History 
be made of the stocks, of the guillotine, of siege engines. 
Very interesting will a study of these last be found. Plans for 
models can be worked out, with a little care, from pictures 
such as those in Viollet-le-Duc’s “ Architecture Militaire.” 
An example may be given of how a simple model of a 
siege-engine may be made. The model is that of the éré- 
buchet, the pictures of which are generally well known. 
A base is made by fastening together three stripes of wood 
in the shape of the letter H; from the points where the 
strips join, two other strips are raised perpendicularly to 
act as the supports of the balance-pivot. Between these 
two uprights, at the distance of several inches from the 
ground, according to the size of the model constructed, the 
pivot-beam is placed, and across this is fixed the main 
throwing-beam, at one end of which there will be fastened 
the weight, and at the other there will be scooped out, or 
fastened on, a receptacle for the objects to be thrown. If 
the pivot is arranged to move smoothy and easily, a hook 
and a piece of string for the lowering of the receptacle 
will complete a presentable working-model of a trébuchet. 
Models may also be made of castles, monasteries and 
abbeys, but these require a much greater amount of 
work, and usually a certain amount of collaboration be- 
tween various pupils. A good way to proceed with a 
model of this sort is as follows :—First a plan of some 
actual mediaeval castle is procured, and is copied on a 
large sheet of blank paper, on the same scale as that on 
which it is intended the model shall be. When a satis- 
factory ground-plan has been made, it can be pasted or 
pinned on to a wooden base, which will serve as the ground 
from which the model is to be raised. Small plans are 
then drawn out with the measurements and instructions 
for each particular section of curtain wall, each turret and
-P-A-G-E-107
History and Allied Studies 99 
each building, every pupil taking charge of one unit. These 
separate pieces, when completely made and painted, may 
then be brought together and glued or otherwise fixed on 
the board. The painting may often be profitably delayed 
until the whole model has been put together. 
Plans of castles and religious buildings may be found 
in works such as the before-named book of Viollet-le-Duc 
and Barnard’s “Companion to Mediaeval History,” or 
in local guide-books. 
In drawing there is much, of course, which can be done 
to illustrate history lessons. Arms and armour often 
make good subjects for drawing, while in the field of 
decorative design we can not only use the ornamentations 
drawn from architectural models but coats of arms as well. 
The study of heraldry, though interesting, can have no 
place in the history syllabus, but it would be a useful 
thing if, in drawing and colouring designs, pupils could get 
to know the coats of arms of the great mediaeval families. 
A word may be said, perhaps, on the subject of 
architecture. A little knowledge of this subject will do 
a great deal to increase interest in history. If it is not 
arranged that some information about architecture is given 
in connection with drawing lessons, then, at least in a 
secondary school, a few lessons should be devoted by the 
history teacher to some simple explanations of the greatest 
developments and changes in British architecture, especially 
if such changes can be illustrated by examples drawn from 
the neighbourhood of the school itself.  
-P-A-G-E-108
Ill. LIBRARIES AND COLLECTIONS 
Mr Keatince points out in “The New Teaching” that 
the function of the laboratory in relation to science work 
is represented in history work by the library. Without a 
good collection of books, advanced work in the upper forms 
is reduced within very narrow limits. Every school that 
takes the teaching of history seriously should possess a 
collection of books on historical subjects. And this should 
be no mere agglomeration of text-books, source-books, 
atlases and fortuitous “specimen copies”; it must be a well 
thought-out collection designed to illustrate and to aid the 
work laid down in the syllabus, as well as to provide 
material for private reading on the part of advanced pupils. 
As to the composition of this library much might be 
said, and the books to be purchased for it naturally depend 
very largely on the funds available for the purpose. A 
historical library must grow slowly, and we can only in- 
dicate roughly the lines on which it can best be brought 
together. 
First we must have certain books which may be termed 
volumes of general reference, detailed Histories of England 
and Europe and such like books. Of long series of volumes 
on the history of England there are several, notably Long- 
man’s “ Political History of England” in twelve volumes, 
and Methuen’s “ History of England” in seven. In Euro- 
pean History there are also several series, notably the 
“Periods of European History” series published by 
Rivington and on a very much larger scale the Cambridge 
Mediaeval and Modern Histories, which include chapters 
on English history. As regards other more general re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  Ltbraries and Collections 101 
ference books, there is a Dictionary of English History 
published by Cassell, while there is an excellent little 
Biographical Dictionary published by Chambers. An his- 
torical atlas, which need not be too expensive, should also 
be added to the library. Keith Johnson’s and Gardiner’s 
are both good and cheap. 
During recent years there have appeared several series 
of cheap reprints of famous books of the Everyman type. 
The historical volumes of these series are often of such 
importance that, at their low price, we can have no excuse 
for failing to get them. A short list of such books may 
be given: The “ Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,” Bede’s ‘History 
of the English Church,” Thierry’s “Norman Conquest,” 
Giraldus Cambrensis’ “Itinerary of Wales,” Stanley’s 
“Memorials of Canterbury,” Froude’s “History of Eng- 
land,” Macaulay’s “History of England,” Pepys’ “Diary,” 
Evelyn’s “Diary,” Cromwell’s “ Letters,” Burnet’s “History 
of His Own Time,” Parkman’s “Montcalm” and “Wolfe,” 
Macaulay’s “Essays,” Pitt’s “Ovations,” Burke’s “Orations” 
—these are but a few of the volumes on English historical 
subjects issued in one series alone—the “Everyman.” 
From the same series we may draw the following works on 
European History: Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the 
Roman Empire,” Sismondi’s “Italian Republics,” Liitzow’s 
“History of Bohemia,” Machiavelli’s “History of Florence,” 
Motley’s ‘Dutch Republic,” Carlyle’s “French Revolution,” 
and other volumes. Nelson’s shilling series supplies some 
good historical books, such as Morley’s “Life of Cobden” 
and Bagehot’s “ British Constitution.” There are other im- 
portant French volumes of historical import in their shilling 
French series, such as Lévy’s “Napoléon Intime” and Ségur’s 
“Campagne de Russie.” Other historical works can be 
found in Bohn’s cheap reprints, in the World’s Classics 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 The Teaching of History 
series and in other similar collections. A little more ex- 
pensive is Fisher Unwin’s half-crown series, which includes 
Seignobos’ interesting volumes on “ Civilisation,” Villari’s 
“Life and Times of Machiavelli” and some of Thorold 
Rogers’ books on “ Economic History.” 
A word must be said for the new modern series issued 
by the “ Home University ” editors, the “ People’s Books” 
and the Cambridge University Handbooks. With few 
exceptions these brief modern works, written by historical 
experts, are excellent handbooks for elementary historical 
study. In all such cases, where the book in question 
is modern and without a seasoned reputation, it is well 
for the teacher to have a glance through it before deciding 
on its usefulness for his school library. 
As for the more expensive historical books, one can 
hardly say offhand what volumes should be recommended 
for inclusion. Individual teachers will doubtless differ as to 
the particular books they consider indispensable, and it 
would probably be unwise to put forward the names of any, 
merely on the strength of their general reputation. The 
specialist will doubtless be acquainted with the general run 
of historical literature and, unless the amount of money at 
his disposal be very great indeed, he will probably be at 
no loss to indicate suitable additions. 
If a school possesses a good historical library, it may be 
used with effect, not merely for the use and reference of 
the teacher, who will find in it ready to hand the materials 
for illustrating his lessons, but for the use and reference of 
the pupils as well. It will be employed in connection with 
those lessons in which senior pupils are set to get up historical 
subjects, and no opportunity should be allowed to pass by 
in which they may be encouraged to read for themselves, 
out of school-hours, the great historical masterpieces.  
-P-A-G-E-111
Libraries and Collections 103 
Besides collecting a library of historical volumes, it will 
also be advisable to make a collection of pictures which 
may illustrate the subjects with which we deal. These pictures 
may beobtained from a number of sources. Certain publishers 
issue short series of wall-pictures illustrating subjects drawn 
from history. These pictures usually prove somewhat ex- 
pensive, particularly if they are going to be preserved by 
framing. Other pictures, notably historical portraits and 
reproductions of famous pictures, may be obtained from 
firms of engravers and picture-shops. These carefully- 
prepared and in many cases very artistic productions make 
very fitting ornaments for the school-room wall, but their 
purchase on a large scale is not altogether advisable. If 
pupils hold their history lessons in a room which is always 
surrounded with pictures, they soon begin to take these 
pictures as a matter of course and lose interest in them. 
Familiarity in this case undoubtedly breeds contempt. It 
will be found more effective to keep the majority of our 
pictures in store and only to bring them out to illustrate 
our lessons directly. They can then be left for display in 
the class-room for some time, and then, when other pictures 
have come along to replace them, they may be taken down 
and reserved for the next year’s use. This will be found to 
be far better than keeping them always before the pupil’s 
eyes. 
A collection of historical pictures may also be got to- 
gether by the pupils themselves. A class should always be 
encouraged to bring to school any illustrations that pupils 
may get hold of to illustrate their lessons. These may come 
from books, magazines andevensometimesfromadvertisement 
bills; the humble cigarette card, too, is not to be despised. 
Again, there is much to be done with a collection of pic- 
ture postcards, Every history teacher should make a school
-P-A-G-E-112
104 The Teaching of History 
collection of this form of illustration. Historical postcards 
may be got together from all sorts of places. There are 
cards of celebrated pictures, cards of portraits in the 
National Portrait Gallery, cards of historic buildings and 
scenes, representations of famous documents. When the 
boys or girls go for their holidays in the summer, they 
should be asked to collect postcards of anything of historical 
interest in the district to which they happen to go. It is 
remarkable what good results will come from the beginning 
of a postcard collection of this description. 
Cards and magazine-pictures can often be shown to 
great advantage if they can be mounted on thick paper or 
thin cardboard, giving some slight margin round them, on 
which it is sometimes good to write explanatory notes on 
the pictures. If the wall of the schoolroom does not present 
an extensive wooden surface on which illustrations may be 
fixed with drawing pins, a couple of wooden grooves may 
be constructed round the walls, and into these wooden 
grooves may be slipped pieces of cardboard on which the 
pictures can be pinned or otherwise mounted. 
The history-room should certainly possess one or two 
large wall-maps. These should be chosen to illustrate those 
areas in which most historical action has taken place. A 
physical map shaded to represent contours will frequently 
be found more useful than a political map, though in this 
case the teacher will have to make sure of the exact posi- 
tion of places discussed before dealing with the map. There 
should certainly be a map of England and Wales, and a 
larger one of the United Kingdom; a map of the latter 
will prove more effective than two larger maps of Scotland 
and Ireland. Then it will be useful to have a large wall-map 
of France, again preferably a physical map, for in the Middle 
Ages much of our history is concerned with France, and the
-P-A-G-E-113
  
Inbraries and Collections 105 
map will frequently have to be used. For European history, 
and even for English history, a map of Europe will be re- 
quired; the difficulties connected with the difference in the 
political configuration at different periods can again best 
be obviated by having a physical map. 
All models made by the pupils should find a place in 
the history store-cupboard, being brought out to illustrate 
one point or another when it crops up; duplicate specimens 
of models need not, of course, as a general rule be retained 
at school. Drawings and paintings should also find a place 
here, and should always bear the name of the pupil respon- 
sible for them as well as the name of the school in which 
they were made. 
A word or two may be said on the subject of lantern- 
slides and lantern-lessons. Nothing helps to make the past 
real in the eyes of the pupil so much as the presentation of 
visual images by means of large pictures. But considerations 
of space and the great cost which is entailed in the acquisi- 
tion of a large collection of good-sized pictures will prevent 
many schools from attempting to form such a gallery. The 
same function may be as effectively or even more effectively 
fulfilled by lantern-slides, for the effect of the darkened 
room, and the consequent focussing of all visual activity 
upon the picture on the screen, are more favourable to 
mental concentration on the picture than the conditions 
governing the display of a picture in an ordinary lighted 
room. 
Some schools possess facilities for this sort of work, 
while others do not. Where a lantern exists, an occasional 
lantern-lesson is a relief from the ordinary lessons, but we 
should not make it of too frequent occurrence; lantern- 
shows are always apt to lose force by constant repetition. 
Unless a school has plenty of money to spare, it will not be
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 The Teaching of History 
possible to obtain a very large collection of lantern-slides, 
though in some districts, such as for example the County 
of London, schools may subscribe to a circulating library 
of lantern-slides, and this, of course, is a decided advantage. 
It will often be found useful to get the class to describe the 
slides as they appear on the screen, if they illustrate work 
already done. 
Books, drawings, pictures, postcards, models, maps and 
lantern-slides will make an excellent school historical col- 
lection. Every teacher should take the opportunity of also 
building up a collection of good past work done by his 
pupils, for his own satisfaction, for the credit of his school, 
and for the inspiration of future pupils. The inclusion of 
some piece of his work in the collection should be made 
the aim and ambition of every boy or girl who studies the 
subject of history in the school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
IV. CAVENDO TUTUS 
Ir remains, in a few brief remarks, to call attention to some 
of the mostcommon pitfalls which beset the instructor of this 
subject. 
In the first place it cannot be too often repeated that 
the teacher should never lose sight of his main plan. Par- 
ticularly in the senior forms, he must keep himself from 
making too wide excursions beyond the bounds of the 
syllabus. It is quite possible that with an intelligent class, 
one that is prone to ask numerous questions, he will find 
himself being led away into lengthy expatiation on subjects 
which do not fall well within the bounds of the lesson. 
Time should certainly be allotted to a lesson on military 
equipments at the time of the Civil War of 1642, but we 
should not allow a lesson on the course of the Marston 
Moor campaign to be interrupted by questions relative to 
muskets and pikes. The religious question in the Ireland 
of William of Orange’s time calls for some discussion, but 
we must not be led off into premature remarks about the 
recent Home Rule question. 
Again, facts should not be piled up with the idea of 
filling out a lesson. Some teachers have a way of rolling 
out incidents and pieces of information without connection 
and without definite aim, in a manner that has been described 
as “bead-stringing.” If facts that are not essential to the 
main story of history are being given, it ought to be with 
the definite idea of illustrating the more important facts or 
of impressing them on the minds of the pupils. 
Another great fault of history teachers is that they are
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 The Teaching of History 
frequently addicted to moralising on events. In the case of 
some instructors, almost every fresh phase of an historical 
episode is made the occasion for a more or less dithyrambic 
exposition of the virtue or otherwise of the characters con- 
cerned. 
Anything which touches upon the sphere of pure ethics 
is far better left to the discussion of the class, and it will 
often prove useful to encourage an informal debate on some 
such topic. Moralising on events which have already been 
outlined is in most cases a waste of energy on the part of 
the teacher, but a useful exercise in expressing themselves 
and a useful aid to remembering the facts for the pupils. 
There is, however, one species of moralising which com- 
mands more excuse and which in many cases is deliberately 
encouraged by authority. This is the cult of patriotism. 
English schools are not subjected to State regulation in this 
respect. In some other countries, however, there is a dis- 
tinct attempt on the part of the State to colour the course 
of instruction in history with a strong national bias. Thus 
in France the State schools are expected to encourage the 
love of Ja patrie and an admiration for the institutions and 
principles of the Republic. In Germany instructions were 
issued that history teachers should inculcate the principles 
of German patriotism, the necessity of German unity and 
the virtues of the dynasty. The same sort of thing was 
apparent in the State instructions issued both in the 
Austrian and in the Hungarian schools. In the British 
Colonies, too, the instruction has a distinctly Imperial ten- 
dency, bringing out as far as possible the advantages of the 
unity of the Empire and encouraging the strengthening of 
the ties which bind the Colonies to the mother-country. So 
it is obvious that the cult of patriotismis very widely practised 
in schools outside these islands. It would take much space
-P-A-G-E-117
Cavendo Tutus 109 
to discuss the advisability of establishing some such system 
in British schools but we may perhaps not be considered 
wrong in saying that the cult of patriotism in our history 
lessons is far from being a fault. 
Although the remark applies equally to all subjects, it 
may be as well to be on our guard against getting over the 
heads of our pupils. Language and ideas must be propor- 
tioned to the capacity of the class for understanding them, 
and we must neither fall into the habit of using too advanced 
words nor embark upon too advanced and complex political 
ideas. The teacher should always try and picture to himself 
the mental attitude of the pupils, to put himself in their 
place, and so to gauge the effect of his lessons. It must not 
be forgotten, either, that frequent tests are necessary in 
order to estimate what progress the class is making in the 
acquisition of solid knowledge. Furthermore, we must 
always see to it that in dealing with past ages we really do 
bring out the essential differences between old and new 
institutions and ideas. It is no good talking about the Par- 
liament of Edward I and of Charles I unless we have 
explained how the assemblies of those reigns were not the 
same as the modern Parliaments; it is no good speaking of 
the Roman Catholic religion of the Middle Ages unless we 
havemadesure that our pupils haverid themselves of the idea 
of the present day religious system in England, where all 
creeds exist side by side in peace and mutual toleration. In 
the second place we must not fall into the temptation of 
holding up past manners and facts to ridicule; it is easy 
and natural for us to laugh at the passionate and emotional 
conduct of earlier centuries and at their somewhat crude 
table-habits, it is easy for us to sneer at the diminutive 
size of the armies that fought at Agincourt and Blenheim 
compared with our modern hosts, but we shall not be pur-
-P-A-G-E-118
110 The Teaching of History 
suing the right line if we encourage this kind of “superior” 
and contemptuous attitude towards the past. It is our task 
to try to understand our ancestors, not to sneer at them. 
It has been frequently asserted that our ordinary history 
deals too much with men and too little with mankind. A 
deeper charge still we often hear brought against our his- 
torians. It is asserted that the history we learn at school 
and in the university is superficial, that it deals only with 
the surface layer of human life, with the kings and princes 
and statesmen instead of with the merchants and farmers 
and workmen, with the generals and admirals instead of 
with the soldiers and sailors, with parliamentary debates and 
political intrigues, and not with the price of bread and 
conditions of home life. This charge too is based upon 
truth, for until quite recently social and economic history 
has taken a very humble place in the syllabus of both school 
and university. Now one of the virtuous faculties which a 
study of history is supposed to bring out is a power of 
discerning the tendency to exaggeration displayed by advo- 
cates of rival policies and opinions; and if this be so, it is to 
be hoped that the student will be able to avoid the adoption 
of either the political or the social idea of history teaching 
in their extreme form. Of course we cannot neglect the 
masses in our historical researches; the state of public 
opinion, the standard of civilisation, the economic needs of 
the community, the pressure of unemployment and hunger, 
the religious beliefs of the people are factors of profound 
significance, the factors, indeed, on which all other historical 
influences are based. But here again we must utter a two- 
fold warning. The cardinal faults of the social-economic 
school of history teachers are that they devote far too 
much time to their own social and economic side of history 
and that they load up their material with an overheavy
-P-A-G-E-119
  Cavendo Tutus lll 
mass of trivial detail, equalling if not surpassing the sins 
of the old-fashioned political school in this respect. 
On the principle of devoting more attention to those 
movements of history that concern large masses of men 
than to those that concern smaller numbers, perhaps the 
social aspect of historical study seems to command a much 
larger amount of attention than the political. But another 
consideration cuts across this in a rather forcible way. The 
elementary factors of human life remain the same through 
all ages, and social and economic history deal largely with 
these elementary factors. Men must always eat, they must 
always dress in mild and cool climates, they must always 
find means of amusing themselves in their spare hours. 
Food may differ from time to time, clothes and fashions 
may alter, sports and pastimes may change with the passing 
centuries, but their general characteristics remain the same, 
and it is not a matter of great importance whether the people 
dress in red or blue or black, in ruffs or starched collars, 
or whether they play nine men morris and clash or cricket 
and football and billiards. The general social condition 
of the people remains very much the same from age to age; 
it is only in times of extraordinary development, such as 
those of the Industrial Revolution, that the social condition 
undergoes a serious change. It will thus be found that the 
main outlines of social history can be written in com- 
paratively few pages, or taught in comparatively few lessons. 
Not so the political outlines ; the institutions under which 
the people are governed require greater explanation to those 
pupils who, while easily understanding social references, 
have no knowledge or experience of the working of political 
institutions; these institutions too change more rapidly 
than the social conditions on which they are primarily based. 
It is true that the political commotions of history are largely
-P-A-G-E-120
112 The Teaching of History 
superficial, but they are nevertheless important when they 
produce great results, and it will take very much longer for 
the teacher to explain the political movements than to ex- 
plain the contemporary social changes. For instance, no 
one would deny the real importance of the struggle between 
Crown and Parliament in the seventeenth century; but 
when we have sketched the social conditions of 1603 we have 
virtually also sketched those of 1625 and 1640 and 1660 
and 1689. Things had not moved so very rapidly in the 
social world, except when they reflected the political dis- 
turbances, as in connection with the religious changes 
engineered by Roundheads and Cavaliers. On the other hand 
the political movements of that time, the conflicts between 
the Kings and the Parliaments, the movements of armies 
in the Civil War, the laws passed by triumphant parties, all 
these require quite a considerable amount of space and time 
devoted to them. 
We see then that it is possible to compress our social 
and economic history into a very much smaller compass 
than we can our political history and thus, while granting 
the claim of the former to a prominent place in the syllabus, 
reason demands that political and constitutional subjects 
should command the greater part of the time at our dis- 
posal. ’ 
Again, those social economic enthusiasts who clamour 
loudest against the trivial personalities of Piers Gaveston, 
Anne Boleyn and George Villiers are often found plunging 
headlong into the same abyss, mutato nomine. Quite unim- 
portant details about miracle plays and ten-course banquets 
and court fashions fulfil the same ré/e in their social histories 
as the above mentioned characters filled in the old fashioned 
political histories. These things are all doubtless very 
interesting, but so are the private lives of celebrities and
-P-A-G-E-121
  Cavendo Tutus 113 
we must treat both in the same way. As a means of 
stimulating historical interest, as a means of illustrating the 
more important facts, as an occasional layer of jam in the 
plain pudding of the school history-lesson, they have their 
value; but in both cases we must never forget the true pro- 
portion of their historical importance. 
History and biography are closely allied subjects but 
they arenot thesame. History deals with nations. Biography 
deals with individuals. The subjects may be closely cognate; 
nations are often profoundly influenced by the thoughts 
and actions of a great individual; conversely great men and 
women draw much of their inspiration and all their oppor- 
tunity from the society into which they are thrown by 
Providence. But in teaching one, we must beware of ram- 
bling off into the other, although we may sometimes enlist 
the services of the sister-subject i in order to facilitate his- 
tory teaching. There is no doubt much that is fascinating 
in the lives of such great men as William the Conqueror, 
Thomas Becket, Martin Luther, Wellington, Nelson, 
Napoleon; but in teaching of these men it must not be 
forgotten that we are dealing with their influence on the 
nation and not with their own personal history. The bio- 
graphical tradition is very strong in history teaching, and 
finds its worst expression in the once universal division of 
the history book into reigns, each chapter being labelled 
with the name of one of the sovereigns. 
Once again we must take warning. We must not lose 
sight of the solid work which we expect our pupils to do, 
It is not enough that we should entertain and amuse, it is 
not enough that we should find occupation for the minds 
of our classes, we must secure real effort and real accom- 
plishment. It is quite possible to get excellent specimens 
of work done in the way of maps and exercises and com- 
1 8 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
114 The Teaching of History 
positions, without their yielding any very deep or permanent 
results in the way of facts and ideas remembered. Some 
teachers are apt to lose sight of this in their pursuit of the 
more refined methods of instruction. 
Another similar fault is that of doing much of the 
work for the pupil that should be done by him. Wherever 
it is possible for a class to extract information from the 
text-book it should never be told by the teacher; wherever 
a fact can be elicited from the class itself, it should not 
come from the teacher’s lips. But these are faults which 
apply to the teaching of almost all subjects, and are not 
confined to teachers of history. 
An energetic history teacher has to be a person of mani- 
fold activities. Not only has he to carry out his ordinary 
school work, to prepare lessons, to correct exercises, to plan 
and conduct school visits; he has to keep in touch with his 
subject in a variety of other ways. He must keep his eye 
on the educational papers, and seize upon any fresh ideas 
on history-teaching therein put forward. He has to read, 
in his own private time, a great deal of historical matter, 
to amplify and add to his knowledge. He ought to look 
out for reviews of new historical works in the columns of 
the Press. He should, if possible, join and attend the 
meetings of some such society as the Historical Association. 
In short, it is only a specialist who can make a thoroughly 
good teacher of this subject. 
It is the duty of a military commander to be ever alert 
and active, keeping his eye on his front, his flank, his rear, 
on his train of supplies, on the condition of the weather, 
on a vast number of other things. So it is with the history- 
teacher. It used to be at one time a prevalent idea that 
history was one of the easiest of all subjects to teach. It 
was only necessary, it was thought, to get hold of a text-
-P-A-G-E-123
  Cavendo Tutus 115 
book and keep a page or two ahead of the class, and there 
was an end of it. But it ought to be apparent by this time 
that this is very far from the truth. History is perhaps the 
most difficult of all the subjects of the school curriculum 
to teach with effect. It requires a teacher who is willing to 
be ever active, ever enquiring, ever on his guard against 
the numerous pitfalls which beset his path. He may well 
take as his motto that of one of our ducal houses, Cavendo 
tutus.

Nore. The important stages in the development of 
the main theme of the story are shown in italics. 
(0) A Feudal Village. 
(This lesson does not centre round an event or series of 
events. It is merely descriptive of society in a thirteenth- 
century village, and gives in an essay form some ideas re- 
specting mediaeval land-tenure, military service, etc.) 
The average village small—usually a manor—there is 
a lord, his house, his steward—the people divided into 
villeins and freemen—most of them villeins—what it meant 
to be a villein—cannot leave the village, marry, sell beasts,

cut down trees, without lord’s consent—no share in govern- 
ment—no right to bring lawsuits against others, except in 
his lord’s own court. 
How the soil was tilled—the three-field system—wheat, 
barley and fallow—how the three areas were distributed, 
rarely each in one piece—every villager must have his share 
of land, in wheat and barley—rotation of crops causes con- 
stant change of pieces under cultivation—cases of a fresh 
distribution each year—the strip system—each villager has 
many little strips—advantages of the change system; its 
disadvantages. 
Some villagers hold more than others—superior position 
of the freemen—big share held by lord of the manor—how 
did he get this big estate cultivated? 
Rents of the villeins—service—produce—money—rents 
of the “socage freemen”—service—produce and money— 
other varieties of rent; services in the lord’s hall, butler, 
steward, falconer, chamberlain (grand serjeanty)—gifts and 
nominal rent (petty serjeanty)—prayers and masses of the 
Church for the lord’s soul (frank almoign). Lastly, the 
military tenant (knight service). 
How the King’s army was raised—partly by hire, partly 
by rent agreement (military tenure)—a “knight’s fee”— 
what the service was. 
Other features of the mediaeval village—the church— 
its uses, religious and secular—the lord’s mill and dovecote 
—usual obligation on some villager to attend hundred and 
shire courts. 
Land round the village—meadow strips—waste lands— 
right to pasture animals and cut turf, etc.—‘parks” and 
“bocland.”

give a brief outline of his public life, and will bring in a 
good deal of detail concerning the old navy.) 
Horatio Nelson—early life—takes to the sea—ships of 
the eighteenth century—skill needed to manage then—long 
voyages—water and food supplies—scurvy.

  VI. SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHY 
A short bibliography of useful and easily accessible literature on 
the Teaching of History. 
[A very full bibliography of this subject will be found in the 
Supendives to Professor H. Johnson’s Teaching of History (Mac- 
millan, 1915). His bibliography includes many French and German 
works. 
An early work on the subject is J. Wyer’s Bibliography of the 
study and teaching of History, published in America in 1899, though

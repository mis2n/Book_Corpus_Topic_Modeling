Was. 
However numerous may be the systems of educay 
tion adopted in different countries, and in distant 
ages of the world, the object proposed to be at- 
tained has everywhere been ostensibly the same: 
viz. by care and training, to render the body and 
mind of man apt instruments for fulfilling the de- 
sign of his existence—the acquisition of happiness, 
social and domestic. But, in endeavouring to effect 
this purpose, mankind have had recourse to an 
almost infinite variety of contrivances, each age in- 
novating upon the practices of the preceding one ; 
each nation, each university, each public school, 
nay, every celebrated teacher, imagining some in- 
genious improvements upon everything previously 
existing in the world. The question, however, now 
is, whether, after so much activity has been exer- 
cised, and all the wonderful discoveries with which 
the science. of pedotrophy -is said to be enriched, 
the world is any nearer than it was of old to sound 
notions on the subject; or whether, after all, it be 
not rather an art.than a science, depending far

more on the genius of the individual who exercises 
it, than on any body of rules, or plan of operations 
which it would be possible to devise. 
To arrive at any determinate notions on a sub- 
ject, in which, as the father of a family, I am myself 
deeply interested, I found it necessary to examine 
the theories and practice of other times and coun- 
tries; and, although space is here wanting to give, 
in detail, the result of all these researches, it will 
not, perhaps, be out of place to preface the masterly 
treatise of Locke by a glance over the notions ante- 
cedently prevalent in the world. A compilation, 
however, of plans, rules, and regulations, or even an 
analysis of pedagogic legislation, would by no 
means answer my purpose. What I aim at is, to 
give the pervading spirit of education during the 
ages preceding our philosopher’s labours, which, 
almost entirely divested of visionary systematizing- , 
have effected more towards introducing the deci_ 
sions of common sense into this branch of politics, 
—for such it is,—than those cf any other man, per- 
haps, since the days of Aristotle. 
The practices of ancient nations in educating their 
children, with the exception of the Greeks and 
Romans, are but very imperfectly known to us. 
Among the ancient Egyptians, who adhered to the 
system of castes still in force among the Hindoos, a 
different plan was no doubt adopted by every grand 
division of the people; and the object being, not 
to call into activity all the nation’s energies, but to 
regulate for the advantage of the king and priests 
so much of it as could not be suppressed, or, in-

deed, dispensed with, they, as do still the Brahs 
mins, inculcated the belief that all their institutions 
derived their origin from God, and must, without 
reserve or scrutiny, be obeyed to the letter. All 
kinds of knowledge which could confer power or 
consideration, or withdraw the mind from the 
tyranny of superstition, were monopolized by the 
priestly legislators. The people were permitted to 
know no more than what fitted them to be hewers 
of wood and drawers of water for the clergy, who, 
from their universities of Heliopolis, Memphis, and 
Thebes, issued those peremptory mandates at which 
both prince and subject trembled. (1) There, in 
fact, the sacerdotal caste were every thing, the peo- 
ple nothing. All their monuments represent the 
triumph of superstition and its ministers: human 
sacrifices, cringing inferiors, domineering priests 
and princes. Accordingly, their civilization was 
inflexible and unprogressive, their arts rude and 
uninformed by a soul; and the noblest of all arts, 
the art of painting the passions in harmonious 
numbers, was prohibited or unknown ;(?) and the

(2) Herodotus, indeed, ii. 79, is supposed by warproug vopovg 
to mean “national hymns.” But this opinion, though sup- 
ported by Wesseling, is inconsistent with what follows in the 
same chapter, where the historian says, the “ Maneros” was their 
first and only song: dodiy te rabryy xpéryy kal podyny 
opiar yevtobar. By vépoug above we must therefore understand 
“laws.” Had it signified any species of poem, it is hardly to 
be supposed that Dio Chrysostom, who, doubtless was well ac- 
quainted with Herodotyis, would have asserted positively that 
poetry was inserted in the ‘Index Expurgatorius’ of Egypt.

absence of poetry from their literature, which could 
only have arisen from its wanting a place in their 
sympathies, will convince us that, not only did 
they never make any remarkable progress in the 
other liberal arts, but that they never could. 
Some idea, indeed, might be formed of the sys- 
tem of education pursued by the ancient nations of 
the East, from that, still prevalent among them ; 
for their political institutions remaining in spirit 
the same, no great change can have been effected 
in the art of preparing men to pay obedience to 
those institutions. There the basis of all teach- 
ing is the inculcation of a slavish obedience to the 
prince, who, being despotic, is himself supposed to be 
unteachable, and incapable of reason. This principle 
is fertile in consequences. As the monarch exacts 
blind obedience from every one around him, all 
those who come forth from his presence, and repre- 
sent him to the people, require likewise, in their 
turn, equal servility from those next below them, 
and these from the next; until tyranny projects 
its feelers into every cottage and hovel in the 
empire. Montesquieu, therefore, is right in con- 
sidering fear to be the governing principle in 
despotic states. (°) Every person fears the man 
immediately above him ; and be who stands upper-

most fears all. This deep-rooted reciprocal apprek 
hension is the key to every thing in such forms of 
government. It is the glass through which the 
great contemplate their dependants, and their. de- 
pendants them. But this fear implies something 
else which accompanies it, and is its cause: it 
implies the existence and the consciousness - of 
injustice. 
All being aware that injustice is among’ them, it 
becomes every man’s endeavour to:makeit-his ally, 
or, if he fail in this, to escape from its fangs. « The 
weak employ their wits in devising how to screen 
themselves from the oppression of the strong; while 
the latter, backed by all the traditionary prejudices 
of their race, put every art in practice to widen the 
space between themselves and the poor, by wring- 
ing from them whatever they ‘possess, even the 
very means of subsistence. This is constantly 
done by Mohammed Ali in Egypt, and by tyrannic 
landlords all over the world. To these governing 
classes it is all-important to possess the-means of 
influencing opinion, that master-tyrant, by which 
” everything in this world is swayed. : This, in fact, 
it is that enables the privileged ‘orders in. several 
European states to derive vast revenues from the 
soil, while the. productive classes, the creators’ of 
wealth, are from time to time reduced to: contend 
with the inferior animals for the food which nature 
has provided for them.

themselves any thing like a liberal system of moral 
culture; and even of this the account delivered 
down to us isso evidently interpolated by the his- 
torian with ideas palpably of Greek origin, that we 
scarcely know how to confide even in the remainder. 
But the picture, though rather, perhaps,.a sugges- 
tion of what Xenophon thought desirable, than a 
resemblance of something which actually existed, 
is too curious and full of interest to be omitted. 
The forum of the Persian capital, situated in front 
of the palace and government (*) offices, instead of 
being appropriated, like the Grecian agore, to the 
purposes of business, was set apart for the exercises 
and dwelling of the youth, Market-stuff, and 
every kind of merchandize, usually found in the 
bazaars and public places of the East, were ba- 
nished to another place, that the harmony and 
good order of the stripling aristocrats might not be 
disturbed. by. the clamour and buffoonery of the 
chapmen, of whom Agorakrites, in the “ Knights,” 
may probably be regarded as a not unfavourable 
specimen. ‘Che parallelogram was next divided, 
with a. precision not unworthy of Mr. Owen of 
Lanark, ifito four parts, of which the first was ap-

the third to full-grown, men, the fourth to persons 
beyond the military age.

Every morning at day-break the first and third 
classes made their appearance in the square; the 
elders arrived at what hour they thought fit, or 
might altogether absent themselves, except on cer- 
tain days, when all were expected to: be present; 
but, unless married, in which case they might oc- 
casionally remain at home, the youth slept, or 
passed the night under arms about the palace. 
Over each of these classes were appointed twelve 
inspectors, one for every Persian tribe. Those who 
had charge of the boys were. selected from among 
the elders, for their skill in the art of education. 
The class of grown men supplied leaders for the 
youth, whose minds and morals they were expected 
to improve; the men themselves were under the 
superintendence of inspectors chosen from their 
own body; and even the elders were watched nar- 
rowly in the performance of their duty by persons _ 
appointed for the purpose. In what the duties of 
each class consisted, Xenophon is at some pains to 
explain, in order that it may, as he says, be seen 
how carefully the institutions of Persia were adapt- 
ed to generate virtuous habits among the citizens. 
There can be little doubt that the Baron Von 
Altenstein, in consolidating his'very artificial, and, 
in many respects, admirable system of education 
for the Prussian dominions, had before him this 
extraordinary sketch of Xenophon. Several of his 
regulations certainly recal the Cyropzdia to mind, 
even in the details; though the ancient system still 
more strongly breathed a military spirit. Let the 
reader carefully compare what follows with Victor

Cousin’s Report; bearing, at the same time, in 
mind that the Persian institutions, as described by 
Xenophon, aim at creating a higher state of soci- 
ety, virtues more heroic, because more allied to 
freedom and equality, and a more vigorous exercise 
of public opinion than would, perhaps, be foand 
compatible with the safety of the despotic German 
state. 
The boys ‘who frequented the Persian forum 
were expected diligently to apply themselves to 
the study of justice, theoretical and practical ; this 
knowledge holding, among them, the rank appro- 
priated in Greece to science and literature. To 
facilitate its acquisition their instructors were gene- 
rally occupied, during the greater part of the day, 
in giving practical lessons, by judging and decid~- 
ing between them. For in this miniature world, 
as among mankind in general, mutual accusations 
took place, of theft, robbery, violence, deception, 
calumny, or other grave offences.(*) The guilty, 
and those who brought forward unfounded accusa- 
tions, were punished. In this court cognizance was 
taken of a crime, which, though seldom made the 
ground of an action at law, is often the cause of 
deadly enmities—I mean ingratitude;—and who- 
ever was found guilty of omitting, when in his 
power, to repay an act of kindness, underwent se- 
vere chastisement. For it was thought that per- 
  
OA practice very similar was introduced by Mr. Hill into his 
establishment at Hazelwood near Birmingham ; and, I believe, 
with useful results,
-P-A-G-E-18
PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. xi 
sons of such a temper of mind must be unmindful 
of the benefits they derived from Heaven, from 
their parents, their country, or their friends; and 
to ingratitude naturally succeeds impudence, the 
parent of every disgraceful action. 
Another virtue instilled by the force of example 
into the minds of the youthful Persians was teni- 
perance; for, beholding their elders, leading con- 
stantly before their eyes, a sober and temperate 
life, they were almost irresistibly impelled by the 
principle of imitation to practice. what they wit- 
nessed. To this also the frugal simplicity of their 
diet greatly conduced; for it was expected that © 
they should follow the example of their instructors, 
who, though advanced in years, were careful to ab- 
stain from eating or drinking, until the permission 
of their superiors was signified. From the begin- 
ning, moreover, of their education, they were de- 
livered from that mistaken tenderness of mothers, 
and mischievous indulgence of servants, so much 
deprecated by Locke; and, to secure the utmost 
regularity and equality, took their meals with their 
preceptors, at the hours appointed by the state. 
However, so democratic on this point were their 
feelings, that they carried along with them to school. 
their own food, consisting of bread and cresses; 
(xapdapoy,) together with a kothon, or earthen cup, 
that, if thirsty, they might help themselves from the 
nearest brook, ‘The remainder of their instruction, 
which, it will be perceived was neither very com- 
plicated nor vety, extensive, consisted in learning 
the use of the bow, and, like the Orientals of our

own days, to throw the jereed. (axovriZevv.) 
was their education up to the age of sixt 
peventeen, when, upon passing into the c 
epheboi, or youth, they were subjected to 
ferent kind of discipline. 
During the ten years immediately following their 
entrance into this second class, they lodged, as we 
have already observed, in the precincts of the 
palace, that they might form a guard to the city, 
and acquire temperate and manly habits; this 
period of life being confessedly the most critical. 
Similar reflections lead, no doubt, to similar prac- 
tices; but it is worthy of remark that, on this 
point, Xenophon's Persians seem to have imitated 
the Athenians and Spartans, among whom youth 
was subjected to a more rigid superintendence than. 
boyhood, In the early ages of the Persian mo- 
narchy, these young men constituted a kind of 
armed police, holding themselves always in readi- 
ness to execute the orders of the magistrates. 
This employment, actively exercising both mind 
and body, was an useful preparative to a military 
life ; but the Socratic philosopher attributes much 
greater efficacy to the chase, to which they were 
Jed several times in the month by their king, who 
on these occasions took along with him one half 
of the guard. 
Their hunting equipment, described con amore 
by Xenophon, consisted of a bow, a quiver, a 
small battle-axe, or a hunting-knife in a sheath, 
a light shield, and two javelins, one to throw, the 
other for close fighting. The chase, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-20
PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. xilf 
among them was a matter of public concern, 
an important branch of education, and for that 
reason entrusted to their first magistrate, who 
led, as in war; both engaging personally in the 
pursuit of the game, and taking care that every 
other person did the same thing. Soldiers, in- 
deed, have generally been great sportsmen, particu- 
larly our English soldiers, who, like the Greeks, 
frequently, even when in active service; find time 
for their favourite amusement; a circumstance 
which General Foy animadverts on with: more 
warmth than judgment in his history of the Pen- 
insular Wars. For, undoubtedly no kind of 
exercise can be better adapted to nerve and invigo- 
rate the body, since it habituates men to early 
rising, to endure heat and cold, to ride, to walk, 
to run, and where, as in Persia, the game often 
consisted of fierce and powerful animals, there was 
need of considerable courage, when the hunter 
found himself unexpectedly, perhaps, exposed to 
their greatest fury in their lairs. 
On these occasions, when exercise communicated 
a keen edge to the appetite, the youth carried 
along with them a more plentiful dinner than that 
of the boys, though of the same kind. While thé 
pursuit of the game continued, however, they 
never paused to dine, but deferred it to the even- 
ing; aud if the same ‘thing happened on the 
morrow they'counted those two days as one, since 
one day’s provisions only were consumed. This 
they did with a view to accustom themselves. to
-P-A-G-E-21
xiv PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. 
abstinence, that, should the circumstances of war 
render it necessary, they might be able cheerfully 
to support it. The game, when they took any, 
gave arelish to their bread; if not, their cresses 
were at hand. Nor let any one imagine, says 
the philosopher, that such food must have been 
distasteful to them, or that their palates rebelled 
against water. Let him consider how delicious 
even a barley crust appears to a hungry man, and 
how sweet to the thirsty a draught from a cool 
stream ! 
Those divisions of the class that remained at 
home, were not, in the meantime, idle. They 
amused themselves with repeating the exercises 
they had learned in boyhood, shooting with the 
bow, and hurling the jereed, dividing into parties, 
and contending against each other. To promote 
emulation, and call forth their greatest energies, 
public matches were set on foot, and prizes ap- 
pointed for the winners ; and the members of the 
tribe in which were found the greatest number 
of fair, bold, and skilful players not only lavished 
praise and honour on the actual leaders of the 
youth, but likewise on those who had superin- 
tended their training in boyhood, Other circum- 
stances in their education show how thoroughly 
the. system was pervaded by the principle of 
utility. While approaching thus, under the guid- 
ance.of the state, the threshold of manhood, they 
were taught to consider themselves in hostility 
towards the wicked, being employed by the magis-
-P-A-G-E-22
PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. _x¥ 
trate in mounting guard over the city, in pursuing 
and apprehending thieves, and-in. many other 
offices requiring force or agility. 
In this class they remained ten years, with 
which their education may, perhaps, .be supposed 
to have terminated.- But to comprehend the wis- 
dom of their training, it is necessary to understand 
what kind of life they were designed to lead when 
men, that it may be seen whether the. means. were 
nicely adapted to the end. . For. twenty-five years 
from their entrance within the pale of manhood, 
their life was regulated after the following manner: 
in the first place, they always, like the epheboi, 
held themselves in readiness to execute the magis- 
trates’ orders in all things requiring the exertions 
of robust and prudent men. When called upon 
active military service, they no longer, as in the 
former class, went to the field armed: with: the 
javelin or the bow, but prepared for close fight, 
breasted with steel, bearing in the left hand a 
small round buckler, and in the right a Kopis, ov 
short sword, exactly as the Persians are represented 
in works of art. : 
. Except the teachers of the boys, all public func- 
tionaries were chosen from this class. But, when 
their twenty-five years of manhood were fulfilled, 
and they were. turned of fifty, they entered into the 
class of: elders, who, not being by law required to 
pass thei,frontiers on military service, remained 
constantly-at-home, as judges of their nation, to 
whose decisions, even in matters of life and death, 
all causes public and private were submitted.

With them rested the choice also of magistrates ; 
and if any Persian, youth or man, transgressed the 
laws, they had power to expe! him from his tribe,

This curious picture of ancient Persian life, 
though invested with a somewhat Utopian. air, may 
however have been during a short period realized , 
the government being a military aristocracy, not 
unlike that of Crete and Sparta; and ‘the rigid 
system of discipline, above described;'éréated, per- 
haps, those hardy and high-minded: soldiers with 
which the elder Cyrus subdued -the'whole of wes- 
tern Asia. Admission into this privileged class 
was not difficult. Every Persian who could fur- 
nish his son with the requisite’ frugal diet, and 
dispense with his labour, possessed the right of 
sending him to this school of ¥irtue. But it was 
necessary to begin at the beginning; for none but 
thosewho ‘had passed their boyhood in the first 
class. could: be’ admitted into the second, or exer- 
cise ‘any. public office of trust or emolument.

notwithstanding the piety of his soul, and the

Ignorance and prejudice, however, were the 
hinges upon which every thing turned; and the 
example afforded by this ancient monarchy suffices 
of itself to show how superior are the results ob- 
tained by cultivating the intellect, to any that can 
possibly arise from merely disciplining the man- 
ners, and confining the attestion::to simply prac- 
tical views. For, had ‘cate deem taken to inculcate

of Lock,“ indulged them in the laxury of shoes, 
and‘enetvated their bodies by warm and effeminate 
raiment ; and, in ‘eating, permitted their own un- 
disciplined appetite to: be the measure of their

aristocratic. Jaconizers at Athens, was regarded as 
the beau ideal of .a legislator, instead of subjecting

I have seen the high enthusiasm and imagina- 
tiveness’ of the Athenian eharacter traced, with 
reprehension, to the influence of poetry over their 
education. But the objection can scarcely be urged 
seriously by any one possessing a spark of philo- 
sophy. For without those qualities, the virtues, 
when they exist at all, must be stunted and pigmy- 
like, adapted rather to the cloister and hermit’s 
cell, than for those scenes of bustle and contention 
in which the citizens of a free state must pass 
their lives. But,’ whether or not this be so, it is 
absurd to attribute to books or teachers qualities 
inherent in the physical temperament; though, 
possessing these, the Athenian youth doubtless im- 
bibed from the poets principles whereby to guide 
their. loftier aspirations, and nobler views of the 
nature and destiny of man, than could, from any 
other source, have been derived ; virtue, as it was 
understood in antiquity, being invested in their

was simply a following out of the manner of

had made some proficiency in the Kithara, the 
noblest songs of the lyric poets were placed in their 
hands, that amid the mingled inspiration of music 
and verse, their sympathies might be irresistibly 
directed towards whatever was good and beautifal. 
Rhythm and harmony, to adopt the language of 
the great Abderite sophist, were thus in some 
measure compelled to inhabit the souls of youth, 
and, by their influence, to render them. milder, 
more modest, and of better constituted. minds, 
while all their abilities both to speak and to act 
were called into life. (*°)

they were carefully instructed in horsemanship and 
fencing ; and, universally to diffuse and maintain 
the national predilection for the fine arts, drawing

the multiplicity of their studies a curious passage 
occurs in Aischines Socraticus, who observes that, 
whenthechild wasseven years old, numerous labours 
were imposed on him, under the despotic sway 
of health-guardians and masters of exercises; while, 
as his years increased, he successively passed 
under the jarisdiction of critics; geometricians, 
tacticians, and a host of other gnasters. But 
when he was registered among thé’ youth, studies 
still severer awaited him it the Lyceum, the 
Academy, and the Cynosarges, where every trans- 
gression was punished with stripes. His rights, 
however, were no less sedulously watched over 
than his conduct, by the ten inspectors of youth, 
one from every tribe, who wete chosen annually 
by ‘the people at large, and received a regular 
salary from the state. (*') 
: From the Atheniané, the people of Rome bor- 
rowed much of their civilization, since it was from 
them that they derived even the laws by which their 
state was governed. It is not, therefore, surprising

Romans, and infused into her fierce alumni. what-. 
ever elegance or humanity they possessed. - Up to 
this period, their education had been conducted in 
an almost exclusively military spirit. Their insti- 
tutions, indeed, were less artificial than. those of 
Lycurgus; they were likewise more consistent with 
views of material and palpable utility, their pur- 
suits, even in the instance of the highest patricians, 
being connected with agriculture.and rural. eqo- 
nomy in general; but the energies of'-the nation 
not having been directed by mental training to- 
wards the ennobling delights of literature and 
science, they were incapable of enjoying leisure, 
and took refuge from ennui in the excitements of 
war, which, if every other way inferior, are no 
doubt, as General Foy contends, equal in intense- 
ness to those afforded by the exercise of the plastic 
and mimetic arts. 
Whatever men exclusively pursue they neces- 
sarily excel in ; and, accordingly, the Romans cul- 
tivating with undividing attention the science of 
strategy in all its branches, together with the lof- 
tier science of politics, were in the end enabled to 
triumph over the whole civilized world, and, esta- 
blish the most powerful empire recorded in history. 
In other. arts and pursuits they were. willing, as 
Virgil in his well-known passage admits, to relin- 
quish the palm of excellence to others:

The Abbé Fleury, inhis clever work, da Choix

the inventors of all the more important sciences ; 
or, at least, of all systematic investigation of the 
theories of ethics and politics, together with the 
plastic and mimetic arts, properly so called, instead 
of devoting their youth to mastering the tongues 
and historic records of. other nations and ages, 
generally confined their studies within the circle of 
the Hellenic language and experience. (*) The 
position of the Romans was different. Observing 
that, in eloquence, in poetry, in philosophy, the 
Greeks had attained a degree of perfection exceed- 
ing what it had entered any of: their countrymen’s 
minds to conceive, they felt that, to obtain any 
thing like:a liberal education, they must acquire 
the language in which thought ‘had most com-

pletely developed itself. And not merely so. Greek 
was also the language of commerce and diplomacy’ 
throughout the Levant; and ambassadors, men of| 
business, and whoever sought to carry his experi- 
ence beyond his own threshold, soon found the 
necessity of possessing this universal instrument of 
communication, insomuch that to be ignorant of it 
was, in Rome, not to be a gentleman. 
The facilities, moreover, of acquiring Greek 
were numerous. Athens, the great instructress of 
mankind, still spoke her own pure language; and 
there were many colonies from Hellas established 
in Magna Grecia, where the mother dialect was 
preserved in more or-less perfection. War, also, 
and the intestine troubles of their country, had 
driven multitudes of Grecian adventurers from 
their homes; and these undertook, in various ways, 
to deliver from barbarism and ignorance the devas- 
tators of their native land, and to reveal to them an 
inner life, and sources of pleasure, which, hitherto, 
they wot not of. 
. The grammatical studies of the Romans were 
consequently confined, at first, to the Greek lan- 
guage, as, in modern nations, they were for many 
ages.to the Latin; but perceiving, at length, the 
capabilities of their own masculine tongue, they 
diligently applied themselves to the improvement 
of it, and succeeded with very inflexible materials, 
in forming a dialect singularly well adapted 
to the expression of energetic and impetuous 
thoughts. 
At the period, however, wherein the Romans
-P-A-G-E-50
   PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. 
commenced their studies, those of the Greeks had: 
undergone important changes. ‘The poets, with — 
their moral fables, traditionary legends, and reli- 
gious sanctions of virtue, no longer possessed any 
very active influence, the scepticism of the natural 
philosophers having destroyed that ingenuous cre- 
dulity on which the mythi had based their authority. 
And this circumstance will, in great part,account for - 
the unspiritual form assumed from the commiéence- 
ment by Roman literature, one of the greatest oria- 
ments of which employed his genius in -recom- 
mending the dullest: species of atheism; whilé,'in 
Greece, the philosophical poets of the first ages; 
singing, 
“ how heaven and earth, 
In the beginning, rose out of chaos,” 
had, in spite of scattered seeds of pantheism, che- 
rished a feeling profoundly religious. Scepticism, 
however, which is an inert principle, may be con- 
sidered merely as an incapacity to seize vigorously 
upon truth, or enthusiastically to pursue it through 
the various mazes of philosophy ; and those tainted 
by it, are consequently, of all men, the most unapt 
for the successful exertion of creative energy. | 
But, nevertheless, history, and the moral beau- 
ty of the Socratic philosophy, were not without 
charms for the: robust minds of the Romans; and 
though the inward spirit of poetry was an essence 
too delicate and: subtile to produce any. sensible 
effect upon them, they could still appreciate its 
exquisite pictures of human life, its fine moral 
precepts, and brilliant imagery. It therefore bes

came customary, at Rome, as previously in Greec 
to read, recite, and chaunt the works of the b 
poets, which, having ‘survived so many ages, NO 
began to be respected for their antiquity, and th 
historical and religious traditions they contained. 
A new spirit was introduced when Rome becam 
a prey to the Caesars; for, from that moment, th: 
genuine spirit of antiquity,—the principle of self- 
government,—ceased to exist. Greece itself was 
now a wreck, a shadow; and though the youth o 
Rome still frequented the site of what had once been|

it, advance themselves in the court ol _ -,-._. --~ 
result was generally answerable to the motive. In 
the place where the greatest men known to history 
once instructed their rising fellow-citizens in the 
doctrines of philosophy, they found a herd.of vain 
sophists, teaching for hire the art of wrangling ; 
gluttonous, ‘irreligious, unprincipled pettifoggers, 
who subsisted by frequenting rich men’s feasts, 
where, as we find them painted to the life in the 
« Deipnosophiste,” they ostentatiously displayed 
their abilities to do everything, but revive the liber- 
ties of their country. It was, in short, time that pa- 
ganism, worn out, or utterly inefficient forall moral 
purposes, should yield up the place of guide and 
instructor of mankind, to that pure and perfect 
system which, about this time, the mercy of God 
revealed to the world. 
Education, it might have been hoped, should 
now have assumed a form approaching the ideal.
-P-A-G-E-52

The spirit of Christianity, developing itself in‘ 
unfolding of the young mind, should have given ‘ 
seraph’s wings to the soul, wherewith to soar high 
above whatever was. base and dishonourable. A 
perfect example had been exhibited. Celestial vir- 
tue had been clothed in human shape. A brand 
of love, kindled in the highest heavens, redolent of 
the ineffable purity. of God, had been placed it the 
hands of man, to light him upward.’ ‘In oné word, 
Christ had lived, and suffered; and, with him} all 
that was earthly in human nature had perished, 
consumed in the crucible of divine love, mortality 
had put on immortality, and the golden links of 
that eternal chain which connects man with his 
Creator, faith had discovered ascending through 
the clouds to heaven. - 
But the mental culture of the early Christians 
displayed but little of the spirit of their réligion. 
Designed to introduce ‘the most complete distinc- 
tion between themselves and the pagans, it was 
much too narrow and illiberal. They sought to 
confine, as much as possible, the reading of their 
children to the Holy Scriptures, rejecting all other 
studies as useless and pernicious ; and though, by 
this means, they succeeded, indeed, in generating 
among themselves a distinctive character, and man- 
ners unlike those of their neighbours, innumerable 
prejudices were,.at the same time, engendered, 
which, if they did not, upon the whole, impede the 
progress of Christianity, undoubtedly impaired. its 
purity, and upon the more learned and enlightened

ages that succeeded, imposed the laborious task of 
weeding out the heresies and errors then sown. 
The excellent Fleury, however, in many respects 
so entirely liberal, imagines the practice of those 
times an emanation, in some sort, from the spirit of 
Christianity ; and carefully, therefore, abstains from 
condemning it. On the contrary, their fanaticism 
seems, for the moment, praiseworthy in his eyes. 
He enters earnestly into their peculiar feelings, and, 
in astyle rich with the odour of Platonism, thunders 
an anathema against all heathen lore. He relates 
with evident commendation their neglect of what 
were then denominated foreign or exterior studies, 
which in fact, constituted, he says, a portion of 
the manners of Paganism ; and were, for the most 
part, useless or dangerous. For, the poets were 
nothing less than “the devil’s prophets,” breath- 
ing of little but idolatry and incontinence, and, 
by their fascinating pictures, softening down our 
indignation against those impetuous passions which 
terminate in crime. 
. Philosophy they despised, because many among 
its teachers denied the truth of religion, contend- 
ing against the possibility of miracles and pro- 
pecies; while others, more superstitious, or aim- 
ing more at popularity, sought to support the cause 
of idolatry by fine-spun physical allegories, or 
' the .secrets of magic. Their morality, too, was 
rejected as erroneous, because based on this proud 
principle, that man is of himself able to be vir- 
tuous. The orators of the pagan world appeared
-P-A-G-E-54
PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE, 
   in their eyes, to abound with little else than 
fice, falsehood, contumely, or flattery; and had it’ 
even been otherwise, what was the subject oftheir 
most serious discourses but the management of 
public business, a thing. from which the early 
Christians anxiously sought to escape? They 
would,-in fact, have regarded as entirely lost the 
time given them to secure the interests of eternity, 
had they employed it in reading secular: histories, 
in the study of mathematics, astronomy, or other 
sciences, thén considered more curious than ‘usefal. 
Even in the most innocent mental Pursuits they 
discovered the snares of vanity, 
The majority therefore of Christians, in those ages, 
devoted themselves to manual Jabours, or works of 
charity. Such schools as existed were kept im: the 
churches, where the bishops, not yet too wealthy or 
proud to be useful, explained the Scriptures. There 
were also many priests and deacons engaged in 
instructing catechumens, or in disputing against 
the heathen; but the condition of the clergy was 
then far from being an enviable one, as their bi- 
shops not only employed them as readers and 
secretaries, but sometimesalso in the almost menial 
capacity of attendants and letter-carriers. Little 
time, therefore, was left for genuine study; and it 
has been well observed that of those few Christian 
writers who understood anything of philosophy, 
the greater:number had become acquainted with 
it before theiz:conversion: 
In reality, education was exceedingly neglected 
in the first ages of Christianity, and this neglect

was. the parent of that night of profound ignorance 
which overspread the whole of Europe during the 
middle ages. Little or nothing was studied but 
the doctrines of a thorny and obscure theology, or 
the rules and practices of monastic orders, based on 
the most grovelling fanaticism, at variance with all 
the best interests of society, and necessarily gene- 
rative of that uncheerful gloom which particularly 
distinguishes the modern from the ancient world. 
For, instead of seeking to ripen and bring to per- 
fection the powers of mind or body, instead of la- 
bouring to reduce man’s passions and affections 
under the control of reason, to teach the true end 
of life, or the proper mode of using the blessings 
with which it abounds, those sombre bigots un- 
gratefully rejected the gifts of God, shutting them- 
selves up from the light of heaven in cells and dun- 
geons, refusing all nourishing or wholesome food, 
and betaking themselves, in.some instances, to 
grazing among the beasts of the field. When their 
imaginations took any bent towards literature, they 
preserved the same perverse characteristics. For 
being ignorant of all wholesome truth, they spun 
the most absurd and monstrous theories, and, in- 
stead of enlightening, only embarrassed and puz- 
zled a world unhappily reduced to the necessity of 
receiving what was termed instruction from teach- 
ers so utterly irrational, 
Some insight into the process by which this state 
of things was brought about, we obtain through 
that most curious and instructive work, which St. 
Augustin has entitled his “Confessions.” The

picture,—too brief, indeed,—of school-boy 1 
studies in those extraordinary times, is draw 
much liveliness and vigour of fancy. He 
himself up from the cradle, and, working his way 
upward to man’s estate, sketching as he goes along 
his studies and his companions, his minute ingenu- 
ousness, had not fanaticism interfered; would pro- 
bably have rivalled that of Rousseaa.. ‘In the train 
of the true religion, as we lear -from innumerable:

numerous, to become acquainted with all their pe-

It is chiefly, however, in the spirit which | per- 
vades it, that one system of education differs from 
another; for youths may nominally be taught the 
same things, in two different places, and the result

studies, at the outset, differed but little from our:

arithmetic, the knowledge of which seems to have 
been, imparted in a very crabhed way. Indeed, the 
whole discipline of those infant schools, and much 
more those of boyhood, must. have been. severe, 
even to savageness;. for St. Augustin, still, in his 
old age, when length of time might be expected to 
have worn. out the impression, looked back upon 
his birchen days with horror, and speaks of his pre- 
ceptors in a tone of considerable resentment ; ob- 
serving, that they who so angrily chastised him, had 
themselves been guilty, of the same faults. He, 
nevertheless, acknowledges that his partiality for 
the fives-court impeded his progress.in knowledge ; 
and. that, in short, he should have leaned nothing 
had he not been forced into it. (*) 
Greek, the value of which had again began to be 
felt, was taught children at a very early age; but 
the mode of teaching appears to have been ill calcu- 
lated: to, recommend the language, for Augustin 
complains that he hated it, But. it, may be in- 
ferred, from his account, that the -Aineid was then a 
favourite book with boys; for he represents him- 
self.shedding delicious tears over the fate of Dido, 
and altogether, as much, interested in the story as a 
. modern. boy with. a, novel; partly, perhaps, because it was read by stealth. Arithmetic he hated. also,

Homer, however, though “sweetly: full o 
ties,’ as he terms it, obtained no ‘share 
partiality; no doubt because bis “ vanities 
shrouded beneath the difficulties: ‘of. a, -forei

acquires its own language; with the bitter ‘disoiphitle: 
by which they are usually indoctrinated in Forel 
tongues. “The Latin,” says.he; “ was ‘equalty; int

without fear or torture, I gradually aequired it,

From the same testimony we learn that: the: 
Christians had at.length returned to the old Greek’ 
practice of causing. their children to commit to 
memory speeches, or passages from the poets; 
or, which was equally useful,:to clothe the poet's 
thoughts in prose of their: own. To drill them 
into a correct pronunciation would appear to have 
been equally necessary ; for. already, at’ least: in

had commenced, it being not uncommon, at 
Thagasta, for boys to bring the master’s ferula 
about their ears for metamorphosing hominem into 
ominem! St, Augustin is sore on this point; to 
which, however, the pedagogues seem to have 
attached too great importance, since, as he words 
it, they visited with more severity offences against 
the laws of grammar than against those of God. (7) 
Several circumstances concur, in fact, to prove 
that more stress was laid on learning than on 
morals. Parents often sent their children from 
under their own. eye, to distant schools and col- 
leges, where their progress in vice appears to have 
been at least commensurate with that which they 
made in rhetoric and general literature. Still, from. 
the acerbity of his remarks on the theatre, we dis- 
cover the ascetic turn of the public mind, and the 
approximation to a state of things, such as would 
have delighted Sir Andrew Agnew; except that, 
with this aversion to recreation, was united a pro- 
pensity to judicial astrology, divination, magic, 
and a belief in the force of numbers, charms, in- 
cantations, kc. which smelled strongly, he would. 
perhaps think, of heathenism and idolatry.(**) 
But the fascination of the subject is, I see, 
enticing me into much greater detail than would 
be consistent with my present design. I must 
therefore, with. one bound, reach the times of

conditions required by Dr. Wiseman, and other 
Roman Catholics of our day, for the support of 
religion and learning, had long existed in the 
Christian world—bishops’ with princely revenues, 
nobles not inferior in wealth, and those ‘most 
hopeful fosterers of philosophy, the monks—and 
yet learning had disappeared, and religion ‘along 
with it. This, barbarian as he was, Charleniagne 
perceived, and desiring rather to reign over a 
people enlightened and civilized, than over a priest- 
ridden rabble, he sought to revive all liberal 
studies, and along with them the spirit of Chris- 
tianity. ‘ . 
With a true insight into the character of man- 
kind, who despise wisdom obscure and on foot, he 
encouraged learned men by honours and rewards ; 
and set them a good example by applying him- 
self also to study. He established schools in the 
principal cities of his empire, and,—what, no doubt, 
was equally necessary,—in his own palace, which 
was itself, a kind of ambulatory metropolis, as 
Fleury (*) happily. expresses it. The sort of in- 
struction afforded by these schools may be learned 
from several of the Capitularies, where the bishops, 
to whom sad necessity compelled.them to confide 
the business of education, are enjoined to instruct 
children in grammar, arithmetic, and psalmody,

cess, however, was necessarily partial, The des- 
potism of their government, and. the intolerant 
spirit of their religion forbade the growth of a phi- 
losophy healthy and sound ; though such branches 
of literature and science as a tyrant may cultivate 
or. patronise, received encouragement, and were 
not. unsuccessfully cultivated under the Khalifs of 
the house of Abbas. 
Al Mansoor, a prince still renowned in Moham- 
medan history, led the way by his example, apply- 
ing himself diligently.to the study of law and 
astronomy. His grandson, also, Al Mamoon, the 
more readily:and surely to awaken the passion for 
letters among his subjects, collected, and caused to 
be translated into Arabic, the: philosophical and 
scientific works of several Greek authors, such as 
Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Galen, &c. 
The most profuse rewards which a monarch could 
bestow were everywhere, throughout the Mahom- 
medan world, conferred on men of learning; and, as 
the servants of .princes usually smile or frown upon 
whomsoever their masters do, the sovereign’s exam- 
ple was followed by his vizirs and emirs, so that, 
fora time, philosophy wore a fine turban, fed upon 
thrushes, and grew half beside itself amid the warm 
embraces of fortune. 
Tn.the midst of this heyday of literary enthusiasm, 
a vizir expended two hundred thousand pieces of 
gold in founding acollegeat Bagdad, which he, more- 
over, endowed with an annual revenue of fifteen 
thousand dinars, . Here, six thousand students of all 
ranks received instruction; and, as in the despotic

state of modern Prussia, the needy discip]) 
learning were supported at the -public exy 
while the several professors received adequate sasa- 
ries. At a later period, the great “ Mosque: of 
Flowers” at Cairo was, perhaps, still more magni- 
ficently endowed, and frequented by a greater num- 
ber of pupils from every quarter: of the moslem 
world. (3°) 
But the system of. education. that. ieigned para- 
mount in all those vast. establishments, appears 
strongly to have resembled: what we still find: regu- 
lating, among the Orientals, the studies of youth. 
Necessarily adapted to their government and faith, 
and influenced likewise by their national character, 
it was rather calculated to produce an agreeable 
and modest exterior, than any high degree of men- 
tal energy. Still, it cannot be denied that, through 
the Moors of Spain, the Arabs had the merit of in- 
spiring the European nations of the middle.ages 
with something like a love of learning, which, 
though it terminated in the scholastic philosophy, 
kept the mind in some degree awake, and exercised 
it, though in trifling pursuits; till more important 
studies were introduced. 
In that night of ignorance the study of foreign 
languages had utterly failed in Europe. . Even the 
Latin, barbarous as it had become, and easy of ac- 
quirement, was an; object of no attention, though 
still employed as the instrument. of their meagre 
studies. Thislamentable state of things is by some

writers indulgently imputed to the public mis- 
fortunes ‘of ‘the times, infested. by civil wars, the 
ignorant ambition of princes, and the incursions of 
‘barbarous tribes; though, under the free govern- 
ments of antiquity, letters and arts flourished 
amidst the fiercest hostilities, simultaneously with 
that domestic turbulence, upon which so much so- 
phistical declamation has been thrown away. 
It must, nevertheless, be acknowledged that the 
circumstances of the middle ages were sufficiently 
pitiable. But they were the consequences, not the 
cause, of the total neglect of education; for, had 
the ignorant ‘clergy, and the still more ignorant 
nobles, assiduously cultivated the atts which lead 
to greatness in peace and war, their countries could 
never have fallen a prey to the barbarous Notmans, 
and other similay marauders, who have left their 
pernicious spawn in some of the finest provinces 
of Europe. “An enlightened and martial people 
would have had nothing to fear from those savage 
hordes, who might uselessly' have spiked them- 
Selves uponthe chevaux de frise of civilization. 
‘But the struggle was between ignorance and 
‘valour on the one hand, and ignorance and cow- 
ardi¢e on the other.” In that part of Europe which 
had once been civilized, instead of meditating 
upon the means of anieliotating the condition of

trifling and casuistry the blessed doctrines of the 
Gospel. 
Many circumstances. at length. concurred once 
more to rouse the dormant faculties of mankind, 
and turn them in the right direction. . Something 
like a love of learning, or, rather, learning : itself, 
had always found supporters, though few and im- 
perfect, in the empire. of. the .east;:.and;:aa-the 
Turks pressed towards Constantinople, and::from

polity with destruction, numerous learned. and. — 
talented Greeks fled before the approaching storm, 
carrying along with them civilization a second 
time into Latium. Their advent. immediately 
caused a revolution in the system of education. 
Platonism was revived, though not in its pristine 
purity. A superior style of thinking, derived prin- 
cipally from that source, gradually began to. pre- 
vail, and, ascending into the region of politics, hu- 
manized, in some degree, the counsels of princes, 
the last of mankind upon whom philosophy. exer- 
cises any beneficial influence. In effecting this 
change Cosmo de’ Medici was a principal instru- 
ment. He had the wisdom to perceive that.;no 
influence is so sure, no policy so effective, as that 
which is..based on considerations.of public good; 
and he sought to connect the power and welfare of 
his house with the spread of literature and philose- 
phy. For this.purpose he educated, and brought:

learned men, founded, for their use, the Laurentian 
Library, infused the literary spirit into his times, 
and had thus the honour of aiding to transfer the 
empire of the world from the sword to the pen, 
which henceforward forever must bear sway. This 
was irrevocably fixed by the invention of printing, 
which, by neutralizing the influence of the clergy, 
the coadjutors of an armed nobility, and imper- 
ceptibly sapping the foundations of despotism, has 
at length secured the triumph of learning, that, 
directing public opinion, now governs the clergy, 
the military, the court, and whatever else, in bar- 
barous ages, was thought to be the depository of 
power. : 
This great democratic engine, public opinion, 
was, in Italy, chiefly set in motion, as I have said, 
by the Byzantine Greeks, who, though hot from 
the court of a despot, nevertheless aided in develop- 
ing among the Italians the spirit of freedom, both 
by.the works which they explained in their lectures, 
and‘the literature they brought into fashion, of 
-which the whole tendency is republican. There 
existed, however, antagonist principles that pre- 
vented free institutions from taking deep root in 
Italy. Even the grandson of Cosmo, Lorenzo de’ 
Medici, distinguished no less as a poet than asa 
statesman, threw himself into the antidemocratic 
party, and marred the example which Florence 
might otherwise have afforded to Italy. Some- 
thing may, perhaps, be attributed to his education. 
Gentile d'Urbino, the man who directed his early 
studies, was bishop of Arezzo; which may, pro-

bably, account: for Lorenzo’s leaning towards tk 
church, and the ecclesiastical ambition be. exhibite_ 
in indecently thrusting forward his son Giovanni, 
afterwards Leo X., in the priestly career. > : 
The “ Disputationes Camaldulenses” of Landino, 
written about 1468, and Roscoe’s “ Life of Lorenzo 
de’ Medici” furnish a good picture of Italian edu- 
cational institutions in the fifteenth century.: Ma- 
chiavelli, too, both in his historical and: political: 
works, draws aside the veil, and shows us what kind: 
of men those institutions produced. And the reves; 
lation is highly instructive; for, never was more: 
completely verified the saying, “As. you sow, so 
shall you reap,” than in that age, when the intellect 
being cultivated at the expense of the morals and 
the heart, the fruits it produced were perjury, trea- 
chery, secret assassination, tyranny in the prince, 
and baseness in the people. And yet with what 
vigour did the imagination carry on its labours in 
those ages! The whole mass of society seemed to 
be impregnated with fire, and the genius of Dante, 
Petrarca, Beccatelli, and Politiano, flashed forth 
through clouds of impure smoke, like wholesome 
meteors. among the stinking exhalations of the 
Solfaterra, 
But for the people, education, as yet, there was 
none ; and it is a truth not sufficiently insisted on, 
that, whether “the voice of the People” be or be 
not “ the voice of God,” it is the only effectual curb’ 
upon the passions.of the more. powerful.’ Where-

among the crowd, and work their way upward. 
To them was the gospel first preached, and by their 
hands was the saving yoke of Christianity riveted 
on the neck of kings. Among them Christ, here on 
earth, walked habitually. Few else heard his voice. 
He set the example of instructing the poor, of 
caring for men in the inverse ratio of the vain 
world’s care, of removing the curse of the original 
sin from those on whom it pressed most heavily, of 
enlightening those who sat in darkness and the 
shadow of death. Thus practically he wished to 
teach us that all are equal in the sight of God,

beauty of the soul. 
But in Italy, during the ages of which I am 
speaking, Christianity exercised no influence. The

with religion, ¢): the wordling looked upon religion 
as: inconsistent with policy. Between them truth 
lay unnoticed: What sort of wisdom was then in

From that age, however, the number of tho: 
who felt the necessity of education went on increa: 
ing. A sort of instinctive conviction that know- 
ledge is better than ignorance was abroad; and the 
press, enlisting itself on the right side, not merely 
diffused and enlightened this conviction, but made 
it the characteristic distinction of these latter ages. 
Philosophers, emboldened by the sympathies of the 
people, successively attacked the numerous pre- 
judices which stood in the way of a free diffusion 
of knowledge; but it remained for our illustrious 
countryman, to whose Treatise these humble re- 
marks are designed as an introduction, to legislate 
on a grand scale in Pedagogies; and his system, 
the result of long and ardent study, and practical 
observations of every condition of life, may un- 
questionably be considered the most complete, 
the most philosophical, the most humane and 
practicable, that has yet, in any age or language, 
been presented to the world.

To 
EDWARD CLARKE, ESQ. 
oF 
CHIPLEY. 
Sir, 
Turse thoughts conceming education, wich now come abroad 
into the world, do of right belong to you, being written several 
years since for your sake, and are no other than what you have 
already by you in my letters. J have so little varied any thing, 
but only the order of what was sent you at different times, and 
on several occasions, that the reader will easily find, in the fami- 
Hiarity and fashion of the style, that they were rather the private 
conversation of two friends, than a discourse designed for public 
view. 
The importunity of friends is the common apology for publi- 
cations men are afraid to own themselves forward to. But you 
know I can truly say, that if some, who having heard of these 
papers of mine, had not pressed to see them, and afterwards to 
have them printed, they had lain dormant still in that privacy they 
were designed for. But those whose judgment I defer much 
to, telling me that they were persuaded that this rough draught 
of mine might be of some use, if made more public, touched. 
upon what will always be very prevalent with me: for I think 
it every man’s indispensable duty, to do all the service he can to 
his country ; and J see not what difference he puts between himself 
and his cattle, who lives without that thought. This subject is of 
so great concernment, and aright way of education is of so general

advantage, that did I find my abilities answer my wishes, I 
should not have needed exhortations or importunities from others. 
However, the meanness of these papers, and my just distrust of 
them, shall not keep me, by the shame of doing so little, from 
contributing my mite, when there is no more required of me, 
than my throwing it into the public receptacle. And if there be 
any more of their size and notions, who liked them so well, that 
they thought them worth printing, I may flatter myself they 
will not be lost labour to every body. 
I myself have been consulted of late by so many, who profess 
themselves at a loss how to breed their children, and the early 
corruption of youth is now become so general a complaint, that 
he cannot be thought wholly impertinent, who brings the consi- 
deration of this matter on the stage, and offers something, if it 
be but to excite others, or afford matter of correction: for errors 
in education should ‘be less indulged than any. These, like 
faults in the first concoction, that are never mended in the second 
or third, carry their afterwards incorrigible taint with them, 
through all the parts and stations of life. 
I am so far from being conceited of any thing I have here 
offered, that I should not be sorry, even for your sake, if some 
one abler and fitter for such a task would, in a just treatise of 
education, suited to our English gentry, rectify the mistakes I 
have made in this; it being much more desirable to me, that 
young gentlemen should be put into (that which every one ought 
to be solicitous about) the best way of being formed and in- 
structed, than that my opinion should be received concerning it. 
You will, however, in the mean time bear me witness, that the 
method here proposed has had no ordinary effects upon a gentle- 
man’s son it was not designed for. I will not say the good tem- 
per of the child did not very much contribute to it; but this I 
think you and the parents are satisfied of, that a contrary usage, 
according to the ordinary disciplining of children, would not 
have mended that temper, nor have brought him to be in love 
with his book, to takea pleasure in learning, and to desi: 
does, to be taught more, than those about him think fi 
to teach him.
-P-A-G-E-74
EPISTLE DEDICATORY. 5 
But my business is not to recommend this treatise to you, 
whose opinion of it I know already, nor it to the world, either by 
your opinion or patronage. The well educating of their children 
is so much the duty and concern of parents, and the welfare and 
prosperity of the nation so much depends on it, that I would 
have every one lay it seriously to heart; and after having well 
examined and distinguished what fancy, custom, or reason advises 
in the case, set his helping hand to promote everywhere that 
way of training up youth, with regard to their several conditions, 
which is the easiest, shortest, and likeliest to produce virtuous, 
useful, and able men in their distinct callings ; though that most 
to be taken care of is, the gentleman’s calling. For if those of 
that rank are by their education once set right, they will quickly 
bring all the rest into order. 
I know not whether I have done more than shown my good - 
wishes towards it in this short discourse; such as it is, the world 
now has it, and if there be any thing in it worth their acceptance, 
they owe their thanks to you for it. My affection to you gave 
the first rise to it, and I am pleased, that I can leave to pos- 
terity this mark of the friendship which has been between us: 
for I know no greater pleasure in this life, nor a better remem- 
brance to be left behind one, than a long-continued friendship 
with an honest, useful, and worthy man, and lover of his coun-

THOUGHTS 
CONCERNING 
EDUCATION. 
1. A sounp mind in a sound body, is a short, 
but full description of a happy state in this world, 
He that has these two, has little more to wish for ; 
and he that wants either of them, will be but little 
the better for any thing else. Men’s happiness 
or misery is most part of their own making.. He 
whose mind directs not wisely, will never take 
the right way, and he whose body is crazy and 
feeble, will never be able to advance in it. I con- 
fess, there are some men’s constitutions of body and 
mind so vigorous and well framed by nature, that 
they need not much assistance from others, but by 
the strength of their natural genius, they are from 
their cradles carried towards what is excellent; and 
by the privilege of their happy constitutions, are 
able todo wonders, But examples of this kind are 
but few; and I think I may say, that of all the men 
we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, 
good or evil, useful or not, by their education. It 
is that which makes the great difference in mankind. 
The little or almost insensible impressions on our

tender infancies, have very important and lasting 
consequences : and there it is, as in the fountains of 
some rivers, where a gentle application of the hand 
turns the flexible waters into channels, that make 
them take quite contrary courses ; and by this little 
direction given them at first in the source, they re- 
ceive different tendencies, and arrive at last at very 
remote and distant places. (*)

2. I imagine the minds of children as easily 
  
(‘) Nowhere is the great importance of a well conducted edu- 
cation, or the incalculable risk incurred by entrusting the train- 
ing of youth to impostors, more forcibly insisted on, than in the 
introduction to the Protagoras, where, in a light and lively man- 
ner, Socrates discloses to his young friend Hippocrates the vast 
extent of that power which a teacher possesses over the soul of 
his pupil. “You are about to put your spirit into his hands,”” 
says he; and it behoves you well to consider who and what the 
man is, to whose keeping you deliver up so sacred a deposit. 
am sure if you were dangerously ill, it would not without the 
greatest care and consultation be determined what physician 
should be called in; and now that your soul is sick of ignorance, 
and would be healed, beware, lest by aiming to escape from this 
disease, you fall into another far more fatal;” (Plato. Oper. i. 
155, sq. edit, Bekk.) It is time also for us in England to in- 
quire who and what are the men in whose hands the education of 
our youth is placed; whether they are not, in many cases, 
sophists and impostors, who culpably misdirect and misinform the 
minds of their pupils, inculeating prejudices, when they should 
be teaching religion and imparting knowledge; and cherishing. 
those predilections and predispositions by which they may after- 
wards most largely and certainly profit? Instances of such mis~ 
application of the rights and powers of a teacher are numerous, 
and always will be, until the masters of youth are elevated to a 
higher grade in society, and shall constitute a distinct and honour—

tumed this or that way, as water itself; and though 
this be the principal part, and our main care 
should be about the inside, yet the clay-cottage is 
not to be neglected. I shall therefore begin with 
the case, and consider first the health of the body,

happiness; and how requisite a strong constitu-

one that will make any figure in the world, is too 
obvious to need any proof.

without the help of physic, should do for the pre-

its colour from the good or evil management of childhood, have 
been solicitous to ameliorate the discipline affecting the condition 
of ourearly years, Jeremy Taylor, (Life of Christ, vol. i. p. 126

thers, from the example of the Virgin, the duty incumbent on 
them to nourish their own offspring; Rousseau, Buffon, Lace=

least not sickly constitution in their children. And 
this perhaps might be all dispatched in this one 
short rule, viz. That gentlemen should use their 
children, as the honest farmers and substantial yeo- 
men do theirs. But because the mothers possibly 
may think this a little too hard, and the fathers too 
short,I shall explain myself more particularly ; only 
laying down this as a general and certain observa- 
tion for the women to consider, viz. that most 
children’s constitutions are either spoiled, or at 
least harmed, by cockering and tenderness. 
WARMTH. 
5. The first thing to be taken care of, is, that 
children be not too warmly clad or covered, winter 
or summer. The face when we are born, is no 
less tender than any other part of the body. It is 
use alone hardens it, and makes it more able to 
endure the cold. And therefore the Scythian phi- 
losopher gave a very significant answer to the 
Athenian, who wondered how he could go naked 
in frost and snow. “How,” said the Scythian, 
“can you endure your face exposed to the sharp 
winter air?” ‘My face is used to it,” said the 
Athenian.. “Think me all face,” replied the 
‘Scythian. (°) Our bodies will endure any thing 
  
(2) This story is told by Hlian with some variation of cir- 
cumstances.. “A Scythian king observing one of his subjects 
walking about naked during a heavy fall of snow, inquired of him. 
whether he were not cold. ‘Is your forehead cold ?? answered 
the man. The king replied that it was not. ‘Then think me 
all forehead !” said the Scythian.”—(Var. Hist. vii. 6.)

that from the beginning they are accustomed 
to. 
An eminent instance of this, though in the con- 
trary excess of heat, being to our present purpose, 
to show what use can do, I shall set down in the 
author's words, as I meet with it in a late ingeni- 
ous voyage. “The heats,” says he, “are more 
violent in Malta, than in any part of Europe: 
they exceed those of Rome itself, and are perfectly 
stifling; and so much the more, because'there are 
seldom any cooling breezes here, This makes 
the common people as black as gipsies: but yet 
the peasants defy the sun; they work on in the 
hottest part of the day, without intermission, or 
sheltering themselves from his scorching rays. 
This has convinced me, that nature can bring it- 
self to many things which seem impossible, pro- 
vided we accustom ourselves from our infancy. 
The Maltese do so, who harden the bodies of 
their children, and reconcile them to the heat, by 
making them go stark naked, without shirt, drawers, 
or any thing on their heads, from their cradles, till 
they are ten years old.” (*) 
  {*) Nouveau Voyage du Levant, p. 150—175. Though 
this were true of Malta, where, however, the children of the 
poor have a particularly squalid appearance, it can never hold 
good as a rule, even in warmer climates. No children are 
more exposed than those of the Arabs; yet this is so far from 
being favourable to their growth or strength that no children 
I have ever seen, even among the Irish in London, present 
a more wretched or. stunted appearance. Indged, all but those

also was the case at Sparta, and among those barbarous na-

12 WARMTH. 
Give me leave therefore to advise you, not to 
fence too carefully against the cold of this our 
climate. There are those in England, who wear 
the same clothes winter and summer, and that 
without any inconvenience, or more sense of cold 
than others find. But ifthe mother will needs have 
an allowance for frost and snow, for fear of harm, 
and the father for fear of censure, be sure let not 
his winter-clothing be too warm: and amongst 
other things, remember, that when nature has so 
well covered his head with hair, and strengthened 
it with a year or two's age, that he can run about 
by day without a cap, it is best that by night a 
child should also lie without one; there being no- 
thing that more exposes to head-aches, colds, ca- 
tarrhs, coughs, and several other diseases, than 
keeping the head warm. (*) 
6. I have said he here, because the principal 
  
tions of antiquity where bodily strength was sought to be se- 
cured at every hazard. On the contrary, the children of the 
wealthy, who are able properly to clothe and feed them, exhibit 
in Egypt, as everywhere else, the greatest superiority over their 
poorer brethren in strength and beauty.—(Egypt and Mohammed 
Ali, vol, ii. p. 362.) 
(°) I have seen this practice pursued in a large family of 
children with the best possible results, no inconvenience ever 
avising ‘from it, and many complaints, to which children other- 
wise managed are liable, being evidently avoided. While in 
the shade, boys may safely go bareheaded by day, or, during 
ing and winter, even in the sun; but, when the sun shines 
fiercely during the summer months, should no other inconve- 
nience arise, the being exposed bareheaded to its rays, induces a 
habit of pursingsup the eyes, causing early wrinkles, and fre- 
quently slight attacks of ophthalmia. At such times, therefore, as 
many as can afford a cover for the head should wear it.

aim of my discourse is, how a young gentleman 
should be brought up from his infancy, which, in 
all things will not so perfectly suit the education of 
daughters; though where the difference of sex re- 
quires different treatment, it will be no hard matter 
to distinguish. 
7. I would also advise his feet to be washed 
every day in cold water, and to have his shoes so 
thin, that they might leak and let in water, when- 
ever he comes near it. Here, I fear, I shall have 
the mistress and maids too against me. One will 
think it too filthy, and the other perhaps too 
much pains, to make clean his stockings. But 
yet truth will have it, that his health is much 
more worth, than all such considerations, and ten 
times as much more. And he that considers how 
mischievous and mortal a thing taking wet in the 
feet is, to those who have been bred nicely, will 
wish he had, with the poor people’s children, gone 
barefoot, who, by that means, come to be so re- 
conciled by custom to wet in their feet, that they 
take no more cold or harm by it, than if they were 
wet in their hands. And what is it, I. pray, that 
makes this great difference between the hands and 
the feet in others, but only custom? I doubt not, 
but if a man from his cradle had been always used 
to go barefoot, whilst his hands were constantly 
‘wrapt up in warm mittins, and covered with hand- 
shoes, as the Dutch call gloves; I doubt not, I 
say, but such a custom would make taking wet in 
his hands as dangerous to him, as now taking wet 
in their feet is to a great many others. The way

to prevent this, is, to have his shoes made so as to 
Jeak water, and his feet washed constantly every 
day in cold water. (°) It is recommendable for its 
cleanliness ; but that which I aim at in it, is health 5 
and therefore I limit it not precisely to any time of 
the day. I have known it used every night with 
very good success, and that all the winter, with- 
out the omitting it so much as one night in extreme 
cold weather ; when thick ice covered the water, 
the child bathed his legs and feet in it, though he 
was of an age not big enough to rub and wipe them 
himself; and when he began this custom was pu- 
ling and very tender. But the great end being to 
harden those parts, by a frequent and familiar use 
of cold water, and thereby to prevent the mischiefs 
that usually attend accidental taking wet in the feet 
in those who are bred otherwise, I think it may be 
left to the prudence and convenience of the parents, 
to choose either night or morning: the time I deem 
indifferent, so the thing be effectually done. The 
health and hardiness procured by.it, would be a 
good purchase at a much dearer rate. To which, 
if I add, the preventing of corns, that to some men 
would be a very valuable consideration. But begin

always continued from childhood upwards. But, if intermitted 
in youth, the man who, in boyhood, might have defied wet feet, 
will nevertheless be as liable to take cold in after years from the 
accidental use of leaky boots in winter, as if originally educated. 
in the most delicate manner. Generally, however, those who 
have the care of children injure them by over solicitude about their health.

this, as in al] other alterations from our ordinary

tle and insensible degrees; and so we may bring

How fond mothers are like to receive this doce:

them warm? A little to remove their fears by ex- 
amples, without which the plainest reason is sel- 
dom hearkened to: Seneca tells us of himself, (Ep. 
58, and 83,) that he used to bathe himself in cold 
spring-water in the midst of winter. This, if he 
had not thought it not only tolerable, but healthy 
too, he would scarce have done, in an exuberant 
fortune, that could well have borne: the expense of 
a warm bath, and in an age (for he was then old) 
that would have excused greater indulgence. If 
we think his stoical principles led him to this se- 
verity, let it be so, that this sect reconciled cold 
water to his sufferance. What made it agreeable 
to his health ? For that was not impaired by this 
hard usage. But what shall we say to Horace; 
who warmed not himself with the reputation of 
any sect, and least of all affected stoical auste- 
rities ? yet he assures us, he was wont in the win-

ter season to bathe himself in cold water. But, 
perhaps, Italy will be thought much warmer than 
England, and the chillness of their waters not to 
come near ours in winter. If the rivers of Italy 
are warmer, those of Germany and Poland are 
much colder, than any in this our country; and 
yet in these, the Jews, both men and women, 
bathe all over, at all seasons of the year, without 
any prejudice to their health. And every one is 
not apt to believe it is a miracle, or any peculiar 
virtue of St. Winifred’s Well, (7) that makes the 
cold waters of that famous spring do no harm to the 
tender bodies that bathe in it. Every one is now 
full of the miracles done by cold baths on decayed 
and weak constitutions, for the recovery of health 
and strength ; and therefore they cannot be imprac- 
ticable or intolerable for the improving and har- 
dening the bodies of those who are in better cir- 
cumstances, 
If these examples of grown men be not thought 
yet to reach the case of children, but that they may 
be judged still to be too tender, and unable to bear 
such usage, let them examine what the Germans of

the cure; but, if recommended without any reference to super-

whose existence, depended on their superior skill in naval affairs, 
swimming was almost as useful as the knowledge of letters, 
Franklin, in his Letter to Oliver Neele, has made on this subject 
several very good remarks: after giving his friend directions how 
the art is to be acquired, &c. he adds :—“ Learn fairly to swim 5 
as I wish all men were taught todo in their youth: they would, 
on mauy occurrences, be the safer for having that skill, and on 
many more the happier, as freer from painful apprehensions of 
danger, to say nothing of the enjoyment in so delightful and 
wholesome an exercise. Soldiers particularly should, methinks, al) 
be taught toswim ; it might be of frequent use either in surprising 
an enemy or saving themselves. And if I had now boys to edu- 
cate, I should prefer. those schools (other things being equal) 
where an opportunity was afforded for acquiring so advantageous 
an art, which once leamed is néver forgotten.” 
In the Memoirs of his life, written by himself, he describes his 
own proficiency in the art, and glances at the advantages he 
might have acquired by superior skill even in so humble an ac-

both upon the surface of the water, as well as: under it. This 
sight occasioned much astonishment and pleasure to those to

as much as it can be conveniently avoided, they

them know, that a child will never statve nor 
dwindle for want of nourishment, who, ‘besides 
flesb at dinner, and spoon-meat, or some such other 
thing, at supper, may have good bread and beer as 
often as he has a stomach. For thus, upon second 
thoughts, I should judge it best for children to be 
ordered. The morning is generally designed for. 
study, to which a full stomach is but an iM prepara- 
tion. Dry bread, though the best nourishment, 
has the least temptation; and nobody would have 
a child crammed at breakfast, who has-any regard 
to his mind or bady,.and would not have him dull 
and unhealthy. Nor let any one think this unsuit-

16. His drink should be only small beers and 
‘that too he should never be suffered to have be- 
tween meals, but after he had eat a piece of bread. 
The reasons why I say this, are these:—~ .- 
17. 1. More fevers and surfeits are got by peo- 
ple’s drinking when they are hot, than by any 
one thing I know... Therefore, if by play he be 
hot and dry, bread will ill go down; and so if he 
cannot have drink, but upon that condition, he will 
be forced to forbear; for, if he be very hot, he 
should by no means drink ; at least a good piece of 
bread first.to be eaten will gain time to warm the 
beer blood hot,:which then he may drink safely. 
If-he be-very dry, it will go down so warmed, 
and quench his thirst better; and if he will not 
‘drink it so warmed, abstaining will not’ hurt him. 
‘Besides, this will teach him to forbear, which is a 
‘habit of great use for health of body and mind too. 
18. 2. Not being permitted to drink without. eat- 
ing, will: prevent the custom of having the cup 
often at his nose; a dangerous beginning, and pre- 
patation to good fellowship. Men often bring 
habitual hunger and thirst on themselves by cus- 
tom. And if you please to try, you may, though 
he be weaned from it, bring him by use to such a 
necessity again of drinking in the night, that he

   will not be able to sleep without it.. It being ‘the. 
lullaby used by nurses, to still crying children, 1 
believe mothers generally find some difficulty to 
wean their. children from drinking in the night, 
when they first take them home. — Believe it, cus- 
tom prevails.as much by day as by night ;.and you 
may, if you please, bring any one ‘to be: ‘thirsty

twenty-four hours, than I did. Try it when you | 
please, you may with small, as well as with strong 
beer, drink yourself into a drought. The great 
thing to be minded in education is what habits you 
settle ; and therefore in this, as all other things, do 
not begin to make any thing customary, the prac. 
tice whereof you would not have continue, and 
increase. It is convenient for health and sobriety, 
to drink no more than natural thirst requires; and 
he that eats not salt meats, nor drinks strong drink, 
will seldom thirst between meals, unless he. has 
been accustomed to such unseasonable drinking, 
19, Above all, take great care that he seldom, if 
ever, taste any wine or strong drink. There is 
nothing so ordinarily given children in England,

berries, cherries, gooseberries, or currants, when 
thorough ripe, I think may be pretty safely allowed 
them, and that with a very liberal hand, if they be 
eaten with these cautions :——1. Not after meals, as 
we usually do, when the stomach is already full of 
other food : but I think they should be eaten rather 
before or between meals, and children should have 
them for their breakfast. 2. Bread eaten with 
them. 3. Perfectly ripe. If they are thus eaten, 
J imagine them rather conducing than hurtfal to 
our health. Summer-fruits, being suited to the 
hot season of the year they come in, refresh our 
stomachs, languishing’ and fainting under it; and 
therefore I should not be altogether so strict in this 
point, as some are to their children: who being 
kept so very short, instead of a moderate quantity 
of well-chosen fruit, which being allowed them, 
would content them, whenever they can get loose, 
or bribe a servant to supply them, satisfy their 
longing with any trash they can get, and eat toa 
surfeit. : 
Apples and pears too, which are thorough ripe, 
and have been gathered some time, I think may 
be safely eaten at any time, and in pretty large 
quantities; especially apples, which never did any 
body burt, that I have heard, after October. 
Fruits also dried without sugar, I think very 
wholesome. But sweetmeats of all kinds are to 
be avoided ; which, whether they do more harm to 
the maker or eater, is not. easy to tell. This I am 
sure, it is one of the most inconvenient ways of ex-

: _ SLEEP. 
2h Of all that looks soft and effeminate, nothing 
is more to be indulged children, than sleep. In 
this alone they are to be permitted-to have their 
full satisfaction ; nothing contributing more to the 
growth and health of children than sleep. All that 
is to be regulated in it, is,in what part of the 
twenty-four hours they should take it; .which will 
easily be resolved, by only saying, that it is of 
great use to accustom them to rise early in the 
morning. It is best so to do, for health; and he 
that, from his childhood, has, by a settled custom, 
made rising betimes easy and familiar to him, will 
not, when he is a man, waste the best and most 
useful part of his life in drowsiness, and lying in 
bed. (!7) - If children therefore are to be called up 
early in the morning, it will follow of course, that 
they must go to bed betimes ;. whereby they will be 
accustomed to avoid the unhealthy and unsafe 
hours of debauchery, which are those of the even- 
('”): They who have had the care of children well know how 
impossible it is to abridge with safety the quantity of sleep re- 
quired by their different temperaments ; and how unphilosophi- 
eal are the views of those who would regulate it, not aceording 
to’ the constitution, but to the age. Some, for. their health’s 
sake, have need of much more sleep than others; and, perhaps, 
in childhood, it is the more robust that require most. As a ge- 
neral rule, it may be laid dewn that, during the first years of their 
lives, children need more repose than afterwards ; and many,

wine: until midnight. You are now, by the accus- 
toming of his tender years, to indispose him to 
those inconveniences as much ag you-can ; and it 
will be no small advantage, that contrary’ practice 
having made sitting up uneasy to him, it will make 
him often avoid, and very seldom propose midnight 
revels. But if it should not reach so far, but fashion 
and company should prevail, and make bim live as 
others do above twenty, it is worth the while to 
accustom him to early rising and early going to 
bed between this and that, for the present improve- 
ment of his health, and other advantages. 
Though I have said, a large allowance of sleep, 
even as much as they will take, should be made to 
children when they are little; yet I do’ not mean, 
that it should always be continued to them in so 
large a proportion, and they suffered to indulge a 
drowsy laziness in their bed, as they grow up 
bigger. But whether they should begin to be 
restrained at seven, or ten years old, or any other 
time, is impossible to be precisely determined. 
Their tempers, strength, and constitutions, must be 
considered. But some time between seven and 
fourteen, if they are too great lovers of their beds, 
I think it may be seasonable to begin to reduce 
them by degrees to about eight hours, which is 
generally rest enough for healthy grown people. 
If you have accustomed him as you shoald do, to 
rise constantly very early in the morning, this fault 
of being too long in bed will easily be reformed, 
and most children will be forward enough to shorten 
that time themselves, by coveting to sit up with the

company at night; though if they be not looked 
after, they will be apt to take it out in the morn- 
ing, which should by no means be permitted. They 
should constantly be called up and-made to rise at 
their early hour; but great care should be taken in 
waking them, that it be not done hastily, nor with © 
a loud or shrill voice, or any other sudden violent 
noise, This often affrights children, and does them 
great harm ; and sound sleep thus broke off, with 
sudden alarms, is apt enough to disoompose any 
one. (°) When children are to be wakened out of 
their sleep, be sure to begin with a low call; and 
some gentle motion, and so draw them out of it by 
degrees, and give them none but kind words and 
usage, until they are come perfectly to themselves, 
and being quite dressed, you are sure they are 
thoroughly awake. The being forced from their 
sleep, how gently soever you do it, is pain enough 
to them ; and care should be taken not to add any 
other uneasiness to it, especially such that may 
terrify them.

stool regularly: people that are very loose, havé 
seldom strong thoughts, or strong bodies. But the 
cure of this, both by diet and medicine, being much 
more easy than the contrary evil, there needs not 
much to be said about it: for if it come to threaten, 
either by its violence or duration, it will soon 
enough, and sometimes too soon, make a physician 
be sent for; and if it be. moderate or short, it is 
commonly best to leave it to nature. On the other 
side, costiveness has too its ill effects, and is much 
harder to be dealt with by physic; purging mediz 
cines, which seem to give relief, rather increasing 
than removing the evil. 
24. It being an indisposition I had a particular 
reason to, inquire into, and not finding the cure of 
it in books, I set my thoughts on work, believing, 
that greater changes than that might be made in 
our bodies if we took the right course, and pro- 
ceeded by rational steps. : 
1, Then I considered, that going to stool, was 
the effect of certain motions of the body; especially 
of the peristaltic motion of the guts. ~ - - : 
2. I considered, that several motions, that were 
not perfectly voluntary, might yet, by use and con- 
stant application, be brought to: be habitual, if by 
an unintermitted custom they were at certain sea- 
sons endeavoured to be constantly. produced. ; 
3. I had observed some men, who by taking 
after supper a pipe of tobacco, never failed of a 
stool, and began to doubt with myself, whether ‘it 
were not more custom, than the tobacco, that gave 
them the benefit of nature; or at least, if the to-
-P-A-G-E-109
40 COSTIVENESS; 
bacco did it, it was rather by exciting. a vigorous 
motion in the guts, than by any purging quality ; 
for then it would have had other effects.. Having 
thus once got the opinion, that it was possible to 
make it habitual, the next thing was to consider 
what way and means was the likeliest to obtain it. 
4, Then I guessed, that if a man, after his first 
eating in the morning, would presently solicit na- 
ture, and try whether he could strain himself so as 
to obtain a stool, he might in time, by a constant 
application, bring it to be habitual. ~ 
25, The reasons that made me choose that time, 
were, 1. Because the stomach being then empty, if it 
received any thing grateful toit (for I would never, 
but in case of necessity, have any oneeat, but what 
he likes, and when he has an appetite) it was apt to 
embrace it close by a strong constriction of its fibres ; 
which constriction, I supposed, might probably be 
continued on in the guts, and se increase their peris- 
taltic motion, as we see in the ileus, that an inverted 
motion, being begun anywhere below, continues 
itself all the whole length, and makes even the 
stomach obey that irregular motion. 
2. Because when men eat they usually relax 
their thoughts, and the spirits, then free from other 
employments, are more vigorously distributed into 
the lower belly, which thereby contribute to the 
same effect, . 
3. Because, whenever men have leisure to eat, 
they have leisure enough also to make so much 
court to Madam Cloacina, as would be ne 
to our present purpose ; but else, in the variety of
-P-A-G-E-110
COSTIVENESS, al 
human affairs-and accidents, it was impossible to 
affix it to any hour certain, whereby the custom 
would be interrupted. Whereas men in health 
seldom failing to eat once a day, though the hour 
changed, the custom might still be preserved. 
26. Upon these grounds the experiment began to 
be tried, and I have known none who have been 
steady in the prosecution of it, and taken. care,to.go 
constantly to the necessary-house; after their. first 
eating, whenever that happened, whether «they 
found themselves called on or not, and there endea- 
your to put nature upon her duty, but in a few 
months they obtained the desired success, : and 
brought themselves to so regular a habit, that 
they seldom ever failed of a stool after their first 
eating, unless it were by their own negleet: for, 
whether they have any motion or not, if they go. to 
the place, and do. their part, they are sure to have 
nature very obedient. 
27. I would therefore advise, that this course 
should be taken with a child every day presently 
after he has eaten his breakfast. Inet him be set 
upon the stool, as if disburthening were. as much 
in his power, as filling his belly; and Jet not him 
or his maid know any thing to the contrary, but 
that it is so; and if he be forced to endeavour, by 
being hindered from his play, or eating again till 
he has been effectually at stool, or at least done his

that better than the ladies’ diet-drinks or apothe: 
caries’ medicines. Have a great care of tampering 
that way, lest, instead of preventing, you draw on 
diseases. Nor even upon every little indisposition 
is physic to be given, or the physician to be called 
to children, especially if he be a busy man, that will 
presently fill their windows with gallipots, and _ 
their stomachs with drugs. It is safer to leave them 
wholly to nature, than to put them into the hands 
of one forward to tamper, or that thinks children 
are to be cured, in ordinary distempers, by any 
thing but diet, or by a method very little distant 
from it: it seeming suitable both to my reason 
and experience, that the tender constitutions, of 
children should have as little done to them as. is 
possible, and as the absolute necessity of the case 
requires. A little cold-stilled red poppy-water, 
which is the true surfeit-water, with ease, and ab- 
stinence from flesh, often puts an end to several 
distempers in the beginning, which, by too forward 
applications, might have been made lusty diseases. 
When such a gentle treatment. will not stop the 
growing mischief, nor hinder it from turning into 
a formed disease, it will be time to seek the advice 
of some sober and discreet physician: In this part, 
T hope, I shall find an easy belief; and nobody 
can have a pretence to doubt. the advice of one 
who has spent some time in the study of physic,

strength and vigour, so that it may be able to obey 
and execute the orders of the mind; the next and 
principal business is, to set the mind right, that on 
all occasions it may be disposed to consent to 
nothing but what may be suitable to the dignity 
and.excellency of @ rational creature. . 
32. If what I have said in the beginning of this 
discourse be true, as.I do not doubt but it is, viz. 
That the difference to be found in the manners and 
abilities of men is owing more to their education, 
than to any thing else,(*) we have reason to con- 
clude, that great care is to be had of forming chil- 
dren’s minds, and giving them that seasoning early, 
which shajl influence their lives always after: for 
when they do well or ill, the praise or blame will 
be laid there; and when any thing is done awk-

wardly, the common saying will pass upon them, 
that it is suitable to their breeding. 
33. As the strength of the body lies chiefly in 
being able to endure hardships, so’also does that 
ofthe mind. And the great principle and founda- 
tion of all virtue and worth is’ placed in this, 
That a man is able to deny himself his own de- 
sires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow 
what reason directs as best, though the appetite 
lean the other way. 
34, The great mistake I have observed in people's 
breeding their children, has been, that this has not 
been taken care enough of in its due season; that 
the mind has not been made obedient to discipline, 
and pliant to reason, when at first it was most 
tender, most easy to be bowed. Parents. being 
wisely ordained by natare to love their children, 
are very apt, if reason watch not that natural af- 
fection very warily, are apt, I say, to let it run into 
fondness. They love their little ones, and it is 
their duty; but they often, with them, cherish their 
faults too. They must not be crossed, forsooth; 
they must be permitted to have their wills in all 
things; and they being in their infancies not ca- 
pable of great vices, their parents think they may 
safely enough indulge their irregularities, and make 
themselves sport with that pretty perverseness 
which they think well enough becomes that inno- 
cent age. But to a fond parent, that would not 
have his child corrected for a perverse trick, but 
excused it, saying it was a small matter, Solon

36, The fondling must be taught to ‘strike and 
‘call names, must have what he calls for, and 
do what he pleases. Thus parents, by humouring 
and cockering them when little, corrupt the prin- 
ciples of nature in their children, and wonder after- 
wards to taste the bitter waters, when. they them- 
selves have poisoned the fountain. For when their 
children are grown up, and these ill habits with 
them; when they are now too big to be dandled, 
and their parents can no longer make use of them 
as play-things, then they. complain that the brats 
are uritoward and perverse; then they are offended 
to see them wilful, and are troubled with those ill 
humours which they themselves infused and fo- 
mented in them ; and then, perhaps too late, would 
be glad to get out those weeds which their own 
hands have planted, and which now have taken too 
deep’a root to be easily extirpated. For he that 
. hath been used to have his will in every thing, as 
long as he was in coats, why should we think it

it still, when he is in breeches? Indeed, as he grows 
more towards a man, age shows his faults the more; 
so that there be few parents then so blind.as not , 
to see them, few so insensible as not to feel the ill” 
effects of their own indulgence.* He had the will 
of his maid before he could speak or go; he had 
the mastery of his parents ever since he could 
prattle; and why, now he is grown up, is stronger 
and wiser than he was then, why now of. a sudden 
must he be restrained and curbed? Why must he 
at seven, fourteen, or twenty years-old, lose the 
privilege, which the parents’ indulgence until then 
so largely allowed him ? Try it in a dog or a horse, 
or any other creature, and see whether the ill and 
resty tricks they have learned when. young, are 
easily to be mended when they are. knit; and yet 
none of those creatures are half so wilful and 
proud, or half so desirous to be masters of them- 
selves and others, as man. 
36. We are generally wise enough to begin 
with them when they are very young, and disci- 
pline betimes those other creatures we would make 
useful and good for somewhat. They are only 
our own offspring, that we neglect in this point; 
and having made. them ill children, we foolishly 
expect they should be good men. For if the child 
must have grapes or sugarplums when he has a 
mind to them, rather than make the poor baby cry, 
or be out of humour; why, when he is grown up, 
must he not be satished too, if his desires carry 
him to wine or women? They are objects as suit- 
able to the longing of one of more years, as what

he cried for, when little, was to the inclinations 
ofa. child. The having desires, accommodated to 
~gathe apprehensions and relish of those several ages, 
is not the fault; but the not having them subject 
to the rules and restraints of reason: the difference 
lies not in having or not having appetites, but in 
the power to govern, and deny ourselves in them. 
He that is not used to submit his will to the reason 
of others when he is young, will scaree hearken to 
submit to his own reason when he is of an age to 
make use of it. And what kind of a man such a 
one is like to prove, is easy to foresee. 
37. These are oversights usually committed by 
those who seem to take the greatest care of their 
children’s education. But if we look into the com- 
mon management of children, we shall have rea- 
son to wonder, in the great dissoluteness of man- 
ners which the world complains of, that there are 
any footsteps at all left of virtue. I desire to know 
what vice can be named, which parents, and those 
about children, do not season them with, and drop 
into them:the seeds of, as soon as they are capable 
to receive them? I do not mean by the examples 
they give, and the patterns they set before them, 
which is encouragement enough; but that which T 
would take notice of here is, the downright teach- 
ing them vice, and actual putting them out of the 
way of virtue. Before they can go, they principle 
them with violence, revenge, and cruelty. Give

do any mischief. But I ask, does nog this. corrupt 
their mind? Is not this the way .of force and vio- 
lence, that they are set in? And if they, hhaye been 
taught when little, to strike and bust others by ¢* 
proxy, and encouraged to rejoice in the harm they 
have brought upon them, and see.them suffer, are 
they not prepared to-do it when they areistrong 
enough to be felt themselves, and oa strike, to 
some purpose ? 
The coverings of our: bodies,, which . for 
desty, warmth, and defence, are by the: folly or vice” 
of parents recommended to their children for other 
ases. They are made matter of vanity and emu- 
lation. A child is set a longing after a new suit, 
for the finery of it; and when, the: little girl is 
tricked up in her new gown and commode, how 
can her mother do less: than teach: her- to admire 
herself, by calling her, her hittle queen and her 
princess? Thus the little ones are taeght. to be 
proud of their clothes, before they can put them 
on, And why should they not continue to value 
themselves for this outside fashionableness of the 
tailor or tirewoman’s making, when ;their parents 
have so early instructed them to do.so.?: 
Lying and equivocations, and excuses little dif. 
ferent from lying, are put into the mouths of young 
people, and commended in apprentices and chil- 
dren, whilst they are for their masters’ or parents’ 
advantage. And.can it be thought, that he that

under tuition, their healths perhaps may be pretty 
well secured, yet their desires must needs yield to 
the lessons which everywhere will be read to them 
upon this part of epicurism. The commendation 
that eating well has everywhere, cannot fail to be 
a successful incentive to. natural appetites, and 
bring them quickly to the liking and expense of a

present pleasure or pain, for the sake of what reason 
tells him is fit-to be done, wants the true principle 
of virtue and industry, and is in danger of never 
being good for:any thing. This temper, therefore, so 
contrary to unguided nature, is to be got betimes ;

and this habit, as the true foundation of future 
ability and happiness, is to be wrought into the 
mind as early as may be, even from the first dawn= 
ings of knowledge or apprehension in children, and 
so to be confirmed in them, by-all the care and 
ways imaginable, by those who have the: oversight 
of their education.

and humbled too much in children;.if: their: spi-

industry, and are in a worse state than the forme: 
For extravagant young fellows, that have liveliness 
and spirit, come sometimes to be set right, and: 80 
make able and great men: but dejected minds, 
timorous and tame, and low spirits, are hardly 
ever to be raised, and very seldom attain to any: 
thing. To avoid the danger that is on either hand, 
is the great art; and he that has found a way how 
to keep up a child’s spirits easy, active, and free; 
and yet at the same time to restrain him from 
many things he has a mind to, and to draw him 
to things that are uneasy to him; he, I say, that 
knows how to reconcile these seeming contradic- 
tions, has, in my opinion, got the true secret of 
education. 
47. The usual, lazy, and short way by chas- 
tisement, and the rod, which is the only instrument 
of government that tutors generally know or ever 
think of, is the most unfit: of any to be used in 
education, because it tends.to both those mischiefs;,

not.at all to the mastery of our! nateral propensity 
to indulge corporal and’ present pleasure, and to 
avoid pain at any rate, but rather éncourages it, and 
thereby strengthens that in’ us, which’ is-the root 
from whence spring all'vicious actions, and the ir- 
regularities of life. For what other motive, but of 
sensual pleasure and pain, does-a child act by, who 
drudges at his book against his inclinations, or ab- 
stains from eating tnwholesome fruit, that’ he takes 
pleasure ‘i, only: out of fear of whipping?. He in 
this only prefers the greater ‘corporal pleasure, or 
avoids the greater corporal pain. And’ what is it, 
to govern his actions, and direct his conduct by 
such motives as‘these ? What is it, E say, but to 
cherish that principle in him, which it is our busi- 
ness to root obtand destroy ? And therefore I can- 
not think‘any correction useful to ‘a child, where 
the shame of suffering for having done amiss, does 
not work more upon him than the pain. 
49. 2. This sort of correction naturally breeds 
an aversion to that which itis the tutor’s business 
to create a liking to. How obvious is it to ob- 
serve, that children come to hate things which

him ; but when that is removed, and by being-ont

the greater scope to his natural inclination ; which

52. Beating them, and all other sorts of slavish 
and corporal punishments, are not the discipline 
fit to be used in the education: of those we would 
have wise, good, and -ingenuous men; and there- 
fore very rarely tobe‘ applied, and that only in 
  (?5) Of all questions connected with the subject of education, this 
of personal chastisement would appear to be the most difficult. 
Locke’s idea that it breaks the spirit of children is confuted by the 
experience of all agess nor is ita jot more correct to say that it 
naturally creates an aversion to learning, in any who are not born 
to be dunces. Both at:Athens and Sparta, not only the boys, 
bit the youth, even in the gymmasia, had their irregularities 
punished with stripes, undoubtedly without their spirits being 
)roken, or any aversion created for those studies by which they 
were to distinguish themselves in the republic. Correction is in- 
flicted in our own country with like results. But the question is, 
respecting its efficacy in promoting the ends of discipline, and 
whether other punishments might not be employed with equal or 
greater advantage. My own experience, as the father of a nu- 
‘merous family, is, that. they cannot. With a few timid un- 
energetic natures, or where a child is brought up, in the midst of 
grown persons, alone, confinement, sour looks, banishment from 
the society of those they love, may, perhaps, be found sufficient, 
particularly with girls; but no man, who has ever had to deal 
with a house full of robust, high-spirited, energetic, adventurous 
boys, could ever hope to maintain order, or enforce application,    
sometimes having recourse to the rod. I hear, indeed, of such

great occasions, and cases of extremity. On the 
other side, to flatter children by rewards of things 
that are pleasant to them, is as carefully to be 
avoided. He that will give to his son-apples, or 
sugarplums, or what else of this kind he is most 
delighted with, to make him learn his book, does

cation of a gentle spirit, nurtured for honour and liberty. "There 
is, I know not what of servility in rigour and coristraint; and, in 
my opinion, that which cannot be effected by reason, prudence, 
and care, will never be effected by force. Thus was I brought

that they have those enjoyments, only as the con- 
sequences of the state of esteem and acceptation 
they are in with their parents and governors; but 
they should never be offered or bestowed on them, 
as the rewards of this or that particular perform- 
ance, that they show an aversion to, or to which 
they would not have applied themselves without 
that temptation. 
54, But if you take away the rod on one hand, 
and these little encouragements, which they are 
taken with, on the other, how then (will you say} 
shall children be governed? Remove hope and 
fear, and there is an end of all discipline. I grant 
that good and evil, reward and punishment, are 
the only motives to a rational creature: these are 
the spur and reins whereby all mankind are set 
on work, and guided, and therefore they are to be 
made use of to children too. For I advise their 
parents and governors always to carry this in their 
minds, that children are to be treated as rational 
creatures. 
55. Rewards, I grant, and punishments must be 
proposed to children, if we intend to work upon 
them. The mistake I imagine is, that those that 
are generally made use of, are ill chosen. The pains 
and pleasures of the body are, I think, of ill con- 
sequence, when made the rewards and punishments 
whereby men would prevail on their children ; for, 
as I said before, they serve but to increase and 
strengthen those inclinations, which it is our busi- 
ness to subdue and master. What principle of vir-

and dangerous fruit, you purchase his quiet by 
giving him a less hurtful sweetmeat.*-This per-

and sets that farther out of order. For here you 
only change the object, but flatter still ‘his appe- 
tite, and allow that must, be satisfied, wherein, as I 
have shown, lies the root of the mischief; and 
until you bring him to be able to beara denial of 
that satisfaction, the child may at present be quiet 
and orderly, but the disease is not cured. By this 
way of proceeding, you foment and cherish in him 
that which is the spring from whence all the evil 
flows, which will be sure on the next occasion to 
break out again with more. violence, give him 
stronger longings, and you more trouble. . 
56. The rewards and punishments then, whereby 
we should keep children in order, are quite of 
another kind, and of that force, that when we can 
get them once to work, the business, I think, is 
done, and the difficulty is over. Esteem and dis- 
grace are, of all others, the most powerful incen- 
tives to the mind, when once it. is brought to relish 
them. If you can once get into chi

seek the ways (and practise them when found) to 
attain this, which I look on as the. great secret of 
education. (*) 
57, First, children (earlier perhaps than we think) 
are very sensible of praise and commendation. 
They find a pleasure in being esteemed and valued, 
especially by their parents, and those. whom. they 
depend on. If therefore the father caress and.com- 
mend them when they do well, show a cold ‘and 
neglectful countenance to them upon doing ill, and 
this accompanied by a like carriage of the mother, 
and all others that are about them, it will in a little 
time make them sensible of the difference; and this, 
if constantly observed, I doubt not but will of itself 
work more than threats or blows, which lose their 
force when once grown common, and are of no use 
when shame does not attend them ; and therefore 
are to be forborne, and never to be used, but in the 
case hereafter mentioned, when it is brought to 
extremity. : 
58. But, secondly, To make the sense of esteem 
  
() This, no doubt, is a most important consideration. The 
love of praise, and the dread of blame exist in all men; -but in 
many, perhaps in most, they are too feeble to be relied on as 
steady principles of action. Dull, heavy, unambitious children, 
{and the same is true of men,) will more frequently yield to 
their indolence, or be diverted from their duty by the allure. 
ments of play, or by any. other temptation, than they will by the 
dread of censure, or desire of approbation, be irresistibly im. 
pelled towards what is right. On the other hand, ingenuous 
lads, alive to all the nobler influences, may be very powerfully 
operated upon by the hope of: praise.

or disgrace sink the deeper, and be-of the more 
weight; other agreeable or disagreeable things 
should constantly accompany these different states; 
not as particular rewards and purishments of this 
or that particular action, but as necessarily be- 
longing to, and constantly attending one, who 
by his carriage has brought himself into a state of 
disgrace or commendation. By which way of 
treating them, children may as much as possible be 
brought to conceive, that those that are commended, 
and in esteem for doing well, will necessarily be 
beloved and cherished hy évery body, and have all 
other good things as a consequence of it; and on 
the other side, when any one by miscarriage falls 
into disesteem, and cares not to preserve his credit, 
he will unavoidably fall under neglect and con- 
tempt; and in that state, the want of whatever 
might satisfy or delight him will follow. In this 
way the objects of their desires are made assisting 
to virtue, when a settled experience from the begin- 
ning teaches children that the things they delight 
in, belong to, and are to be enjoyed by those only 
who are in a state of reputation. If by these means 
you can come once to shame them out of their 
faults, (for besides that, I would willingly have no 
punishment,) and make them in love with the plea- 
sure of being well thought of, you may turn them 
as you please, and they will be in love with all the 
ways of virtue.

hardly to be hindered from crossing herein the 
design of the father and mother. Children dis- 
countenanced by their parents for any. fault, find 
usually a refuge and relief in the caresses of those 
foolish flatterers, who thereby undo whatever the 
parents endeavour to establish. | When the father 
or mother looks sour on the child, every body: else 
should put on the same coldness to him, and:no+

right again, and restored him to his former cre- 
dit. (7) If this were constantly observed, 1 guess 
there would be little need of blows or chidings: 
their own ease and satisfaction would quickly teach 
children to court. commendation, and avoid doing 
that which they found every body condemned, and 
they were sure to suffer for, without being chid

(7) The co-operation of servants, in the work of education, is 
extremely difficult to command. This portion of the treatise re- 
gards more the education of those who have the management of 
children, than of the children themselves; and ultimately re- 
solves itself into this :—be wise and vittuous yourselves, and your 
children will be so. Unfortunately, it-is easier to desire than to 
obtain wisdom. We move in a vicious circle: because our 
parents were unwise our education, which should have rendered 
us so, was ill-directed ; we, therefore, lack the wisdom necessary 
to enable us effectually to instruct our children ;‘for this reason 
they, in their turn, are imperfectly trained ; and must transmit 
their imperfections to posterity. But this should not discourage 
us from. attempting all we can; for, though the children of So- 
crates were not wise, and those of Pericles and Alcibiades undis- 
tinguished for ability, we mast not lose faith in the force of exe

quickly cease, and a few blows fully expiate. 
Parents should well consider what faults in their 
children are weighty enough to deserve the de- 
claration of their anger: but when their displea- 
sure is once declared to a degree that carries any 
punishment with it, they ought not presently to 
lay by the severity of their brows, but to restore 
their children to their former grace, with. some 
difficulty, and delay a full reconciliation, until their 
conformity, and more than ordinary merit make 
good their amendment. If this be not so ordered, 
punishment will, by familiarity, become a mere 
thing of course, and lose all its influence; offend- 
ing, being chastised, and then forgiven, will be 
thought as natural and necessary, as noon, night, 
and morning following one another. 
61. Concerning reputation, I shall only remark 
this one thing more of it, that though it be not the 
true principle and measure of virtue, (for that is 
the knowledge of a man’s duty, and the satisfaction 
it is to obey his Maker, in following the dictates 
of that light God has given him, with the hopes 
of acceptation and reward,) yet it is that which 
comes nearest to it: and being the testimony and 
applause that other people’s reason, as it were by 
a common consent, gives to virtuous and well- 
ordered actions, it is the proper guide and encou- 
ragement of children, until they grow able to judge 
for themselves, and to find what i is right by their . 
own reason, : 
62. This consideration may direct parents how
-P-A-G-E-141
72 CHILDISHNESS. 
to manage themselves, in reproving and commend- 
ing .their children. The rebukes and chiding, 
which their faults will sometimes make hardly to 
_be avoided, should not only be: in ‘sober, grave, 
and unpassionate words, but also alone and in pri- 
yate: but the commendations children deserve, 
they should receive before’ others. This doubles 
the reward, by spreading their praise; but the 
backwardness parents show in divulging their faults, 
will make them set a greater value on their credit 
themselves, and teach them to be the more careful 
to preserve the good opinion of others, whilst they 
think they have it: hut when being exposed to 
shame, by publishing their miscarriages, they give 
it up for lost, that. check upon them is taken off, 
and they will be the less careful to preserve others’ 
good thoughts of them, the more they suspect that 
their reputation with them is already blemished. 
63. But if a right course be taken with children, 
there will not be so much need of the application 
of the common rewards and punishments, as we 
imagine, and as the general practice has esta- 
blished. For all their innocent folly, playing, and 
childish ‘actions, are to be left perfectly free and 
unrestrained, as far as they can consist with the 
respect due to those that are present; and that 
with the greatest allowance. If these faults of 
their age, rather than of the children themselves, 
were, as they should be, left only to time and 
imitation, and riper years to cure, children would 
escape a great deal of misapplied and useless cor-
-P-A-G-E-142
ROLES. 73 
rection, which either fails to overpower the natural 
disposition of their childhood, and so by an ineffec- 
tual familiarity, makes correction in other neces- 
sary cases of less use; or else if it be of force to 
restrain the natural gaiety of that age, it serves 
only to spoil the temper both of body and mind, 
If the noise and bustle of their. play prove at 
any time inconvenient, or unsuitable to the place 
or company they are in, (which can only be.where 
their parents are,) a look or a word from the father 
or mother, if they have established the authority 
they should, will be enough either to remove or 
quiet them for that time. But this gamesome 
humour, which is wisely adapted by nature to 
their age and temper, should rather be encouraged 
to keep up their spirits, and improve their strength 
and health, than curbed and restrained ; and the 
chief art is to make all that they. have to do, sport 
and play too. 
RULES. 
64, And here give me leave to take notice of 
one thing I think a fault in the ordinary method 
of education; and that is, the charging of children’s 
memories, upon all occasions, with rules and pre- 
cepts, which they often do not understand, and 
constantly as soon forget as given... If it be some 
action you would have done, or done otherwise, 
whenever they forget, or do it awkwardly, make 
them do it over and over again, until they are 
perfect; whereby you will get these two advan-
-P-A-G-E-143
74 RULES. 
tages: first, to see whether it-be anaction they 
can do, or is fit to be expected of them ; -for some- 
times children are bid to do things, which upon 
trial they are found not able todo, and had need 
be taught and exercised in, before they are re- 
quired to do them. But it is much easier for a 
tutor to command than to teach. Secondly, ano- 
ther thing got by it will be this, that by repeating 
the same action, until it be grown habitual in them, 
the performance will not’ depend on memory or 
reflection, the concomitant of prudence and age, 
and not of childhood, but will be natural in them. 
Thus bowing to a gentleman, when he salutes him, 
and looking in his face, when he speaks to him, is 
by constant use as natural to a well-bred man, as 
breathing; it requires no thought, no reflection. 
Having this way cured in your child, any fault, it 
is cured for ever: and thus one by one you may 
weed them out all, and plant what habits you please, 
65. I have seen parents so heap rules on their 
children, that it was impossible for the poor little 
ones to remember a tenth part of them, much less 
to observe them. However, they were either by 
words or blows corrected for the breach of those 
multiplied, and often very impertinent precepts. 
Whence it naturally followed, that the children 
minded not.what was said. to them, when it was 
evident to them that no attention they were capable 
of was sufficient to preserve them from transgres- 
sion, and the rebukes which followed it. 
Let therefore your rules to your son be as few ag
-P-A-G-E-144
HABITS. 7 
possible, and rather fewer than more than seem ab- 
solutely necessary. For if you burden him with 
many rules, one of these two things must necessa- 
rily follow; that either he must be very often 
punished, which will be of ill consequence, by 
making punishment too frequent and familiar; or 
else you must let the transgressions of some of your 
rules go unpunished, whereby they will of course 
grow contemptible, and your authority hecome 
cheap to him. Make but few laws, but see they 
be well observed when once made. Few years re- 
quire but few laws, and as his age increases, when 
one rule is by practice well established, you may 
add another. 
HABITS, 
66. But pray remember, children are not to be 
taught by rules which will be always slipping out 
of their memories, What you think necessary for 
them to do, settle in them by an indispensible prac- 
tice, as often as the occasion returns; and if it be 
possible, make occasions. This will beget habits in 
them, which being once established, operate of 
themselves easily and naturally, without the assist- 
ance of the memory. But here let me give two 
cautions. 1. The one is, that you keep them to

care of, is, not to endeavour to! :settle.‘too many 
habitsati once, lest by variety you confound them, 
and: so perfect none. When. constant custom has 
made any one thing easy and natural to them, and 
they practise it without reflection, you may then 
‘6 on to another. 
. This method of teaching children by repeated 
‘practice, and the same action done over and over 
again, under the eye and direction of the tutor, 
till they have got the habit of doing.it well, and 
not by relying on rules trusted to their memories, 
has so many advantages, which way ever we con- 
sider .it, that I. cannot but wonder (if i] customs 
could be wondered at in any thing) how. it could 
possibly be so much neglected. I shall name one 
more that comes now in my way. By this method 
we shall see whether what is required of him be 
adapted to. his capacity, and any way suited to 
the child’s natural genius and constitution; for 
that too must be considered in a right education. 
We must not hope wholly to change their original 
tempers, nor make the gay pensive and grave, nor 
the melancholy sportive, without spoiling them. 
-God has stamped certain characters upon men’s 
aninds, which, like their shapes, may perhaps be a 
little mended, but can hardly be totally altered and 
transformed into the contrary. 
He therefore that is about children should well 
study their natures and aptitudes, and see by often 
trials, what turn they easily take, and what becomes 
them ; observe what: their native stock is, how it

may be improved, and what it is fit for.(*) He 
should consider what they want, whether they be 
capable of having it wrought into them by indus- 
try, and incorporated there by practice; and whe- 
ther it be worth while to endeavour it. For in 
many cases, all that we can do, or should aim at, is, 
to make the best of what nature has given, to prevent 
the vices and faults to which such a constitution is 
most inclined, and give it all the advantages itis 
capable of. Every one’s natural genius should be 
carried as far as it could; but to attempt the put. 
ting another upon him, will be but labour in vain; 
and what is so plastered on, will at best sit but 
untowardly, and have always hanging to it the un- 
gracefulness of constraint and affectation. 
Affectation is not, I confess, an early fault of 
childhood, or the product of untaught nature. It . 
is of that sort of weeds which grow not in the 
wild uncultivated waste, but in garden plots, under 
the negligent hand, or unskilful care of a gar-< 
dener. Management and instruction, and some 
sense of the necessity of breeding, are requisite to 
make any one capable of affectation, which en- 
deavours to correct natural defects, and has always 
the laudable aim of pleasing, though it always 
misses it; and the more it labours to put on grace- 
fulness, the farther it is from it. For this reason; 
it is the more carefully to be watched, because it is

the proper fault of education ;.a perverted educa- 
tion'indeed, but such as young. people. often fall 
into,-either by their own mistake, or the ill conduct 
of those about them. : 
He that will examine wherein ‘that gracefalness 
lies, which always pleases, will find it arises from 
that natural coherence, which appears between the 
thing done, and such a temper of mind as cannot 
but be approved of as suitable to the occasion. We 
cannot but be pleased with a humane, friendly, 
civil temper, wherever we meet with it. A mind 
free, and master of itself and all its actions, not 
low and narrow, not haughty and insolent, not 
blemished ‘with any great defect, is what every one 
is taken with. The actions which naturally how 
from such a well-formed mind, please us also, as 
the genuine marks of it; and being as it were na- 
tural emanations from the spirit and disposition 
within, cannot but be easy and unconstrained. This 
seems to me to be that beauty which shines through 
some men’s actions, sets off all that they do, and 
takes all they come near; when by a constant 
practice, they have fashioned their carriage, and 
made all those little expressions of civility and re- 
spect, which nature or custom has established in 
conversation, so easy to themselves, that they seem 
not artificial or studied, but naturally to flow from a 
sweetness of mind, and a well-turned disposition.(*°) 
    
(°°) The theory of an easy and graceful behaviour, both here 
and everywhere throughout the work, recommended by Locke, is

APFECTATION. 9 
On the other side, affectation is an awkward 
and forced imitation of what should be genuine 
and easy, wanting the beauty that accompanies 
what is natural; because there is always a disagree- 
ment between the outward action, and the mind 
within, one of these two ways: 1. Either when a 
man would outwardly put on a disposition of mind, 
which he really has not, but endeavours, by. a 
forced carriage to make show of; yet so, that the 
constraint he is under discovers itself. And thus 
men affect sometimes to appear sad, merry, or 
kind, when in truth they are not so. 
2. The other is when they do not endeavour to 
make show of dispositions of mind, which they 
have not, but to express those they have by a 
carriage not suited to them: and such in conver- 
sation are all constrained motions, actions, words, 
or looks, which, though designed to show either 
their respect or civility to the company, or their 
satisfaction and easiness in it, are not yet natural 
  
most completely unfolded in the discourse of Isocrates to Demo- 
nicus, where every precept is found that can be needed by a 
diligent and high-minded student of the world. In its tone it 
has all that loftiness and nobility of breeding which distinguish 
the republican gentleman from the supple subject of a monarchy ; 
which, could they be placed in juxtaposition, would mark the 
difference between a disciple of Isocrates and a disciple of Lord 
Chesterfield. This latter able and judicious, though somewhat 
Jax writer, urges upon his son the absolute necessity of elegant 
ease of manner: “Prepare youtself,” says he, “for the great 
world, as the athlete used to do for their exercises; oil (if I 
may use that expression) your mind, and your manners, to give 
them the necessary suppleness and flexibility: strength alone will 
not do, as young people are too apt to think.”

others, without discerning what is graceful i in them, 
or what is peculiar to their characters, often makes 
” a great part of this. But affectation of all kinds, 
" whencesoever it proceeds, is always offensive : be- 
cause we naturally hate whatever ‘is counterfeit, 
and condemn those who have nothing better to re- 
commend themselves by. (*°) 
Plain and rough nature, left to. itself, is much 
better than an artificial ungracefulness, and such 
studied ways of being ill-fashioned. The want of 
an accomplishment, or some defect in our beha- 
viour, coming short of the utmost gracefulness, 
often escapes observation and censure. But affec- 
tation in any part-of our carriage is lighting up a 
candle to our defects, and never fails to make us be 
taken notice of, either as wanting sense, or wanting 
sincerity. This governors ought the more dili- 
gently to look after, because, as I above observed, 
it is an acquired ugliness, owing to mistaken edu- 
cation, few being guilty of it, but those who pre- 
tend to breeding, and would not be thought igno- 
rant of what is fashionable and becoming in con- 
versation; and, if I mistake not, it has often its 
tise from the lazy admonitions of those who give 
rules, and propose examples, without joining prac-

67. Manners, as they call it, about which chil- 
dren are so often perplexed, and have so many 
goodly exhortations made them by their wise maids 
and governesses, I think, are rather to be learnt by 
example than rules; and then children, if kept out 
of ill company, will take a pride to behave them- 
selves prettily, after the fashion of others, perceiv- 
ing themselves esteemed and commended for it. 
But if by a little negligence in this part, the boy 
should not pull off his hat, or make legs very 
gracefully, a dancing-master will cure that defect, 
and wipe off all that plainness of nature, which the 
a-la-mode people call clownishness. And since 
nothing appears to me to give children so much be- 
coming confidence and behaviour, and s0 to raise 
them to the conversation of those above their age, 
as dancing, I think they should be taught to dance 
as soon as they are capable of learning it. For 
though this consists only in outward gracefulness 
of motion, yet, I know not how, it gives children 
manly thoughts’ and carriage, more than any 
thing. ("} But otherwise I would not have little

I have said concerning manners, I-would not have 
so understood, as if I meant that those who have. 
the judgment to do it, should not gently fashion the 
motions and carriage of children, when: they are 
very young. It would be of great advantage, if 
they had people about them from their being first 
able to go, that had the skill, and would take the 
right way to do it. That which I complain of, is, 
the wrong course that is usually taken in this matter, 
Children, who were never taught.any such thing as 
behaviour, are often (especially when strangers are 
present) chid for having some way or other failed 
in good manners, and have thereupon reproofs and 
precepts heaped upon them, concerning putting off 
their hats, or making of legs, &c. Though in this, 
those concerned pretend to correct the child, yet, in 
truth for the most part, it is but to cover their own 
shame, and they lay the blame on the poor little 
ones, sometimes passionately enough, to divert it 
from themselves, for fear the by-standers should 
impute to their want of ‘care and skill the child's 
ill behaviour. (*)

68. I mentioned above, one great mischief that 
came by servants to children, when by their flat- 
teries they take off the edge and force of the pa- 
rents’ rebukes, and so lessen their authority: and 
here is another. great inconvenience which children 
receive from the ill examples which they meet with 
amongst the meaner servants. 
They are wholly, if possible, to be kept from 
such conversation ; for the’ contagion of these ill 
precedents, both in civility and virtue,. horribly 
infects children, as often as they come within reach 
of it. They frequently learn: from unbred or de- 
bauched servants such language, untowardly tricks, 
and vices, as otherwise they possibly would be 
ignorant of all their lives. 
69. It is a hard matter wholly to prevent this 
mischief. You will have very good luck, if. you 
never have a clownish or. vicious servant, and if 
from them your children never get any infection: 
but yet as much must be done towards it as can be,

ing in their presence should be made ‘easy to them : 
they should be allowed the’ liberties ind freedoms 
suitable to their ages; and not’ be'held under un- 
necessary restraints, when in their parents’ or go- 
venor’s sight. If it be a prison to them, it is no 
wonder they should not like it. They must not be 
hindered from being children, or fromi playing, or 
doing ‘as children, but from doing ill; all other 
liberty is to ‘be allowed them. Next, to:make them 
in. love with the: company of their parents, they 
should ‘receive all their good things there,and from 
their hands. The servants should.be hindered from 
making court to them, by. giving them strong 
drink, wine, fruit, play-things, and other sach mat- 
ters, which may make them in love with their con-

if I send him abroad, how is it possible to. keep him 
from the contagion of rudeness and. vice, which is

perhaps be more innocent, but more ignorant too 
of the world; wanting there change of company, 
and being used constantly to the same faces, he 
will, when he comes abroad, be a sheepish or con- 
ceited creature. 
I confess, both sides have their inconveniences. . 
Being abroad, it is true, will make him bolder, and 
better able to bustle and shift among boys of his 
own age; and the emulation of schoolfellows 
often puts life and industry into young lads. But 
till you can find a school, wherein it is possible for 
the master to look after the manners of bis scholars, 
and can show as great effects of his care of forming 
their minds to virtue, and their carriage to good 
breeding, as of forming their tongues to the learned 
languages, you must confess, that you have a strange 
value for words, when preferring the languages of 
the ancient Greeks and Romans, to that which

gerous evil of the two; and therefore, in the first 
place, to be fenced against. If that sheepish soft+ 
ness, which often enervates.those who are. bred like 
fondlings at home, be carefully to be avoided, it is 
principally so for virtue’s sake; for fear lest such a 
yielding temper should be too susceptible of vicious 
impressions, and expose the. novice too easily.to be 
corrupted. A young man, before. be. leaves the 
shelter of his father’s hdause,.and:the guard:of a 
tutor, should be fortified with resolution; and made 
acquainted with men, to secure his virtues, lest‘he 
should be let into some ruinons course, or fatal pre~ 
cipice, before he is sufficiently acquainted with the 
danger of conversation, and has stéadiness enough 
not to yield to every temptation. Were it not for 
this, a young man’s bash fulness and ignorance in the 
world, would not so much need an early care. Con- 
versation would cure it in a great measure; orif 
that will not do it early enough, it is.only a stronger 
reason for a good tutor at home. - For if pains be 
to be taken to give him a manly air and assu- 
rance betimes, it js chiefly. as a fence. to his. vir- 
tue, when he goes into the world under his own 
conduct. Ptjees 
It is preposterous therefore to sacrifice his inno- 
cency to the attaining of confidence; and- some 
little skill of bustling for himself among others, by 
his conversation with ill-bred and vicious boys; 
when the chief use of that sturdiness, and standing 
upon his own legs, is‘ only for the. preservation of 
his virtue. For if confidence. oy cunning come

there needs not any great care to stock them. with

it has been nursed up into so uncontrolled a domi-

Christian piety and virtue every where, and dfJeain-

of this generation, would consider how to retrieve 
them in the next. This I am sure, that. if the 
foundation of it be not laid in the edueation and

be in vain. And if the innocence, sobriety, and

seems to be never where we are, but hangs thick before and be- 
hind us. Perhaps, did we deeply investigate the. matter, the 
reign of vice might appear to have been always more widely ex- 
tended than that of virtue; though it cannot be denied that, 
owing to the greater influence of democratic principles, and the 
more rigid enforcement of those penalties awarded by the laws, 
morals, and manners, in the republics of ancient Greece, were far 
more pure and high-toned than among modern nations, where 
the governments, owing much of their support to vice, cannot be 
other than unfavourable to virtue. The Puritans, in their’ best 
times, might perhaps have borne some comparison with ‘the vir- 
tuous citizens of antiquity. As a-nation, however, we are doubt. 
less more virtuous at ‘pfesent, than at any former period ; atid. as 
freedom and knowledge are more widely diffused, the tone of‘oar 
morals will be raised. Ignorant persons are never virtadus, 
though they may be harmless.

learning, which has hitherto made England consi- 
derable in the world. I was going to-add courage 
too, though it has been looked on :as/the:nataral 
inheritance of Englishmen. What -has been.talked 
of some late actions at sea, of a kind unknown to 
‘our ancestors, (*) gives me occasion to-say, that 
debauchery sinks the courage of men;:and when 
dissoluteness has eaten out the sense of true honour, 
bravery seldom stays long after it. And I think 
it impossible to find an instance of any uation, 
however.renowned for their valour, whoever kept 
their credit in arms,.or made themselves redoubta- 
ble amonget their neighbours, after corruption had 
once broken through and dissolved the restraint of 
discipline, and vice was grown to such a head, that 
it durst show itself barefaced, without being out 
of countenance. 
It is virtue then, direct virtue, which is the hard 
and valuable part to be aimed at in education, and 
not:a forward pertness, or any little arts of shifting. 
All other considerations and accomplishments 
should give way and be postponed to this. This 
is the solid and substantial good which tutors

monwealth swept the seas, carrying terror and victory over half 
the world. Old Noll at least understood how to render his coun-

should not only read lectures, and talk of, but the 
labour and art of education should furnish the 
mind with, fasten there, and never cease till the 
young man had a true relish of it, and placed his 
strength, his glory, and his pleasure in it, 
The more this advances, the easier way will be 
made for all other accomplishments in their turns; 
for he that is brought to submit to virtue, will not 
be refractory, or resty, in any thing that becomes 
him; and therefore I cannot but prefer breeding 
of a young gentleman at home in his father’s sight, 
under a good governor, as much the best and safest 
way to this great and main end of education, 
when it can be had, and is ordered as it should be. 
Gentlemen’s houses are seldom without variety of 
company: they should use their sons to all the 
strange faces that come there, and engage them 
in conversation with men of parts and breeding, 
as soon as they are capable of it. And why those 
who live in the country should not take them with 
them, when they make visits of civility to their 
neighbours, I know not. This I am sure, a father 
that breeds his son at home, has the opportunity to 
have him more in his own company, and there give 
him what encouragement he thinks fit, and can keep 
him better from the taint of servants, and the 
meaner sort of people, than is possible to be done 
abroad. But what shall be resolved in the case, 
must in great measure be left to the parents, to be 
determined by their circumstances and conveni- 
ences; only I think it the worst sort of good huss

Or if you assume to yourself the liberty you have

force to your example, and recommend the action 
the more powerfully tohim. ‘For you must always 
remember, that children affect to be men earlier 
than is thought; and they love breeches, not: for 
their cut or ease, but because the having them is a

the father’s carriage before his children, must 
extend itself to all those who have any authority 
over them, or for whom be would have them have 
any respect. 
PUNISHMENT. 
72. But to return to the business of rewards 
and punishments, All the actions of childishneas, 
and unfashionable carriage, and whatever time and 
age will of itself be sure to reform, being (as T 
have said) exempt from the discipline of the rod, 
there will not be so much need of beating children, 
as is generally made use of. To which, if we add 
learning to read, write, dance, foreign language, 
&c. as under the same privilege, there will be but 
very rarely an occasion for blows or force in ap 
ingenuous education. The right way to teach them 
those things, is to give them a liking and inclination 
to what you propose to them to be learned, and 
that will engage their industry and application. 
This I think no hard matter to do, if children be 
handled as they should: be, and the rewards and

2. None of the things 'they~are 
should ‘ever be made a-burdén t6 them,‘oriinposed 
‘on'them as a task. Whatever iis ‘so proposed, pre-

or indifference. Leta child be butordered towhip his

not soon be weary of any play at this rate. Is it 
not so with grown men? What they do cheer- 
fally of themselves, do they ‘not.présently grow 
sick of, and can no more endure,:2s-soon as they 
find it-is expected of them as a duty? Children 
have as-much a mind:to show that'they are free, 
that theit.own good ‘actions come from themselves, 
‘that-they are absolute and independent, as any of 
the proudest of you grown men, think of them as 
you please. : 
74, 2. As a cohgequence of this, they should 
seldom be put about doing even ‘those things you 
have got an inclination in them to, but when they 
have a mind and disposition’ to it.’ He that loves 
reading, writing, music, &c. finds yet in himself 
‘certain seasons wherein those things hav

he only ‘bothers and wearies himself to'n    
    
     
-P-A-G-E-168
DISPOSITION. 99 
So it is with children. This change of temper 
should be carefully observed in them, and the 
favourable seasons of aptitude and inclination be 
heedfully laid hold of: and if they are not often 
enough forward of themselves, a. good disposition 
should be talked into them, before they be set upon 
any thing. This I think no hard matter for a discreet 
tutor to do, who has studied: his pupil’s temper; and 
will be at a little pains to fill hishead with suitable 
jdeas, such as may make him in love with the present 
business. By this means a great deal of time and 
tiring would be saved ; for a child will learn three 
times as much when he is in tune, as he will with 
double the time and pains when he goes awkwardly, 
or is dragged unwillingly to it. If this were 
minded as it should, children. might be permitted 
to weary themselves with play, and yet have time 
enough to learn what is suited to the capacity of 
each age. But no such thing is considered in the 
ordinary way of education, nor can it ‘well be. 
The rough discipline of the rod is built upon other 
principles, has-no attraction in it, regards not what 
humour children are in, nor looks after favourable 
seasons of inclination. And indeed it would be 
ridiculous, when‘compulsion and blows. have raised 
an aversion in the child to his. task, to expect he 
should freely of his own accord leave his play, and 
with pleasure court the occasions of learning. 
‘Whereas, were matters ordered right, learning any 
thing they should. be taught, might be made as

other things are ill learned, when the mind is either 
indisposed, or otherwise taken wp, yet itis of great 
moment, and worth our endeavours, to teach the 
mind to get the mastery over itself, and to be able 
upon choice, to take itself’ off from: the hot pursuit, 
of one thing, and set itself upom another. with fati- 
lity and delight, or at. any time to shake off its 
sluggishness, and vigorously employ: itself about 
what reason, or the advice of another shall direct.. 
This is to be done in children by trying them. 
sometimes, when they are by laziness unbent, or 
by avocation bent another way, and endeavouring 
to make them buckle to the thing proposed, If by, 
this means the mind can get an habitual dominion 
over itself, lay by ideas or business as occasion, 
requires, and betake itself to new and less aecept- 
able employments, without reluctancy or discom- 
posure, it will be an advantage of more conse- 
quence than Latin or logic, or most of those things 
children are usually required to learn.

that age, than in any other part of their life, and 
being indifferent to any thing they can do, so they 
may be but doing, dancing and Scotch-hoppers

imperious discipline. And: I: think it no hard 
matter to gain this point; I.am sure it will not be 
where children have no: ill’ examples set’ before 
them. The great danger therefére, I apprehend, is 
only from servants, and other: ill-ordered children, 
or such other vicious or foolish. people, who ‘spoil 
children both by the ill. pattern’ they set before 
them in their own ill manners, and by giving them 
together the two things they should never have at 
once; I mean vicious pleasures and commen-. 
dation. 
CHIDING, 
7. As children should very seldom. be corrected 
by blows, so I think frequent, and especially’ pas- 
sionate chiding of almost as ill consequence: . It 
lessens the authority of the parents, and the respect 
of the child; for I bid you still remember, they: 
distinguish early betwixt passion and reason: and 
as they cannot but have a reverence for what comes 
from the latter, so they quickly grow into a. con- 
tempt of the former ; or if it causes'a present terror, 
yet it soon wears off, and natural inclination will 
easily learn to slight such scare-crows which make 
a noise, but are not animated by. reason. Children 
being to be restrained by their parents only in 
vicious (which, in their tendér. years,:.are only a. 
few) things, a look:or nod only ought to correct

terror. I have known the children of a person of 
quality kept in awe by the fear of having their shoes 
pulled off, as much as othera by apprehensions, of 
arod hanging over them. Some such’ punishment 
I think better than beating ; for it-is shame of the 
fault, and the disgrace that attends. it; that they 
should stand in fear of, rather thaw pain, if you 
would have them have & temper traly itigenadus. 
But stubbornness, and an obstinate dissbediérice; 
must be mastered with foree and blows} for this 
there is no other remedy. Whatever particulat 
action you bid him do, or forbeat, you must ‘bé 
sure to see yourself obeyed ; no quarter in this case; 
no resistance ; for when onee it comes to be a trial 
of skill, a contest for mastery’ betwixt you, as it 
is if you command, and he refuses, you must be 
sure to carry it, whatever blows it costs, if a nod or 
words will not prevail; unless, for ever after, you 
intend to live in obedience to your son. A prudent 
and kind mother of my acquaintance, was, on such 
an occasion, forced to whip her little daughter, at 
her first coming home from nurse, eight times suc- 
cessively the same morning, before she could mas- 
ter ber stubbornness, (®) and obtain a compliance 
  (®) Children nursed from home are generally obstinate on 
their return, even though they were otherwise with their nurte. 
To them their patents ate strangers, and for some time appear 
in the light of usurpets, the nurse, in thelf ‘estimation, being the 
legitimate authority. This is particularly obeervable in France, 
where so many chitdren spend their early infancy under the ropfs 
of strangers; though afterwards parents and children live on 
terms of much greater fantilfatity and equality than among ¢ ours 
selves, and tutoie each other H¢'urdthary contpanions.

been very pliant and tractable. For if you punish’ 
a child so, as if it were only to’ revenge the past 
fault, which has raised your choler, what operation 
can this have upon his mind, which is the part to 
be amended? If there were no sturdy humour, or 
wilfulness, mixed with his fault; there was nothing 
in it that required the severity:of blows. A kind 
or grave admonition is. enough to’rémedy the slips 
of frailty, forgetfulness, or inadvertency; and is as) 
much as they will stand in need of. “But if théte 
were a perverseness in the will, if it weré a designed; 
resolved disobedience, the punishment is not to be 
measured by the greatness or smallness of the matter’ 
wherein it appeared, but by the opposition it carries, 
and stands in, to that respect and submission which 
is due to the father’s orders; which must always be 
rigorously exacted, and the blows by pauses laid: 
on, till they reach the: mind, and you perceive the’ 
signs of a true sorrow, shame, and purpose of-obe-

This, I confess, requires something more than 
setting children a task, and whipping them without: 
any more ado, if it be not done,and. done to our 
fancy. This requires care, attention, observation, 
and a nice study of children’s tempers, and weigh- 
ing their faults well, before we come to this sort of 
punishment. But is not that better, than always to 
have the rod in hand, as the only instrument of

riper growth. ‘They must be permitted, as I said, 
the foolish and childish actions suitable to their 
years, without taking notice of them. Inadver- 
tency, carelessness, and gaiety, is the character of 
that age. I think the severity I spoke of is not to 
extend itself to such unseasonable restraints.. Nor 
is that hastily to be interpreted, obstinacy: or wilful- 
ness, which is the natural product of their age -or 
temper. In such miscarriages they are to besas~ 
sisted, and helped towards an amendmen}, as weak 
people under a natural infirmity; which, though 
they are warned of, yet every relapse must not be 
counted a perfect neglect, and they presently treated 
as obstinate. Fauits of frailty, as they should never 
be neglected, or let pass without minding, so, un- 
less the will mix with them, they should never be 
exaggerated, or very sharply reproved; but witha 
gentle hand set right, as time and age permit. By 
this means, children will come to see what it is in 
any miscarriage that is chiefly offensive, and so 
learn to avoid it. This will encourage them to 
keep their wills right; which is the great business, 
when they find that it preserves them from any 
great displeasure, and that in all their other failings 
they meet with the kind gopcera and help, rather . 
than the anger and passionate reproaches of their

when, as the last remedy, it comes to be necessary, 
at what times, and by whom ‘it should’ be déte; 
whether presently upon committing the fault, whilst 
it is yet fresh and hot; and whether -pardtite 
themselves should beat their: children: As to the 
first, I think it should not be done presently, lest 
passion mingle with it; and so, though it exceed 
the just proportion, yet it lose of its due weight: 
for even children discern when we do things in pas- 
sion. But, as I said before, that has most weight 
with them, that appears sedately to come from 
their parent’s reason; and they are not without 
this distinction. Next, if you have any discreet 
servant capable of it, and has the place of govern+ 
ing your child, (for if you have a tutor, there is no 
doubt,) I think it is best the smartshould come tiore 
immediately from anothér’s hand, though by the pa-

parent’s authority will be preserved, atid the child’s 
aversion, for the pain it suffers, rather be turned 
on the person that immediately inflicts. For I

chastisement is usually the consequence only of 
former indulgences or neglects: if vicious inclina- 
tions were watched from the beginning, and the 
first irregularities, which. they cause, corrected by 
those gentler ways, we should seldom have to do 
with more than one disorder at once; which would . 
be easily set right, without any stir or. noise, and 
not require so harsh a discipline as beating. . Thus 
one by one, as they appeared, they might all-be 
weeded out, without any signs or memory. that 
ever they had been there. But we letting their 
faults (by indulging and humouring our little ones) 
grow up, till they are sturdy and numerous, and 
the deformity of them makes us ashamed, and un- 
easy, we are fain to come to the plough and. the 
harrow ; the spade and the pick-axe, must go deep 
to come at the roots; and all the force, skill, and 
diligence we can use, is scarce enough to cleanse 
the vitiated seed-plot, overgrown with weeds, and 
restore us the hopes of fruits, to reward our pains

father and child the trouble of repeated injunctions, 
and multiplied rules of doing and forbearing. For 
J am of opinion, that of those actions which tend to 
vicious habits, (which are those alone that a father 
should interpose his authority and commands in,) 
none should be forbidden children till they are 
found guilty of them. For such untimely probi-

that children cannot be brought to, without the 
severity of the lash, and hardly with that too}, or 
else, that it is a mistake, that those tongues could 
not be taught them without beating. 
87. But let us suppose some so negligent or 
idle, that they will not be brought to learn by the 
gentle ways proposed, for we must grant, that there 
will be children found of all tempers; yet it does 
not thence follow, that the rough discipline of the 
cudgel is to be used to all. Nor can any. one 
be concluded unmanageable by the milder methods

of contempt, you have chosen amiss; and if you 
show any contempt of him, he will hardly escape 
it from your son: and whenever that happens, what-

(®) Locke will not be suspected of affecting any cynical con- 
tempt for wealth ;—on this point his philosophy is perhaps too 
indulgent ;—but he wisely inculeates the necessity of preferring 
before it education, which, rightly considered, is only that 
mental training which enables the opulent to enjoy wealth, and 
the poor to be happy without it, All real philosophers have ad- 
mitted,—indeed they could dono otherwise,—the value of riches 
to those who know how to employ them; but Aristotle, distin- 
guished for his sound common sense, derides the absurd desire of 
mankind to heap up wealth indefinitely. “There is a limit,” 
he observes, “to the accumulation of wealth for provision, but 
none to accumulation for gain, The master of a family. endese

91. The consideration of charge ought not there- 
fore to deter those who are able. The great diffi- 
culty will be where to find a proper person: for 
those of small age, parts, and virtue, are unfit for 
this employment, and those that have greater, will 
hardly be got to undertake such a charge: You 
must therefore look out early, and inquire évery- 
where ; for the world has people of all sorts.“ And 
T remember Montaigne says, in one of his Exsays, 
that the learned Castalio was fain to ” 
trenchers at Bale, to keep himself from starving, 
when his father would have given any money for 
such a tutor for his son, and Castalio have willing- 
ly embraced such an employment upon very rea- 
sonable terms; but this was for want of intelli- 
gence. (*°)

(48) In what edition, or in what part of the Essays, Locke met with 
this anecdote, Ihave been unable to discover ; but probably what 
is here said of the trencher-making at Ble may have been found 
in a note to some old English translation. It might have been ex- 
pected, that when Montaigne passed through the above city, in his 
way to Italy, he would have alluded in his journal (published 
one hundred and eighty years after his death) to the poverty of 
Castalio, where he mentions the learned men of the place ; (t. i. 
pp- 44—58 ;) but no allusion to his name occurs. His extreme 
poverty, and ultimate starvation, are however commemorated, but 
without any mention of the trencher-making, in his Essays, (1. i, 
ch. 34, tom. ii p. 270,) where he is lamenting the want, through- 
out Europe, of something like our present system of advertising, 
which still needs many improvements.’ “To the great shame of 
our present age, I hear,” he observes, “that, before our eyes, two

much the business of a tutor, rightly employed, lies 
out of the road, and how remote it is from the 
thoughts of many, even of those who propose to 
themselves this employment, will perhaps be of my 
mind, that one fit to educate and form the mind of 
a young gentleman, is not everywhere to. be found, 
and that more than ordinary care-is to be taken in 
the choice of him, or else you may fail of yourend. 
93. The character of a sober man and a‘scho- 
lar, is, as I have above observed, what everyone 
expects in a tutor. This generally is thought 
enough, and is all that parents commonly look fort 
but when such a one has emptied out into his 
pupil all the Latin and logie he has brought from 
the university, will that furnitare make him a: fine 
gentleman ? Or ean it be expected, that he should 
be better bred, better skilled in. the. world, better 
principled in the grounds and foundations of true 
virtue and generosity, than his young tutor is. 
To form a young gentleman as he should be, it 
is fit his governor should himself be well-bred, 
understand the ways of carriage, and measures 
of civility in all the variety of persons, times, and 
places, and keep his pupil, as much as his age re- 
quires, constantly to the observation of them. This 
is an art not to be learned or taught by books. 
Nothing can give it, but good company, and ob- 
servation joined together, The tailor may make 
his clothes modish, and the. dancing-master give 
fashion to his motions; yet neither of these, thougli

tinguish all those different states of the world, and well to under- 
stand their strength, their way of fighting, their customs, religions, 
governments, and interests; and, by the perusal gf solid history, 
to observe their rise, progress, decay, and whencé, how, aha by 
what accidents and errors those great changes and ‘revolutions of 
empiresand kingdoms have happened. Ihave scarce learnt of you 
the names of my gtandsires, the famous founders of this empire 
so far were you from having taught me the history of’ their life, 
and what course they took to make such great conquests, You 
had a mind to teach me the Arabian tongue, to read and to write. 
I am much obliged to you, forsooth, for having made me lose so 
much time upon a language, that requires ten or twelve years to 
attain to its perfection ; as if the son of a king should think it to 
be an honour to him to be a grammarian or some doctor of the 
law, and to learn other languages than those of his neighbours, 
when he cannot well be without them ; he, to whom time is so 
precious for so many weighty things, which he ought betimes to 
learn, As if there were any spirit that did not with some re- 
luetancy, and even with a kind of debasement, employ itself in 
so sad and dry an exercise, so longsome and tedious, as is that of 
learning words.” 
Thus did Aurungzéb resent the pedantic instructions of his 
tutor ; to which it is affirmed in that court, that after some en- 
tertainment, which he had with others, he further added the fol- 
lowing reproof : ' . . “Know you not, that childhood well governed, being a state 
which is ordinarily accompanied with a happy memory, is capa- 
ble of thousands of good precepts and instructions, which remain 
deeply impressed the whole remainder of a man’s life, and keep

sciences, may they not as well be learned in our mother-tongue as 
in Arabic? Yon told my father, Shah-Jehan, that you would 
teach me philosophy. It is‘ tne, I remember very well, that

(**) Isocrates glancing in his Areopagitica, at the history of 
Athenian education, observes, that in the earlier aged of the Re- 
public, though much care was taken of the training of youth, 
that of the first stage of manhood was watched over with still 
greater solicitude. (§. 1d’. Oratores Attici, tom. iii. p. 364.) Dur- 
ing this period,—from eighteen to twenty-one,—the young men 
were denominated fpn€ou. (Polluc. viti. 104, 105.). After this, 
becoming their own masters, they were supposed. to. possess. 
greater liberty ; as is well remarked in the Andrian of Terence.

the sober advices he has received from his gover-

they call being governed by others, do it only that 
they may have the government of him themselves: 
and make him believe, he goes like a man: of ‘him-

This is a knowledge, which, upon all occasions,'é

I know it is often said, that to discover to a young 
man the vices of the age, is to teach them him. 
That, I confess, is a good deal so, according ‘as it 
is done; and therefore requires a discreet man of 
parts, who knows the world, and can judge of the 
temper, inclination, and weak side of his pupil. 
This farther is to be remembered; that it is not 
possible now (as perhaps formerly it was) to keep a 
young gentleman from vice, by a total ignorance 
of it, unless you will all his‘life’mue him up in a 
closet, and never let. him go into company. The 
longer he is kept thus hoodwinked, the less he will 
see when he comes abroad into open day-light, and 
be the more exposed to be a.prey to himself and

the round of education, a gentleman may in'a good 
measure be unfurnished with, without any great dis- 
paragement to himself, or. prejudice-to his affairs. _ 
But prudence and good-breeding are in all theista-

young men suffer in the want: of. them, and come 
rawer and more awkward into the: world, than they, 
should, for this very reason, because these qualities,» 
which are of all others the most necessary to. be 
taught, and stand most in need of the assistance and 
help of a teacher, are genefally. neglected and 
thought but a slight, or no part of a tutor’s busi-.

the main stress is laid upon his proficiency in things, 
agreat part whereof belong not to a gentleman's 
calling ; which is to have the knowledge of a man 
of business, a carriage suitable to his rank, and to 
be eminent and useful in his country, according to 
his station. Whenever either’ spare hours. from 
that, or an inclination to perfect himself in some

deserves well to make a part in education, whichi 
men are ashamed of, where they aré most concerned 
to show their parts and: breeding.” : 
There is yet another reason: why politeness of 
manners, and knowledge of the world should prin- 
cipally be looked after in a tutor ;’and that is, be- 
cause a man of parts and years may enter a lad’ far 
enough in any of those sciences, which he has'nd 
deep insight into himself. Books in these will be 
able to furnish him, and give him light and prece- 
dency enough to go before a young follower: but 
he will never be able to set another right in the 
knowledge of the world, and above all in breeding; 
who is a novice in them himself. . 
This is a knowledge he must have about him, 
worn into him by use and conversation, and a long 
forming himself by what he has observed’ to be 
practised and allowed in the best company. This, 
if he has it not of his own, is nowhere to be bor- 
towed for the use of his pupil; or if he could find 
pertinent treatises of it in books, that would reach 
all the particulars of an English gentleman’s beha- 
viour, his own ill-fashioned example, if he’ bé“not 
well bred himself, would spoil all his lectures: it 
being impossible, that any one should come forth 
well fashioned out of unpolished, ill-bred company. 
I say this, not that I think such a tutor‘is every’ 
day to be met with, or to be had at the ordinary’ 
rates; but that those who. are able, may not be!

youth, and those trifling occupations which it is 
commonly wasted in. For it is easy to observe, 
that many young men continue longer jin the 
thought and conversation of school-boys, than 
otherwise they would, because their parents keep 
them at that distance, and in that low. rank, by all 
their carriage to them. 
96, Another thing of greater consequence, which 
you will obtain by such a way of treating him, will 
be his friendship. Many fathers, though they pro- 
portion to their sons liberal allowances, according 
to their age and condition, yet they keep the 
knowledge of their estates and concerns from 
them, with as much reservedness, as if they 
were guarding a secret of state from a spy. or an 
enemy. This, if it looks not like jealousy, yet it 
wants those marks of kindness and intimacy which 
a father should show to his son, and no doubt often 
hinders or abates that cheerfulness and satisfaction. 
wherewith a son should address himself to, and 
rely upon his father. And I cannot but often won- 
der to see fathers, who love their sons very well, 
yet so order the matter by a constant stiffness, and 
a mien of authority and distance to them all their 
lives, as if they were never to enjoy, or have any 
comfort from those they love best in the world, 
till they had lost them, by being removed into 
another. Nothing cements and establishes friend- 
ship and good-will, so much as confident commu- 
nication of concernments and affairs. Other kind- 
nesses, without this, leave still some doubts: but 
when your son sees you open your mind to him,

      when: he finds that you interét him ia your affairs,

him see, that the enjoyment you. have, is not with- 
out’ care; which the more he is-sensible of, the 
less will he envy you the possession, and the more 
think himself happy under the management of so 
favourable a friend and so careful a father. ‘There 
is scarce any ‘young man of so little thought, or so 
void of ‘sense, that would not be glad of a sure 
friend; ‘that he might have recourse: to, and freely 
consult on occasion. The reservedness and distance 
‘that fathers keep, often deprive their sons of that 
refage, which would be of more advantage to them, 
than a hundred rebukes and chidings. Would your 
son engage. in- some frolic, or take a vagary, were 
it not much better he should do it with, than with- 
out: your knowledge? For since allowances for 
such things must be made to young men, the. more 
you know of his intrigues and designs, the bette:

be sure you advise only as a friend of more expe- 
rience; but with your advice mingle nothing of 
command or authority, nor more than you would 
to your equal, or a stranger. That. would be to 
drive him for ever from. any further demanding, or 
receiving advantage from your counsel. “You. must 
consider that he is a young: man,. and has plea- 
sures and fancies which you are past.. You must 
not expect his inclination should be jast as yours, 
nor that at twenty he should have: the same - 
thoughts you have at fifty. All that you. can wish, 
is, that since youth must have some liberty, some 
out-leaps, they might be with the ingenuity of'a 
son, and under the eye of a father, and then no 
very great harm can come of it. .'The way to. ob- 
tain this, as I said before, is (according as-you find 
him capable) to talk with him about your affairs, 
propose matters to him familiarly, and ask his ad-: 
vice; and when he ever lights on the. right, follow 
it as his; and if it succeed well, let him have the 
commendation, This will not at all lessen your 
authority, but increase his love and esteem of you. 
Whilst you keep your estate, the staff :will still: be 
in your own hands; and your authority the surer, 
the more he is strengthened with confidence. and

to be avoided by one who would improve himself, 
and be acceptable to others. 
REVERENCE. 
99. When by making your son sensible that 
he: depends on you, and.is'in your power, you 
have established your authority; and by being 
inflexibly severd in your carriage to him, when 
obstinately persisting in any ill-matured trick which 
you have forbidden, especially lying, you have 
imprinted on his mind that awe which is necessary: 
and, on the. other side, when (by permitting him 
the full liberty due to his age, and laying no re- 
straint in your presence to those childish actions 
and gaiety of carriage, which, whilst he is very 
young, is as necessary to him as meat or sleep) you 
have réconciled him to your company, and made 
him sensible of your care and love of him by in- 
dulgence and. tenderness, especially caressing him 
on all occasions wherein he does any thing well, 
and being kind to him after a thousand fashions, 
suitable to his age, which nature teaches parents 
better than I can: when, I say, by these ways 
of tenderness and affection, which parents never 
want for their children, yow have also planted. in 
him a particular affection for you; he is then in 
the state you could desire, and: you have formed in 
his- mind that trie revereivce which is always after- 
wards carefully to be continued, and maintained 
in both parts of it, love and fear, as the great princi-

ples whereby you will always have hold upon him, 
to turn his mind to the ways-of virtue and ho- 
nour. : 
TEMPER. 
100. When this. foundation is once well laid, 
and you find this reverence begin to work in him, 
the next thing to be done, is carefully to consider 
his temper, and the particular constitution of his 
mind. Stubbormness, lying, and ill-natured ac- 
tions, are not (as have been said) to be permitted 
in him from the beginning, whatever his temper 
be... Those seeds of vices are not to be suffered to 
take any root, but: must be carefully weeded out, 
as soon as ever they begin to show themselves in 
him; and your authority is to take place, and in- 
fiuence his mind, from the very dawning of any 
knowledge in him, that it may operate as a natural 
principle, whereof he never perceived the beginning, 
never knew that it: was, or could be otherwise. 
By this, if the reverence he owes you be establish- 
ed early, it will always be sacred to him, and it 
will be as hard for him to resist it, as the princi- 
ples of his nature. 
- 101. Having thus very early set up your au- 
thority, and by the .gentler. applications of it, 
shamed him out of. what.leads towards any im- 
moral habit, as soon as you have observed it in 
him, (for I would by no means have chiding used, 
much less blows, till obstinacy and incorrigibleness 
make it absolutely necessary,) it will be fit to con- 
sider which way the natural make of his mind in-
-P-A-G-E-220
  TEMPER. 151 
clines him. Some: men, by the unalterable frame 
of their constitutions are stout, others timorous, 
some confident, others modest, tractable, or obsti- 
nate, curious or careless, quick or slow. There 
are not more differences in men’s faces, and the 
outward lineaments. of their bodies, than there are 
in the makes and tempers of their minds; only 
there is this difference, that the distinguishing cha- 
racters of the face, and the lineaments of the body, 
grow more plain and visible with time and age; 
but the peculiar physiognomy of the mind is most, 
discernible in children, before art and cunning 
hath taught them to hide their deformities, and 
conceal their il inclinations ander a’ dissembled 
outside. 
102. Begin therefore betimes nicely to obsefve 
your son’s temper; and that, when he is under 
least restraint in his. play, and as he thinks out 
of your sight, see what are his predominate pas- 
sions, and prevailing: inclinations; whether he 
be fierce or mild, bold or bashful, compassionate 
or cruel, open or reserved, &c. For as these are 
different in him, so are your methods to be dif- 
ferent, and your authority must hence take measures 
to apply itself different ways to him. ‘These na- 
tive propensities, these prevalencies of constitu- 
tion, are not to be cured’ by rules, or a direct con- 
test, especially those of them’ that are the humbler 
and meaner sort, which- proceed from :fear, and 
lowness of spirit, though with art they may be 
much mended, and turned to good purposes. But

this, be sure, after all is done, the bias will always 
hang on that side that nature first placed it: and if 
youcarefully observe the characters of his mind, 
now iii the first scenes of his life, you will ever after 
beable to judge which way his thoughts lean, and 
what he aims at even hereafter, when, as he grows 
up, the plot thickens, and he puts on several shapes 
to act; it. 
103. I told you before, that children love liber- 
ty; and therefore they should be brought to do 
the things that are fit for them, without feeling 
any restraint laid upon them. I now tell you, 
they love something more, and that is dominion: 
and: this is the first original of most vicious habits, 
that are ordinary and natural. This love of power 
antl dominion, shows itself very early, and that in 
thése two things. 
104. 1. We seé children, as soon almost as 
they are born, (I dm sure long before they can 
speak,) cry,’grow peevish, sullen, and out of hu- 
mour, for nothing but to have their wills. They 
would have their desires submitted to by others; 
they contend for a ready compliance from all about 
them; especially from those that stand near, or be- 
neath thei in age or degree, as soon as they come 
to consider others with those distinctions. 
- 105. Another thing wherein they show their 
love of dominion, is, theit desire to have things to 
be theirs: they would have property and posses- 
sion, pleasing theniselves with the power which 
that seems to give, and the right they thereby have
-P-A-G-E-222

to dispose of them as they please. (*°) He that has 
not observed these two hamours working very be- 
times in children, has' taken little notice of their 
actions: and he who thinks that these two roots of 
almost all the injustice and contention that so dis- 
turb human life, are not early to be weeded out, 
and contrary habits introduced, neglects the pro- 
per season to lay the fouridations of a good and: 
worthy man: To do this, I imagine these,follow- 
ing things may somewhat conduce.

Jopes itself thus:—two boys, say brotliers, are walking together, 
or playing about a room, with their ordinary playthings: their 
language and mauner are those of equals. Presently, one of 
them picks up an apple, a walnut, a butch of grapes, or any 
other trifling thing which may be eaten. From that moment the 
finder adopts a haughty tone, a magisterial air, a superiority 
over the other, exactly resembling the bearing of a nouveau riche 
to a dependant in the great world; and the luckless one, with 
equal readinési, adopts the manners of a sycophant, softens his 
voice into the pitch of entreaty, looks humbly and fawningly on 
the favourite of fortune, follows about his arrogant and conceited 
footsteps, hangs on his glance, becomes, in one word, his obse-

parents for any thing, which will perhaps be 
thought: to lay too great a curb on the minds of 
children, to the prejudice’ of that love and affection 
which should be between them and their parents ; 
Ishall explain myself a little more particularly. 
It is fit that. they should have liberty to declare 
their wants to their parents, and that with all ten- 
derness they should be hearkened to, and supplied, 
at least;whilst they are very little. But it is one 
thing to say, I am hungry, another to say, I would 
have roast meat. Having declared their watts, their 
natural wants, the pain they feel from hunger, 
thirst; cold, or any other necessity of nature, it is 
the duty of their parents, and those about them, to 
rélieve them: but children must leave it to the 
choice and ordering of their parents, what they 
think properest for them, and how much; and 
must not be permitted to choose for themselves, 
and say, I would have wine, or white bread ; the 
very naming of it should make them lose it. 
107. That which parents should take care of 
here, is to distinguish between the wants of fancy, 
and those of nature; which Horace has well taught 
them to do in this verse: 
Queis humana sibi doleat natura negatis. 
Those are truly natural wants, which reason 
alone, without some other help, is not able to 
fence against, nor keep from disturbing us.’ The 
pains of sickness and hurts, hunger, thirst, and cold, 
want of sleep, and rest or relaxation of the part 
wearied with labour, are what all men feel, and the

best disposed minds cannot but be sensible of their 
uneasiness; and therefore ought, by fit applications, 
to seek their removal; though not with impatience or 
over great haste, upon. the first approaches of them, 
where delay does not threaten some irreparable 
harm. The pains that come from. the necessities of 
nature, are monitors to us, to beware of greater mis- 
chiefs, which they are the forerunners of;-and 
therefore they must not be wholly neglected, ‘nor 
strained too far. But yet the more children cait 
be inured to hardships of this kind, by a wise care 
to make them stronger in body and mind, the better 
it will be for them. (*') I need not here give any 
caution to keep within the bounds of doing them 
good, and to take care; that what children are made 
to suffer; should .neither break their spirits,. nor 
injure their health, parents. being but too apt.of 
themselves to incline more than they should to the 
softer side. 
But whatever compliance the necessities of na- 
ture may require, the wants of fancy children should 
never be gratified in, nor suffered. to mention. The 
very speaking for any such thing should make 
them lose it. Clothes, when they need, they must’ 
have; but if they speak for this stuff or that colour,

of the Athenians, and the other nations of Greece, the principles

they should’ be sure to go without it. Not that I 
would have patents purposely crosé the desires of 
their-children in matters of indifferency; on the 
contrary, where their carriage deserve it, and one 
ig-sure it will not corrupt,or effeminate their minds, 
and make them’ fond of trifles, I think all things 
should be contrived, as much as could be, to their 
satisfaction, that they may find the ease and pléa- 
sure of doing well. The best for children, is, 
that they should not place any pleasure in such 
things at all, nor fegulate their delight by their 
fancies, but be indifferent. to all that nature has 
made so. This is what their parents and teachers 
should chiéfly aim at; but till this be obtained, 
all that I oppose here, is the liberty of asking, 
which in these things of conceit ought to be re- 
strained by a constant forfeiture annexed to it. 
This may perhaps be thought a little too severe 
py the natural indulgence of tender parents; but 
yet it is nd more than nécessary: for since the 
waethod I propose is to banish the rod, this restraint 
of their tongues will be of great use to settle that 
awe we have elsewhere spoken of, and to keep up 
in them the respect and reverence due to their 
parents. Next, it will teach them to keep in, and so 
master their inclinations. By this means they will 
be brought to learn the art of' stifling their desires, 
as soon as they rise up in them, when they are 
easiest to be subdued, For giving vent, gives life 
and strength to our appetites; and he that has the 
confidence to turn his wishes into demands, will 
be but a little way from thinking he ought to

obtain them. This, I am sure, every one can 
more easily bear a denial from himself, than from 
any body else. They should therefore be accus- 
tomed betimes to consult, and make use of their 
reason before they give allowance to their incli- 
nations. It is a great .step.towards the mastery of 
our desires, to give this stap to them, and shut them 
up in silence. This-babit. got by children, of.stay- 
ing the forwardness of their fancies, and delibera- 
ting whether it be fit or-not, before they speak, will 
be of no small advantage to them in matters of 
greater consequence, in the future course of their 
lives. For that which I cannot too often inculcate, 
is, that whatever the matter be about which it is 
conversant, whether great: or small, the main (I 
had almost said only) thing to be considered in 
every action of a child, is, what influence it will 
have upon his mind; what habit it tends to, and.is 
like to settle in him ; how it will become him when 
he is bigger; and if it be encouraged, whither it 
will lead him, when he:is grown up. 
My meaning therefore is not, that children should 
purposely be made uneasy. This would relish too 
much of inhumanity and ill nature, and be apt to 
infect them with it. They should be brought to 
deny their appetites; and their minds, as well as 
bodies, be made vigorous, easy, and strong, by the 
custom of having their inclinations in subjection, 
aad their bodies exercised with bardships: but all 
this, without giving them any mark or apprehen- 
sion of ill will towards them. The constant loss of 
what they craved, or carved to themselves, should
-P-A-G-E-227
158 SELF-DENIAL; 
teach. them modesty, submission, and a power to 
forbear: -but the rewarding their modesty, and 
silence, by giving them what they liked, should 
also assure them of the love of those who rigorously 
exacted this obedience. The contenting themselves 
now in the want of what’ they wished for, is a vir- 
tue, that. another time should be rewarded with 
what is suited and acceptable to them; which 
should be bestowed on them, as if it were a natural 
consequence of their good behaviour, and not a 
bargain about it. But you will lose your labour, 
and what is' more, their love and reverence too, if 
they can receive from others what you deny them. 
This is to be kept very staunch, and carefully to be 
watched. And here the servants come again inmy 
way. 
108. If this be begun betimes, and they accustom 
themselves early to silence their desires, this useful 
” habit will settle them; and as they come to grow 
up in age. and discretion, they may be allowed 
greater liberty, when reason comes to speak in them, 
and not passion : for whenever reason would speak, 
it should be hearkened to. But as they should 
never be heard, when they speak for any particular 
thing they would have, unless it be first proposed 
to them; so they should always be heard, and fairly 
and: kindly answered, when they ask after any 
thing they would know, and desire to be informed 
about. - Curiosity should be as carefully cherished 
in children, as other appetites suppressed. (**)

  RECREATION. 159 
RECREATION. 
However strict a hand is to be kept upon all 
desires of fancy, yet there is one case wherein fancy 
must be permitted to speak, and be hearkened to 
also. Recreation is as necessary as labour or food. 
But because there can be no recreation without 
delight, which depends not always on reason, but 
oftener on fancy, it must be permitted children not 
only to divert themselves, but to do it after their 
own fashion, provided it be innocently, and without 
prejudice to their health; and therefore in this case 
they should not be denied, if they proposed any 
particular kind of recreation. Though I think in 
a well-ordered education, they will seldom be 
brought to the necessity of asking any such liberty: 
care should be taken, that what is of advantage to 
  though it be certainly a passion which we ought to cherish, nu- 
merous occasions will occur, as those conversant with the busi- 
ness of education well know, when you can neither reply to their 
questions with propriety, nor safely repress their desire of know- 
ledge, but must escape by an evasion, or declare plainly that you 
possess information above their reach, or which it were dangerous 
to impart to them. “How is it that the moon hangs, without 
falling, over yonder hill ?” inquires a child of its father. “I 
cannot now explain it to you, my dear; for you would not un- 
derstand ms.” This appeared to be the best answer; but mark 
the unfavourable conclusion immediately drawn by the young 
querist.. ‘‘Won’t you explain it to me, because you don’t 
know, papa?” From this inference of ignorance to cbntempt 
the passage is easy. Children must, therefore, be impressed 
with the idea that their minds are weak, and incapable of receiy- 
ing certain kinds of knowledge, for which they must wait till 
years confer greater strength upon their judgment.

them, they should always do with delight; and 
before they are wearied with one; they should be 
timely diverted to some other useful employment. 
But if they are not yet brought to that degree of 
perfection, that one way of improvement can be 
made a recreation to them, they must be let loose 
to the childish play they fancy ; which they should 
be weaned from, by being made to surfeit of it: 
but from things of use, that they are employed in, 
they should always be sent away with an appetite, 
at least be dismissed before they are tired, and grow 
quite sick of it, (*) that so they may return to it 
again, as to a pleasure that diverts them. For you 
must never think them set right, till they can find 
delight in the practice of laudable things; and the 
aseful exercises of the body and mind, taking their 
turns, make their lives and improvements pleasant 
in a continued train of recreations, wherein the 
wearied part is constantly relieved and refreshed. 
Whether. this can be, done in every temper, or 
whether tutors and parents will be at the pains, and 
have the discretion and patience to bring them to 
this, I know not; but that it may be done in most 
children, if a right course be taken to raise in them 
the desire of credit, esteem, and reputation, I do

not at all doubt. And when they have so much 
true life put into them, they may freely be talked 
with about what most delights them, and be directed, 
or let loose to it; so that they may perceive that: 
they are beloved and cherished, and that those 
under whose tuition they are, are not enemies to 
their satisfaction, Such a management will make 
them in love with the hand that directs them, aad 
the virtue they gre directed to. 
This farther advantage may be made by a free 
liberty permitted them in their recreations, that it 
will discover their natural tempers, show theit 
inclinations and aptitudes, and thereby direct wise 
parents in the choice, both of the course of life, and 
employment ‘they shall design them for, and of fit 
remedies, in the meantime, to be applied to what- 
ever bent of nature they may observe most likely 
to mislead any of their children. 
109. 2. Children who live together, often strive 
for mastery, whose wills shall carry it over the rest; 
whoever begins ‘the contest, should be sure to be 
crossed in it. But not only that, bat they should 
be taught to have all the deference, eomplaisance, 
and civility one for another imaginable. This, 
when they see it procures them respect, love and 
esteem, and that they lose no superiority by it, 
they will take ‘more pleasure in, than in insolent 
domineering ; ‘for so plainly is the other.

nates their minds to suffer them to complain ; and 
if-they endure sometimes crossing, or. pain from 
others, without: being permitted to think it strange 
or intolerable, it will do them.no harm to learn 
sufferance, and harden them early. But though 
you give no countenance to the complaints of the 
querulous, yet take care to curb the insolence and 
ill nature of the injurious. When you observe it 
yourself, reprove it before the injured party : but if 
the complaint be of something really worth your 
notice, and prevention another time, then reprove 
the offender by himself alone, out of sight of him 
that complained, and make him go and ask pardon, 
and make reparation: which coming thus, as it 
were from himself, will be the more cheerfully 
performed, and more kindly received, the love 
strengthened between them, and a custom of civility 
grow familiar amongst your children. 
110. 3. As to the having and possessing of 
things, teach them to part with what they have 
easily and freely, to their friends, and Jet them find 
by experience that the most liberal has always the 
most plenty, with esteem and commendation to boot, 
- and they will quickly learn to practise it. This, I 
imagine, will make brothers and sisters kinder and 
civiler to one another, and consequently to others, 
than twenty rules about good manners, with which 
children are ordinarily perplexed and cumbered. 
Covetousness, and the desire of having in our pos- 
session, and under our dominion, more than we 
have need of, being the root of all evil, should be 
early and carefully weeded out, and the contrary

commendation and eredit, and constantly taking 
care that he loses nothing by his liberality. Let all 
the instances he gives of such freeness be always 
repaid, and with interest; and let him sensibly 
perceive, that the kindness he shows to others, is no 
ill husbandry for himself; but that. it brings a re- 
tarn of kindness both from those that receive it and 
those who look on. Make this a contest among 
children, who'shall outdo one another this way: 
and by this means, by a constant practice, children 
having made it easy to themselves to part with 
what they have, good nature may be settled in 
them into a habit, and they may take pleasure, 
and pique themselves in being kind, liberal, and 
civil to others. 
If liberality ought to. be encouraged, certainly 
great care is to be taken that children transgress 
not the rules. of justice: and whenever they do, 
they. should be set right, and if there be occasion 
for it, severely rebuked.

cormm rebus utebatur, commodato sumens ab illis pocula, aulea

than ‘teasén or ‘reflection, it is no wonder that in 
children they should be very apt to deviate from the 
just ‘measures of right and wrong; which are in 
the ‘thind the result of improved ‘reason, and serious 
meditation. This, the more they are apt to mis- 
lake, the iniore careful guard bught to be kept over 
them, and every the least slip in this great social 
virtue taken notice of, and rectified; and that in 
things of the least weight and moment, both to 
instruct théir ignorance, and ‘prevent ill habits ; 
which from small beginnings in pins and cherry- 
stones, will, if let alone, grow up to higher frauds, 
and be in danger to end at last in downright 
. hardened dishoresty.. The first tendency to any 
injustice that appears, must be suppressed with a 
show of wonder and abhorrence in the parents and 
governors. But because children cannot well com- 
prehend what injustice is, till they understand pro- 
perty, and how particular persons come by it, the 
safest way to secure honesty, is to lay the founda- 
tions of it early in liberality, and an easiness to part 
with to others whatever they have or like them- 
selves. This may be taught them early, before 
they have language and understanding enough to 
form distinct notions of property, and to know 
what is theirs by a peculiar right, exclusive of 
others. And since children seldom have any thing 
“but by gift, and that for the most part from their 
parents, they may be at first taught not to take or 
keep any thing but what is given them by those 
whom they take to have a power over it. And as: 
their capacities enlarge, other rules and cases of
-P-A-G-E-234
oe eet CRYING, 165 
justice, and rights concerning mewm and tuum, 
may be proposed and inculcated. If any act of 
injustice in them appears to proceed, not from 
mistake, but a pervérseriess in their wills, when a 
gentle rebuke and shame will not reform this irre- 
gular and covetous inclination, rougher remedies 
must be applied: and it is but for the father or 
tutor to take and keep from them something that 
they value'and think their own, or order some- 
body else to do it; and by such instances, make 
them sensible what little advantage they are like to 
make by possessing themselves unjustly of what is 
another's, whilst there are in the world stronger 
and more men than they. But if an ingenuous de- 
testation of this shameful vice be but carefully and 
early instilled into them, as I think it may, that is 
the true and genuine method to obviate this crime, 
and will be a better. guard against dishonesty than — 
any considerations drawn from interest; habits 
working more constantly, and with greater facility, 
than reason,' which, when’ we have most need of 
it, is seldom fairly consulted, and more rarely 
obeyed. 
CRYING. 
111. Crying is a fault that should not be tole- 
rated in children ; not only for the unpleasant and 
unbecoming noise it fills the house with, but for more 
considérable reasons, in reference to the children 
themselves: which is to be our aim in education. 
Their crying is of two sorts; either stubborn 
and domineering, or querulous and whining:
-P-A-G-E-235
166 CRYING. 
“4. Their crying is very often a striving for mas- 
‘tery, and an open declaration of their insolence or 
obstinacy; when they have not the power to ob- 
tain their desire, they will, by their clamour and 
sobbing, maintain their.title and right to it. This 
is an avowed continuing of their claim and a sort of 
‘remonstrance against the oppression and injustice 
of those-who deny them what they have a mind to. 
112. 2. Sometimes their crying is the effect 
of pain, or true sorrow, and a bemoaning them- 
selves under it. 
These two, if carefully observed, may, by the 
amien, looks, actions, and particularly by the tone 
of their crying, be easily distinguished ; but nei- 
ther of them must be suffered, much less encou- 
raged. 
1. The. obstinate, or stomachful erying, should 
by no means be permitted, because it is but ano- 
ther. way of flattering their desires, and encou- 
raging those passions which it is our main business 
to subdue: and if it be, as often it is, upon the 
receiving any correction, it quite defeats all the 
good effects of it; for any chastisement which 
leaves them in this declared opposition, only serves 
to make them worse. - The restraints and punish- 
ments laid on children are all misapplied and lost, 
as far as they do not prevail over their wills, teach 
them. to submit. their passions, and make their 
minds supple and pliant to what their parent’s rea- 
son advises them now, and so prepare them to obey 
what their own reason shall advise hereafter, But 
if in any thing wherein they are crossed, they may
-P-A-G-E-236
CRYING, 167 
be suffered to go away crying, they confirm them- 
selves-in. their desires, and cherish the ill humour, 
with a declaration of their right, and a resolution 
to satisfy. their inclination the first opportunity. 
This therefore is another argument against the fre- 
quent use of blows: for, whenever you come to 
that extremity it is not enough to whip or beat 
them, you .must-do. it till you find you have sub- 
dued their minds, till with submission and patience 
they yield tothe correction; which you shall best 
discover by their crying, and their ceasing from it 
upon your bidding. : Without this, the beating of 
children is but a passionate tyranny over them ; 
and it is mere cruelty, and not correction, to put 
their bodies in pain, without doing their minds any 
good. As this gives us'a reason why children 
should ‘seldom be corrected, so it. also prevents 
their being so. For if, whenever they are chastised, 
it were done thus without passion, soberly, and 
yet effectually too, laying on the blows and smart 
not furiously, and all at once, but slowly, with 
reasoning between, and with observation how it 
wrought,. stopping when it had made them pliant, 
penitent and yielding; they would seldom need the 
like punishment again, being made careful to avoid 
the fault that deserved it.. Besides, by this means, 
as the punishment would. not be lost for being too 
little, and not effectual, so it would be kept from 
being too much, if we gave. off as soon as we per- 
ceived that it reached.the mind, and that it was 
bettered. For since the chiding or beating of chil- 
dren should be always the least that possibly may

be, thet. which is laid on in the heat of anger, sel- 
dem.-observes the measure,. but is commonly more 
than: it should be, though it proves less than 
enough. 
-- 113. 2. Many children are apt to ery, upon any 
little paim they suffer, and :the least harm that 
befals them, put them into complaints and bawling. 
This few children avoid : for it being the first and 
natural way te declare their suffering or wants, be- 
fore they can speak, the compassion that is thought 
due to that tender. age foolishly encourages, and 
continues it, in them long after they can speak. It 
is the duty, I confess, of those about children, to 
compassionate them, whenever they suffer any 
hurt; but not to show it in pitying them. Help 
and ease them the best: you can, but by no means 
bemoan them... This softens their minds, and 
makes them yield to the litde harms that happen 
to them; whereby they sink deeper into that part, 
which alone. feels, and make larger wounds there, 
than otherwise they would. They should be 
hardened against all sufferings, especially of the 
body, and have no tenderness but what rises from 
an. ingenuous shame, and a quick sense of reputa- 
tion. The many inconveniences this life is ex- 
posed to, require we should not be too sensible 
of every little hurt. What our minds yield not to 
makes but a slight impression, and does us but very 
little harm. . It is the suffering of our spirits, that 
gives and continues the pain. This brawniness 
and _insensibility of mind, is the best armour we 
can have against the common evils and accidents
-P-A-G-E-238
CRYING. 169 
of life; and being a.temper that is to be got by 
exercise and custom, more than any other way, the 
practice of it should be: begun bétimes ; and happy 
is he that is taught it early. That effeminacy of 
spirit, which is to be prevented or cured, as nothing 
that E know so much imereases in children as cry- 
ing; so nothing, on the other side, so much 
checks and restrains, as their’ being. hindered from 
that sort of complaining. In the little harms they 
suffer from knocks and falls, they should not be 
pitied for falling, but bid do so again; which ‘be- 
sides that. it stops their crying, is a better way to 
cure their heedlessness, and prevent their tumbling 
another time, than either chiding or bemoaning 
them. But, let the hurts they receive be what 
they will, stop their crying, and that will give 
them more quiet and ease at. present, and harden 
them for the future. 
114, The former sort of crying requires severity 
to silence it; and where a look, or a positive com- 
mand will not do it, blows must: for it proceeding 
from pride, obstinacy, and: stomach, the will, where 
the fault lies, must be.bent, and made to comply, 
by a rigour sufficient to master it. But this latter 
being ordinarily from softness of mind, a quite 
contrary cause, ought to. be treated with-a gentler 
hand. | Persuasion, or ‘diverting the thoughts 
another way; or langhing: at their whining, may 
perbaps be. at first the proper’ method: but for 
this, the circumstances: of the thing, and the par- 
ticular temper of the child, must be considered, 
No certain: unvariable rales can be given about
-P-A-G-E-239
170 CRYING. 
it ; but it must be left to the prudence of the parents 
or'tutor. But this, I think, I may say in general, 
that’ there should be a constant discountenancing 
‘of this sort of crying also; and that the father, by 
his authority, should always stop it, mixing a 
‘greater degree of roughness in his looks or words, 
‘proportionably as the child is of a greater age, or 
a sturdier temper: but always let it be enough 
‘to silence their whimpering, and put an end to the 
disorder. 
113. Cowardice and courage are so nearly re- 
lated to the fore-mentioned tempers, that it may 
not be amiss here to take notice of them. Fear is 
a passion, that, if rightly governed, has its use. 
And though self-love seldom fails to keep it watch- 
ful-and high enough in us, yet there may be an 
‘excess on the daring. side. Fool-hardiness and 
insensibility of danger, being as little reasonable, 
as trembling and shrinking at the approach of 
every little evil. - Fear was given us as a monitor 
to quicken our industry, and keep us‘upon our 
guard against the approaches of evil ; and therefore 
to have'no apprehension of mischief at hand, not to 
. thake a just estimate of the danger, but heedlessly 
to ran into it, be the hazard what it will, without 
tonsidering of what, use or consequence it may be, 
is not the resolution of a rational creature, but 
bratish fury.. Those who have children of this 
temper, have nothing -to do, but a little to awaken 
their reason, which self-preservation will quickly 
dispose them to hearken to, unless (which is usually 
the case) some other passion hurries them on head-
-P-A-G-E-240
FORTITUDE. 171 
long, without sense, and without consideration. A 
dislike of evil is so natural to mankind, that no- 
body, I think, can be without fear of it: fear being 
nothing but an uneasiness under the apprebension 
of that coming upon, us which we dislike. And 
therefore, whenever any one runs into danger, we 
may say, it is under the. conduct of ignorance, or 
the command of some more imperious. passion, 
nobody being so much an enemy to himself, as to 
come within the reach of evil, out of free choice, 
and court danger for danger’s sake. If it be there- 
fore pride, vain-glory, or rage, that silences a 
child’s fear, or makes him not hearken to. its advice, 
those are by fit means to be abated, that a little 
consideration may allay his heat, and make him 
bethink himself, whether this attempt be worth the 
venture, But this being a fault that children are not 
so often guilty of, I shall not be more particular in 
its cure. Weakness of spirit is the more common 
defect, and therefore will require the greater care. 
FORTITUDE. 
Fortitude is the guard and support of theother vir- 
tues; and without courage a man will scarce keep 
steady to his duty, and fill up the character of a 
traly. worthy man. 
Courage, that makes us bear up against dangers 
» that: we fear, and evils that we feel, is of great use 
in an estate, as ours is in this life, exposed to 
assaults on all hands: and therefore it is very ad- 
visable to get children into this armour as early as 
we can... Natural temper, I confess, does here a
-P-A-G-E-241
172 COURAGE. 
great.déal: but even where that is defective, and 
the heart is.in itself weak and timorous, it may, by 
a right: management, be brought to a better resolu- 
tions: What is to be done to prevent breaking 
children’s spirits by frightful apprehensions instilled 
into them when young, or bemoaning themselves 
under every little suffering, I have already taken 
notice; how to harden their tempers, and raise 
their courage, if we find them too much subject to 
fear, is farther to be considered. 
True fortitude, I take to be the quiet possession 
of a man’s self, and an undisturbed doing his duty, 
whatever evil besets, or danger lies in his way. 
This there are so few men attain to, that we are not 
to expect it from children. But yet something may 
be done: and a wise conduct by insensible degrees 
may carry them farther than one expects. 
The neglect of this great care of them, whilst 
they are young, is the reason, perhaps, why there 
are so few ‘that have this virtue in its full latitude, 
when they are men, (*) I should not say this in a 
nation so naturally brave, as ours is, did I think 
that true fortitude required nothing but courage in, 
the field, and contempt of life in the face of an 
enemy. . This, I confess, is not the least part of it, 
nor can be denied the laurels and honours always 
justly due to the valour of those who venture their 
lives for their country, But yet this is not all. 
  ) Men ‘often fase the enemy boldly in the field, who, at 
home, would quail before a sneer or a frown from their supe: 
riors ; but this is merely a species of cowardice, arising from the 
want of. that fortitude which a good education confers.

COWARDICE. 173 
Dangers attack us in other places, besides the field 
of battle; and though death be the king of terrors, 
yet pain, disgrace and poverty have frightful looks, 
able to discompose most men, whom they seem 
ready to seize on: and: there are those who con- 
temn some of these, and yet are heartily frighted 
with the other. True fortitude is prepared fordan- 
gers of all kinds, and unmoved, whatsoever evil it 
be that threatens, I do not mean unmoved with 
any fear at all. Where danger shows itself, ap» 
prehension cannot, without stupidity, be wanting : 
where danger is, sense of danger should be. and 
so much fear as should keep us awake, and excite 
our attention, industry, and vigour, but not disturb 
the calm use of our reason, nor hinder the execu- 
tion of what that dictates, 
COWARDICE. 
The first step to get this noble and manly steadi- 
ness, is, what I have above mentioned, carefully to 
keep children from frights of ali kinds, when they 
are young. Let not any fearful apprehensions be 
talked into them, nor terrible objects surprise them. 
This often so shatters and discomposes the spirit, 
that they never recover it again ; but during their 
whole life, upon the first suggestion or appearance 
of any terrifying idea, are scattered and con- 
founded ; the body is enervated,.and the mind dis- 
turbed;-and the man scarce -himself, or capable of 
any composed or rational action. "Whether this be 
from an habitual motion of the animal spirits, in- 
troduced by:the first strong impression, or from the
-P-A-G-E-243
174 COWARDICE. 
alteration of the constitution by some more unac- 
countable way, this is certain, that so it is. In- 
stances ‘of such who in a weak timorous mind, have 
borne, all their whole lives through, the effects of a 
fright when they were young, are everywhere to 
be seen, and therefore as much as may be to be 
prevented. (*) 
The next thing is by gentle degrees to accustom 
children to those things they are too much afraid 
of. But here great caution is to be used, that you 
do not make too much haste, nor attempt this cure 
too early, for fear lest you increase the mischief 
instead of remedying it. ' Little ones in arms may 
be‘easily kept out of the way of terrifying objects, 
and till they can talk and understand what is said to 
them, are scarce capable of that reasoning and dis- 
course, which should be used, to let them know 
there is no harm in those frightful objects, which 
we would make them familiar with, and do, to 
that purpose, by gentle degrees bring nearer and 
nearer to them. And therefore it is seldom there is 
  
.(%) St. Paul speaks contemptuously of those who through 
fear of death are all their life-time subject to bondage; and 
many, through a much less fear, spend a life of almost constant 
apprehension of evil. Aversion and fear, as Hobbes distinctly 
shows, spring from the same root: “ when the object displeaseth, 
it is called aversion, in respect of the displeasure present; but in 
respect of the displeasure expected, fear.”"—(Treatise on Human 
“Nature, chap. vii. §. 2.) They, therefore, who foster the anti- 
pathies, the irrational dislikes, the perverse idiosyncracies of 
children, voluntarily enfeeble their minds, and lay them open to 
every species of unfounded apprehensions of future displeasure, 
or uneasiness, which we usually denominate fear.
-P-A-G-E-244
COWARDICE. 176, 
need of anyapplication to them of this kind, till after 
they can run about and talk. But yet, if it should 
happen that infants should have taken offence at 
any thing which cannot be easily kept out of their 
way, and that they show marks of terror as often as 
it comes in sight; all the allays of fright, by divert- 
ing their thoughts, or mixing pleasant and agree- 
able appearances with it, must be used, till it.be 
grown familiar and inoffensive to them. ; 
I think we may observe, that, when children 
are first born, all objects of sight, that do not hurt 
the eyes, are indifferent to them; and they are no 
more afraid of a Blackamoor or a lion, than of 
their nurse or.a cat. ()} What is it then, that after- 
wards, in certain mixtures of shape and colour, 
comes to atfright them? Nothing but the appre- 
hensions of harm that accompanies those things. 
Did a child suck every day a new nurse, I make 
account it would be no more affrighted with the 
change of faces at six months old, than at sixty. 
The reason then why it will not come to a stranger, 
is, because having been accustomed to receive its 
food and kind usage only from one or two, that 
are about it, the child apprehends, by coming into 
the arms of a stranger, the being taken from what 
delights and feeds it, and every moment supplies 
its wants, which it often feels, and therefore fears 
when the nurse is away. 
  
(*) This. arises from the same cause that makes some men 
foolhardy, viz. ignorance. By. habit, however, this ignorance 
might be made the mother of much useful wisdom.
-P-A-G-E-245
176 COWARDICE. 
The ‘only thing we are naturally afraid of is 
pait;or loss of pleasure. And because these 
ate ‘not ‘annexed to any shape, colour, or size 
of visible objects, we are frighted with none of 
them, till either we have felt pain from them, or 
have notions put into us that they will do us harm. 
The pleasant brightness and lustre of flame and fire, 
so delights children, that at first they always desire 
to be handling'of it: (*) but when constant expe- 
rience has convinced them, by the exquisite pains it 
has put them to, how cruel and unmerciful it is, they 
are afraid to touch it, and carefully avoid it. This 
being the ground of fear, it is not hard to find 
whence it arises, and ‘how it is to be cured in all 
mistaken objects of terror. And when the mind is 
confirmed against them, and has got a mastery 
over itself, and its usual fears, in lighter occasions, 
itis in good preparation to meet more real dangers. 
Your child shrieks, and runs away at the sight of a 
frog; let ‘another catch it, and lay it down at a 
good distance from him: at first accustom bim to 
look upon it; when he can do that, then to come 
nearer to it, and see it leap without emotion; then 
to touch it lightly, when it is held fast in another's

hand ; ‘and-so on, till he can: come to handle it as 
confidently as a butterfly, or a sparrow. By the 
same Way any other vain terrors may be removed; 
if care be taken, that you go not too fast, and push 
not the child on to a new degree of assurance, till 
he be thoroughly confirmed in the former. And 
thus the young soldier is to be trained on to the 
warfare of life; wherein care is to be taken, that 
more things be not represented as dangerous, than 
teally are-so; and then, that whatever you observe 
him to be more frighted at than he should, you be 
sure to toll him on by insensible degrees, till he 
‘at last, quitting his fears, masters the difficulty, and 
comes off with applause. Successes of this kind 
often repeated, will make him find, that evils are 
not always so certain, or so great, as our fears -re- 
present them ; and that the way to avoid them is 
not to ran away, or be discomposed, dejected, and 
deterred by fear, where either our credit or duty 
requires us to go on. 
HARDINESS. 
But since the great foundation of fear in chil- 
dren is pain, the way to harden, and fortify 
children against fear and danger, is to accustom 
them to suffer pain. This it is possible will 
be thought, by kind parents, a very unnatural 
thing towards their children ; and by most, unrea- 
sonable, to endeavour to reconcile any one to the 
sense of pain, by bringing it uponhim, It will be 
said, it may perhaps give the child an aversion for 
him that makes him suffer; but can never recom-

mend: to him suffering itself. This is a strange 
method. . You will not have children whipped and 
punished for their faults, but you would have them 
tormented for doing well, or for tormenting’s sake. 
I doubt not but such objections as these will be 
made,-and I shall be thought inconsistent with my- 
self, or fantastical, in proposing it. I confess, it is 
athing to be managed with great discretion, and 
therefore it falls not out amiss, that it will not be 
received or relished, but by those who consider 
well, and look into the reason of things. I would 
not have children much beaten for their faults, be- 
cause I would not have them think bodily pain the 
greatest punishment: and I would have them, 
when they do well, be sometimes put in pain, for 
the same reason, that they might be accustomed to 
bear it, without looking on it as the greatest evil. 
How much education may reconcile young people 
to pain and sufferance, the examples of Sparta do 
sufficiently show: and they, who have once brought 
themselves not to think bodily pain the greatest of 
evils, or that which they ought to stand most in 
fear of, have made no small advance towards vir- 
tue. But I am not so foolish to propose the Lace- 
demonian discipline in our age, or constitution. (°°) 
  
() Aware of the prejudices of the vulgar, who, dreading the 
accusation of pedantry, avoid all reference to classical examples, 
Locke appears to have somewhat dissembled bis admiration of 
Lycurgus’s system of education. In many respects, no doubt, it 
was extremely faulty, as I shall elsewhere have occasion to 
prove ; but in inculcating a patient endurance of corporal suffer- 
ing no institutions hitherto submitted to the world have been 
equally successful,
-P-A-G-E-248

But yet I do say, that inuring children gently to 
suffer some degrees of pain without shrinking, is 
a way to gain firmness to their minds, and lay a 
foundation for courage and resolution, in the future 
part of their lives. 
Not to bemoan them, or permit them to bemoan 
themselves, on every little pain they suffer, is the 
first step to be made. But of this I have spoken 
elsewhere. 
The next thing is, sometimes designedly to put 
them in pain: but care must be taken, that this be 
done when the child is in good humour, and satis- 
fied of the goodwill and kindness of him that 
hurts him, at the time that he does it. There must 
no marks of anger, or displeasure, on the one side, 
nor compassion, or repenting, on the other, go along 
with it: and it must be sure to be no more than 
the child can bear, without repining or taking it 
amiss, or for a punishment. Managed by these 
degrees, and with such circumstances, I have seen 
a child.run away laughing, with good smart blows 
of a wand on his back, who would have cried for 
an unkind word, and been very sensible of the 
chastisement of a cold look, from the same person. 
Satisfy a child, by a constant course of your care 
and kindness, that you perfectly love him, and he 
may by degrees be accustomed to bear very painful, 
and rough usage from you, without -flinching or 
complaining: and this we see children do every 
day in play one with another. The softer you find 
your child is, the more you are to seek occasions, 
at fit times, thus to harden him. The great art in’ 
N2
-P-A-G-E-249
180 HARDINESS. 
this is, to begin with what is but very little painful, 
and to proceed by insensible degrees, when you are 
playing, and in good hurhour with him, and speak- 
ing. well of him: and when you have once got 
him to think bimself made amends for his suffering, 
by the praise which is given him for his courage; 
when he can take a pride in giving such marks of 
his manliness, and can prefer the reputation of 
being brave and stout, to the avoiding a little pain, 
or the shrinking under it; you need not despair 
in time, and by the assistance of his growing rea- 
son, to. master his timorousness, and mend the 
weakness of his constitution. As he grows big- 
ger, he is to be set upon bolder attempts than his 
natural temper carries him to, and whenever he is 
observed to flinch from what one has reason to 
think he would come off well in, if he had but 
courage to undertake: that he should be assisted 
in at, first, and by. degrees shamed to, till at last 
practice has given more assurance, and with ita 
mastery; which must be rewarded with great 
praise, and the good opinion of others, for his 
performance. When by these steps he has got re- 
solution enough not to be deterred, from what he 
ought to do, by the apprehension of danger; when 
fear does not, in sudden or hazardous occurrences, 
discompose his mind, set his body a trembling, and 
make him unfit for action, or run away from it, he 
has then the courage of a rational creature: and 
such a hardiness we should endeavour. by custom 
and use to bring children to, ax proper occasions 
come in our way.

CRUELTY. 181 
CRUELTY. 
116, One thing I havé frequently observed in 
children, that when they have got possession of 
any poor creature, they are apt to use it ill: 
they often torment and treat very roughly, young 
birds, butterflies, and such other poor animals, 
which fall into their hands, and that with a seem- 
ing kind of pleasure. (©) This, I think should 
be watched in them, and if they incline to any 
such cruelty, they should be taught the contrary 
usage. For the custom of tormenting and killing 
of beasts, will, by degrees, harden their minds 
even towards men; and they, who delight in the 
suffering and destruction of inferior creatures, will 
not be apt to be very compassionate, or benign 
to those of their own kind.(“) Our practice 
takes notice of this.in. the exclusion of butchers 
from juries of life and death. Children should 
from the beginning be bred up in an abhorrence of 
  
(®) It is related that, in order by extreme terror to inculcate 
salutary. lessons of humanity, the court of Areopagus, at Athens, 
once put to death a boy incorrigibly addicted to indulge in cruelty 
towards the inferior animals; inferring that, when years should 
endow him with superior strength, he would exercise the same 
cruelties towards men. But this was to repress a lesser, by com- 
mitting a greater crime. (°') Tn a note to his “ Europe during the Middle Ages,” Mr. 
Hallam gives a very curious account of a knight who, in order 
to inure his son to the shedding of blood, used to make him a 
present of several prisoners of war, in cutting whose throats he 
might amuse himself in the court of his father’s castle, and thus 
acquire the habit of killing men with coolness. This is quite in 
keeping with the general manners of those ferocious knights,

killing, or tormenting any living creature; and be 
taught not to spoil or destroy any thing, unless it 
be‘for. the preservation or advantage of some other 
‘that is nobler. And truly, if the preservation of 
all mankind, as much as in him lies, where every 
one’s persuasion, as indeed it is every one’s duty, 
‘and the true principle to regulate our religion, 
politics, and morality by, the world would be much 
quieter, and better natured than it is. But to re- 
turn to our present business; I cannot but com- 
mend both the kindness and prudence of a mother 
I knew, who was wont always to indulge her 
daughters, when any of them desired dogs, squir- 
rels, birds, or any such things, as young girls use 
to be delighted with: but then, when they had 
them, they must be sure to keep them well, and 
look diligently after them, that they wanted no- 
thing, or were not ill used. For if they were 
negligent in their care of them, it was counted a 
great fault, which often forfeited their possession, 
or at least they failed not to be rebuked for it; 
whereby they were early taught diligence and good 
nature. And indeed, I think people should be 
accustomed, from their cradles, to be tender to all 
sensible creatures, and to spoil or waste nothing at 
all, , 
from whom, according to Mr. Nelson Coleridge, modern nations 
have inherited a knowledge of the “ point of honour,” of which, 
he says, the Greeks were wholly ignorant! The true picture of 
the times of chivalry, given by St. Palaye, leads us to congratu- 
late the Greeks on their ignorance of such principles of honour as 
prevailed in those most savage and brutal ages, when the women 
were generally as unchaste as the men were barbarous.  
-P-A-G-E-252
CRUELTYs 183 
This delight they take in doing of mischief; 
whereby I mean spoiling of any thing to no pur- 
pose, but more especially the pleasure they take 
to put any thing in pain, that is. capable of it, I 
cannot persuade myself tobe any other than a 
foreign and introduced. disposition, a habit bor- 
rowed from custom and'conversation. People teach 
children to strike, and laugh, when they hart, or 
see harm come to others: and they have the ex- 
amples of most about them, to confirm them in it. 
All the entertainment and talk of history is of no- 
thing almost but fighting and killing: and the 
honour and renown that is bestowed on conquerors 
(who for the most part are but the great butchers 
of mankind) (*) farther mislead growing youth, who 
by this means come to think slaughter the laudable 
business of mankind, and the most heroic of.vir- 
tues. By these steps unnatural cruelty is planted in 
us; and what humanity abhors, custom reconciles 
and recommends to us, by laying it in the way to 
honour. . Thus, by fashion and opinion, that comes 
to be a pleasure, which in itself neither is, nor can 
be any. This ought carefully to be watched, and 
early remedied ; so as to settle and cherish the con- 
  
() Duellists, who still in semibarbarous countries, are treated. 
by the vulgar with a sort of respect, are butchers of mankind on 
a small scale. Even in our own Parliament House, however, 
where, if anywhere, we might expect to find a gentlemanly feel- 
ing and sound sense, individuals are not wanting who wish to 
argue with pistols when their knowledge or their intellect fails 
them. Till this practice becomes extinct, we shall always, in 
spite of our other social improvements, bear about us marks of 
the savage, traces of the barbarous race from which we sprung,
-P-A-G-E-253

trary,and more natural temper of benignity and 
compassion in the room of it: but still by the same 
gentle methods which are to be applied to the 
other two faults before mentioned. It may not 
perhaps be unreasonable here to add this farther 
caution, viz. That the mischiefs or harms, that 
come by play, inadvertency, or ignorance, and 
were not known to be harms, or designed for mis- 
chief’s sake, though they may perhaps be some- 
_ times of considerable damage, yet are not at all, or 
but very gently to be taken notice of. For this, I 
think, I cannot too often inculcate, that whatever 
miscarriage a child is guilty of, and whatever be 
the consequence of it, the thing to be regarded in 
taking notice of it, is only what root it springs 
from, and what habit it is like to establish: and to 
that the correction ought to be directed, and the 
child not to suffer any punishment, for any harm 
which may have come by his play or inadvertency. 
The. faults to be amended lie in the mind ; and if 
they are such, as either age will cure, or no ill ha- 
bits will follow from; the present action, whatever 
displeasing circumstances it: may have, is to be pas- 
sed by, without any animadversions. 
117 Another way to instil sentiments of hu- 
manity, and to keep them lively in young folks, 
will be, to accustom them to civility in their lan- 
guage and deportment towards their inferiors and 
the: meaner sort of people, particularly servants. 
It is not unusual to observe the children in gentle- 
men’s families treat the servants of the house with 
domineering words, names of contempt, and an
-P-A-G-E-254
CRUELTY, 185 
imperious carriage; as if they were of another 
race and species beneath them. (°) Whether ill ex- 
ample, the advantage of fortune, or their natural 
vanity inspire this haughtiness, it should be pre- 
vented, or weeded out; and a gentle, courteous, 
affable carriage towards the lower ranks of men, 
placed in the room of it. No- part of their supe- 
tiority will be hereby lost; but the distinction.in- 
creased, and their authority strengthened ; when 
love in inferiors is joined to outward respect, and 
an esteem.of the person has a, share in their sub- 
mission: and domestics will pay a more ready and 
cheerful service, when they find themselves not 
spurned, because fortune has laid them below the 
level of others, at their master’s feet. Children 
should not be suffered to lose the consideration of 
human nature, in the shufflings of outward condi- 
tions. The more they have, the better humoured 
they should be taught to be; and the more com- 
passionate and gentle to those of their brethren who 
are placed lower, and have seantier portions. If 
they are suffered from their cradles to treat men ill 
and rudely, because, by their father’s title, they 
think they have a little power over them, at best it 
is ill-bred, and if care be not taken, will by de- 
grees nurse up their natural pride into an habitual

beat their dependants to death, for making a mistake in market-

a CURIOSITY. 
-- 118. Curiosity in children (which I had oc- 
casion just to mention, §. 108,) is but an appetite 
after knowledge; and therefore ought to be en- 
couraged in them not only as a good sign, but as 
the great instrament Nature has provided, to re- 
move that ignorance they were born with; and 
which, without.this busy inquisitiveness, will make 
them dull and useless creatures. The ways to 
encourage it and keep it active and busy, are, I 
suppose, these following. 
1. Not to check or discountenance any enquiries 
he shall make, nor suffer them to be laughed at; 
but to answer all his questions, and explain the 
matter he desires to know, so as to make them as 
much intelligible to him, as suits the capacity of 
his age and knowledge. But confound not his 
understanding with explications or notions that are 
above it: or with the variety or number of things 
that are not to his present purpose. Mark what it 
is his mind aims at in the question, and not what 
words he expresses it in: and when you have in- 
formed and satisfied him in that, you shall see how 
his thoughts will enlarge themselves, and how by 
fit. answers he may be led on farther than perhaps 
you could imagine. For knowledge is grateful to 
  
(8) This is worthy of being written in letters of gold, and 
suspended in the drawing-room of every great house.
-P-A-G-E-256
i 
CURIOSITY. 187 
the understanding, as light to the eyes: (*) children 
are pleased and delighted with it exceedingly, es- 
pecially if they see, that their enquiries are regard- 
ed, and that their desire of knowing is encouraged 
and commended. And I doubt not, but one great 
reason why many children abandon themselves 
wholly to silly sports, and trifle away all their 
time insipidly, is, because they have found their 
curiosity baulked, and their enquiries neglected. 
But had they been treated with more kindness and 
respect, and their questions answered, as they 
should, to their satisfaction; I doubt not but they 
would have taken more pleasure in learning, and 
improving their knowledge, wherein there would 
be still newness and variety, which is what they 
" are delighted with, than in returning over and over 
to the same play and playthings. 
119. 2. To this serious answering their ques- 
tions, and informing their understandings in what 
they desire, as if it were a matter that needed it, 
should be added some peculiar ways of com- 
mendation. Let others, whom they esteem, be 
told before their faces of the knowledge they have 
in such and such things; and since we are all, even 
from our cradles, vain and proud creatures, let 
their vanity be flattered with things that will do 
them good; and let their pride set them on work 
  
() A beautiful thought, elaborated from the common obser- 
vation, that knowledge is the light of the mind. Locke is not 
often figurative or poetical in his language, but when he chooses 
to give play to his fancy, nothing can be more exquisite than the 
comparisons he suggests, or the ideas he presents to the mind.
-P-A-G-E-257

on something which may turn to their advantage. 
Upon ‘this ground you shall find that there cannot 
be a greater spur to the attaining what you would 
have -the eldest. learn and know himself, than to 
set him upon teaching it his younger brothers and 
sisters, 
120. 3. As children’s inquiries are not to be 
slighted; so also great care is to be taken, that 
they never receive deceitful and eluding answers. 
They easily perceive when they are slighted or 
deceived ; and quickly learn the trick of neglect, 
dissimulation, and falsehood, which they observe 
others to make use of. We are not to intrench 
upon truth in any conversation, but least of all 
with children; since if we can play false with 
them, we not only deceive their expectation, and 
hinder their knowledge, but corrupt their inno- 
cence, and:teach them the worst of vices. They 
are travellers newly arrived in a strange country, of 
which they know nothing; we should therefore 
make conscience not to mislead them. And though 
their questions seem sometimes not very material, 
yet they should be seriously answered: for how- 
ever they may appear to us (to whom they are 
long since known) inquiries not worth the mak- 
ing; they are of moment to those who are wholly 
ignorant. Children are strangers to all we are 
acquainted with; and all the things they meet with 
are at first unknown to them, as they once were 
to us: and happy are they who meet with civil 
people, that will comply with their ignorance, and 
help them to get out of it.
-P-A-G-E-258
CURIOSITY. 189 
If you.or I now should be set down in Japan, 
with all our prudence and knowledge about us, a 
conceit whereof makes us, perhaps, so apt to slight 
the thoughts and inquiries of children ; should we, 
I say, be set down in Japan, we should, no doubt 
(if we would inform ourselves of what is there to 
be known) ask a thousand questions, which, to a 
supercilious or inconsiderate Japaner, would seem 
very idle and impertinent; though to us they would 
be very material and of importance to be resolved ; 
and we should be glad to find a man so complaisant 
and courteous, as to satisfy our demands, and in- 
struct our ignorance. 
When any new thing comes in their way, chil- 
dren usually ask the common question of a 
stranger: What is it? Whereby they ordinarily 
mean nothing but the name; and therefore to tell 
them how it is called is usually the proper answer 
to that demand. And the next question usually is: 
What isit for? And to this it should be answered 
truly and directly: the use of the thing should 
be told, and the way explained, how it serves to 
such a purpose, as far as their capacities can com- 
prehend it, And so of any other circumstances 
they shall ask about it; not turning them going, 
till you have given them all the satisfaction they 
are capable of: and so leading them by your 
answers, into farther questions. And perhaps toa 
grown man, such conversation will not be alto- 
gether so idle and insignificant as we are apt to 
imagine. The native and untaught suggestions of 
inquisitive children do often offer things, that may

set a.considering man’s thoughts on work. And 1 
think there is frequently more to be learned from 
the ‘unexpected questions of a child, (®) than the 
discourses of men, who talk in a road, according to 
the notions they have borrowed, and the prejudices 
of their education. 
121. 4. Perhaps it may not sometimes be amiss 
to excite their curiosity, by bringing strange and 
new things in their way, on purpose to engage 
their inquiry, and give them occasion to inform 
themselves about them: and if by chance their 
curiosity leads them to.ask, what they should not 
know; it is a great deal better.to tell them plainly, 
that it is a thing that belongs not to them to know, 
than to pop them off with a falsehood, or a fri- 
volous answer. 
122. Pertness, that appears sometimes so early, 
proceeds from a principle, that seldom accompa- 
nies a strong constitution of body, or ripens into a 
strong judgment of mind. If it were desirable to 
have a child a more brisk talker, I believe there 
might ways be found to make him so: but I sup- 
pose a wise father had rather that his son should 
be able and useful, when a man, than pretty com- 
pany, and a diversion to others, whilst a child: 
  
{*) This is an extremely acute remark, and shows he was 
well acquainted with the conversation of children, by which the 
wisest men may frequently profit. It places them in a position 
which they quitted long before they could register their observa- 
tions, and enables them, by the help of younger and more unworn 
eyes, to view things ina light in which they can never, but by such 
reflection, appear to them.

though if that too were to be considered, I think 
I may say, there is not so much pleasure to have a 
child prattle agreeably, as to reason well. En- 
courage therefore his inquisitiveness all you can, 
by satisfying his demands, and informing his judg- 
ment, as far as it is capable. When his reasons 
are any way tolerable, let him find the credit and 
commendation of it: and when they are quite out 
of the way, let him, without being laughed at for 
his mistake, be gently put into the right; and if 
he show a forwardness to be reasoning about things 
that come in his way, take care as much as you 
can, that nobody check this inclination in him, or 
mislead it by captions or fallacious ways of talking 
with him. For when all is ‘done, this, as the 
highest and most important faculty of our minds, 
deserves the, greatest care and attention in culti- 
vating it: the right improvement, and exercise of 
our reason being the highest perfection that a man 
can attain to in this life. 
SAUNTERING. 
123. Contrary to this busy inquisitive temper, 
there is sometimes observable in children, a listless 
carelessness, a want of regard to any.thing, and a 
sort of trifling even at their business, This saun- 
tering humour I look on as one of the worst quali- 
ties that can appear in a child, as well as one of the 
hardest to be cured, where it is natural. But it 
being liable to be mistaken in’ some cases, care 
must be taken to make a right judgment coneern- 
ing that trifling at their books or business, which

easily discern whether it be listlessness in his tent’

saunter away his time of study. 
126. If some defect in his constitution has cast

none of the easiest to be dealt with, because, gene- 
rally carrying with it am unconcernedness for. the

foresight and desire; which, how to plant and in- 
crease, where nature has given a cold and contrary 
temper, will be the question. As soon as you are 
satisfied that this is the case, you must carefully 
enquire whether there be nothing he delights in:

127. If you have not hold enough upon him 
this'way to stir up vigour and activity in him, you 
must employ him in some-constant bodily labour, 
‘whereby he may get a habit of doing something. 
The keeping him: hard to some study were the 
better way to get him a habit of exercising and 
applying his mind. But because this is an invisible 
attention, arid nobody can tell when he is, or is not 
idle at it,.you must: find bodily employments for 
him, which he must be constantly busied in, and 
kept to; and if’ they have some little hardship and 
-shame-in them, it may not be the worse, that they 
may the sooner weary him, and make him desire 
to return to his book. ‘But be sure, when you ex- 
change his book for his other labour, set him such 
a task, to be done in such a time, as may allow 
him. no opportunity:‘to be idle. Only after you 
have by'this:way brought him to be attentive and 
industrious at his book, you may, upon his dis- 
patching his study within the time set him, give 
him, asa reward, some respite from his other Ja- 
bour; which you may diminish as you find him 
grow more and more steady in his application, and, 
at last wholly take off, when his sauntering at his 
book is cured.

128. We formerly observed, that variety and

recommended their plays to them ; and that there- 
fore their book, or any thing we would have them 
jtearn, should not bé’enjoined them as business. 
This their parents, tutors, and teachers are apt to 
forget; and their impatience to have them busied 
in what is fit for them to do, suffers them not to 
deceive them into it: but by the repeated injunc- 
tions they meet ‘with, children quickly. distinguish 
between what is required of them, and what not. 
When this mistake has once made his book uneasy 
to him, the cure is to be applied at the other end. 
And since it will be then too late to ‘endeavour 
to make it a play to him, you must take the con- 
trary course: observe what. play he is most de- 
lighted with; enjoin that, and make him play so 
many hours every day, not as a punishment for 
playing, but as if it were the business required of 
him, -This, if I mistake not, will in a few days make 
him so weary of his most beloved sport, that he 
will prefer his book, or any thing, to it, especially if 
it may redéem him from any. part of the task of play 
which is set him, and he may be suffered to employ 
some part of the time destined to his task of play, 
in his book, or such other exercise as is really use- 
fal to him. This I at: least think a better cure 
than that forbidding, (which usually increases the 
desire,) or any other punishment should be made use 
of to remedy it: for when. you have once glutted 
his appetite (which may. safely be done in all 
things but eating and drinking) and made him sur- 
feit of what you would have him avoid, you bave 
put into him a principle of aversion, and you need
-P-A-G-E-267
198 COMPULSION. 
not so much fear afterwards ‘his longing for the 
same thing again. 
129. This, I think, is sufficiently evident, that 
children generally hate to be idle. All the care 
thenis, that their busy hamour should be constantly 
employed in something of use to them; which, if 
you will attain, you must make what you would 
have them do, a recreation to them, and not a busi- 
ness. The way to do this, so that they may not 
perceive you have any hand in it, is this proposed 
here; viz. to make them weary of that which 
you would not have them do, by enjoining and 
making them, under some pretence or other, do it 
till they are surfeited.. For example: does your 
‘son play at top and scourge too much? Enjoin him 
to play so many hours every day, and look that he 
do it; and you shall see he will quickly be sick of 
it, and willing to leave it, By this means making 
the recreations you dislike a business to him, he 
will of himself with delight betake himself to those 
things you would have him do, especially if they 
be proposed as rewards for having performed his 
task in that play which is commanded him. For, if 
he be ordered every day to whip his top, 80 long as to 
make him sufficiently weary, do you not think he 
will apply himself with eagerness to his book, and 
wish for it, if you promise it him as a reward of 
having whipped his top lustily, quite out all the 
time that is set him? Children, in the things they 
do, if they comport with their age, find little differ- 
ence so they may be doing: the esteem they have 
for one thing above another they borrow from
-P-A-G-E-268

others; so that what those about them make to be 
a reward to them, will really be so. By this art it 
is in their governor's choice, whether scotch-hoppers 
shall reward their dancing, or dancing their scotch- 
hoppers ; whether peg-top, or reading; playing at 
trap, or studying the globes, shall be more accept- 
able and pleasing to them; all that they desire being 
to be busy, and busy, as they imagine, in things of 
their own choice, and which they receive as favours 
from their parents, or others, for whom they have 
respect, and with whom they would be in credit: 
A set of children thus ordered, and kept from the 
ill examples of others, would all of them, I suppose, 
with as much earnestness and delight, learn to read, 
write, and what else one would have them, as 
others do their ordinary plays: and the eldest 
being thus entered, and this made the fashion of 
the place, it would be as impossible to hinder them 
from learning the one, as it is ordinarily to keep 
them from the other. 
PLAY-GAMES. 
130. Play-things, I think, children should have, 
and of divers sorts ; but still to be in the custody 
of their tutors, or somebody else, whereof the child 
should have in his power but one at once, and 
should not be suffered to have another but when he 
restored that. This teaches them betimes to be 
careful of not losing or spoiling the things they 
have ; whereas plenty and variety in their own keep-_ 
ing, makes them wanton and careless, and teaches 
them from the beginning to be squanderers and

wasters’. These, I confess, are: little things, and 
such:as swill'seem beneath the: care of a governor ; 
butinothing that. may. form children’s minds is to 
bév overlooked (®):and neglected, and whatsoever

and is not a small thing in its consequences. 
. One thing more.about children’s play-things may 
be worth their parents’ care.. Though it. be agreed 
they should haye of several sorts, yet, I think, they 
should have none bought forthem. This will hin- 
dex that great variety they are often over-charged 
with, which serves:only to teach the mind to wan- 
der after change and suiperfluity, to be unquiet, and 
perpetually stretching itself after something more 
still, though it knows not what, and never to be 
satisfied with what it.hath. The court that is made 
to people of condition in such kind of presents to 
their children, does the little ones great harm. By 
it they are taught pride, vanity and covetousness, 
almost before they can speak: and I have known 
a young child so distracted with the number and 
variety of his play-games, that he tired his maid 
every day to look them over; and was so accus- 
tomed to abundance, that he never thought he had 
enough, but was always asking, What more? What 
more? What new thing shall I have? A good 
introduction to moderate desires, and the ready 
way to-make a contented, happy man !

-P-A-G-E-270
  , PLAY. 201 
How then shall they have the play-games you 
allow them, if none must be bought for them? 1 
answer, they should‘make them themselves, or at 
least endeavour it, and set themselves about it ; till 
then they should have none, and till then they will 
want none of any great‘artifice. A smooth pebble, 
a piece of paper, the mother’s bunch of keys, or 
any. thing they cannot hurt themselves with, serves 
as much to divert little children, as those more 
chargeable and curious toys from the shops, which 
are presently put out of order and broken. Children 
are never dull.or out of humour for want of such 
play-things, unless they have been used to them: 
when ‘they are little, whatever occurs serves the 
tum; and'as they grow bigger, if they are not 
stored by the expensive folly of others, they will 
make them themselves. Indeed, when they once 
begin to set themselves to work about any of their 
inventions, they should be taught and assisted; but 
should have nothing whilst they lazily sit still, 
expecting to be furnished from other hands, with- 
out employing their own. And if you help them: 
where they are at a stand, it will more endear you 
to them than any chargeable toys you shall buy for 
them. Play-things which are above their. skill to 
make, as tops, gigs, battledores, and the like, which 
are to be used with labour, should indeed be pro- 
cured them..These it is convenient they should 
have, not for variety, but. exercise; but these too 
should be given them as bare as might be. Ifthey 
had a top, the scourge-stick and leather-strap 
should be left to their own making and fitting. If
-P-A-G-E-271
202 LYING. 
they sit gaping to have such things drop into their 
mouths, they should go without them. This will 
agcustom them to seek for what they want, in 
themselves, and in their own endeavours ; whereby 
they will be taught moderation in their desires, 
application, industry, thought, contrivance, and 
good husbandry ; qualities that will be useful to 
them when they are men, and therefore cannot be 
learned too soon, nor fixed too-deep. All the plays 
and diversions of children should be directed to- 
wards good useful habits, or else they will intro- 
duce ill ones. Whatever they do, leaves some im- 
pression on that tender age, and from thence they 
receive a tendency to, good or evil: and whatever 
hath such an influence, ought not to be neglected. 
LYING. 
131. Lying is so ready and cheap a cover for any 
miscarriage, and so much in fashion among all 
sorts of people, that a child can hardly avoid ob- 
serving the use which is made of it on all occasions, 
and so can scarce be kept, without great care, 
from getting into it. But it is so ill a quality, 
and the mother of so many ill ones that spawn 
from it, and take shelter under it, that a child 
should be brought up in the greatest abhorrence 
of it imaginable. It should be always (when 
occasionally it comes to be mentioned) spoke of 
before him with the utmost detestation, as a quality 
so wholly inconsistent with the name and character 
of a gentleman, that nobody of any cr 
bear the imputation of a lie; a mark that i:
-P-A-G-E-272
Tn 
NE LYING. 203 
the utmost disgrace, which debases a man to the — 
lowest degree of a shameful meanness, and ranks 
him with the most contemptible part of mankind, 
and the abhorred rascality ; and is not to be endured 
in any one who would converse with people of con- 
dition, or have any esteem or reputation in the 
world. The first time he is found in a lie, it 
should rather be wondered at as a monstrous thing 
in him, than reproved as an ordinary fault. If that 
keeps. him not from relapsing, the next time he 
must be sharply rebuked, and fall into the state of 
great displeasure of his father and mother, and all 
about him, who take notice of it. And if this way 
work not the cure, you must come to blows; for 
after he has been thus warned, a premeditated lie 
must always be looked upon as obstinacy, and never: 
be permitted to escape unpunished. 
132. Children, afraid to have their faults seen in 
their naked colours, will, like the rest of the sons of 
Adam, be apt to make excuses. This is a fault 
usually bordering upon, and leading to untruth, 
and is not to be indulged in them ; but yet it ought 
to be cured rather with shame than roughness. If 
therefore, when a child is questioned for any thing, 
his first answer be an excuse, warn him soberly to tell 
the truth ; and then if he persists to shuffle it off with 
a falsehood, he must be chastised : but if he directly 
confess, you must commend his ingenuousness, 
and pardon the fault, be it what it will; and par- 
don it so, that you never so much as reproach him 
with it, or mention it to him again: for if you 
would have him in love with ingenuousness, and by a

204 LYING. 
constant practice make it habitual to him, you must 
* take care that it never procure him the least incon- 
venience ; ‘but on the contrary, his own confession 
bringing always with it perfect-impunity, should be 
besides encouraged by some marks of approbation. 
Tf his excuse be such at any time that you can- 
not prove it to have any falsehood in it, let it pass 
for true, and be sure not to show any suspicion of 
it. Let him keep up his reputation with you as 
high as is possible : for when once he finds he has 
Jost that, you; have lost a great, and your best hold 
upon him. Therefore let him not think he has the 
character ‘of a liar with-you, as long. as you can 
avoid it without flattering him in it. Thus some 
slips in truth may be overlooked. But after he has 
once been corrected for a lie, you must be sure 
never after to pardon it in him, whenever you find, 
and take notice.to him that he is guilty of it : for it 
being a.fault which he-bas been forbid, and may, 
unless he be'wilful, avoid, the repeating of it is 
perfect perverseness, and must have the chastise- 
ment due to that offence. 
183, This is what I have thought concerning the 
general method of. educating a young gentleman ; 
which, though I am apt to suppose may have some 
influence on the whole course of his education, yet 
Tam far from imagining it contains all those par- 
ticulars which his growing years or peculiar tem- 
per. may require. But this being premised in 
general, we shall, in the next place, descend toa 
more particular consideration of the several parts of 
his education.
-P-A-G-E-274
Gop. 205 
134, That which ‘every. gentleman (that takes 
any care of his education) desires for his son, be+ 
sides the estate he leaves him, is contained (I sup- 
pose) in these four things,: virtue, wisdom, breed- 
ing, and learning. I will not trouble myself whe- 
ther these names ‘do’ not, some of them sometimes 
stand for the same thing, or really include ..one 
another. It serves my. turn here. to’ follow:the 
Popular use of these words, which I presume, is 
clear enough to make me be understood, and I 
hope there will be no difficulty to comprehend my. 
meaning. 
135, I place virtue as the first and most ne- 
cessary of those endowments, that belong to a man 
or a gentleman; as absolutely requisite to make 
him valued and beloved by others, acceptable or 
tolerable to himself. Without that, I think, he 
will be happy neither in this, nor the other 
world, 
136. As the foundation of this, there ought 
very early to be imprinted on his mind a true 
notion of God, as of the independent Supreme 
Being, Author and Maker of all things, from whom 
we receive all our good, who loves us, and gives us 
all things. (7°) And consequent. to this, instil into 
him a love and reverence of this Supreme Being. 
This is enough to begin with, without going to

explain this matter any farther; for fear lest by 
talking too early to him of spirits, and being un- 
seasonably forward to make him understand the 
inconiprehensible nature of that infinite Being, 
his head be either filled with false, or perplexed 
with unintelligible notions of him. Let him only 
be told upon occasion, that God made and governs 
all things, hears and sees every thing, and does all 
manner of. good to those that Jove and obey him ; 
you will find, that being told of such a God, other 
thoughts will be apt to rise up fast enough in his 
mind about him: which as you observe them to 
have any mistakes, you must set right. And I 
think it would be better, if men generally rested in 
such an idea of God, without being too curious in 
their notions about a Being, which all must ac- 
knowledge incomprehensible ; whereby many, who 
have not strength and clearness of thought, to 
distinguish between what they can and what they 
eannot know, run themselves into superstition or 
atheism, making God like themselves, or (because 
they cannot comprehend any thing else) none at 
all. And I am apt to think, the keeping children 
constantly morning and evening to acts of devotion. 
to God, as to their.Maker, Preserver and Benefac- 
tor, in some plain and short form of prayer, suit- 
able to their age and capacity, will be of much

137. Having by gentle degrees, as you find him 
capable of it, settled such an idea of God in his 
mind, and taught him to pray to him, and praise 
him as the Author of his being, and of all the good 
he does or can enjoy; forbear any discourse of 
other spirits, till the. mention of them coming:in 
his way, upon occasion hereafter to be set down,

young, be sure to preserve his tender mind from 
all impressions and notions of spirits and goblins, 
or any fearful apprehensions in the dark. (”') 
This he will be in danger of from the indiscretion 
of servants whose usual method is to awe children, 
and keep them in subjection, by telling them of 
Raw-head and Bloody-bones, and such other names, 
as carry with them the ideas of something terrible 
and hurtful, which they have reason to be afraid of, 
when alone, especially in the dark. This must be 
(7) You may teach a child not to be overcome by the fear of 
hobgoblins ; but preserve him from believing in them you can- 
not, where he must inevitably be surrounded by persons who 
themselves believe. Indeed, a diligent study of the prevailing 
notions of men on this subject in all ages and countries, would 
probably convince us that the belief is not to be at all eradicated, 
though modified by religion and government it may be.

carefully:prevented: for though by this foolish 
way, they may keep them from little faults, yet the 
remedy is much worse than the-disease; and there 
are stamped upon their imaginations ideas, that 
follow them -with terror and‘affrightment. Such 
bug-bear thoughts, once got into the. tender minds 
of children, and being.set on with a strong im- 
pression, from the dread that accompanies such 
apprehensions, sink deep, and fasten themselves 
so as not easily, if ever to be got. out again; and 
whilst they are there, frequently haunt them with 
strange visions, making children dastards when 
alone, and afraid of their shadows and darkness all 
their lives after. I have had those complain to 
me, when men, .who.had been thus used when 
young; that though their reason corrected the 
wrong ideas they had taken in, and they were sa- 
tisfied, that there. was no: cause to fear invisible 
beings more.in:the dark than in the light, yet 
that these,notions were apt. still upon any occa- 
‘sion to start up.first in their prepossessed fancies, 
and not to be removed. without some pains. (7*) 
And to let you see, how lasting and frightful 
  » (79). In fact, this belief, when once it has taken possession of 
the mind, is not to be removed at all. For, in the first place, 
reason itself teaches us to fear in the dark, since in whatever di- 
rection we move, our steps may lead us among hurtful things, 
which, because we cannot see them, it is impossible we should 
avoid. All beings are then invisible ; and our dyead of spirits 
clothed with matter, which by experience we know have power! 
to harm, very easily in imaginative persons superinduces the in- 
stinctive apprehension of spirits not so clothed, of which indeed| 
they know nothing; but for that reason fear the more.

TRUTH AND GOOD-NATURE. 
139. Having laid the foundations of virtue in a 
true notion of a God, such as the creed wisely 
teaches, as far as his age is capable, and by accus- 
toming him to pray to him; the next t'” 
taken care of, is to keep him exactly t 
of truth, and by all the ways imagin: 
ing him to be good-natured. Let him

and is enough for: laying the first foundations of 
virtue in a child:.as he grows'up, the tendency of 
his natural inclination: must. be observed ; which, 
as it inclines him, more than is convenient, on one 
or the other side, from. the right path of virtue, 
ought to have proper remedies applied. . For few 
of Adam’s children are so happy, as not to:be born 
with some bias in their natural temper, which itis 
the business of education either to take’ off, ot 
counterbalance. But to enter into particulars of 
this, would be beyond the design of this short 
Treatise of Education. I intend not to discourse 
of all the virtues and vices, how each virtue is to be 
attained, and every particular vice by its peculiar 
remedies cured: though I have mentioned some of 
the most ordinary faults, and the ways to be used 
in correcting them. , 
WISDOM. 
140. Wisdom I take, in the popular accepta- 
tion, for a man’s managing his business. ably, 
and with foresight, in this world. This is the 
product’ of :a good ‘natural temper, application 
of mind, and experience together, and so above 
the reach of children.. The greatest thing in them 
that can be done towards it, is to hinder them, 
as much as may be, from being cunning; which, 
being the ape of wisdom, is the most distant 
from it that can be: and, as. an ape for the like- 
ness it has to a man, wanting what really should 
make him so, is by so much the uglier. Cun- 
ning is only the want. of -understanding, which

thoughts, and: to keep him at a distance from false- 
hood and cunning; which has always a broad mix- 
ture of. falsehood in it; is the fittest preparation of 
a child for wisdom. The rest, which is to be 
learned from time, expefienee, and observation, 
and-an.acquaintance with men, their tempers, and 
designs, is not to be expected in the ignorance and 
inadvertency of childhood, or the incons’~ 
heat and. unwariness of youth: all that can b: 
towards it, during this unripe age, is, as | 
said, to accustom. them to truth and sincer

to reflection on their own actions. 
Sign ls " GOOD- BREEDING. 
14h. The next ‘good quality belonging to a gen- 
tleman, is good-breeding. There are two sorts of 
ill-breeding: the one a sheepish bashfulness ; and
-P-A-G-E-282
BREEDING. 213 
the other a mishecoming negligence and disre- 
spect in our carriage; both which are avoided by. 
duly observing this.one rule, not to think meanly 
of ourselves, and not to think meanly of others, 
142. The first part ofthis rule must not be 
understood in opposition to humility, but to as- 
surance. We ought not to think so well of ourselves, 
as to stand upon our own value; and assume! to 
ourselves a preference before others, because of any 
advantage, we may imagine, we have over them} 
but modestly to take what is offered, when it is 
our due. But yet we ought to think so well of 
ourselves, ag to perform those actions which are 
incumbent on, and expected of us, without dis- 
composure or disorder, in' whose presence soever 
we are; keeping that respect and distance, which is 
due to eyery one’s rank and quality, There is 
often in people, especially children, a clownish 
shamefacedness before strangers, or those above 
them: they are confounded. in their thoughts, 
words, and looks; and so lose themselves, in that 
confusion, as not.to beable to do any thing, or 
at least not: do with that freedom and graceful- 
nese, which pleases, and makes them acceptable. 
The only cure for this, as for any other miscar- 
riage, is by use to introduce the contrary habit. 
But since we cannot accustom ourselves to converse 
with strangers, and persons of quality, without 
being in their company, nothing can cure this, 
part. of ill-breeding, but. change and variety of 
company, and that:of persons above us. 
143. As:the before-mentioned consists in too 
great a concern how to behave ourselves towards
-P-A-G-E-283
214 BREEDING. 
others ;!so:the other part of ill-breeding, lies in the 
appearance of too little care of pleasing, or showing 
régpect to thosé we have to do with. To avoid 
this,:these two things are requisite: first, a disposi- 
tion‘of the mind not to offend others; and, second- 
ly, the most acceptable, and agreeable way of ex- 
pressing that disposition. From the one, men are 
called civil; from the other.well-fashioned. The 
latter of these is that. decency and gracefulness of 
looks, voice, words; motions, gestures, and of all 
the whole outward demeanor, which takes in com- 
pany, and makes those with whom we may con- 
verse, easy and well pleased. This is, as it were, 
the language whereby that internal civility of the 
mind is expressed ; which, as other languages are, 
being very much governed by the fashion and eus- 
tom of every country, must, in the rules and prac- 
tice of it, be learned chiefly from observation, and 
the carriage of those who are allowed to be exactly 
well bred. - The other part, which lies deeper than 
the outside, is that general good-will and regard 
for all people; which makes any one have a care 
not to ‘show, in his carriage, any contempt, disre- 
spect, or neglect of them; but to express, according 
to the fashion and ‘way of that country, a respect 
and value’ for them, according to their rank and 
condition. It is'a disposition of the mind that 
shows itself in the carriage, whereby a man avoids 
-making any oné-uneasy in conversation. 
I shall take’ notice of four qualities that are most 
directly opposite ‘to this first, and most taking of 
all thé social virtues, and from some one of these 
four itis that incivility commonly has its rise. I
-P-A-G-E-284
ROUGHNESS. 216 
shall set them down, that children may be preserved 
or recovered from their ill influence. | 
1. The first is, a natural roughness, which makes 
aman uncomplaisant to others, so ‘that he has no 
deference for their inclinations, tempers, or con- 
ditions. It is the sure badge of a clown, not to 
mind what pleases or displeases those he is with ; 
and yet one may often find a man in fashionable 
clothes, give an unbounded swing to his humour, 
and suffer it to justle or overrun any one that 
stands in its way, with a perfect indifferency how 
they take it. This is.a brutality that every one 
sees and abhors, and nobody can be easy with: and 
therefore this finds no place in any one who would 
be thought to have the least tincture of good-breed- 
ing. For the very end and business of good- | 
breeding, is to supply the natural stiffness, and so 
soften men’s tempers, that they may bend to a 
compliance, and accommodate themselves to those 
they have to do with. 
2. Contempt, or want of due respect, discovered 
either in looks, words, or gesture: this, from whom- 
soever it comes, brings always uneasiness with: it. 
For nobody can contentedly bear being slighted. 
3. Censoriousness, and finding fault with others, 
has a direct opposition to civility. Men, whatever 
they are, or are not guilty of, would not have their 
faults displayed, and set in. open view and broad 
daylight, before their own or other people’s eyes. 
Blemishes affixed to any one always carry shame 
with them: and the discovery, or even bare.impu- 
tation of any defect, is not borne without some

entertainment of the rest of the company is at the 
cost of that one who is set out in their burlesque 
colours, Who. therefore is ‘not, without uneasiness, 
unless the subject. for which he is rallied, be really 
in itself matter of commendation. For then the 
pleasant, images and: representations, which make 
the ,aillery, carrying praise as well as sport with 
them, the rallied person also finds his account, and 
takes part in the diversion. But because the right

young people, should, carefully.abstain from rail 
lery, which, by a small mistake, or any wrong turn, 
may leave upon the mind. of those who are made 
uneasy by it, the lasting. memory of having been 
picquantly though wittily, taunted for something 
censurable in them. . 
Besides raillery, contradiction i isa ‘sort of censo- 
riousneas, wherein ill-breeding often shows itself. 
Complaisance does not require that we should.al- 
ways admit all the reasonings or relations that the 
company is entertained with, no, nor silently to let 
pass all that is vented in our hearing. The oppos- 
ing the opinions, and rectifying the mistakes of 
others, is what truth and charity sometimes requires 
of us, and civility does not oppose, if it be done 
with due caution-and ¢are of circumstances. But 
there are some people that one may observe, pos- 
sessed as it were, with the spirit of contradiction, 
that steadily, and without regard to right or wrong, 
oppose some one, or perhaps, every one of the com- 
pany, whatever they say. ‘This is. so visible and 
outrageous a way of censuring, that nobody can 
avoid thinking himself injured by it. All oppo- 
sition to what another : man has said, is sa apt. to be 
suspected of cengoriousness, and is so seldom 
received without some sort of humiliation, () that 
    
in all cases 9 dangerous one-sa dangerous, indeed, that he who 
best can wield it, might perhaps, find, did he diligently consi- 
der, that he never in any instance feived real advantage from 
the possession of it...

in M, Piso, 9 man of tare abilities who, probably through some

softest words that can be found, ‘and such as with the

contradict. All marks of respect and good-will 
dught ‘to accompany it, that whilst we gain the 
argument, we may not lose the esteem of those that 
“hear us. © 
4. Captiousness is another fault opposite to 
civility; not only because-it often produces misbe- 
coming and provoking expressions, and carriage ; 
but because it is-a tacit accusation and reproach of 
some incivility taken notice of in those whom we 
areangry with. Such a suspicion or intimation can- 
‘not be borne by any one without uneasiness. Besides, 
one. angry body discomposes the whole company, 
and the harmony ceases upon any such jarring. 
The happiness that all men so steadily pursue, 
consisting in‘ pleasure, it is easy to see why the 
civil are more acceptable than the useful. (°) The 
defect in his education, was through life incapable of tolerating 
. the absurdities of mankind, and thus marred the prospects his 
eloquence and knowledge promised in his early youth to open. 
out before him. His impatience may have partly arisen, how- 
ever, from ‘the infirm state of his health. “Is laborem, quasi 
cutsum, forensem diutias non tolit, quéd et corpore erat infirmo, 
et hominum ‘ineptias ac stultitias, que devorand@ nobis sunt, non 
ferebat, iracundiésque respuebat, sive morosé, ut putabatur, sive 
ingenuo, liberoque fastidio. Is quum satis floruisset adolescens, 
minor haberi est.ceptus postea.” ‘Those who would succeed, as 
men of the world, must no doubt devour much folly and stupi- 
dity; and, what ‘is much worse, appear to be amused by it. 
Censorious and sarcastic men, though ever so able, make more 
enemies than admirers.

ability, sincerity, and: good: intention of a man of 
weight and worth, or a real’ friend, seldom atones 
for the uneasiness that'is.produced by his grave and 
solid representations. Power and riches, nay virtue 
itself, are valued only as conducing to our happi- 
ness. And therefore he recommends himself ill to 
another, as aiming at his happiness, who, in the 
services he does him, makes him uneasy in. the man- 
ner of doing them. He that knows how to make 
those he converses with easy, without debasing 
himself to low and servile flattery, has found the 
true art of living in the world, and being both wel- 
come and valued everywhere. Civility therefore 
is what, in the first place, should with great care be 
made habitual to children and young people. 
144. There is another fault in good manners, 
and that is excess of ceremony, and an obstinate 
persisting to force upon’ another what is not his 
due, and what he cannot take without folly or 
shame. This seems rather a design to expose 
than oblige: or at least looks like a contest for 
mastery, and at best.is but troublesome, and so can 
be no part of good-breeding,-which has no other 
use or end, but to make people easy and satisfied 
in their conversation with us. This is a fault 
  
riors. For, when occasion serves, they will unhesitatingly descend. 
tothe most servile flattery ; seldom speaking disagreeable truths, 
unless to the poor and unfortunate. ‘That praise however is always 
suspicious which is repaid with a dinner ; though the rich Amphy- 
trion is nevertheless easily satisfied with what flatters his vanity :

few,young: people are apt to fall into: but yet, 
if, they are, ever guilty of it, orare suspected to 
ingline, that’ way; they should be told of it, and 
warned. of this, mistaken civility,, The thing 
they..should endeavour. and aim. at, in conversa- 
tion, should be to show respect, esteem, and good-— 
will, by paying to every one that common cere- 
mony. and regard. which is in civility due to them. 
To do this, without a suspicion of flattery, dissimu- 
lation, or meanness, is a great skill, which good 
sense, reason, and good company, can only teach; 
but. is of so much. use in. civi] life, that it is well 
worth the studying. 
145. Thoughthe managing ourselves well in 
this part of our behaviour has the name of good- 
breeding, as if peculiarly the effect of education; 
yet, as I haye said, young children should not be 
much perplexed about: it ;.I mean, about putting off 
their hats, and: making legs modishly. Teach them 
humility, and. to be. good-natured, if you can, and 
this sort of manners will not be wanting; civility 
being, in truth, nothing but a care not to show any 
slighting, or contempt of any one in conversation. 
What are'the most allowed and esteemed ways of 
expressing this, we have above observed. It is as 
peculiar and different, in severa] countries of the 
world, as their languages; and therefore, if it be 
rightly considered, rules and discourses made to 
children ‘about it, are as useless and impertinent as 
it would be now’ and then to give.a rule or two of 
the Spanish tongue, to one that converses only with 
Englishmen, Beg as busy as you please with dis-

courses of civility to yourson;'such as is his com: 
pany, such will be his manners. A ploughman of 
your neighbourhood, that: has never been out of 
his parish, read what lectures you please to him, 
will be as soon in his Janguage as’ his carriage, a 
courtier; that is, in neither will be more ‘polite 
than those he uses to cofvetse with:.and theére- 
fore of this no other care'can be taken, till he be:of 
an age to have a tutor put.to him, who-must lot 
fail to be a well-bred man. And, in good earnest; 
if I were to speak my mind freely, so children do 
nothing out of obstinacy, pride, and ill-nature, it is 
no great matter how they put off their hats, or 
make legs. If you can teach ‘them to l6ve and 
respect other people, they will, as their age requires 
it, find ways to express it acceptably to every one, 
according to the fashions they have been used to : 
and as to their motions and carriage of their bodies, | 
a dancing-master, as has been said, when it is fit, 
will teach them what is most becoming. In the 
meantime, when they are young, people expect 
not that children should be ‘over-mindfal of these 
ceremonies; carelessness is allowed to that age, 
and becomes them as well as compliments do grown, 
people: or, at least, if some very nice people will 
think it a fault, I am sure it isa fault that should 
be overlooked, and left to time, a tutor, and conver- 
sation to cure. “And therefore I think it not worth.

‘Though children; when little, should not be 
muth perplexed with rules and ceremonious parts 
of -breeding, ‘yet there is a sort: of unmannerli- 
mess very apt to grow with young people, if not 
early restrained, and that is a forwardness to inter-

Jars most blamed in this point. There cannot be 
a greater. rudeness, than to interrupt another in the 
current of his discourse; for if there be not imper- 
tinent folly in answering’ a man before we know 
what-he will say, yet itis a plain declaration, that 
_We are. weary to hear him talk any longer, (7”) and 
‘have a disesteem of what he says; which we judg-

_ have every disposition to profit by his remarks; but, if it is ex- 
pected of us to reply to what he says, we may very rationally de- 
sire him to break off, for a'moment, to allow of our asking an 
explanation, or expreasing our dissent from something he ad- 
vances, which the shortness of our memory, or the unreasonable 
Tength of his harangue, might render it difficult for us to retain 
till he thal have done speaking. None, in fact, but a sophist, 
would require those with whom he converses to listen in silence

ing not fit to entertain the company, desire them 
to give audience to us, who have something to pro- 
duce worth their attention. This. shows a very 
great disrespect, and cannot. but be offensive: and 
yet, this is what almost. all interruption. constantly 
carries with it. To which, if there be added, as is 
usual, a correcting of any mistake, or a contradic- 
tion of what has been said, it is a mark of ‘yet 
greater pride and self-conceitedness, when we thus 
intrude ourselves for teachers, and take upon us, 
either to set another right in his story, or show the 
mistakes of his judgment. 
I do not say this, that I think there should be no 
difference of opinions in conversation, nor opposi- 
tion in men’s discourses: this would be to take away 
the greatest advantage of society, and the improve- 
ments which are to -be made by ingenious com- 
pany ; where the light is to be got from the oppo- 
site arguings of men of parts, showing the different 
sides of things; and their various aspects, and proba- 
bilities, would be quite lost, if every one were obliged 
to assent to, and say after the first speaker. Itis not 
the owning one’s dissent from another, that I speak 
against, but the manner of doing it. Young men 
should be taught not to be forward to interpose their 
opinions, unless asked, or when others have done 
and are silent, and then only by way of inquiry, 
not instruction. The positive asserting, and the 
magisterial air should be avoided; and when a 
general. pause of the whole company affords an 
opportunity, they may modestly put in their ques- 
tion as learners.

without noise or passion..(7°), And if it be not soin 
this civilized part of the world, we must impute it 
to a neglect in education, which has not yet re- 
formed this ancient piece of barbarity amongst 
us. Was it not, think you, an entertaining spec- 
tacle, to see two ladies of quality accidentally 
seated on the opposite sides of a room, set. round 
with company, fall into a dispute, and grow-so 
eager in it, that in the heat of the controversy, 
edging by degrees their chairs forwards, they. were 
in a little time got close up to one another in the 
middle of the room; where they for a good while 
managed the dispute as fiercely as two game-cocks 
in the pit, without minding or taking: any notice 
of the circle, which, could not all the while forbear 
smiling ? This I was told by a person of quality, 
who was present at the combat, and did not omit to 
reflect upon the indecencies, that warmth in dispute 
often runs people into; which since custom makes 
too frequent, education should take the more care 
  
() For ,this calmness of ‘the Indians, which, however, in 
many cases, is imaginary, several causes might be assigned, un- 
connected with education, or the superior discipline of the passions. 
First, the fewness of their ideas renders them less eager to engage 
in debate ; secondly, the same sluggishness of intellect which 
keeps them savages is favourable to coolness in- council; but, 
more than all, there is, among such people, whose excellencies 
all lie in the handling of a tomahawk or a javelin, no reputation 
¢r distinction to be gained by readiness in conversation, which is 
therefore seldom or never acquired. Elsewhere, it must be ad-

this being almost that alone, which is thought on,

ing is the furniture of his own mind, the source from which, in 
various circumstances of life, he must. derive that employment. 
for his intellect, without which no man, however virtuous, can 
be happy. If, indeed, he means to confound learning with 
Greek and Latin, as there is some reason from what follows te

more than came to their. share; they might be 
ignorant bumkins.and clowns, if they pleased. 
This so wrought upon the child, that afterwards 
he desired to be taught; would come himself to 
his mother to learn, and would not let his maid be 
quiet till she heard him his lesson. -I doubt not 
but some way like this might be taken with other 
children; and when their tempers are found, some | 
thoughts be instilled into them, that might set 
them upon desiring of learning themselves, and 
make them. seek it, as another sort of play or re- 
creation. But then, as I said before, it must never 
be imposed as a task, nor made a trouble to them. 
There may be.dice and play-things, with. the let-

playing ; and twenty other ways may ‘be found, 
suitable to their particular tempers, to make this 
kind of learning a sport to them. 
149. Thus: children may be cozened into a 
knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, with- 
out perceiving it to be any thing but a sport, and 
play themselves into that which others are whipped 
for. Children should not have any thing like 
work, or serious, laid on them ; neither their minds, 
nor bodies will bear it. It injures their healths ; 
and their being forced and tied down to their books 
in an age at enmity with all such restraint, has, I 
doubt not, been the reason, why a great many 
have hated books and learning all their lives after.

initiate children in the art of lying; or, as Cowper phrases it, 
“Tt was one of the whimsical speculations of this philosopher, 
that all fables which ascribe reason and speech to animals, should. 
be withheld from children, as being only vehicles of deception.” 
(Note to “ Pairing Time Anticipated.”) But Rousseau was 
not. always of this opinion: “Les fictions qui ont un objet 
moral,” he observes, “s’appellent apologues ou fables, et comme

utiles sous de formes sensibles et agréables, en pareil cas on ne

ne ment en aucune fagon.” —(Les Réveries du Promeneur Solitaire, 
Proménade IV. Conf iii. 76, 77, edit. de Lond. 1786.) Bdely- 
leon, in the “Wasps,” is of opinion, that men may derive con- 
siderable advantage from fables, especially when having, in their 
caps, broken doors, or thrown stones at their neighbours, it is 
requisite to negociate forgiveness. ‘ You have only to tell them 
some Indicrous Esopic or Sybaritic fable, which you may have 
learned at drinking-parties,” says he to his father, “and all will 
go well,” :

The Greek Scholiast on this passage makes a distinction between 
the Esopic and Sybaritic fables, pretending, that while the latter 
introduced animals speaking, the former employed men only as

dern commentators.—(Vide Aristoph. Bekk. iii, 613.)

Poem, supposed to have been written between the ninth and

Notes by F..J. Mone. The character of the work evidently 
well suited the taste of the European nations during the middle 
ages; for it got early into popularity, and continued to be a 
favonrite down to a very late period, though now “seldom pored 
on.” For interest, however, it is far superior to Esop; and, if 
adapted to the severer taste of the present age, by judicious cor- 
rections, I know of no book better calculated to excite a passion 
for reading in children. About the beginning of the fifteenth 
century, the modification of the story by Heinrich von Alckmar 
had obtained an European celebrity, and, in 1481, was translated 
into English by Caxton. His version reads admirably, having

and not: any pleasure.of the employment to invite 
them to learn, this sort-of useful books, amongst 
the number of silly. ones that are of all sorts, have 
yet had the fate to be neglected; and nothing that 
I know. has been considered of this kind out, of 
the ordinary road of the horn-book, primer, peal, 
Testament, and Bible. 
158. As. for the Bible, which children are 
usually employed in to exercise and improve. their 
talent in reading, I think the promiscuous reading 
of it, though by chapters as they liein order, isso. 
far from being of any advantage to children, either 
for the perfecting their reading, or principling their 
religion, that perhaps a worse could not be found. 
For what pleasure or encouragement can it’-be to 
a child to exercise himself in reading those parts of 
a book where he understands nothing ? And how 
little are the law of Moses, the Song of Solomon, 
the prophecies in the Old, and the Epistles and 
Apocalypse in the New Testament, suited to a 
child’s capacity? And though the:History of the 
Evangelists, and the Acts, have something easier, 
yet, taken all together, it is very disproportional 
to the understanding of childhood. I grant, that 
the principles of religion are to be drawn from 
thence, and in the words of the Scripture ; yet none 
should be proposed to a child, but such as are 
suited to a child’s capacity and notions. But it is 
far from this to read through the whole Bible, and 
that for reading’s sake. And what an odd jumble

of thoughts: must a child have in his head, if he 
have any.at-all, such ashe should have concerning 
religion, who in his tender age reads all the parts 
ofthe Bible indifferently as the word of God, with- 
out any other distinction. I am apt to think, that 
- this, in some men, has been the very reason why 
they never had clear and distinct thoughts 0 of it all 
their lifetime.

parts of. Scripture which may be proper to be 
put into the hands.of a child to engage: lim to

than, (°7) &c. and others, that he should be made to 
read for his instruction, as that, what you would 
have others do unto you, do you the same unto them; 
and such other easy and plain moral rules which 
being fitly chosen, might often be made use of, 
both for. reading ‘and instruction together; and so 
often read till they are thoroughly fixed in the me- 
mory; and then afterwards, as he grows ripe for 
them, may in their turns, on fit occasions, be incul- 
cated as the standing and sacred rules of his life 
and actions. But the reading of the whole Scrip-

Proportionably excite in artists the ambition to excel. Among 
the Athenians, the only people in whom good taste. appeared to 
be innate, every person of liberal education was taught the arts 
of design ; and hence, in part, their passion for whatever was 
beautiful, and the unerring judgment they displayed in discri- 
minating the merits of all attempts at imitating it. In the nu- 
merous list of instructors whom at Athens it was necessary for the 
youth to attend, the Zwypagdc, or “ drawing-master,” occupied

SHORT-HAND. 
1. Short-hand, an art,.as I. have been told, 
known’ only in England,({®) may perhaps be 
thought worth the learning, both for dispatch in 
what men write for their own memory, and con- 
cealment of what they. would not have lie open 
to every eye.. For he that has once learned any 
  
(®) In this Locke was certainly misinformed. The art of 
writing in short-hand: (onpetoypdgerv) was known both to the 
Greeks and. Romans ;_and by many writers the honour of invent- 
ing it has been attributed to Xenophon. Hanbury, however, in 
a passage of Indicrous solemnity, contends, that Pythagoras 
himself was the person who disclosed this important secret to the 
world ; and, after quoting what Cicero has left us on the subject, 
I shall introduce his remarks. “ Introductis in senatum indici- 
bus,” he says, “constitui senatores, qui omnia indicum dicta, 
inuterrogata, responsa perscriberent. At quos viros! non solim 
summé virtute et fide, cujus generis in senatu facultas maxima ; 
sed etiam quos sciebam memoria, scientid, consuetudine, et cele- 
vitate scribendi, facillimé, que dicerentur, persequi posse.” (Pro 
P, Sulla. XIV. 41, tom. v. p. 401, edit. Barb.) From this pas- 
sage Middleton concludes, that stenography was in use at Rome. 
—( Life of Cicero, i. 147.) Mr. Harding (Introduction to his Sys- 
tem of Stenography, p. 14) refers to another passage of Cicero, 
(Ad Attic. xii. 32,) in which mention is made of this useful art. 
But his reference is wrong ; for in the letter in question no allu- 
sion whatever to the subject occurs. This ingenious gentleman

sort of character, may easily vary it to his own 
private use or fancy, and with more contraction 
suited to the business he would employ it in. 
Mr. Rich’s, the best contrived of any I have seen, 
may, as I think, by one who knows and considers 
grammar well, be made much easier and shorter. 
But for the learning this compendious way of 
writing, there will be no need hastily to look out 
a master; it will be early enough when any con- 
venient opportunity offers itself, at any time after 
  
shows, however, that if Locke be mistaken in supposing the 
English to be the sole possessors of this art, they have at least 
cultivated it with superior industry; for he enumerates one 
hundred and eight writers, besides himeelf, who have treated of 
the art in our language: from 4.D. 1588 to 1828. But to return 
to Mr. Hanbury: “ Who shall refuse,” he inquires, “the honour 
of the invention to the Samian philosopher? Whoever is ac- 
quainted with the history of Pythagoras, must concede it to 
iim! He who had explored the then world of science ; to whom 
Egypt and Persia revealed their mysteries, and Greece had im- 
parted all her stores of learning ; by whom astronomy, geo- 
metry, music, and numbers, were made subservient to a cryptical 
method of promulgating his doctrines by images and symbols: 
~he, of whom, notwithstanding that it is disputed whether he 
himself ever committed his philosophical system to writing, yet of 
whom it isexpressly stated, that he was a perfect master of curio- 
logic, tropical, and symbolical modes of writing, and allowed 
the disciples at a certain stage of advancement, when his prohi- 
bition was taken off their fea 2repdevra (winged words) to take 
minutes of all his lectures (quaque accidissent scribere, inquit Au. 
Gell. lib. i. 9) év wrepoypagace, in winged writing, with se- 
cret characters under the semblance of numbers; for, that they 
might the better apprehend him, he exhibited numbers to his 
disciples in a. way similar to diagrams in geometry. He, the 
lover of wisdom, ought not to be, he must not be passed by, 
when a compendious method of recording the dictates of wisdom 
is the subject of investigation !”

162. As soon as he. can speak. English, it is 
time for him to learn some other language. This 
nobody doubts of; when French is proposed. 
And the reason is, because people are accustomed 
to the right way of teaching that language, which 
is by talking it into children in constant conver- 
sation, and not by grammatical rules. ‘The Latin 
tongue would éasily be taught the same way, if 
his tutor, being constantly with him, would talk 
nothing else to him, (°) and make him answer 
  
.. @), Montaigne, who: was: taught Latin in the way recom- 
mended by Locke, relates, in his lively manner, the history of 
his initiation in ‘that Janguage, Latin and Greek,” he ob- 
serves, “are a great and splendid ornament, which commonly, 
however, is too deatly-bought. I shall here describe a method 
by which they may be more cheaply acquired, and the experi- 
ment having been made pyon myself, whoever. pleases may try 
it, . The expedient was as follows :, while. I wag-still mute in the 
nurge’s arms, my father. placed me under the care of a German, 
a learned physician; deeply versed in Latin, and not ignorant of French, who afterwards acquired a great reputation, This man, 
who had been engaged at e very large salary, had me constantly in 
his arms. He had also two assistants, less learned indeed, but 
who spoke Latin; and never in my presence made use of any other 
language. With regard to the rest of the family, it was an in- 
violable rule, that neither my father himself, nor my mother, nor 
my valet, nor my chamber-maid, (chambriere) should ever, in my 
hearing, speak any thing but the few Latin. expressions they had

still in the same language. But. because French is: 
a living language, and to be used more in speak-. 
ing, that should be first learned, that the yet pliant 
organs of speech might be ‘aceustomed to a due 
formation of those sounds, and he get. the habit of 
pronouncing French.well, which is the harder to 
be done the longer it is * delayed.

163. “When he ean speak and read French 
well, which in this method is usually in a year or 
two, he should proceed to Latin, which it is a 
wonder parents; when. they have lad the experi- 
ment in French, should not think: ought: to be 
learned the same way, by talking and reading. 
Only care is to be taken, whilst he is learning 
these foreign languages, by speaking and reading 
  
Jeamed expressly for the: purpose of chatting with me, And 
the progress they all mgfe was remarkable: both my father and 
mother acquired a competent knowledge of the language, so that, 
when necessary, they could speak it with tolerable fluency, as did 
likewise all the domesties engaged more immediately about me. 
Tn fact, 50 far did we Latinize, that the practice by degrees ex- 
tended to the surrounding villages, where several Roman appella- 
tions of tools and artisans took root, and still prevail. For myself, 
I was six years old before I understood one word more of French, 
or of the Perigord patios, than I did of Arabic; and thus with- 
ont method, without book, grammar, or rules, without whipping 
or tears, I learned ‘as much Latin as my instructors could teach 
me.”—(Essats, |. i. ch. 25.). Montaigne wassingularly fortunate 
in his preceptors,, among whom he names Nicolas Grouchi, 
author of the “ De Comitiis Romanorum ;” Guillaume’ ‘Guerente, 
a commentator of Aristotle; Marco Antonio Mureti; and the 
celebrated Buchanan. Few princés could in any age command

prevails over every thing, has made it so much 
a part. of education, that even those children are

their precious time’ uneasily ‘in Latin, ‘who, after 
they. are once:goné from'school;'are never to have 
more ‘to do with it as long as they live. -Can there 
be any thing ‘more ridiculous,‘than that a: father 
should waste his own money, and his son’s time in 
setting him to learn the Roman language, when at 
the ‘same time he designs him’ for a trade, wherein 
he having no-use for Latin, fails not to forget that 
little which “he brought’ from school, and which it

tended for trades, but even tradesmen and farmers 
fail not to send. their children, though they have 
neither intention nor‘ability to make them scholars. 
If you ask them why they do this, they think it as. 
strange a question, as if you should ask them, why 
they go to church. _ Custom serves for reason, and 
has, to those who take it for. reason, so consecrated 
this method, that it is almost religiously observed 
by them, and they stick to it, as if their children 
had scarce an. orthodox education, unless they: 
learned Lilly’s grammar. 
165. But how necessary soever Latin be to some, 
and is thought toi be to others, to whom it is 
of no manner of: use or service ; yet the ordinary 
way of learning it in a grammar-school is that, 
which having had thoughts about, I cannot be for- 
ward to encourage. The reasons against it are so 
evident, and cogent, that they have prevailed with 
some intelligent.pérsons, to quit the ordinary road, 
not without success, though .the method made use 
of was not exactly what I imagine the easiest, and - 
in short is this ;—to trouble the child with no 
grammar at-all, but:to have Latin, as’ English has 
been, without the perplexity of rules talked into 
him; for if you will consider it, Latin. is no more 
unknown to a child,. when he comes into the 
world, than English: and yet he learns English 
without master, rule, or grammar: and so might 
he Latin too, as Tully did, if he had somebody. 
always to talk to him in this language. And when 
we so often see a French woman teach an English 
girl to speak and read French perfectly in a year or

two, without any: rule of grammar, or any thing 
else but prattling to her, I cannot but wonder, how 
gentlemen ‘have. overseen this way for their sons, 
and thought, them more dull or ineapable than their 
daughters. 
166. If therefore a a man could be got, who, bim- 
self speaking good Latin, would always be about 
your son, talk constantly to: him, and suffer him 
to speak or read nothing else, this would be the 
true and genuine. way, and that which I. would 
propose, not only as the easiest and best, wherein 
a.child might, without pains or chiding, get a lan- 
_ guage, which others.are wont to be whipt for at 
school six or'seven, years together: but, algo as that 
wherein at the same time he might have his mind 
and manners: formed, and he be instructed to 
boot. in several; sciences, such as.a.good part of 
geography, astronomy;: chronology, anatomy, be- 
sides: same parts!of history, and all other parts of 
knowledge’ of things, that fall under the senses; and 
require little more:than memory.» For there, if we 
would take’ the true way, our knowledge. should 
begin, and in: those things be laid the-founda- 
tion’ ;: anid not in the abstract notions of logic and 
metaphysics, which are. fitter to amuse, than inform 
the understanding, in its first setting out towards 
knowledge. When young men have had their 
heads:employed a while in those abstract specula- 
tions without finding the success and improvement, 
or that use of them, which they expected, they are 
. apt.to have mean thoughts, either of learning, ot 
themselves; they are. tempted to quit their studies,
-P-A-G-E-320
LATIN: 25r- 
and throw away their books, as containing nothing 
but hard words, and empty sounds; or else to con- 
clade, that if there be.any real knowledge in them, 
they themselves have not understandings capable of 
it. That this is so, perhaps I could assure you 
upon my own experience. Amongst other things 
to be learned by a young gentleman in this method, 
whilst others of his age are wholly taken up with 
Latin and languages, I may also set down geometry 
for one’; having known a young gentleman, bred 
something after this way, able to demonstrate 
several Propositions in Euclid, before he was 
thirteen. 
167. But if such a man cannot be got, who 
speaks good Latin, and being able to instruct your 
son in all these parts of knowledge, will undertake 
it by this method; the next best is to have him. 
taught as‘near this way as may be, whichis by 
taking some easy and pleasant book, such as Ausop’s 
fables, and writing the English translation (made as 
literal as it can be) in one line, and the Latin words 
which answer each of them, just overitin another.() 
These let him read every day over and dyer again, 
till he perfectly understands the Latin; and then 
  (*) This plan has been pursued with considerable porsever- 
ance, but apparently, with little success, in our own days; and, 
if I may judge by the ominous silence of its advocates, the 
“Tnterlineary System,” seems to be at length abandoned. I 
have seen it, I think, fairly tried, but never know any benefit to 
be derived from it. Good or bad, however, it is a very old in- 
vention, and appears to be due to the monks, who probably thus 
sought, in the darker ages, to abridge the very scanty laboure’ they imposed upon themselves. Lipsius, in the introductory

goon to another fable, till he be also perfect in 
that) not omitting what he is already perfect in, but 
sometimes reviewing that, to keep it in his memory. 
And when he comes to write, let these be set him 
for ‘copies, which with the exercise of his hand, 
will also advance him in Latin. This being a 
more imperfect way’ than: by talking Latin unto 
him; ‘the formation of ‘the. verbs first, and after- 
wards the declensions of the nouns and pronouns 
perfectly learned ‘by heart,. may facilitate his ac- 
quaintance with the genius and manner of the Latin 
tongue, which varies the signification of verbs and 
nouns, not as the modern languages do by particles 
prefixed, but by changing the last syllables. More 
than this of grammar, I think he need not have 
till he can read himself Sanetii Minerva, with 
Scioppius and Perizonius’s notes. 
Tn teaching of children this too, I think, is to be 
observed,-that in most cases, where they stick, they 
are not to be farther puzzled, by putting them upon 
finding it out themselves; as by asking such ques- 
tions as these, (viz.) which is the nominative case ? 
in: the sentence they are to construe; or demand- 
ing, what aufero signifies, to lead them to the 
  
dielogne to “his .* Art. of ‘Besieging Cities,” observes to some

knowledge of what abstulere signifies, &c. when 
they cannot readily tell. This wastes time only in 
disturbing them for whilst they are learning, and 
apply themselves with attention, they are to be 
kept in good humour, and every thing made easy to 
them, and as pleasant as. possible. Therefore 
wherever they. are at a stand, and are willing: to 
go forwards, help them presently over the difficulty, 
without any rebuke or chiding ; remembering that 
where harsher ways are taken, they are. the. effect 
only of pride and peevishness in the teacher, who 
expects children should instantly be master of as 
much as he knows; whereas he should rather con- 
sider, that his business is to settle in them habits, 
not angrily to.inculcate rules, which serve. for 
little in the conduct of our lives: at least are of no 
use to children, who forget them as soon as given. 
In sciences where their reason is to be exercised, I 
will not deny, but this method may sometimes be 
varied, and difficulties proposed on purpose to ex- 
cite industry, and accustom the mind to employ its 
own strength and sagacity.in reasoning. But yet 
I guess this is not to be done to children, whilst 
very young, nor at their entrance upon any sort of 
knowledge :.then every thing of itself is difficult, 
and the great use and skill of a teacher is to make 
all as easy as he can: but particularly in learning 
of languages there is least occasion for posing of 
children. For languages being to be learned by 
rote, custom, and.memory, are then spoken in 
greatest. perfection, when all rules of grammar are 
utterly forgotten. I grant the grammar of a lan-

guage .isisometimes very carefully to be studied, 
but only'to be studied bya grown man, when 
he‘epplies himself to the understanding of any lan- 
guage vritically, which is seldom the business of 
any but professed scholars. This I think will be 
agreed to, that if a gentleman +be to study any lan- 
guage, it ought.to:be that of his own country, that 
he may understand. the language, which he has 
constant use of, with the utmost accuracy. 
There is yet a further. reason, why. masters and 
teachers should raise no difficulties to their scholars; 
but-on the contrary, should smooth their way, and 
readily help them forwards, where they find them 
stop.’ . Children’s minds are narrow and weak, and 
usually susceptible but of one: thought at once. 
Whatever is in a child's head, fills it. for'the time, 
especially if set on with any passion. It should 
therefore be the skill-and art of the teacher, to clear 
their heads of all other thoughts, whilst they are 
learning of any thing, the better to make room for 
-what -he would instil ‘into them, that it may be 
received with attention and application, without 
which. it leaves no impression. The natural tem- 
per of children disposes their minds to wander. 
Novélty alone takes them ; whatever that presents, 
they are presently eager to have a taste of, and are 
as sooh satisfied: with it. They quickly grow 
weary of the same thing, and so have almost their 
whole delight in change and variety. It is a contra- 
diction to: the natural state of childhood for them 
to fix their fleeting thoughts...Whether this be 
owing to the temper of their brains, or the quick-
-P-A-G-E-324
LATIN, 255 
ness.or instability of their animal spirits, over which 
the mind -has not yet-got a:full command; this is 
visible, that it isa pain to children to keep their 
thoughts steady to any thing. A lasting continued 
attention is one of the bardest tasks can be imposed 
on them ; and therefore, he that requires their ap- 
plication, should endeavour to make what he pro- 
poses as. grateful and agreeable as possible ; at least, 
he ought totake care not to join any displeasing 
or frightful idea with it. If they come not to their 
books with some kindof liking and relish, it is no 
wonder their thoughts should be perpetually shift- 
ing from what disgusts them; and seek better en- 
tertainment in more pleasing objects, after which 
they will unavoidably be gadding. 
It is, I know, the usual method of tutors, to en- 
deavour to procure attention in their. schola: 
to fix their minds'to the business in hand, 
bukes ond corrections, if they find them e 
little wandering. - But such treatment is s

disturbed with. any passion, especially fear, which 
makes the strongest impression on their-yet tender 
and weak spirits. Keep the mind in an easy calm

(*) Here, Locke appears fully sensible of how important it is 
to be able, when occasion: requires, to arrange and express with 
facility and dignity the ideas we possess, and would engraft upon 
the minds of others. . How this may best be done he does not ap- 
pear to haye always perceived with equal clearness; for, in the 
“Essay on the Human Understanding,” (book ifi. ch. 10,) he 
treats figdrative expressions as an abuse of language, though un- 
doubtedly nothing enables a man so completely to transfer truth 
from his owh mind: to another’s as metaphorical composition. 
But, whoever observes what he reads must smile at the philoso- 
pher’s declamation against tropes and figures, when in the very 
threshold of the next chapter he finds him enveloped in meta- 
phors, “Language being the great conduit, wheteby men con- 
vey thelr discoveries, reasonings, and knowledge from one to 
another ; he that-makes an ill use of it, though he- does not cor- 
tupt the fountains of knowledge; which are in things themselves; 
yet he does, as much es’ in- him lies, break or stop. the pipes, 
whereby it is distributed to the public use and advantage of man- 
kind.” : What, in-thé same chapter, he‘says-on the choice of 
words, deserves-to. be:itreasured up in every toan’s..memory': 
“Propriety of ‘speech is that which gives ‘our thoughis entrance 
into other men’s minds: with the greatest ease and: advantege.”” .

guage: ‘he uses, that he may understand his own 
itry speech nicely, and speak it properly, with- 
dat ‘shocking’ the ears of those it is addressed to, 
_ with solecisms and offensive ‘irregularities. . And to 
this purpose grammar is necessary; but it is the 
grammar only of their own proper tongues, and to 
those ‘only who would take pains in cultivating 
their language, and ‘in perfecting’ their’ styles. 
‘Whether all gentlemen’ should not do this, I leave 
to be’ considered, since the want of propriety and 
grammatical ‘exactness, is thought very misbe- 
coming one of that rank, and usually draws on one 
guilty of such faults, the censure of having had a

worthy their care and cultivating, though they have 
daily use of it, and are not seldom, in the future 
course of their lives, judged of by their handsome 
or awkward way of expressing themselves in it. 
Whereas the languages, whose grammars they 
have been so much employed in, are such ag pro- 
bably they shall scarce ever speak or write; or if, 
upon occasion, this should happen, they shall be 
excused for the mistakes and faults they make in it. 
Would not, a Chinese, who took notice of this 
way of breeding, be apt 1o imagine that all our 
young gentlemen were designed to be teachers 
and professors of the dead languages of foreign 
countries, and not to be men. of business in their 
own? 
3. There is a third sort of men, who apply 
themselves to two or three foreign, dead, and 
(which amongst us are called the) learned lan- 
guages, make them their study, and pique them- 
selves upon, their skill in them. No doubt, those 
who propose to themselves the learning of any 
language with this view, and would be critically 
exact in it, ought carefully to study the.grammar 
of it. I would not be mistaken here, as if this 
were to undervalue Greek and Latin. I grant 
these are languages of great use and excellency, 
and a man can have'no place amongst the learned 
in this part of the world, who is a stranger to them.. 
But the knowledge a gentleman would ordinarily 
draw for his. use. out of the Roman and Greek

part of the enquiry, viz. 
‘When Grammar should be taught? 
- To whieh, upon ‘the premised grounds, the an- 
swer is obvious, viz. : 
- Fhat if grammar ought to’ be taught at any 
time, it must be to one that can speak the language 
already ;(*) how else can he be taught the grammar 
of it? ‘This at least is‘evident from the practice of 
the’ wise‘and learned:ziations amongst the ancients. 
They mide it a part of ‘education to cultivate their 
own,’ not: foreign tongues, The Greeks counted 
all other riations barbarous, and had ‘a contempt for 
their languiges. And though the Greek learning 
grew in ‘credit amcngst the Romans; towards the

tongue that.was inade*the study of their. youth;

their own language they were to.make use. of, 
aud: therefore it. was: their own language they were: 
instructed-and exercised in. 
But, more particularly to determine the proper 
season for. grammar, I,.do not. see. how. it can rea- 
sonably be made. any one’s study, hut.as an intro- 
duction to rhetoric; when it is thought:time to put 
any one upon the care of, polishing his tongue, and 
of speaking better than the illiterate, then is the 
time for him. to be instructed in the rules of. gram- 
mar, and not before. For grammar being to teach 
men not to speak, but to speak correctly, and ac- 
cording to the. exact rules of the tongue, which is 
one part of elegancy, there is little use of the one 
to him that. has no need of the other: where rhe- 
torie is not: necessary, grammar may-be spared. I 
know not. why: any. one should waste his time, and 
beat his head about, the Latin grammar, who does 
not intend to be a. critic, or make speeches and 
write dispatcbes in it. When any one finds in 
himself. a necessity or disposition to study any 
foreign language to the bottom, and to. be ,nicely 
exaet, in-the knowledge of it, it will hetime.enough 
to take a grammatical survey of it, If his use of it 
be only to understand some books writ in it, with- 
out a critical knowledge of the tongue itself, read- 
ing alone, as I have said, will attain this end, 
without charging the mind with the multiplied 
rales and intricacies of grammar.

171, But to’ tell: you ‘a little more fully why 
I would not have: him exercised in making of 
themes and verses... 1- As to themes, they have, 
I confess, the pretence df something useful, which 
is to teach people to speak handsomely and well 
on any subject; which, if it could be attained this 
way, I own, would be a great advantage, there’ be- 
ing nothing more becoming a gentleman nor more 
useful in all the occurrences of life, than to be 
able, on any occasion, to speak well, and to the pur-

as is usual in schools, helps not. one jot toward it: 
for do but consider: what it is, in making a theme, 
that a young lad is employed about; it'is to make 
aspeech on some Latin saying;.as Omnia vincit

here the poor lad, who. wants: knowledge of those 
things he is to speak of, which is to be had only 
from time and observation, must set his invention

everywhere: a language which your son, it is a

unless it can be supposed, that the making of set 
Latin'speeches should be the way to teach men to 
speak well in English extempote. The way to 
that, I should think ‘rather to be this: that there 
should be proposed to young gentlemen, rational 
and useful questions, suited to their age and capa- 
cities, and on subjects not wholly unknown to 
them, nor out of their way: such as these, when 
they are ripe for exercises of this natute, they 
should extempore, or after a little meditation upon 
the spot,(®) speak to, without penning of any 
thing: for I ask, if we will examine the effects of 
this way of learning to speak well, who speak best 
inany business, when occasion ‘calls them to it 
upon any debate, either those who have accustomed 
themselves to compose and write down before- 
hand, what they would say; or those, who think- 
ing only of the matter, to understand that as well 
  
() Even this practice, if not very carefully watched over, is 
liable to become the parent of innumerable absurdities. Much 
would of course depend on the: good sense of those who should 
select the questions ; but, whatever care may be taken, the ten- 
dency, in such cases, generally is towards that class of questions 
glanced at by Petronius, who introduces Encolpius, observing :-— 
“ Ego adolescentulos existimo in scholis’ stultissimos fieri, quia 
nihil ex iis, que in usu habemus, aut audiunt, aut vident; sed 
piratas cum catenis in litore stantes, et tyrannos edicta scribentes, 
quibus imperent filiis, ut patrum suorum capita praecidant, sed 
responsa in pestilentia data, ut'virgines tres aut pluresimmolentur,” 
&c.—(Satyricon, &c. p. 47, 48, edit. G. Erhard,'1610.) Some 
attention should also be paid to action, the want of which converts 
our senators into so many posture-makers, and renders a visit to 
the House of Commons like-going: to a fair, to'see mountebanks

173. But_ perhaps: we shall be told, it is to 
improve and perfect them in the Latin tongue. It 
is true, that is their proper basiness at school ; but 
the making of themes is not: the way to it: that 
perplexes their. brains about invention of things to 
be said, not, about, the signification of words to be 
learned.; and when they are-making.a theme, it is 
thoughts they: search and. sweat for, not language. 
But the learning and mastery of.a tongue being un- 
easy and unpleasant enough in itself, should not be 
cumbered with any other difficulties, as is done in 
this way of -proceeding. . In fine, if boy's inven- 
tions be to’be quickened by such exercise, let them 
make themes.in English, where they have facility 
and.a command of words, and will better see what 
kind of thoughts they have, when put into their 
own language. And if the Latin tongue be to be 
learned, let it be doné the easiest way, without toil-

True poets are too rare, and too high objects of veneration, for 
their advent to be viewed with indifference in any state or rank 
of society. Even among the Arabs of the desert the appearance 
of a poet in a family is looked upon as a public blessing, and 
those to whom he belongs being by their neighbours accounted. 
happy, congratulations and presents are sent them from the sun 
rounding tribes, as if a second sun had shone forth upon the 
world. And in civilized nations, though a different mode of ex- 
hibiting their joy is taken, all men of elevated and refined cha- 
Yacters, experience peculiar delight in witnessing, in such writers 
as Milton or Shakespeare, the developement of the creative faculty.

expressing his gratitude to Simonides, the reputed inventor of

from thence one is to reckon, if one would know 
how long the mind retains it. But the learning 
pages of Latin by heart, no more fits the memory 
for retention of any thing else, than the graving of 
one sentence in lead makes it the more capable of 
retaining firmly any other characters. If such a 
sort of exercise of the memory were able to give 
it strength, and improve our parts, players of all 
other people must needs have the best memories, 
and be the best company. But whether the scraps 
they have got into their heads this way, make them 
remember other things the better; and whether 
their parts be improved proportionably to the pains 
they have taken in getting by heart other sayings, 
experience will show. Memory is so necessary to 
all parts and conditions of life, and so little is to be 
done without it, that we are not to fear it should 
grow dull and useless for want of exercise, if exer- 
cise would make it grow stronger. But I fear this 
faculty of the mind is not capable of much help

Pretence in grammar schools. And if Xerxes was 
ableto:call every common soldier by his name in his

thousand men, I think it may be guessed, he got 
not this wonderful ability by learning his lessons by 
heart when he was a boy. This method of exer- 
cising and improving the memory. by toilsome re- 
petitions. without book, of what they read, is, I 
think, little used in the education of princes, which 
if it had that advantage is talked of, should be as 
little neglected in them as in the meanest school- 
boys : princes ‘having as much need of good me- 
mories as any men living, and have generally an 
equal share in this faculty with other men ; though

not for, will, I guess, scarce find the profit answer

learning by rote whole. pages out of books, which, 
the lesson being once said, and that task over, are 
delivered up again to oblivion, and neglected for 
ever. This mends, neither the memory nor the 
mind, What they should learn by heart out of 
authors, I have above mentioned : and such wise 
and useful sentences being once given in charge to 
their memories, they should never be suffered to 
forget again, but be often called to account for 
them ; whereby, besides the use those sayings may 
be to them in their future life, as so many good 
rules and observations, they will be taught to reflect 
often, and bethink themselves what they have to 
remember, which is the only way to make the me- 
mory quick. and useful. The custom of frequent 
reflection will keep. their minds from running 
adrift, and call their thoughts home from useless 
unattentive roving: and therefore, I think, it may © 
do well to give them something every day to re- 
member, but something still, that is in itself worth 
the remembering, and what you would never have 
out of mind, whenever you call, or they themselves 
search for it. This will oblige them often to turn 
their thoughts inwards, than which you cannot 
wish them a better intellectual habit.

to. form the:mind of this scholars, and give that a 
right disposition; which, if once got, though all 
the rest should be neglected, would, in due time, 
produce all the rest: and which, if it be not got, 
and settled, so.as to keep out ill and vicious habits, 
“languages and sciences, and all the other accom- 
plishments of education, will be to no purpose, but 
to make the worse, or more dangerous man. And 
indeed whatever stir there is made about getting of 
Latin, asthe great and difficult business, his mother 
may teach it him herself, if she will but spend two 
or three hours ina day with him, and make him 
read the Evangelists in Latin to her: for she need 
but buy a Latin Testament, and having got some- 
body to niark the last syllable but one where it is 
long, in words above two syllables, (which is enough 
to regulate her pronunciation, and accenting the 
words,) read daily in the gospels, and then let her 
avoid understanding them in Latin if she ean. And 
when she understands ‘the Evangelists in Latin, 
let her, in the same manner read Aisop’s fables, and 
so proceed on to Eutropius, Justin, and other such 
books, Ido not mention this as an imagination of 
what I fancy may do, but as of a thing T have known 
done, and the. Latin tongue with ease got this 
way. 
But to return to what I was saying: he that 
takes upon him the charge of bringing up young 
men, especially young gentlemen, should have 
something more in him than Latin, more than even 
a knowledge of the liberal sciences: he should be 
a person of eminent virtue and prudence, and with

good sense, have’ good humour, and the skill to 
carry himself with gravity, ease, and kindness in a 
constant conversation with his pupils. But of this 
T have spoken at large in another place. 
178, At the same time that he is learning 
French and Latin, a child, as has been said, may 
also be entered in arithmetic, geography, chrono- 
logy, history and geometry too. For if these be 
taught him in French or Latin, when he begins 
onee to understand either of these tongues, he will 
get a knowledge in these sciences, and the lan- 
guage to boot. 
GEOGRAPHY. 
Geography, I think, should be begun with: 
for the learning of the figure of the globe, the 
situation and boundaries of the four parts of the 
world, and that of particular kingdoms and coun- 
tries, being only an exercise of the eyes and me- 
mory,a child with pleasure will learn and retain 
them. And this is so certain, that I now live 
in the house with a child, whom his mother has 
so well instructed this way in geography, that 
he knew the limits of the four parts of the world, 
could readily point, being asked, to any country 
upon the globe, or any county in the map of 
England ; knew all the great rivers, promontories, 
straits, and bays in the world, and could find the 
longitude-and latitude of any place, before he was | 
six years old. ('“) These things, that he will thus

to it; and will make the remainder much easier, 
shen, his judgment has grown ripe enough for it; 
besides that, it gets so much.time now ; and by the 
pleasure of knowing things, leads him on insensi- 
bly to the gaining of languages. 
ARITHMETIC.—ASTRONOMY. 
179. When he has the natural parts of the globe 
well fixed in his memory, it may then be time to 
begin arithmetic. By the natural parts of the 
globe, I mean several positions of the parts of the 
earth and sea, ‘under different names and distinct- 
tions of countries, not coming yet to those artificial 
and imaginary lines, which have been invented, 
and are only, ‘supposed for the better improvement 
of that science. 
180, Arithmetic is the easiest, and consequently 
the first sort of abstract reasoning, which the mind 
commonly bears, or. accustoms itself to: and is of 
so general use in all parts of life and business, that 
“ gearce any thing is to be done without it. This is 
certain, a man carinot_haye too much of it, nor too 
perfectly: he should therefore begin to be exer- 
- cised in counting, as soon, and as far, as heis capa- 
ble of it ; and do something in it every day, till he 
is master of the art of numbers. When be under- 
stands addition and subtraction, he may then be 
advanced farther in geography; after he is ac-

quainted with the poles, zones, parallel circles, and 
meridians, be taught longitude and Jatitude, and 
by them be made'to understand the use of maps, 
and by the numbers placed on their sides, to know 
the respective situation of countries, and how to 
find them. out on the. terrestrial globe, Which 
when he can readily do, be may ‘then be 
entered in the celestial; and there going over ‘all 
the circles again, with a more particular observa- 
tion of the ecliptic, or zodiac, to fix them.all very 
clearly and distinctly in his mind, he may be 
taught the figure and position of the several con- 
stellations, which may be showed him first upon the 
globe, and then in the Heavens. 
When that is done, and he knows pretty well 
the constellations of this our hemisphere, it may be 
time to give him some notions of this our planetary 
world ; and to that purpose, it may not be amiss to 
make him a draught of the Copernican system, and 
therein explain to him the situation of the planets, 
their respective distances from the sun, the centre 
of their revolutions. This will prepare him. to 
understand the motion and theory of the planets, 
the most easy and natural way. For since astro- 
mers no longer doubt of the motion of the planets 
about the sun, it.is fit he should proceed‘upon that 
hypothesis, which- is not only the simplest and 
least perplexed for a learner, but also the likeliest 
to be true in itself. ‘But in this, as in all other 
parts of instruction, great care must be taken with 
children, to begin with that’ which is plain and 
simple, and to teach them as little as can be at

you proceed’ to the next, or any thing new in that 
.science,.-Give them first one simple idea, and see 
that they.take it right, and perfectly comprehend 
it before you go any farther, and then add some 
other simple idea which lies next in your way to 
what you aim at, and so proceeding by gentle and 
insensible steps, children, without confasion and 
amazement, will have their understandings opened, 
and their thoughts extended farther than could 
have been expected... And when any one has 
learned any thing himself, there is no such way to 
fix it in his memory, and to encourage him to go 
on, as to set him to teach it others. 
GEOMETRY. 
181..When he has once got such an acquaint- 
ance with the globes, as is above mentioned, he 
may be fit to be tried a little in geometry ; wherein 
I think the’ six first books of Euclid enough for 
him to be taught. For I am in some doubt, whe- 
ther more to a man of business be necessary or 
useful. At least, if he have a genius and inclina- 
tion to it, being entered so far by his tutor, he will be 
able to go on of himself without a teacher. 
The globes therefore must be studied, and that 
diligently ; and I think may be begun betimes, if 
the tutor will but be careful to distinguish what 
the child is capable of knowing, and what not ; for 
which this may be a rule that perhaps will go 3 
pretty. way, viz. that children may be taught any 
thing that falls under their senses, especially theit

much at: once, nor to. set. him upon a new part, 
till that, which he is upon, be perfectly learned 
and fixed in his memory. 
CHRONOLOGY. 
182, With geography, chronology ought to. go 
hand in hand. I mean the general part of it, so 
that he may have in his mind a view of the whole 
current of time, and the several considerable epochs 
that are made use of. in history. Without these 
two, history, which is the great mistress of pru- 
dence and civil knowledge; (*) and ought to be the 
proper study of a gentleman, or man of business in 
the world, without geography and chronology, I say, 
history will be very ill retained, and very little use- 
fal; but be only a jumble of matters of fact, con- 
fusedly heaped together without order or instruc- 
tion. It is by these two, that the actions of man- 
kind are ranked into their proper places of times 
and countries, under which circumstances, they are 
not only much easier kept in the memory, but in that

ence he should be perfect in, Ido not mean the 
little controversies that are in it. These are end- 
Jess,.and most of them of so little importance to a 
gentleman, as not to deserve to be enquired into, 
were they capable of any easy decision. And there- 
fore all that learned noise and dust of the chrono- 
logist is wholly to. be avoided. The most useful 
book I have seen in that part of learning, is a 
small treatise of Strauchius, (°°) which is printed 
in twelves, under the title of Breviarium Chrono- 
Jogicum, out of which may be selected all that is 
necessary to be taught a young gentleman concern- 
ing chronology; for all that is in that treatise a 
learner need not be cumbered with. He has in him 
the most remarkable or useful epochs reduced all 
to that of the Julian period, which is the easiest, 
plainest, and surest method, that can be made 
use of in chronology. To this treatise of Strau- 
chius, Helvicus’s tables may be added, as a book 
to be turned to on all occasions. 
  
('%) Strauchius’s work has now sunk into obscurity ; nor has 
any other system of chronology been very long lived, or afforded 
much satisfaction to any but their inventors. I mean in re 
ference to remote ages. Gagnet, however, in his “ Origine des 
Loix,” has some useful details; and for Grecian History, subse- 
quent to the Fifty-fifth Olympiad, I may venture to recommend 
the “ Fasti Hellenici” of Mr. Fyne’s Clinton.

it to the study of grown men, the latter makes 
me think it the fittest for a. young lad, who as soon 
as he is instructed in chronology, and acquainted 
with the several epochs in use in this part of 
the world, and can reduce them to the Julian period; 
shonld then have some Latin history put’ into. his 
hand. The choice should be directed by the easi- 
ness of the style; for wherever he begins, chrono+ 
logy will keep it from confusion ; and the pleasant- 
ness of the subject inviting him to read, the lan- 
guage will insensibly be got, without that terrible 
vexation and uneasiness, which children suffer, 
where they are put into books beyond their. capa- 
tity; such as are the Roman orators and poets, only 
to learn the Roman language. When he has by 
reading mastered the easier, such perhaps as Jus- 
tin, Kutropius, Quintus Curtius, &c. the next de- 
gree to these, will give him no great trouble: and 
thus by a gradual progress from the plainest and 
easiest historians,('”) he may at last come to read 
the most difficult and sublime of the Latin authors, 
such as are Tully, Virgil, and Horace.

- work of far superior merit—a work in which for the first time, 
and, perhaps, for the last, the subject has been philosophically 
treated—I mean Aristotle’s Ethics. This the youth should be 
taught to regard as a great fountain of morals, whence the purest

part of the civil law, (which concerns not the chi<

gentleman should be ignorant of the law of his 
country. (') This, whatever station he is in, is so 
tequisite, that from a justice of the peace, to a 
minister of state, I know no place he can well fill 
without it. Ido not mean the chicane, or wrang- 
ling and captious part of the law: a gentleman, 
whose business is to seek the true measures of right 
and wrong, and not the arts how to avoid doing 
the one, and secure himself in doing the other, 
() Cicero constantly urges on his readers the study of the 
laws; but it was then an easy matter, compared with what it is 
Row. Nevertheless, it is desirable that a knowledge of the gpirit 
at least of our laws should be generally diffused, but much to 
be regretted that no better assistant than Blackstone exists.

for his. vealling, i is to take a view of our English con- 
stitution and government, in the ancient books of

RHETORIC—LOGIC. 
188. Rhetoric and logic being the arts, that in 
the ordinary method usually follow immediately 
after grammar, it may perhaps be wondered that I 
have said so little of them. The reason is, because 
of the little advantage young people’ receive ‘by 
them: for I have seldom or never observed any 
one to get the skill of reasoning well, or speaking 
handsomely, by studing those rules which pretend 
to teach it: and’ therefore I would have a young’ 
gentleman take a view of them in the shortest sys- 
tems that could be found, without dwelling long on 
the contemplation and study of those formalities. 
Right reasoning is founded on something else than 
the predicaments and predicables, and does not 
consist in talking in mode and figure itself. But it 
is beside my present business to enlarge upon this 
speculation. To come therefore to what we have in 
hand: if you would have your son reason well, 
let him read Chillingworth ; (""') and if you would 
have him speak well, let him be conversant in 
Tully, ("*) to give him the true idea of eloquence; 
  
('") This is a high compliment to Chillingworth, a favourite 
author with Locke, who elsewhere in his works frequently speaks 
of him, and always with ‘praise. On the subject of logic and 
thetorie I can by no means adopt the opinions expressed’ in this 
Paragraph ; he might as well contend that a man makes no pro- 
ficiency in arithmetic by learning the rules.

that where they apply themselves, I see none of

taught rhetoric, but yet never taught how to ex- 
press themselves handsomely with their tongues or

ing, were the very art and skill of speaking well. 
This, as all other things of practice, is to be learned,

exercise and application, according to good rules, 
or rather patterns, till habits are got, and a facility

Agreeable hereunto, perhaps it might not be 
amiss, to make children, as soon as they are capa-

fault they are guilty of in their way of putting it 
together. When that fault is cured, then to show 
them the next, and so on, till one after another, all, 
at least the gross ones, are mended. When they

got past the faults of grammar, and can join in

of a story, without bald and unhandsome forms of 
transition (as is usual) often repeated, he that 
desires to perfect them yet farther in this, which is 
the first step to speaking well, and needs no inven-

they may be shown how others have practised 
them. The ancient classic authors afford plenty of 
such examples, which they should be made not 
only to translate, but have set before them as -pat- 
terns for their daily imitation. 
‘When they understand how to write English 
with due connexion, propriety, and order, and are 
pretty well masters of a tolerable narrative style, 
they may be advanced to writing of letters; wherein” 
they should not be put upon any strains of wit or 
compliment, but taught to express their own plain 
easy sense, without any incoherence, confusion or 
roughness. And when they are perfect in this, they

much to do in all the occurrences of ghuman life, 
‘that no gentleman can avoid showing himself in

NATURAL. PHILOSOPHY. 
190. Natural philosophy, as a. speculative sci- 
ence, I imagine we have none, and perhaps I may 
think I have reason to say we never shall be able 
to make a science of it. The works of nature are 
contrived by a wisdom, and operate by ways too 
far surpassing our faculties to discover, or capaci- 
ties to conceive, for us ever to be able -to reduce 
them into a science. Natural philosophy being 
the knowledge of the principles, properties and 
operations of things as they are in themselves, I 
imagine there are two parts of it, one comprehend-

ing spirits, with their nature and qualities, and other, 
bodies. The first of these is usually referred to 
metaphysics’: but under what title soever the 
consideration of spirits comes, I think it ought to 
-go'before-the study of matter and body, not as a 
‘science that can be methodized into a system, and 
treated of upon principles of knowledge; but as an 
enlargment.of our minds towards a truer and fuller 
comprehension of the intellectual world, to which 
we are led. both by reason and revelation. And 
since the clearest and largest discoveries we have 
of other spirits, besides God and our own souls, is 
imparted to us from Heaven by revelation, I think 
the information, that at least young people should 
have of them, should be taken from that reve- 
lation. To this purpose, I conclude, it would be 
well, if there were made a good history of the Bible, 
for young people to read; wherein if every thing 
that is fit to be put into it, were laid down in its 
due order of time, and several things omitted 
which are suited only to riper age, that confusion 
which is usually produced by promiscuous reading 
of the Scripture, as it lies now bound =p in our 
Bibles, would be avoided. And als

tion of the most excellent and. powerful part of the

191. Of this history of the Bible, I think too it 
would be well, if there were a short and plain epi-~ 
tome made, containing the chief and most material 
heads, for children to be conversant in as soon as 
they can read.. This, though it will lead them 
early into some notion of spirits, yet it is not con- 
trary to what I said above, that I would not have 
children troubled, whilst young, with notions of 
spirits; whereby my meaning was that I think it 
inconvenient that their yet tender minds should 
receive early impressions of goblins, spectres, and 
apparitions, wherewith their maids, and those 
about them, are apt to fright them into  compli- 
ance with their orders, which often proves a great 
inconvenience to them all their lives after, by sub- 
jecting their minds to frights, fearful apprehensions, 
weakness, and superstition; which, when coming 
abroad into the world and conversation, they grow 
weary and ashamed of; it not seldom happens, 
that to make, as they think, a thorough cure, and 
ease themselves of a load which has sat so heavy 
on them, they throw away the thoughts of all 
spirits together, and so run into the other, but 
worse extreme. 
192, The reason why I would have this pre- 
mised to the study of bodies, and the doctrine 
of the Scriptures well imbibed before young men be 
entered in natural philosophy, is, because matter, 
being a thing that all our senses are constantly

300 PHILOSOPHY. 
conversant with, it is so apt to possess the mind, 
and exclude all other beings, but matter; that pre- 
judice, grounded on such principles, often leaves 
no room for the admittance of spirits, or the al- 
lowing any such thing as immaterial Beings in 
rerum naturd; when yet it is evident, that by 
mere matter and motion, none of the great phe- 
nomena of nature can be resolved, to instance 
but in that common one of gravity, which I think 
impossible to be explained by any natural operation 
of matter, or any other law of motion, but the 
positive will of a superior Being so ordering it. 
And therefore since the deluge cannot be well ex- 
plained, without admitting something out of the 
ordinary course of nature, I propose it to be consi- 
dered, whether God’s altering the centre of gravity 
in the earth for a time (a thing as intelligible as 
gravity itself, which perhaps a little variation of 
causes unknown to us would produce) will not 
more easily account for Noab’s flood than any hy- 
‘pothesis yet made use of to solve it. I hear the 
great objection to this, is, that it would produce 
but a partial deluge, But the alteration of the cen- 
tre of gravity once allowed, it is no hard matter to 
conceive that the Divine Power might make the 
centre of gravity, placed at a due distance from the 
centre of the earth, move round it in a convenient 
space of time, whereby the flood would become 
universal, and as I think, answer all the pheno- 
mena of the deluge, as delivered by Moses, at an 
easier rate than those many hard suppositions that 
are made use of to explain it. But this is nota
-P-A-G-E-370
PHILOSOPHY. 301 
place for that argument, which is here only men- 
tioned by the by, to show the necessity of having 
recourse to something’ beyond bare matter and its 
motion in the explication of nature; to which the 
notions of spirits and their power, as delivered in 
the Bible, where so much is attributed to their 
operation, may be a fit preparative, reserving to a 
fitter opportunity a fuller explication of this hypo- 
thesis, and the application of it to all the parts of 
the deluge, and any difficulties that can be sup- 
posed in the history of the flood, as recorded in 
the Scripture, 
193. But to return to the study of natural 
philosophy. Though the world be full of systems 
of it, yet I cannot say: I know any one which can 
be taught a young man as a science, wherein he 
may be sure to find truth and certainty, which is 
what all sciences give an expectation of. I do 
hence conclude, that none of them are to be read. 
It is necessary for a gentleman, in this learned age, 
to look into some of them to fit himself for conver- 
sation: but whether that of Descartes be put 
into his hands, as that which is most in fashion, or: 
it be thought fit to give him a short view of that 
and several others also, I think the systems of natu- 
tal philosophy, that have obtained in this part of the 
world, are to be read more to know the hypothesis, 
and to understand the terms and ways of talking of 
the several sects, than with hopes to gain thereby a 
comprehensive, scientifical, and satisfactory know- 
ledge of the works of nature. Only this may be 
said, that the modern Corpuscularians talk, in most
-P-A-G-E-371

things, more jntelligibly. than the Peripatetics, who 
possessed the schools immediately before them. 
He that: would look. farther back, and acquaint 
himself with the several opinions of the ancients, 
may gensult Dr. Cudworth’s Intellectual System,(**) 
wherein that very learned author hath with such 
accurateness and judgment.collected and explained 
the opinions of the Greek philosphers, that what 
principles they built on, and what were the chief 
hypotheses that divided them, is better to be seen in 
him, than anywhere else that I know. But I 
would not deter any one from the study of nature ; 
because all the knowledge we have, or possibly 
can have of it, cannot be brought into a science. 
There are very many things in it, that are con- 
venient and ‘necessary to be known to a gentleman: 
and a great many others, that will abundantly 
reward the pains of the curious with delight and 
advantage. But these, I think, are rather to be 
found amongst. such writers as have employed 
themselves in making rational experiments and 
observations, than in starting barely speculative 
systems. Such writings therefore, as many of Mr. 
Boyle’s are, with others, who have wrote of hus- 
bandry, planting, gardening, and the like, mav be

fit for a gentleman, when he hasa little acquainted 
himself with some of the: systems of the natural 
philosophy in fashion. 
194. Though the systems of physics, that I have 
met with, afford little encouragement to look for 
certainty or science in any treatise, which shall 
pretend to give us a body-of natural philosophy from 
the first principles of bodies in general, yet the.in= 
comparable Mr. Newton has shown, how far 
mathematics, applied to some parts of nature, may, 
upon principles that matter of fact justify, carry us 
in the knowledge of somie, as I may so call them, 
particular provinces of the incomprehensible uni- 
verse. And if others could give us so good and 
clear an account of other parts of nature, as he has 
of this our planetary world, and the most consider- 
able phenomena observable in it, in his admirable 
book, Philosophie naturalis Principia Mathematica, 
we might in time hope to be furnished with more 
true and certain knowledge in several parts. of this 
stupendous machine, than hitherto we could have 
expected. And though there are very few, that 
have mathematics enough to understand his demon- 
strations; yet the most accurate mathematicians, 
who have examined them, allowing them to be 
such, his hook will deserve to be read, and give no 
small light and pleasure. to those, who, willing to 
understand the motions, properties, and operations 
of the great masses of matter, in this our solar sys- 
tem, will but carefully mind his conclusions, 
which may be depended on as propositions well

concerning’ a’young gentleman’s studies; wherein 
it awit possibly be wondered that I should omit 
‘Greek, since amongst the Grecians is to be found 
the original, as it were, and foundation of all that 
learning which we have in this part of the world. 
I grant it so; and will add, that no man can pass 
for a scholar that is ignorant of the Greek tongue. 
But I am not here considering the education of a 
professed scholar, but of a gentleman, to whom 
Latin and French, as the world now goes, is by 
every one acknowledged to be necessary. When he 
comes to be a man, if he has a mind to carry 
his studies farther, and look into the Greek learn- 
ing, he will then easily get that tongue himself: 
and if he has not that inclination, his learning 
of it under a tutor-will be but lost labour, and 
nmiuch of his-time and pains spent in that, which 
‘will be neglected and thrown away as soon as he is 
at liberty. For how many are there of an hundred, 
even amongst scholars themselves, who retain the 
Greek they carried from school ; or ever improve it 
to a familiar reading, and perfect understanding of 
Greek’ authors ? (9) 
To conclude this part, which concerns a young

shared between the teachers and learners; none can fall upon

that his business is. not so- much to téach him all 
that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and 
esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right 
way of knowing and improving himself, when he 
has a mind to it. . 
The thoughts of a judicious author on the sub- 
ject of languages, I shall here give the reader, as 
near as I can, in his own way of expressing them: 
He says, (1°) One can scarce burden children too 
much with the knowledge of languages. They 
are useful to men of all conditions, and they 
equally open them the entrance, either to the most 
profound, or the more easy and entertaining parts 
of learning. If this irksome study be put off to 
a little more advanced ‘age, young men. either 
have not resolution enough to apply to it out of 
choice, or steadiness to carry it on. And if any 
one has the gift of. perseverance, it is not without 
the inconvenience. of spending that time upon 
languages, which is destined to other uses. And 
he confines to the study of words that age of his 
life that is above it, and requires things; at: least, 
it is the losing the-best and beautifulest season of 
one’s life. This large foundation of. languages 
cannot be well laid, but when every thing makes 
an easy and deep impression on the mind; when 
the memory is fresh, ready, and tenacious; when 
the head and heart are yet as free from cares, 
passions, and designs; and those on whom the

am; perstiaded, that the small number of truly 
learned;*and the multitude of superficial pre- 
tenders is owing to the neglect of this.” 
A think every body will agree with this observing 
gentleman, that languages are the proper study of 
our first years. But it is to. be considered by the 
parents and tutors, what tongues it is fit the child 
should learn. . For it must: be confessed, that it is 
fruitless pains, and loss of time to learn a language 
which; in the course of life’that he is designed to, 
he is never like'to make use of, or which one may 
guess by his temper he will wholly neglect and lose 
again, as soon as an approach to manhood, setting 
him free from a governor, shall put him into the 
hands of his own inclination, which is not likely to 
allot any of his time to the cultivating the learned 
tongues,-or dispose him to mind any other lan- 
guage, but what daily use,.or some particular 
_ Hecéssity shall force upon him. . 
‘But yet, for the sake of those who are , designed 
to be. scholars, 1 will add, what the same author 
subjoins, to make good, his foregoing remark. It 
will deserve to be considered ‘by all who desire to

* MUSIC. 
197. Music ‘is ‘thought to have some affinity 
with ‘dancing; and a good hand upon some in- 
struments, is, by many people mightily valued. 
But’ it wastes so much of a young man’s time 
to gain but a moderate skill in it; and engages 
often in such odd company, that many think it 
much better spdred: and I have, amongst men of 
parts and buginess,'so seldom heard any one com- 
mended or esteemed for having an -excellency 
in music, that amongst all those things, that ever 
came into the list of accomplishments, I think I 
may give it the last place.("*) Our short lives will 
  
Gs) Yet asa solace, and solitary enjoyment, music has great 
value. It soothes, and. by soothing, appears to strengthen the 
aind; but to those whom nature has not gifted with that delicate 
sensibility which renders men susceptible of the charms of musit, 
it must necessarily appear a trivial object of study. Among the 
Greeks, a people of matchless physical organization, the love of 
music seems always to have accompanied a passion for literature. 
Their system of education, which excluded the study of foreign
-P-A-G-E-380

not serve us for-the attainment of all things; nor 
can our minds be always intent on something to be 
learned. The weakness of our constitutions, both 
of mind and body, requires that we should be often 
unbent: and he that will make use of any part of 
his life, must allow a large portion of it to recrea~ 
tion. Atleast, this must not be denied to young 
people; unless whilst you, with too much haste, 
make them old, you have the displeasure to set 
them in their graves, or a second childhood, sooner 
than you could wish. And therefore, I think, that 
the time and pains allotted to serious improvements, 
should be employed about things of most use and 
consequence, and that too in the method the most 
easy and short, that could be at any rate obtained : 
and perhaps, as I have above said, it would be 
none of the least secrets of education, to make the 
exercises of the body and mind, the recreation one 
to another.. I doubt not but that something might 
be done in it, by a prudent man, that would well 
consider the temper and inclination of his pupil. 
For he that is wearied either with study or dancing, 
  languages, enabled them, moreover, to bestow the requisite time 
on the study of it; and, accordingly, we find Plato and Aristo- 
tle, men to whom the wide range of politics and nature were 
familiar, recommending, in their didactic treatises, a careful cul- 
tivation of the science of music. To Milton it supplied an im- 
Portant portion of the food of the soul. In his blindness and old 
age he loved to plunge into that wilderness of soothing sounds 
which is found in the organ; and at such moments bis imagina- 
tion seems to have been rapt, hurried backwards many thousand 
years, to the age of the prophets and patriarchs, or to that other 
land where Phrygian and Dorian melodies inspired religious 
frenzy or deliberate valour. ‘

never took orders,-was educated for the church, alluding with 
expertness as a swordsman. “Nor, 
though yery thin, was I ever deficient in courage or in strength; 
and I. was wont constantly to. exercise myself in the use of the 
sword, a3-long.as.it comported with my habits and my yeats.

in some such‘ vigorous exercise; I shall leave to the 
discretion of. parents and tutors,. who will do well 
to remember, in all the parts of education, that most 
time and application is to be bestowed on that, 
which is like to be of greatest. consequence, and 
frequentest use, in the ordinary course and oc- 
currences of that life the young man is designed 
for. : . 
199. As for fencing, it seems to me a good 
exercise for health, but dangerous to the life: 
the confidence of-their skill being apt to engage 
in quartels ;those that think. they have learned 
to use their. swords. This presumption makes 
them often more touchy than needs,..on points 
of honour, and slight or no provocations, | Young 
men, in their-warm blood are forward to think they 
have in vain learned to fence, if they never show 
their skill and courage in a duel; and they seem 
to have reason. But how many sad tragedies 
that reason has: been the oceasion ‘of, the tears 
of many a mother can witness. .A.man that 
cannot fence, will be more careful to keep out 
of bullies and gamesters’ company, and will not 
be half so apt to stand upon punctilios, nor to 
give affronts, or fiercely justify them when given, 
which is that which usually makes the quarrel. 
And when a man is in the field, a moderate skill in 
fencing, rather exposes him to the sword of his 
enemy, than secures him from it. And certainly a

since fencing,’and riding the great horse, are so 
‘generally looked upon as necessary qualifications in 
the breeding of a gentleman, it will be hard wholly 
to deny any-one of that rank these marks of dis- 
tinction. I shall‘leave it therefore to the father, to

station he is like:to be in, will allow, or encourage 
‘him to complywith fashions, which having very

to. the most warlike nations, and seem to have added 
dittle of force or courage to those who have re- 
weived them; unless we will think martial skill or

which fencing came into, and with which, T pre-

the hardest part of the task is over. To bring a 
young man to this,'I know nothing which so much 
contributes, as the love: of praise and commenda- 
tion, which should therefore be instilled into him 
by all arts imaginable, Make his mind as sensible 
of credit and shame as may be; and. when you 
have done that, you have put a principle into him, 
which will influence his actions when you are not 
by, to which the fear of a little smart of a rod is 
not comparable, and which will be the proper stock 
whereon afterwards to graft the true principles of 
morality and religion. 
TRADE. 
201. I have one thing more to add, which as soon 
as I mention I shall run the danger of being sus- 
pected to have. forgot what.I am about, and-what 
I have above written concerning education, all 
tending towards a gentleman’s calling, with-which 
a trade seems to be wholly inconsistent. And yet I 
cannot forbear to say, I would have him learn a 
trade, a manual trade; nay, two or three, but one 
more particularly. 
202, The busy inclination of ‘children being 
always to be directed.to something that may be 
useful to them, the advantages proposed from what 
they are set about may be considered of two kinds: 
1. Where the skill itself that is got by exercise, is 
worth the having. Thus skill not only in lan- 
guages and learned sciences, but in painting, turn- 
ing, gardening, tempering, and working in iron,

argument or,two against it not easy to be answered: 
First, ill painting is one of the worst things in the 
world; and to attain a tolerable degree of skill in 
it, requires too much of a man’s time. If he has a 
natural inclination to it, it will endanger the neg- 
lect of all other more.useful studies to give way to 
that; and if he haye no inclination to it, all the 
time, pains, and money shall be employed in it, 
will be thrown away to no purpose. . Another 
reason why I am not for painting in a gentleman, 
is, because it is a sedentary recreation, which more 
employs the mind,than the body. A gentleman’s 
_ more serious employment I look on to be study; 
and when that demands relaxation and refreshment, 
it should be in some exercise of the body, which 
unbends the thought, and confirms the health and 
strength. For. ‘these two reasons I am not for 
Painting. 
. " RECREATIONS. 
204, In the next place, for a country gentleman 
I shall propose one, or rather both these, viz. gar- 
dening or husbandry in general, and working in 
wood, as a carpenter, joiner, or turner, these being fit 
and healthy: recreations for a man of study or busi- 
ness; For since the mind endures not to. be con- 
stantly employed in the same thing or way, and 
sedentary or studious men should have some exer- 
cise, that at the same time might divert their minds, 
  
“just: nothing can be more unworthy a liberal mind than an am- 
bition to daub canvass ; and.to become an artist would require 
the whole time and study ‘of the ablest man.

with affairs-of state, and thought it no lessening to 
their dignity, to make the one the recreation to the 
other, -That indeed which seems most generally to

agriculture. Gideon among the Jews was taken

tion for what Locke here relates. Perhaps, however, he may 
allude to a very beautiful passage in Xenophon’s “ Economics,” 
where Socrates tells Critobulus an anecdote of the Younger 
Cyrus and Lysander, the latter of whom, he says, gave an ac- 
count of the circumstances to his host in Megara. Upon Lysan- 
der’s arrival at Sardes, with presents from the allies, Cyrus re- 
ceived him with great distinction, and showed him his grounds, 
which, in the old Persian language, were denominated a Para- 
dise. The Laconian beheld with admiration the beauty of the 
plantations, where the trees, probably date-palms, arranged in 
right lines at regular distances, with straight and lofty stems, as 
I have seen them on the plain of Memphis, formed umbrageous 
avenues in all directions, while fragrant odours everywhere filled 
the air. He less admired the grounds, however, than the indus- 
try of Cyrus, who had arranged. and laid out the whole; but, on 
his making the remark, «Do you wonder,” said Cyrus, “at this 
circumstance ?- Why, among those trees, there are many that I 
planted with my own hands.” Regarding his appearance, the 
beauty of his perfumed garments, his splendid bracelets, and 
neck-chains, and all the rest of his personal omaments, Lysander 
is said to have exclaimed, * What do you mean, Cyrus ? would 
you pretend that with those hands you have planted trees?” To 
which Cyrus replied : “ Do you feel surprised at that, Lysander ? 
I swear to you by Mithra, that, when in good health, I never

less a diversion, than any of the idle sports in fa- 
shion, if men could but be brought to delight in 
’ them, which-custom and skill in a trade will quickly 
bring any one to do, And I doubt not, but there 
are to be found those, who being frequently called 
to cards, or any. other play, by those they could not 
refuse, have been more tired with these recreations 
than with any the most serious employment of life, 
though the play-has been such, as they have natu-

it strike so deep as to concern them, it is a trade 
then, and not a recreation, wherein few that have 
any thing else to live on, thrive: and at best, a 
thriving gamester has but a poor trade of it, who 
fills his pockets at the price of his reputation. 
Recreation belongs not to people who are stran- 
gers to business, and ‘are not wasted and wearied 
with the employment of their calling. The skill 
should be, so to order their time of recreation, that 
it may relax and refresh the part that has been ex- 
ercised, and is tiréd, and yet do something, which 
besides the present delight and ease, may produce, 
what will afterwards be profitable. It has been 
nothing but the vanity'and pride of greatness and 
riches, that has brought unprofitable and dangerous 
pastimes (as they are called) into fashion, and per- 
suaded people into a belief, that the learning, or 
putting their hands to any thing that was useful, 
could not be a diversion fit for 2 gentleman. This 
has been that which has given cards, dice, and 
drinking, so much credit in the world: and a great

the prevalency of custom, and want of some better 
employment to fill up the vacancy of leisure, more 
than from any real delight is to be found in them.

time lying upon their hands, nor the uneasiness it

suade him to more than ordinary complaisance for 
all the gaieties and diversions of those he converses

think the safest and best way is never to learn any

have time enough from his serious and main busi- 
ness, to learn almost any. trade... It is want of ap- 
plication, and not of leisure, that men are not skil- 
ful in more arts than one; and an hour in a day, 
constantly employed in such.a,way of diversion, 
will carry a man in a short time, a great deal farther 
than he can imagine : which, if it were of no other. 
use but to drive the common, vicious, useless; and 
dangerous pastimes out of fashion, and to show, 
there was no need of them, would deserve to be en- 
couraged. If men from their youth were weaned 
from that sauntering humour, wherein some out of 
custom let a good part of their lives run uselessly 
away, without either business or recreation, they 
would find time enough to acquire dexterity and 
skill in hundreds of things: which, though remote 
from their proper callings, would not at all inter- 
fere with them. And therefore, I think, for this, as 
well as other reasons before mentioned, a lazy, list- 
Jess humour, that idly dreams away the days, is of, 
all others the least to be indulged or permitted in 
young people. It is the proper state of, one sick, 
and out of order in his health, and is tolerable in 
nobody else, of what age or condition soever.

perfuming, varnishing, graving, and several sorts 
of working in iron, brass, and silver; and if,.as. it

Merchants’ accounts, though a'science not likely 
to help a gentleman to get an estate, yet possibly 
there is not any thing of more use and efficacy, to 
make him preserve the estate he has. It is seldom 
observed, that he ‘who keeps an account of his 
income and expenses, and thereby has constantly 
under view the'course of his domestic affairs, lets

them run to ruin: and I doubt not but many a 
man gets. behindhand, before he:is aware, or runs 
farther on, when. he is once in, for want of this 
care, or the skill to do it. I would therefore advise 
ali gentlemen to learn perfectly merchants’ ac- 
counts, and not to think it is a.skill that belongs 
not to them, because it has received. its name from, 
and has been chiefly practised by men of traffic. 
211. When my young master has once got the 
skill of keeping accounts (which is a business of 
reason more. than arithmetic) perhaps it will not 
be amiss that his father, from thenceforth, require 
him to do it in all his concernments. Not that I 
would have him. set down every pint of wine, or 
play, that costs him money ; the general name of 
expenses will serve. for such things well enough : 
nor would I have his father look so narrowly into 
these accounts, as to. take occasion from thence to 
criticise on.his.expenses; he must remember that 
he himself was once a young man, and not forget 
the thoughts he had then, nor.the right his son has 
to have the same, and to have allowance made for 
them. If, therefore,.I would have the young gen- 
tleman obliged to keep an account, it is not at‘all 
to have that way a check upon his expenses, (for what 
the father allows him, he ought to let him be fully 
master of,) but. only, that he might be brought 
early into the custom of doing it, and that might 
be made familiar and habitual to him betimes, 
which will be.so useful and necessary to be con- 
stantly practised the whole. course of. his life. A 
noble Venetian, whose son wallowed in the plenty

of. his father's riches, finding ‘his son’s expenses 
grow very high and extravagant, ordered his cashier 
tolet him have for the future no more money than 
what:heshould count when he received it. This 
_one would think ‘no great restraint to a young gen- 
tleman’s expenses, who could freely have as much 
money as he would tell: but yet this, to one that 
was used to nothing but the pursuit of his pleasures, 
proved a very great trouble, which at last ended in 
this sober and advantageous reflection: If it be so 
much pains to me barely to count the money T 
would spend, what labour and pains did it cost my 
ancestors, not only to count, but to get it? This 
rational thought, suggested by this little pains-im- 
posed upon him, wrought so effectually upon his 
mind, that it made him take up, and from that time 
forwards prove a good husbander. This, at least, 
every body must-allow, that nothing is likelier to 
keep a man within compass, than the having con- 
stantly. before:his eyes the state of his affairs ina 
regular course of account.

212, The last part usually in education, is tra- 
vel, which is commonly thought to finish the work, 
and complete the gentleman. I confess travel into 
foreign countries has great advantages, but the time 
usually chosen to send young mén abroad, is, I 
think, of-all other, that which renders them least 
capable of reaping those advantages. Those which 
are proposed,:as to the main of them, may be 
reduced to these two, first, language; secondly, an

improvement in wisdom and prudence, by seeing 
men, and conversing with people of tempers, cus- 
toms, and ways of living, different from one another, 
and especially from those of his parish and neigh- 
bourhood. But from sixteen to one and twenty, 
which is the ordinary time of travel, men are, of all 
their lives, the least suited to these improve- 
ments. () The first season to get foreign lan- 
guages, and form the tongue to their true ac- 
cents, I should think, should be from seven to 
fourteen or sixteen, and then too, a tutor with 
them is usefol and necessary, who may, with those 
languages, teach them other things. But to put 
them out of their parents’ view at a great distance, 
under a governor, when they think themselves to 
be too much men to be governed by others, and yet 
have not prudence and experience enough to go- 
vern themselves, what is it, but to expose them to 
all the greatest dangers of their whole life, when 
they have the least fence and guard against them ? 
Until that boiling boisterous part of life comes in, 
(°°) Gilbert West, in his quaint but interesting poem on the 
“ Abuse of Travelling,” argues strenuously against the practice 
of sending youth abroad, and praises Lycurgus, who is supposed 
tohave prohibited foreign peregrinations, no less than the receiv- 
ing of strangers. He had himself travelled. West, however, 
approves of 
«© That politic command, 
‘Which from vain travel the young Spartan stayed, 
‘Ne maffered him forsake his native land, ‘To learn deceitful arta, and science contraband.” 
But, perhaps, if we carefully examine the subject, it may be 
found that the Spartan would have ran little risk of deteriorating 
by visiting other countries. He might, at least, have improved 
his humanity.
-P-A-G-E-397
328 TRAVEL. 
it_may be hoped, the tutor. may have some autho- 
rity : neither. the stubbornness of age, nor the temp- 
tation. or examples of others, can take him from 
his tutor's conduct till fifteen or sixteen : but then, 
when. he begins’ to. consort himself with men, and 
thinks himself one ; when he comes. to relish, and 
pride himself in manly vices, and thinks it a shame 
to be any longer under the controul and conduct of 
another, what can be. hoped from even the most 
careful and discreet governor; when neither he has 
power to compel, nor his pupil a disposition to be 
persuaded ; but on the contrary, has the advice of 
warm blood and -prevailing fashion, to hearken to 
the temptations of, his:companions, just as wise as 
himself, rather than to the persuasions of his tutor, 
who is now looked on as an enemy to, his freedom? 
And when is a man so likely to miscarry, as when 
at the same time he is both raw and unruly? This 
is the season of all. his life, that most requires the 
eye and authority of bis parents and friends to go- 
vern it. . The flexibleness of the former part of a 
man’s age, not yet grown up to be headstrong, 
makes it more governable and safe; and in the 
after-part, reason and foresight begin a little to take 
place, and mind a man of his safety and improve- 
ment. The time therefore I should think the fittest 
for a young gentleman to be sent abroad, would 
be, either when he is younger,('°) under a tutor, 
(!) It would be still better if the parents, with the whole fa- 
mily, could make the necessary stay in foreign countries. I 
have seen the experiment frequently made. Children, in this 
way, may at least learn the modern languages on the plan recom- 
mended by Montaigne,

whom he might be the better for; or when he is 
some years old, without a governor; when he is of 
age to govern himself, and make observations of 
what he finds in other countries worthy his notice, 
and that might be of use to him after his return: 
and when too, being thoroughly acquainted with 
Jaws and fashions, the natural and moral advantages 
and defects of his own country, he has some- 
thing to exchange, with those abroad, from whose 
conversation he hoped to reap any knowledge. 
214, The ordering of travel otherwise, is that, 
I imagine, which makes so many young gentle- 
men come back so little improved by it. And if 
they do bring home with them any knowledge of 
the places and people they have seen, it is often an 
admiration of the worst and vainest practices they 
met with abroad ; retaining a relish and memory of 
those things wherein their liberties took its first 
swing, rather than of what should make them bet- 
ter and wiser, after their return. And indeed how 
can it be otherwise, going abroad at the age they 
do under the care of another, who is to provide 
their necessaries, and make their observations for 
them? Thus under the shelter and pretence of a 
governor, thinking themselves excused from stand- 
ing upon their own legs, or being accountable for 
their own conduct, they very seldom trouble them- 
selves with inquiries, or making useful observations 
of their own, Their thoughts run after play and 
pleasure, wherein they take it as a lessening to be 
controlled; but seldom trouble themselves to ex- 
amine the designs, observe the address, and consi~

port themsélves towards them.('") Here he that 
travels with them, is to screen them; get them out 
when ‘they have run themselves into the briars ; 
and in all their miscarriages be answerable for 
them. 
215. I confess, the knowledge of men is so 
great a skill, that it is not to be expected a young 
man should presently be perfect in it. But yet his 
going abroad is to little purpose, if travel does not 
sometimes open his eyes, make him cautious and 
wary, and accustom him to look beyond the out- 
side, and, under the inoffensive guard of a civil 
and obliging carriage, keep himself free and safe in 
his conversation with strangers, and all sort of 
people, without forfeiting their good opinion. He 
that is sent out to travel at the age, and with the 
thoughts of a man designing to improve himself, 
may get into the conversation and acquaintance of 
persons of condition where be comes; which, 
though a thing of most advantage to a gentleman 
that travels; yet J ask, amongst our young men, 
that go abroad'under tutors, what one is there of 
an hundred, that ever visit any person of quality ? 
much less make an acquaintance with such, from 
whose conversation he may learn what is good 
breeding in that country, and what is worth obser 
('8') But among those who travel, there are many whose onl: 
object seems to be to exhibit their own ignorance, and 
their country ; and they generally succeed to the utmost exten| 
of their wishes,

vation in it; though from such persons it is, one 
may learn more in one day, than in a year's 
rambling from one.inn to another, Nor indeed 
is it to be wondered; for men of worth and parts 
will not easily admit the familiarity of boys, who 
yet need the care of a tutor; though a young gen- 
tleman and stranger, appearing like a man, and 
showing a desire to inform himself in the customs, 
manners, laws, and government of the country he 
is in, will find welcome assistance and entertain- 
ment amongst the best and most knowing persons 
everywhere, who will be ready to receive, encou- 
rage, and countenance an ingenuous and inquisitive 
foreigner. : 
216. This, how true soever it be, will not, I 
fear, alter the custom, which has cast the time of 
travel upon the worst part of a man’s life; but for 
reasons not taken from their improvement. The 
young lad must not be ventured abroad at eight or 
ten, for fear what may happen to the tender child, 
though he then runs ten times less risk than at 
sixteen or eighteen. Nor must he stay at home till 
that dangerous heady age be over, because he must 
be back again by one and twenty, to marry, and pro- 
pagate. The father cannot stay any longer for the 
portion, nor the mother for a new set of babies to 
play with; and so my young master, whatever 
comes of it, must have a wife looked out for him, 
by the time he is of age; though it would be no 
prejudice to his strength, his parts, or his issue, if it 
were respited for some time, and he had leave to 
get, in years and knowledge, the start a little of his

CONCLUSION. 
217, Though I am. now come to a conclu- 
sion of what obvious remarks have suggested to 
me concerning education, I would not have it 
thought, that I look on it as a just treatise on 
this subject. There are a thousand. other things, 
that may need consideration; especially if one 
should take in the various tempers, different in- 
clinations, and particular defaults, that are to 
' be found in children, and prescribe proper reme- 
dies. The variety is so great, that it would require 
a volume; nor would that reach it. Each man’s 
mind has some peculiarity, as well as his face, 
that distinguishes, him. from all others; and there 
are possibly scarce two children, who can be con- 
ducted by exactly the same method,. Besides that, 
I think a prince, a nobleman, and an ordinary 
gentleman’s son, should have different ways of 
breeding. But having had here only some general 
views, in reference to the main end and aims in   
(13?) All philosophers have condemned too early marriages. 
Aristotle, without wisbing to fix exactly upon a given period, re- 
commends the age of thirty-seven to men, eighteen to women. 
Plato nearly agreed with him ; and Montaigne, who approved of 
the theory, made some approach to it in practice, for he married 
at thirty-three. Milton's opinions and practice were nearly the 
same.

son, whom being then very little, I considered only 
as white paper, or wax, to be moulded and fashioned 
as one pleases; I have touched little more than 
those heads which I judged necessary for the 
breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in 
general; and have now published these my occa- 
sional thoughts with this hope, that though this 
be far from being a complete treatise on this sub- 
ject, or such as that every one may find what 
will just fit bis child in it, yet it may give some 
small light to those whose concern for their dear 
little ones makes them so irregularly bold, that they 
dare venture to consult their own reason, in the 
education of their children, rather than wholly to 
rely upon Old Custom.

ENGLISH PROSE LITERATURE, 
THith Wreliminary Wiscourses anv ‘Notes, 
BY J. A. ST. JOHN, ESQ. 
  
In the hope of inspiring a disposition toa renewed intercourse 
with the Masterspirits of our native land, and with a desire to 
rescue from the dust of ages, the ablest efforts of the wise and 
good, it is intended to form a Lipaary of the best works of 
our greatest writers— 
BACON—MILTON—SIR THOMAS MORE—SIR PHILIP SYDNEY—CLARENDON 
—LOCKE—DRYDEN—SWIFT—ADDISON—COWLEY— 
BOLINGBROKE—ALGERNON SYDNEY—-HUME—CONYERS MIDDLETON— 
BISHOP BERKELEY—SIR THOMAS BROWNE—BURKE—JOHNSON— 
SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS-—STERNE—ADAM SMITH—PAYNE KNIGHT— 
HOOKER—AND OTHERS. 
To those who thoroughly comprehend the importance and 
high tendency of LrrERaTuRe, when not perverted from the 
original intention of its nature, an elaborate exposition of the 
advantages likely to accrue to the public from such a Series, will 
be altogether unnecessary. They already know that, in every 
art and science, those who would not rest content with a cramped 
mechanical knowledge, meted out to them by the peculiar mea- 
sures in vogue among their Contemporaries, must turn con- 
stantly back, to consider what were the ideas and practices of 
Former Ages, in order to enlarge and improve their own. In 
-reprinting, therefore, the ablest Treatises of our elder writers, 
~—some of the most perfect compositions to which the wit of 
man has given birth,—the Proprietor confidently anticipates the 
countenance and recommendation of every friend to the Litera- 
ture of his country. 
The labours of the Eprror may be very briefly explained. 
To the Works of those Writers, the events of whose lives are 
hitherto little known, he will prefix an Ontcinat Biocra- 
puIcaL Memoir, containing, in addition to the history of the
-P-A-G-E-405
MASTERPIECES OF PROSE LITERATURE. 
  Author’s life, a general view of his Writings, remarks on the 
peculiarities of $iié Style, an outline of the Opinions, religious 
and political, prevalent during the Age in which he lived, and 
an Account of the Fate of his Works after his death, ‘Where- 
ever the text appears to require elucidation, he will subjoin a 
Nore, explaining, or, if necessary, expanding the Author's 
meaning, or illustrating it by Anecdotes or Historical Facts. 
A volume will appear on the first day of each alternate 
Month, handsomely printed, bound and lettered. To the Works 
of each Author a finely engraved Portrait or ILLUSTRA- 
TION will be added. 
Thus introduced, it is hoped that the sterling merit of the 
works themselves will do the rest: particularly as care will be 
taken to avoid even the appearance of monotony in the subjects, 
by following up Politics and Philosophy with Criticism—works 
on Morals and Education—Biography—Pictures of Manners— 
and even with Romance, when, as in the Urorta of Sir Thomas 
More, it has been made subservient to some great moral end.

PREFACE TO ENGLISH EDITION 
HIS volume was published in 1906 in the “ Bibli- 
othéque internationale de psychologie expériment- 
In the present edition I have taken advantage of 
he greater space to make numerous additions. I have 
dded chapters upon measurements of attention, upon 
he relations of attention to the feelings and to the self, 
land have appended a chapter on the educational applica- 
tions of some of the conclusions. Moreover, the short 
chapter in the French edition on memory, will, and reason 
has been expanded into three. New material has been 
introduced here and there throughout the work. I have 
endeavoured to make full use of the suggestions offered by 
my numerous reviewers, and have taken advantage of all 
that seemed practical. In a topic with so many ramifica- 
tions as attention it is difficult to decide just where to stop. 
One is always tempted to extend discussion to topics not 
directly connected with the main theme, and to discuss 
them for themselves, not for their bearing upon the subject 
in hand. I desire to thank M. Vaschide for his courtesy 
in connection with the French edition, and I wish to express 
my gratitude particularly to the editor of the “ Library of 
Philosophy,” Professor Muirhead, for the care he has given 
my manuscript and for numerous valued suggestions. 
Considerable portions of chapter xiii. were published in 
the ‘‘ Philosophical Review” for July, 1907, and are re- 
printed by permission of the editors.

PREFACE 
N the present chaotic condition of attention theories 
an attempt, however modest, to harmonise the known 
facts with one another needs no apology. I have endeav- 
oured in the present volume to bring together in an orderly 
way the results of the different researches, and the theory 
that results is, I hope, nothing more than a general state- 
ment of fact. It has been my aim to exclude rigidly all 
tendencies towards hypothetical constructions, and to give 
all explanations in terms of observed phenomena. Where 
this has been impossible through the limitations of know- 
ledge, I have been satisfied with the simple statement, 
“ We do not know.” 
In criticism of the different theories, I have striven to 
show the relation between the theory and the facts, to 
show what interpretation of the facts has led to the theory, 
and to make use of the theory in my own. 
For the sake of completeness, more emphasis has been 
placed upon the higher mental processes than is usual in 
works on attention. This seems desirable, both because 
it enables one to note how close is the relation between the 
factors that control attention and those that determine the 
more complicated intellectual processes, and because an 
important part of the simple perception can be under- 
stood only if treated as a mental construction. 
The pleasant duty remains of acknowledging my indebted- 
ness to friends for the assistance they haye rendered in the

preparation of the manuscript. To my colleagues, Pro 
fessors Lombard and McMurrich, I am grateful for sugges 
tions as to literature in physiology and neurology. Pro 
fessor Lloyd has read the entire manuscript, as has Professo: 
James R. Angell, Professor Lombard the physiological parts, 
and each has made numerous corrections. But particularly 
I desire to thank my teacher of former years, Professor 
Titchener of Cornell University, who not only has read the 
completed manuscript, but who encouraged me to write it, 
and to whom I owe a more general debt for the inspiration 
I received from his guidance and friendship during four 
years of personal intercourse.

ATTEN FION 
CHAPTER I 
THE MENTAL EFFECTS OF ATTENTION 
HE manifestations of the state that we commonly call 
attention are protean. No part of the individual 
is untouched by them. They extend to every part of the “04 @ 
physical organism, and are among the most profound facts + +*~ __ 
of mind. So numerous Sep vais ee the ea 3 
of attention; that we find it defined by competent autho- * —‘ 
rities as avstate of muscular contraction arid adaptation, ~ 7 
as a pure mental activity, as an emotion or feeling, and 
as a change in the clearness of ideas. Each of the defini- 
tions can be justified from the facts, if we put the chief 
emphasis now upon one phase and now upon another of 
its varied expressions. Each of these aspects must be 
discussed in turn, but for the purposes of the present 
chapter we may confine ourselves to the immediate changes 
in conscious states, since these are most open to observa- 
tion and seem to be fundamental for all the others. 
Perhaps the best general description of the -effectof 
attention is afforded by Wundt’s comparison of conscious- 
ness to the field of vision. As in the eye there is a point 
of clearest vision, where all impressions are very distinct 
as opposed to the vagueness of the objects seen with other 
parts of the retina, so in mind there are always a few pro- 
cesses which stand out clearly, while the others are blurred 
and indefinite. And as the eye can wander over the various 
B 
 
-P-A-G-E-12

objects before it, bringing first one then the other into the 
most favourable position, so the sensations, of which we 
are conscious at one instant, disappear from consciousness 
at the next. Attention.may wander over the mental field 
c= the eye may wander over a surface in the outside world. 
mitting the metaphor, we may say that attention in- 
creases the clearness of the sensations attended, to, but 
it is very difficult to describe what is meant by clearness 
in a way that shall make it any more easily understood. 
Every one knows what is meant by the term and has ex- 
perienced the change which actually goes on during atten- 
tion. It means largely that some one element of con- 
sciousness is picked out from the others, and given an 
advantage over them. It is more fully conscious, more 
adequately a part of our experience than are the others. 
Clearness is then purely a relative matter. All mental 
processes affect us in some degree, but those processes 
to which we attend affect us in a much higher degree than 
those to which we do not attend. Increase in the degree 
to which an impression is conscious and increase in atten- 
tion to that impression are synonymous terms. 
There are many similarities between attention thus re- 
garded and the intensity of a sensation, and it has been sug- 
gested that attention really has the same effect upon a 
conscious content as that which results when the intensity 
of a stimulus affecting us is increased. There are, how- 
ever, serious objections to this view, and there is probably 
no other phase of the attention problem which excites so 
much dispute as this one of the relation of attention to 
the intensity of the mental process affected. There are 
two rival views as to how the attention might affect the 
sensation. The first and most direct, held by Mach, and 
in a certain degree by Stumpf among others, is that the 
sensation attended to is directly and immediately in- 
creased in intensity; the other, favoured by Wundt, is 
that there is a relative increase in the intensity or effective- 
ness of the sensation, due to the fact that all the remaining
-P-A-G-E-13
The Mental Effects of Attention 3 
content of consciousness has its intensity decreased by 
the attending process. The strongest objection to the 
assumption that there is an actual increase in the intensity 
of the process attended to is one that we owe to Kiilpe, 
derived from a technical argument based upon the facts 
of Weber’s law. The sta of the law. in simplest 
terms is that {one notices absolutely equi ifferencés of ~~ 
intensity mi more easily W he-sensations compared ~~ = : + — iia eng Re 
are faint than when stfong, and that the -keenness in dis- ~~~ 
‘crimination abso. ifference decreases as the inten- 
sities increase, while the relative discrimination is constant. 
One is more likely to overlook changes of the same amount 
1 t or a cannon sho an im mt 
been 3 ere 
the sensation when attended to, it would become more 
difficult to notice small differences when straining the 
attention than when not attending at all. This is of course 
entirely out of harmony both with the facts of daily life 
and the results of technical experiments. Judgments of 
difference are always more accurate when the attention 
is good. There is one possible flaw in the argument. This 
is that it is not at all certain that attention may not produce 
an increase in the intensity of the sensation proportional 
to the intensity of the stimulus, rather than an absolute, 
arbitrary increase. If the increase were thus relative one 
would find that loud sounds are increased in greater amount 
than faint sounds. This harmonises with what we know 
of mental states, and is fully as probable as that the in- 
crease should be absolute in amount. The only lack of 
harmony in that case between the facts of the attention 
and the results obtained from the experiments on Weber’s 
law is that the attention decreases the fraction of the 
stimulus which can just be noticed instead of leaving it 
unchanged—a fact which can be explained only on the as- 
sumption of some other influence than the change in in- 
tensity. It is probably as easy to assume that this other 
effect, whatever it may prove to be, explains all of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
yy 4 Attention 
results of the attention as well as those which are mani- 
fested in connection with experiments on Weber’s law. 
While then the a priori objections to the theory are suf- 
ficiently strong to make it improbable that the change in 
intensity is sufficient to account for the effects of the at- 
tention, they are not positive enough to decide against any 
concrete facts which may have a bearing on the question. 
The great difficulty in settling the matter on the basis 
of fact is that it is impossible directly to compare an object 
attended to with one not attended to. There is an un- 
avoidable impulse to attend to both before the judgment 
is made, and any results that should claim to be accurate 
on this point would be open to grave suspicion. 
=~ The men who have formed an opinion from introspection, 
and who have had experience enough to make them com- 
petent judges, are hopelessly at variance. An interesting 
instance of this is offered by the difference of opinion be- 
tween Stumpf [*] and Mach with reference to the effect of 
attention upon sounds. Stumpf holds in his second vol- 
ume that weak tones in a group of other tones, whether 
weak or strong, are increased in intensity when attended 
to. He denies, however, that there is any increase in 
tones of moderate intensity even when sounding in a chord 
or clang. Mach, under the same circumstances, with the 
same complex of tones, is equally positive that the tones 
increase in intensity as attention turns upon them. It 
should be added that Stumpf holds that there is no in- 
crease in intensity even with faint tones beyond that which 
they would have were they sounding alone with no physio- 
logical hindrances in the way of their coming to conscious- 
ness. As he rightly argues, were attention to increase 
tones indefinitely, one could never be sure whether a change 
were objective or subjective. The same divergence of 
opinion exists among other authorities equally entitled 
to an opinion. Evidently no help can be obtained from 
this source. 
Lehmann [‘] settles the question in favour of the inde-  
-P-A-G-E-15
  The Mental Effects of Attention 5 
pendence of attention of intensity by reminding us that 
when we are gazing at a sheet of white paper there is no 
difference in shade between the part looked at directly 
and the surrounding parts which are not attended to. 
Again, there are two objections to this summary settle- 
ment of the question. In the first place, it is frequently 
denied that the intensity of the visual stimulus is accom- 
panied by corresponding change in the intensity of the 
sensation, but rather that the series of grays that we find 
on the sensation side are differences in quality. In that 
case we should expect no change in colour to come with 
the attending, for no one has claimed that quality changes 
with degree of attention. In the second place even if 
there were a difference in the shade we would not expect 
it to be noticed, as it is well known that an evenly-coloured 
red area seems red over its entire extent, although we know 
that we can only see the red in a limited field in the centre. 
And finally, the objection would hold here also that it is 
impossible to compare the portion attended to with the 
other parts of the field, because with the comparison there 
comes at once and involuntarily a change of the attention 
to the parts of the field hitherto not directly observed. 
The experiments that have been devoted to the ques- 
tion by Miinsterberg, [*] Kiilpe, [7] and Miss Hamlin all rest 
upon the assumption that distraction decreases the amount 
of attention. This may or may not be true, as will be 
seen in a later chapter. Even granting the general prin- 
ciple, we are no better off, for results vary between proving 
that attention increases the intensity of a sensation and 
that it decreases it. 
A careful consideration of the facts seems to give no 
definite proof in favour of either side in the controversy. We 
are left with the mere fact that the weight of authority is in 
favour of regarding the effect of attention as different from 
the effect of an increased-intensity of the external stimu- 
lus; but with no convincing proof in favour of that posi- 
tion. One other factor demands consideration in this 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 Attention 
connection before we can turn to other phases of the problem. 
That is that many of the writers who insist that attention 
does not increase the intensity of sensations of moderate 
strength, also assert that it does increase the intensity 
of very weak sensations. The fact upon which this 
statement is based is that in many cases we can by attend- 
ing bring to consciousness sensations so weak that they 
ordinarily pass unobserved. If you will attend fixedly 
for a few moments to any point on the external skin, you 
will find coming into consciousness a number of itching, 
tingling, or prickling sensations which you had not previously 
noticed, and would in all probability not have observed 
Were it not for the increased attention to that part of the 
( ‘body. In the same way attentive listening will at any 
\ time bring to consciousness noises which for the most part 
\would pass unnoticed under ordinary circumstances. It 
may be the gentle rustling of leaves, the rippling of a dis- 
tant brook, the droning of insects, or in case these and all 
other external sounds are lacking, there is still left the sound 
of the blood as it pulses through the ears. The same prin- 
ciple could be illustrated from any of the senses. In these 
cases it is still a question whether we have to do with a 
phenomenon of a new sort rather than an application 
of the principles earlier considered to a new intensity. 
Were it certain in any case that the sound which came in 
with the attention had been entirely without effect upon 
consciousness up to the time that the attention was turned 
toward it we might have a clear case of the influence upon 
intensity. But in nearly every instance we can assume that 
the faint sensation was contributing its share to the total 
impression received, and was merely picked out of the mass 
for increased emphasis. All the noises of a summer day 
in the woods undoubtedly contribute their part to the 
woodland impression, although they may not be heard 
in isolation. The complex of sensations from the skin, 
it has frequently been suggested, unites with the sensa- 
tions from the internal organs to furnish the background
-P-A-G-E-17
  The Mental Effects of Attention ii 
of our consciousness. They are probably always present 
in varying degrees, but yet with sufficient constancy to 
constitute one of the marks of our personal identity. All 
that attention does then is probably to bring to greater 
prominence one of these elements. It is merely an increase 
in clearness, as was the other, and there seems no evidence 
for regarding this case as different from the other. If there 
is no increase in intensity at the basis of the gain in clear- 
ness in the one instance, there seems no reason to assume 
itin the other. Nowhere do we find an example of attention 
in which we may be sure that an impression which was 
entirely unconscious becomes entirely conscious owing to 
a change in the attention. In all cases, apparently, there 
is a mass of sensations which unite in some one group, and 
it is possible to select relatively smaller bits from the mass, 
or to combine them in even larger wholes, but in any case 
each part is contributing its share to the total effect. The 
intensity of the sensation makes no difference in principle. 
It matters not whether the tones of a single violin are 
made to stand out from an orchestra, or whether an overtone 
is heard out from the compound note of a single violin 
string. In both cases we are analysing a whole into its 
parts, and there seems to be no reason for assuming that 
the analysis is accomplished at one time in a way different 
from that in which it is accomplished in the other. If 
intensity is what changes in one case, there is no reason for 
assuming that it is not also at the basis of the other change. 
Nowhere do we find an instance in which a sensation comes 
to a sense organ which has not been just previously stimu- 
lated, or in which we can be sure that there is not another 
stimulation that is at work at the same time which serves 
as a background from which the previously unnoticed 
impression is picked out by the attention. Nowhere 
then can we be sure that we have a case of mete increase 
in intensity, rather than an increase in clearness, which 
gives one of several equally intense sensations an ad- 
vantage over the others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    8 Attention 
Another closely related explanation has been suggested 
to account for the prominence given to one at the expense 
of the other elements. This is that all the other mental 
processes have their intensity decreased, while the object 
attended to remains at its normal intensity. This theory 
is open to all of the objections to which the first was sub- 
jected. It would not account for the phenomena of 
Weber’s law any more than the other, and all the results 
of direct introspection would have the same bearing upon 
it as upon the other. We could not distinguish by obser- 
vation between the results of increasing the intensity of 
one element and decreasing the intensity of all the others. 
It has no advantages over assuming directly that attention 
increases the intensity of the impression attended to. 
And there are many difficulties that are peculiar to the 
more complicated theory from its theoretical side. The 
only picture that we could have on this assumption would 
be that the difference in level between the mountain peak 
of the attention and the plain of the ordinary consciousness 
would be produced not by elevating the peak, but by de- 
pressing the plain. With a very insignificant exception 
all the elements of consciousness would be held at a level 
much below that which they would ordinarily attain, and 
to which their inherent energy would raise them. On any 
analogy with physical energy it would be impossible for 
consciousness to have sufficient force to neutralise so much 
more than half of its entire energy. If it is denied that 
the analogies from energy have a place, it is at least opposed 
to the general law of parsimony in science to choose the 
more complicated explanation when the simpler is equally 
in harmony with the facts. Furthermore, as will be seen 
later on in the discussion, this explanation is entirely at 
variance with what we know of the physiological processes. 
On the whole then there seems to be no very satisfactory 
outcome to the discussion of the relation between clear- 
ness and intensity. It is impossible to accept any of the 
arguments on either side as conclusive. There are a num-  
-P-A-G-E-19
  The Mental Effects of Attention 9 
ber of points in which intensity and attention have the 
same effects, and it will perhaps help us more to enumer- 
ate them than to delay longer with the apparently insoluble 
theoretical problem of their ultimate relation. .To begin 
with intensity as the simpler and better known phenome- 
non, we can perhaps best define it as a change in sensation 
due to a change in the amount of physical energy which 
affects the sense organs. From the subjective standpoint 
it is a change that affects one conscious process alone, 
and is not accompanied by a corresponding change in any 
other conscious process. The change in degree of attention 
on the other hand, although it may be very similar to the 
change in intensity, affects not only the one element of 
consciousness, but all the other elements that are present 
at the same time. When one idea becomes clear and dis- 
tinct all the others lose in distinctness. And again the 
degree of attention is limited by the number of objects 
which come into attention at the same time. If a number 
of objects are attended to, each stands out less clearly than 
if it alone had held the field. While then the intensity of 
a sensation is practically independent of any other sensa- 
tion, and one or any number of sensations may increase 
or decrease without affecting the intensity of any other, 
the amount of attention is practically constant, and can- 
not be applied to one object without affecting the clear- 
ness of others. 
But intensity and attention cannnot be readily isolated 
in practice. We must always abstract from one to con- 
sider the other. In comparing intensities we always think 
of each as at the maximum of attention, and we also think 
of the intensities as identical when comparing the efficiency 
of attention. There is no doubt, as will be seen in the next 
chapter, that intensity makes attention easier on the one 
side, and that the effectiveness of an intensity in conscious- 
ness depends very much upon the state of the attention. 
From this standpoint we might (define the intensity as the 
degree of efficiency of a sensation in consciousness due to 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 Attention 
‘the energy expended upon the sense organ, attention as 
an increase in efficiency due to subjective conditions alone) 
We may summarise the concrete differences between them 
in the statement that, while they are alike in that both 
increase the clearness and distinctness of the elements 
which they affect, they are different in so far as increase 
in the intensity renders discrimination more difficult, 
while increase in the attention renders it easier, and that 
intensity is an individual thing affecting only the one sen- 
sation, while attention is general in its results and has an 
influence upon consciousness as a whole. 
It has been suggested that an important characteristic 
of attention is that it holds in consciousness for a longer 
time than usual the sensation to which it is applied. This 
was early held by Stumpf to be the only influence of atten- 
tion. Later, however, he withdrew the suggestion on the 
ground that one sees the influence of attention in mental 
states that persist for but a brief period. It is probable 
that there is some influence, but it is relatively unim- 
portant. Even if true, it might be a subordinate influ- 
ence of increase in intensity, for we know that in single 
sensations increase, in intensity often has the same 
effect as increase in duration. In rhythm intensity and 
duration are almost interchangeable. If we could assume 
‘increase in intensity, persistence in consciousness must 
follow immediately. 
One other aspect is, however, peculiar to attention, and 
that is the analytic function. When we attend to a process 
we break it up into its elements, and many times into ele- 
ments which we did not know to be present before the 
analysis took place. An object is given in a chaotic mass 
without any particular form, and it is only under the in- 
fluence of the attention that it takes shape. First one 
bit or aspect of the process stands out, and then another, 
as the attention plays over it, and we get a real concep- 
tion of the object only as the result of many different acts 
of the attention. It is hardly fair to say, however, that
-P-A-G-E-21
  The Mental Effects of Attention . 11 
the function of the attention is always analytic, for just 
as frequently it partakes of the nature of a synthesis. It 
is just as possible for the minute elements to be seen first, 
and for them to suggest the whole, as for the whole to come 
first and be followed by the parts. And in many cases 
neither happens, but the attention selects first one, then 
another, of several co-ordinate aspects. What is selected 
is not so much a part of the given whole as a phase of the 
whole—a point of view from which to observe the total 
mass. The function of analysis then is not essential to 
the attention—in fact most cases of attention do not result 
in analysis. Rather may we say that attention is funda- 
mentally a change in clearness of some one phase or aspect 
of a mental process. And while analysis depends upon 
that, it is not, as has been suggested, the prime effect, 
but is merely incidental to other functions, is, in fact, a 
result of the one thing which is characteristic of atten- 
tion—the increase in clearness or prominence which it 
produces in some one idea, or of some aspect of that one 
idea. Increase in clearness is the only change which can 
certainly be affirmed to be the result of attention. 
SUMMARY 
I. The essence of attention as a conscious process is 
an increase in the clearness of one _ or group of ideas 
at the expense of others. 
2. Whether the change’ in clearness is identical with, or 
dependent upon, change in intensity is as yet open to con- 
troversy. 
3. The analytic function of attention is dependent upon 
the change in clearness, and so must be regarded as sub- 
ordinate, not primary.

CHAPTER II 
THE MOTOR CONCOMITANTS OF ATTENTION 
NE of the most striking facts in connection with 
the attention is its close connection with bodily 
movement and posture. The ordinary objective measure 
of attention rests upon the attitude of the man’s body, 
the direction of his eyes, and other bodily signs. There 
is no act of the attention that is unaccompanied by some 
motor process, and it is our problem in this chapter to clas- 
sify, and so far as is possible to explain, the different changes 
that take place in the body during attention. 
It is possible to divide the motor manifestations which 
accompany attention into four great groups :— 
I. Movements of adaptation in the sense organ which 
prepare it the better to receive the entering sensation. 
II. Correlated movements in the organism in general 
whose nature and direction depend upon the nature of the 
particular stimulus. 
III. General overflow effects upon the voluntary muscles 
which do not depend upon the nature of the stimulus. 
IV. Effects upon the involuntary or semi-voluntary 
mechanisms of pulse, respiration, and vaso-motor activities. 
Of course, there are subdivisions under each of these 
heads that could almost as justly be given a separate clas- 
sification, and several of the groups made come very near 
together, but the classification will suffice as a basis for 
discussion. 
That the sense organs adapt themselves to give the 
12

fullest possible amount of each impression is a common- 
    convince himself upon the slightest observation. When 
an object in the field of vision catches the attention, seems 
interesting, the eye at once turns toward it ; when a vague 
sound is heard at night the head is adjusted to the source 
of sound to give the most favourable condition for listening. 
These observations of the daily life are confirmed and ex- 
tended by the experiments to which they have been sub- 
jected. Not only do we turn the eyes toward the object, 
but before it is possible to obtain a clear image there must 
also be an adjustment of the crystalline lens and a conver- 
gence of the eyes which shall bring the object in question 
upon the centre, the spot of clearest vision, of each eye. The 
first is accomplished by the relaxation of the ciliary muscle, 
which by flattening the lens or permitting it to assume 
its normal rotundity gives the adjustment necessary for 
obtaining a clear image upon the retina. The convergence 
takes place through a relaxation of the external recti 
muscles and contraction of the internal, or vice versa, if the 
new object is at a greater distance than the one just looked 
at, until the image falls upon the centre of each retina. 
It can easily be seen from introspection that these ad- 
justments follow the attention in order of time. If while 
reading a book there is a sudden desire to learn the time 
of day, it will be noticed that remembered images of the 
clock come into consciousness before the movement begins, 
and that there is a considerable interval between the in- 
stant that the eyes are adjusted upon the clock before the 
accommodation is complete and the image is distinct enough 
to permit of telling the hour. All of these movements 
are reflexes of the attention. The only condition for their 
occurrence is that an object catches the attention, and 
as soon as it attracts the attention the movement which 
is necessary to give the most favourable condition for 
its entrance follows at once. As you look out of the win-
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  14 Attention 
dow, the direction of the line of sight, the accommodation 
of the lens, and the convergence, change constantly and 
spontaneously as, one after another, the objects in the 
landscape attract you. If a moving wagon come into 
the field at a distance from you and from the object at 
which you are looking, it will at once catch the attention, 
and immediately the complex series of movements that 
result in bringing it into the best relations for clear vision 
will begin.. So close is this connection that there is no 
other way in which it can be brought about except through 
the attention. If the photographer should ask you to 
lower the eyes thirty degrees below the horizontal plane, 
and turn them twenty degrees to the left of the median 
plane, with the eyes focussed and converged upon an 
object at a distance of forty feet, you would have great 
difficulty in carrying out his directions, and could do it 
then only by selecting one object after another in the field 
of vision and deciding which one fulfilled the conditions 
most closely. When, however, he asks you to look at 
some object that he places before you, you can do it at 
once without the least difficulty, and almost without know- 
ing how the movements are brought about. 
The mechanism is purely reflex, but of a high degree 
of complexity. When the object attracts attention, the 
nature of the double images which it casts upon the 
two retinas, the size of its retinal image in comparison 
with its known real size, and other similar marks of dis- 
tance, combine to form a stimulus which produces an ex- 
citation of the oculo-motor and ciliary nerves, and these 
in turn bring about the proper adjustment. The effect 
of the attention is merely to choose and emphasize one of 
the many sets of stimuli which are all ready to determine 
the movements in one way or the other. Similarly each 
object that affects the retina seems to exert a reflex influence 
which tends to turn the eyes so that the object will fall 
upon the point of clearest vision. Each impression is a 
stimulus for both sets of movements at the same time,
-P-A-G-E-25
  
The Motor Concomitants of Attention 15 
So strong is this physiological tendency to look at the 
object attended to, that it is only with the greatest diffi- 
culty that one can attend to one object and have the eyes 
directed to another, and even when successful there seems 
to be a divided atténtion between the object mainly at- 
tended to and the object upon which the eyes are fixed. 
The difficulty of attending to an object without turning 
the eyes upon it can be seen clearly if one studies some 
imperfection of the media of the eye, which is a little to 
one side of the line of sight. Unconsciously, and in spite 
of the fact that the movement is of not the slightest value 
in aiding observation, there is a turning of the eyes towards 
the object, and as that movement carries the imperfection 
with it, there is still another movement, until the object 
has been followed through the limits of rotation of the 
eye. These vain movements in search of the will-o’-the- 
wisp imperfection will result as often as the eye is brought 
back to the central position and the attempt to observe 
the imperfection is continued. There is no change by the 
degree of practice that one can obtain in ordinary experi- 
ments. 
Heinrich has shown that there is not only a special 
adjustment for each object in the field of vision, but that 
| there is also a characteristic attitude for cases of strained 
attention to impressions from other senses and for atten- 
tion to remembered impressions. In the latter case the 
lens is flattened and the axes of the eyes are parallel, as 
in looking at distant objects, and in some cases he tells 
us that the adjustment for distant objects may be exceeded, 
so that the lens becomes even flatter than for seeing ob- 
jects on the horizon, and the eyes actually diverge instead 
of converge. There is also under these circumstances a 
marked dilation of the pupil. In attending to impressions 
from other sense organs the eyes are adjusted to receive 
the same impression even if it is dark, or there is some other 
condition which prevents the object from being seen. An 
excellent instance of this can be obtained by watching a
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 ‘Attention 
man trying to attend to two tuning forks held one before 
each ear. As the attention turns from fork to fork there 
is an accompanying movement of the eyes from side to 
side in the most striking manner, in spite of the fact that 
the forks are held in such a position that it is impossible 
to see either. 
How far there may be an analogous adaptation of the ear 
in hearing it is difficult to say. It has been suggested that 
the tensor tympani—the muscle attached to the malleus, 
through which it can exert a tension upon the drum of the 
ear—might be of influence in adjusting the drum to tones 
of different pitch. That it plays some part in the hearing 
process is made evident by the fact that it degenerates 
when the auditory nerve is destroyed. Opinion as to 
whether its function is a tuning of the drum is still divided. 
Experiments of Ostmann [** 3] make it probable that the 
function is merely to protect the ear from very intense and 
very highsounds. He found that the muscle was contracted 
only during very intense and very complicated noises. 
Pure tones, no matter how high or how intense, seemed to 
have but very slight effects. Heinrich, on the other hand, 
has convinced himself by recent experiments that the 
muscle has a definite influence in accommodating the tym- 
panum to receive noises even of moderate intensities. [°] 
Evidently, then, it is still a matter of doubt as to the exact 
part that this muscle plays in preparing the ear for hearing. 
Whatever it may be, however, the movement is undoubt- 
edly of a reflex character, and follows the turning of the 
attention to a particular tonal element. There is no agree- 
ment as to what may be the action of the other small muscle, 
the stapedius, which might also have a part in adjusting 
the auditory mechanism. 
There are certainly definite adjustments for touch. As 
the question whether a surface is rough or smooth, hot 
or cold, comes into mind there is a movement of the 
fingers toward the surface, if it is within reach. This move- 
ment takes place almost as reflexly and with as little con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  The Motor Concomitants of Attention 17 
scious intention as do the movements of the eyes., In the 
blind, who are largely dependent on touch for their know- 
ledge as a whole, movements of contraction and relaxation 
of the finger tips have been noticed as the accompaniments 
of the attentive examination of any surface. These are 
of great value in giving an idea of the form and nature of 
the surface. A moving finger will notice differences which 
would be entirely unobserved by one at rest. 
Smell, too, has its reflex adaptive movements. It will 
be noticed that one carefully testing any substance by its 
odour will take long breaths almost involuntarily. They 
are the direct result of the desire to attain certainty of the 
nature of the substance, and not due to any distinct inten- 
tion of the man making the test. This reflex can probably 
be observed to best advantage in the lower animals, who 
depend upon smell most completely for their protection 
and food, but it is undoubtedly present to a large extent 
in man as well. 
In much the same way a substance to be tasted is rolled 
over the tongue and pressed against the roof of the mouth 
in an endeavour to bring it as completely as possible in 
contact with the tongue. This movement is also accom- 
panied by movements of the lips and the external facial 
muscles, which probably play little or no part in making 
the tasting more accurate, but are merely survivals of asso- 
ciated movements. They indicate to the observer that 
close attention is being given to the sensations of taste. 
Estimates of weight are also accompanied by a number 
of slight lifting movements, which serve to bring into play 
the more delicate sensory endings of muscle and tendon 
in addition to the sensory endings of the skin. They thus 
bring about the same increase in the accuracy of the com- 
parison as accommodation in vision, and in so far are to 
be put into the same category. 
In all but the strictly organic senses, then, there are 
movements that serve to adjust the organ to give the im- 
pression its greatest effect in consciousness.) These move- 
c
-P-A-G-E-28
    18 Attention 
ments are all initiated as a result of attending, and many, 
if not all, of the movements can be made in no other way 
than by attending to some stimulus. It must also be 
emphasised that the movements are not made as the result 
of a distinct purpose, but come as an unforeseen accompani- 
ment of the attending itself. Another point which it may 
be well to emphasise because of its bearing on a theory to 
be discussed later, is that the movements seem in every 
case to follow the attention and never to initiate it. 
II. The second series of bodily movements which accom- 
pany the attention process is unlike the preceding, in that 
they have no influence upon the efficiency of the attention, 
and have little or nothing to do with the sense organs 
involved, but they are like them in that the nature} and 
direction of the movements depend upon the object which 
is attended to and the degree of the attention. These move- — 
ments consist of changes in the position of the limbs, of | 
the general posture of the body, and of changes in the — 
conditions of contraction and relaxation of the voluntary 
muscles generally. It has been very clearly demonstrated 
that every act of the attention is accompanied by a move- 
ment which is different enough to mark that particular 
act of the attention off from every other. Popularly, 
this is perhaps best shown by some of the parlour mind- 
reading games. A very common instance is that in which 
some member of the party volunteers to leave the room 
while the others choose some object, and then will tell 
what object has been chosen if those present will only 
keep their minds upon it continuously. If you will watch 
carefully a company as it “ thinks,” you will notice that 
there are frequent furtive glances of all the members to- 
ward the object, that hands unconsciously drift toward it, 
and the position of the body as a whole in some cases be- 
comes a tell-tale of the object. These movements, to- 
gether with the awed hush whenever the object is ap- 
proached, and the slight exclamations when the wrong 
direction is taken, are a sufficient guide to the seeker as   
/
-P-A-G-E-29
  The Motor Concomitants of Attention 19 
to the whereabouts of the desired object. Often the per- 
son who takes advantage of these movements is as uncon- 
scious as the persons who give him the hints as to the nature 
of the guidance, or that there has been any guidance of 
this kind at all. His usual statement is that he merely 
felt that he was right, but could not say in what the feeling 
consisted. He is just as sure that he has received no assist- 
ance of this simple kind from the spectators as the other 
members of the company are that they have given none. 
What has happened is that he has unconsciously inferred his 
goal from a number of slight separate indications, no one 
of which is noticed in itself, but which together are con- 
vincing. 
A more extended and complicated use of this fact, that 
the movements are directed as well as called out by the 
attention, is to be found in the professional exhibitions of 
mind, or more properly muscle, reading which are given in 
many parts of the world. Nearly all of the feats of the 
well-known mind readers are to be explained as shrewd 
inferences from slight movements of this kind to the mental 
states which must have been present to occasion them. 
In many cases the person whose mind is being read and the 
person who reads it are equally ignorant of the way in 
which the information is given or received, but the fact 
that even the most skilful operators insist upon receiving 
the ‘“‘spirit influence”? by direct physical contact is suffi- 
cient to raise a suspicion that there is some transfer of 
mechanical impressions. When a performer opens a safe 
blindfolded while holding the hand of the owner, who knows 
the combination, he is undoubtedly directed when to stop 
by involuntary movements of the owner, for whom the 
sight of certain figures under the pointer had been for 
years the signal to turn backward or to stop. There are 
similar movements in large number which accompany 
every other act of the attention, and even mental pro- 
cesses not so closely connected with the senses. 
Scientific experiments made by Professors Sommer, W. Jas-
-P-A-G-E-30
20 Attention 
trow, and others, confirm the statement that there is an 
actual movement of the hand that corresponds to the 
nature and direction of the attention. They have devised 
apparatus that records on smoked paper all the move- 
ments of the members, and enables them to compare the 
records with the nature of the mental processes that were 
going on at the time. Extended experiments show that 
there is a very close connection between the movements 
and the direction of the attention. If the subject looked 
attentively at an object in any direction there was at once 
a movement of the hand toward that object. When lis- 
tening to a man walking across the floor behind him the 
hand would swing backward and forward in time with the 
movements of the walking, and also usually tend back- 
ward in the direction that he had from the subject. While 
watching the swing of a pendulum there is a rhythmic swing 
back and forth in time with the pendulum. 
A more striking illustration of the same fact is offered 
by the movements of a crowd in watching any game or 
contest that involves movement. If you have ever stood 
upon the side lines during an exciting football contest, you 
will have noticed the marked tendency of the whole mass 
of observers to follow the movements of the players with 
their bodies. In some moments of excitement the entire 
body will move forward in complete unconsciousness of 
the fact that any movement is being made until it is very 
difficult for the individuals to regain their equilibrium, 
and in most cases the whole crowd will have changed its 
position very considerably without being conscious that 
a step has been taken. 
It is evident from these results that every act of attend- 
ing is accompanied by movements of some kind that are 
of a nature related to the position of the object attended 
to, and in some cases to its nature and intensity. It would 
be possible to cite innumerable other cases, but these seem 
sufficient to confirm the statement. 
III. The third class of movements are neither useful nor
-P-A-G-E-31
  The Motor Concomzitants of Attentcon or 
symbolic; they do not make the attention more effective 
so far as can be seen, and do not vary with the changes 
in the object attended to or with its direction from the 
observer. These it seems simplest to regard as mere over- 
flow phenomena, and to think of them as due to a spread 
of nervous energy from the centres of the brain involved 
in attention along the paths of least resistance to the various 
motor centres. They are analogous in their origin to the 
diffused motor excitations which come out during strenu- 
ous physical exertion. It will be noticed when lifting a 
heavy weight, for instance, that in addition to the muscles 
directly involved, there are a number of apparently unre- 
lated muscles in a state of contraction. Careful observa- 
tion will show that the teeth are firmly set, the forehead 
is wrinkled, and the body as a whole is braced for the effort. 
The motor impulse seems to spread from the nerve centres 
directly involved to others only remotely connected. In 
attention exactly the same process goes on, and much the 
same muscles are affected. One who is studying intently 
has a wrinkled brow, and in extreme cases the hand may be 
clenched and the greater number of the voluntary muscles 
be in a state of contraction. In addition to its general 
excitatory effect, attention seems to have a tendency to 
inhibit movements in general. One who becomes suddenly 
interested in a train of thought or line of argument with 
a companion will frequently stop and stand still until his 
interest is decreased. A woman engaged in knitting or 
some other mechanical task while listening to a conversa- 
tion or lecture will suddenly stop as she becomes interested 
in what is being said, to resume again when some less en- 
grossing subject is reached. It is possible and usual to 
measure the attention of an assemblage by the quiet of 
the room. When the programme is uninteresting there 
is always the noise of rustling garments, of books and pro- 
grammes in motion, and the other accompaniments of 
slight movements. When the audience is interested all 
these movements are inhibited, and there is quiet. This
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 Attention 
inhibitory effect of attention can hardly be classed as pur- 
poseless, but it belongs in this group because due to im- 
mediate overflow effects which vary only with the degree of 
the attention, and not at all with its nature or direction. 
This entire series of immediate overflow effects is accom- 
panied by a consciousness of strain, which in part serves 
us as a subjective measure of the degree of attention. It 
is one of the most marked conscious concomitants of the 
attention. Its function must be discussed in a later 
chapter. 
IV. No less widespread, and equally important from the 
theoretical standpoint, are the changes of the involuntary 
and partially voluntary activities of the body during at- 
tention, which have been brought together for considera- 
tion under the fourth head. There is no process concerned 
in circulation or respiration that is not profoundly modified 
when attention is prolonged or intense. Much ingenuity 
has been spent by many investigators in devising appara- 
tus to record the various movements, and in collecting and 
interpreting the data obtained. We must omit all men- 
tion of mechanical methods, and devote ourselves to the 
main results that have been so far established. 
We may for convenience divide the phenomena connected 
with circulation into three groups: the pulse rate, the 
tonic condition of the arterial walls (vaso-motor phenom- 
ena), and blood pressure. The latter undoubtedly de- 
pends in part upon the two former, but as there is also 
involved the strength of heart-beat, we must treat it 
separately. 
There are two ways of studying the rate of the pulse. 
The simplest is merely to count the number of beats in 
the minute during a resting condition, and again when 
the subject is attentive. A comparison of the two will 
give a rough measure of the change due to the attention. 
The more delicate method involves recording the separate 
pulse-beats upon a revolving drum or other moving sur- 
face. After the record is made the length of each pulse- 
   
-P-A-G-E-33
  The Motor Concomitants of Attention 28 
beat may be measured and a curve plotted from the results 
that will show the changes during the periods in question. 
The first method shows roughly that the heart rate is con- 
siderably quickened during attention. The second method 
shows that the rate is nearly always changed, but there 
is no very definite rule as to the direction of the change. 
Often the first change is compensated for by a second in 
the opposite direction. In general, we may say that any 
activity of the attention is accompanied by a slowing of 
the pulse rate, followed by a more prolonged acceleration. 
The effect upon the muscles in the walls of the blood- 
vessels is even more marked. It is known that the walls 
of the arteries contain smooth muscle tissues, which are 
connected through the sympathetic system with a centre 
in the medulla. It has been shown by experiments that 
nearly every mental process is reflected in the condition 
of contraction or relaxation of these muscles. The atten- 
tion forms no exception to this rule. Every act of the 
attention of any considerable degree or intensity, or of 
appreciable duration, is accompanied by a contraction 
of the arteries and a consequent diminution of the volume 
of the members. This contraction seems to increase con- 
tinuously throughout the entire time that attention is 
strongly active, even when that period may cover half an 
hour or more, and recovery is quite slow. 
This question takes two different forms as we consider 
different parts of the body. The effect upon the volume 
of the brain is probably not the same as that upon the 
capillaries of the limbs. Mosso and Patrizi, who have 
studied the changes in the volume of the brain upon indi- 
viduals suffering from injuries to the skull, have found that 
during the process of attention there is an increase in the 
volume of the brain and a dilatation of its capillaries as 
opposed to the constriction of the vessels of the limbs. 
This was shown both by directly recording the changes 
in volume on individuals whose cerebral cavity had been 
brought into connection with the outside air through 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
24 Attention 
  some injury, and also by balancing the person to be ex- 
perimented upon on a delicately adjusted board and noting 
the change in balance as the blood rushed to the head in 
prolonged attention. There is also as an accompaniment 
of the increasing blood supply a rise in the temperature of 
the brain. Tracings taken at the same time from the 
arm and leg would show a contraction of the blood-vessels, 
if any change was noticed at all. As we have seen, there 
is in normal individuals a decrease in the volume in nearly 
every case if the attention be of sufficient degree. There 
has been some discussion among the different investigators 
as to whether the effect upon the circulation of the brain 
were direct or merely an acompaniment of the decrease 
in the volume of the peripheral vessels, and there is as yet 
no general agreement upon this point, in spite of the tracings 
of Mosso, which show that the volumes of the arm, the leg, 
and the brain may change independently of each other. 
Measurements of blood pressure are not so numerous 
as those of changes in volume and in heart rate, but the 
results so far obtained are quite constant, and show that 
during attention there is a marked increase in the pressure 
in the peripheral vessels. The change in blood pressure 
is probably in part the result of the contraction of the 
arteries and in part due to the increase in frequency of 
heart-beat, but there is also probably a change in the 
strength of heart-beat that adds to the total effect. 
The changes in the respiratory processes during atten- 
tion are perhaps the most decided of all. They are cer- 
tainly most evident to the casual observer. It can be 
noticed without special means of observation that the 
breath is held or considerably checked during strained at- 
tention, and it is to this fact that we owe the phrase “ breath- 
less attention.” The period of checked respiration is 
always followed by a very deep breath—the sigh that is 
so frequently noticed as relief from prolonged attention. 
Records taken of movements of the chest wall confirm and 
extend common observation. During attention the respira-
-P-A-G-E-35
  The Motor Concomitants of Attention 25 
tory movements are considerably more frequent, and are 
also much shallower, than in normal breathing, and are 
followed for a considerable period by deep and slow respira- 
tion. 
All of the changes are probably the result of overflows 
of the nervous processes in the cerebrum that are, involved 
in the attention process upon the medullary centres, and 
through them upon the particular mechanisms involved. 
The question of their utility in the attention process must 
be discussed later. 
As a whole then it seems that the physiological effects 
of the attention are as widespread as they well could be. 
There seems to be no muscle in any part of the body that 
may not be affected in some degree by a sufficiently strong 
attention process. There is at the time a motor disturb- 
ance that extends through the entire nervous system. 
It is no wonder then that the physiological aspects of the 
problem have attracted so much notice, and have been 
given such an important place by the theorists, although 
we must postpone a discussion of the problem of the place 
of these movements in the general theory to a later time. 
SUMMARY 
Attention to any stimulus is accompanied by widespread 
motor phenomena. 
1. The muscles of sense organs contract to give the 
greatest possible effect to the stimulus. 
2. The voluntary muscles of limbs and trunk undergo 
contractions that have previously been found useful under 
stimulations of the same kind. 
3. There is a diffuse contraction of many voluntury 
muscles without reference to the nature of the stimulus. 
4. The respiratory and circulatory processes are pro- 
foundly affected. 
5. The bodily processes succeed, or at most accompany, 
the attention. They do not precede it.

  CHAPTER III 
THE CONDITIONS OF ATTENTION 
EFORE we can attempt any theory of the attention, 
or even any more extended treatment of the effects 
of attention in consciousness, it seems well to give an un- 
prejudiced statement of the conditions under which attend- 
ing takes place. By condition in this connection we mean 
not so much to imply a final cause as merely to enumerate 
the antecedent and concomitant states of consciousness, 
and to select those which seem more than accidental to 
the state of attention. In order to obtain a complete list 
of the relevant processes we shall have recourse in part to 
introspection, in larger part to conditions which have been 
enumerated by others, and in part to experimental results. 
It is hoped that by collecting all the conditions that have 
been suggested it will be possible by eliminating and com- 
bining them to obtain a more complete list than would be 
possible in any other way, and also to prepare the way for 
an adequate theory of the processes involved much better 
than if the theory were constructed for itself with reference 
to but one aspect of the problem. 
We shall not attempt to discuss the physiological pro- 
cesses in this chapter, but shall confine ourselves entirely 
to the conscious states. While the results of the different 
theories that have been offered will undoubtedly modify 
the statement of the conditions, there will be no specific 
mention of theories in the chapter. All that must come 
later, when we can utilise the material which is to be gathered 
here. The present chapter then must be looked upon merely 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  The Conditions of Attention 27 
as a collection of facts, not in any sense as a theory of the 
attention. Its purpose will have been fulfilled if we can 
state under what conditions one is likely to attend to a 
particular event, and do not here concern ourselves to dis- 
cover the reason for the conditions. 
In order fully to comply with the ideal we have set, it 
may be well to mention that all the physiological changes 
mentioned in the last chapter have by some authors been 
regarded as among the conditions of the attention, if 
not as the conditions. If we accepted that theory it 
would be well to combine both chapters under the one 
heading. But as the facts are also susceptible of a 
different treatment, and one that we believe to be truer, 
we shall pass them over for the time being with this mere 
reference. 
We may roughly divide the conditions of the attention 
into two great classes—the subjective and the objective. 
The line is not always sharply drawn. One class gradually 
shades off into the other, and there is a border-land of 
considerable extent in which the processes may be brought, 
now under one head, now under the other, as you change 
the point of view. The classification will serve fairly well 
for practical purposes, however, and it is not difficult to 
point out the reasons for the divergencies when the phe- 
nomena are not to be assigned with certainty to any one 
class. 
In a general way we may define the objective conditions 
as those qualities which belong to the entering sensation 
alone, regarded in isolation from the environment in which 
it was received; or in the rough, those characteristics 
which depend upon the nature of the external world at 
the time. (Those conditions which depend upon impres- 
sions received through the senses, retained in some way 
to be again active at a later time, we may call subjective. 
We may say, if we care to, that they depend upon the 
nature of the mind at the time ; but as we can know what 
the nature of the mind is only from the impressions which  
-P-A-G-E-38
  Attention 
  have affected it at some earlier time, or from the different ways 
in which it responds at the present time, it is more con- 
venient and truer to the limits of our knowledge to say that the 
subjective conditions consist of the earlier impressions that 
the individual has been subjected to, including, of course, 
the influences that have affected the ancestors and have 
given the individual in question his hereditary bent. They 
include what Professor Huxley calls the nature and nurture 
of the individual. It is the group of hereditary tendencies 
which offers the most difficulties in the way of classifica- 
tion. Here where the tendencies are common to many 
individuals, it is very difficult to say how much belongs 
to the stimulus and how much is due to the common here- 
dity of mankind. The details of the difficulty may be 
postponed for the present. 
The most important of the objective conditions is prob- 
ably the intensity of the sensation. A loud noise, a very 
intense odour, or a brilliant light will force their way into 
consciousness in spite of all the subjective forces which 
may attempt to oppose them. Hegel in the Napoleonic 
wars, and Archimedes at the taking of Syracuse, are the 
exceptions which prove the rule. Ordinarily if a cannon 
is fired under your window, or a bright light is thrown 
into your eyes, there is immediate attention given to it, 
no matter what the incentives may be to hold the atten- 
tion upon the duty of the moment. The effect seems to 
depend entirely upon the brute force of the stimulus and 
as little as may be upon the nature of the organism at the 
time. 
However, it is not the mere intensity of the stimulus 
which is effective in attracting the attention, so much as 
it is the change in its intensity. The noise of the train 
upon which we are riding passes unnoticed after a short 
interval, while the whirl of the train which passes on the 
parallel line, although it does not add very greatly to the 
din, will be noticed at once. The lighting of a candle in 
a dark room has vastly more power to attract us than the

continuous glare of the sun to which we have been long 
exposed. And other instances could be cited indefinitely. 
Not only is a positive change an important condition of 
the attention, but a negative change as well will have the 
same general effect in attracting the attention. The miller 
who has become entirely unconscious of the noise which his 
mill makes is at once aroused by its stopping. A lull in 
the conversation in the adjoining room is more effective 
in rousing one from work than doubling the intensity of 
the tones. This is very well illustrated by the sudden stop- 
ping of the clock on your desk. Its ticking may have 
been entirely unnoticed up to the moment it stops, but 
with the stopping there comes at once not only the know- 
ledge that it has stopped, but the last ticks are distinctly 
heard. Sounds are heard that would have passed entirely 
unnoticed if they had not ceased, and they are not heard 
until they fail to be followed by others in the regular rhythm. 
Of the same nature are the explanations of the frequent ! 
stories of men who go to sleep in battle from excessive 
fatigue and are awakened by the cessation of the firing. It 
is also a very common experience for one who has gone to 
sleep on a moving railway train to be awakened by the stop- 
ping of the train, or for the passengers on a boat to be dis- 
turbed by the quiet that follows the slowing or stopping of 
the propeller. In general then it seems that it is not so 
much the intensity of the sensation as it is the change in 
the intensity which is effective in calling the attention. 
Dr. Knight Dunlap found that if a faint noise from a 
telephone receiver be interrupted, it would be noticed, when 
the constant tone itself would not be perceived. In fact 
one is more likely to notice the disappearance of a tone 
than its appearance. It is possible for a tone to begin and 
to remain unnoticed until it ceases, and then to become 
noticed for the first time. 
There is also evidence of a summation effect when several 
successive stimuli, each too slight in itself to attract the 
attention, act upon a man. If, for instance, you desire to 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 Attention 
attract the attention of a man absorbed in some occupa- 
tion, it will be found that while he will not hear his name 
the first time it is called, he will be aroused from his work 
if the same sound is repeated several times at the same 
intensity. We have an analogous phenomenon in the so- 
called “staircase’’ phenomenon of muscle-nerve physio- 
logy. If a stimulus be repeatedly applied to a muscle- 
nerve preparation, the earlier contractions are seen to be 
considerably smaller than the later, and for many stimu- 
lations each contraction is greater than the preceding. 
Another factor of importance is the (rate of change 
in the intensity. A sudden change is much more effective 
than a gradual one, no matter in which direction it takes 
place. This seems to be a general law of nervous excita- 
bility. Preyer succeeded in destroying the life of a brain- 
less frog, without producing the slightest reaction, by in- 
creasing the temperature of the water by very slow degrees. 
Professor Stratton, Dr. Stern, and Dr. Goldscheider have 
shown in various sense departments that it is very much 
easier within wide limits to detect a rapid change of inten- 
sity than a slight one. 
Another objective factor which is very closely related 
to intensity in this connection as in most others is exten- 
sity for sight and touch. A large object is more likely to 
attract the attention than a small one, other things being 
equal. A large object in the field of vision is noticed if 
there be nothing else about that is particularly noteworthy. 
A tall man, a high building, a large expanse of meadow, 
will each scarcely escape notice when in the field of view, 
while smaller objects no more striking for themselves will 
be overlooked under the same circumstances. This is 
almost the universal rule in vision, although here again 
there is a large part played by contrast just as there was 
by change in intensity. A comparatively large object 
among many small ones affects us as much as a very large 
among medium-sized. It makes no difference what the 
object may be. 
   
-P-A-G-E-41
  The Conditions of Attention 31 
There is apparently an exception to the rule in the tac- 
tual sensations where a small object is the more startling. 
A pin-prick will attract one when an equally intense pres- 
sure from a large blunt “object would pass almost unnoticed. 
This is an exception which can very evidently be explained 
on evolutionary grounds. A large object in contact with 
the body means on the average, a support and a source of 
benefit rather than of danger, while a small object is 
very likely to injure the skin and may prove disastrous. 
It was therefore necessary if the animal were to survive 
that the small object be attended to and avoided, while 
attention to the broad surface was largely a matter of in- 
difference. 
Change is as important in attracting the attention in 
extensity as in intensity. When an object in the field of 
vision suddenly changes in size attention is at once drawn. 
The same thing is true for touch. It need not be considered 
at any length, however, for change in size in every day 
life is a comparatively infrequent phenomenon. 
The effect of duration upon attention is very hard to 
state. Up to a certain point increase in duration has the 
same effect as increase in intensity, and serves to call atten- 
tion to the stimulus. Weak stimuli of short duration 
will pass unnoticed, while if long persistent they may come 
to consciousness. On the other hand, a considerable dura- 
tion even of comparatively intense sensations blunts the 
sense organs and makes it easy to distract the attention 
from them. There has been no determination of the 
limits within which duration is a favourable condition, 
or of the time at which it becomes unfavourable. We can 
only make the statement, based entirely upon rough ob- 
servation, that moderate duration is favourable, prolonged 
stimulation unfavourable, to attention. 
These complete the list of objective conditions favour- 
able to attention. It might be possible to include in the 
list such factors as newness and variety of stimulation, 
the presence of contours, and the effect of movement, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    32 Attention 
as all of these can be shown to depend for their efficiency 
upon inherited or acquired modifications of consciousness, 
they can best be treated under the head of the subjective 
conditions. Their explanation is to be found in the past 
history of consciousness, not in the present nature of 
the nervous system. It is only their widespread appear- 
ance that makes them seem to fall within the class of 
objective conditions. 
A study of the subjective conditions offers more 
difficulties, because it is not so easy to interpret the results. 
We cannot say at once what the conditions are here that 
make a given object stand out. We can only say that 
certain objects do attract the attention, and then study 
the previous circumstances in the life history of the indi- 
vidual which brings about that result. We can in this 
chapter merely enumerate the objects that are interest- 
ing, and give the results of as many investigations as pos- 
sible that serve to explain the interest which attaches to 
them. The group of subjective conditions must be treated 
abstractly and in masses rather than concretely in terms 
of specific instances, because there are too many different 
groups and too many details in the phenomena to make it 
feasible to give anything more than typical illustrations 
of the nature of the effects. 
One of the most satisfactory ways of studying many of 
the phenomena of the attention is by means of a simple 
stereoscope. If you replace the pictures of the ordinary 
parlour instrument by a card having upon one side a square 
of red paper, upon the other a square of green, and adjust 
them so that each square entirely fills one half of the field 
of vision, it will be found that there will be a constant 
fluctuation from one colour to the other, and neither will 
be seen all the time. As you have two fields in themselves 
equally likely to attract attention, and neither with any 
advantage of position, the triumph of one or the other 
must depend upon the attitude of the mind toward it, 
upon the subjective conditions. Unfortunately, from the  
-P-A-G-E-43
  The Conditions of Attention 33 
standpoint of the experiment, there tends to enter a regu- 
lar alternation between the two fields, so that the imme- 
diate effect of determining to attend to one or the other 
is very slight. However, subjective conditions decide 
which colour shall be seen first, and in so far the method 
throws some light upon our problem. One of the deter- 
mining factors is the idea which is in mind at the time 
the cards are first presented. If you expect to see the red, 
and have a distinct memory image of the red, you will see 
it first, and will continue to see it until fatigue for that 
process sets in, when the green will supplant it. This 
alternation will then continue at regular intervals, and at 
a rate which depends upon the nature of the general stim- 
ulation, as long as the instrument is held before the eye. 
The general explanation of the alternations must be left 
over to a later chapter. We are concerned with them now 
only as a means of studying the conditions under which 
one colour is preferred to another. Other factors may be 
studied by this method on the assumption that the object 
favoured in any way will persist longer than those not so 
favoured. It is only necessary to compare the times that each 
colour holds the field, as conditions are varied, to determine 
the relative strength of the different influences at work. 
So Dr. Breese [?] found that if you draw straight lines upon 
each coloured field, and count the lines upon the one colour, 
you will keep its image more continuously before the mind, 
and also make it persist a considerably longer period 
than the other. That the memory image will be more 
easily kept in consciousness under these conditions is due 
to the earlier experience of the individual in a way that will 
be discussed in chapter vii. 
Another instance of the importance of the idea in mind 
just before the stimulus to be attended to is given by Helm- 
holtz. [5] In determining the part played by eye move- 
ments in the perception of depth, Helmholtz had occasion 
to make a number of experiments on the influence of suc- 
cessive illuminations of the field of vision by the electric 
D  
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 Attention 
spark. The two halves of an ordinary stereoscopic view 
were placed on the wall of a dark box, with their centres 
separated by a distance equal to the distance between the 
eyes. The centres of the cards were pierced to admit a 
light just strong enough to permit the centre of each pic- 
ture to be fixated by the eyes with axes parallel. By this 
arrangement the two halves of the picture were united in 
such a way that the same effect was produced as by the 
stereoscope ordinarily used. The spark lasted far too 
short a time to permit of eye movements, or of seeing the 
whole picture during any one illumination. Helmholtz 
found under these circumstances that he could at will fix 
upon any one part of the field of vision, and make that 
part stand out in clear relief. The selection was accom- 
plished, he says, by picturing to himself the part of the 
field of vision which he desired to see. This is the more 
striking from the fact mentioned above that it was impossible 
to bring any one part into a more favourable position of the 
field by moving the eyes, for any eye movement would 
have disturbed the stereoscopic vision and have shown all 
the objects in double images. The process of turning the 
attention to any one part of the field consisted of nothing 
else than having in mind before the spark came a memory 
image of that part. When the flash came the part imagined 
stood out predominant in consciousness, and impressions 
were received from it alone. 
Another important discovery in the same experiment 
was that what was seen during one exposure helped in the | 
perception of the next impression. At first only a very 
imperfect image of any part is received. With each suc- 
ceeding spark a greater amount of detail is perceived, until 
a clear image of that region is obtained. Here the explana- 
tion is that each image calls up by association some con- 
nected image, and if that really is present it is seen dis- 
tinctly because of the aid from the image already in mind ; 
and if the suggestion was not fortunate it is excluded from 
the next preparatory image, and a second and perhaps  
-P-A-G-E-45
  The Conditions of Attention 35 
more fortunate possibility succeeds, to be confirmed or 
rejected by the next glance. Both the attention to the 
object and its interpretation are facilitated by the idea in 
the mind at the instant the impression is received. 
Another classical example of the influence of ideas in the 
mind at the time upon other ideas that are just entering 
is seen in “hearing out’ overtones. It has been found that 
if the sounding of a complex note is preceded by sounding 
alone the overtone it is desired to hear, it is very much 
easier to assure oneself of its presence than if the tone 
is not sounded. It seems to be essential to hearing the 
overtone at all that there be an image of the tone to be heard 
in mind, and Stumpf suggests that the greater success of 
musicians over ordinary persons in hearing these tones is 
due to the fact that they have in mind a greater number of 
remembered tones, and when listening can more easily 
call up the image of the tone desired. They do not escape 
the general requirement for accurate listening, but are 
able to satisfy it much more readily and certainly. 
Picking out the separate tones of the different instru- 
ments in an orchestra follows very much the same laws. 
If you have in mind the visual picture of the instrument 
which you are listening for, it is more easily detected than 
if there is no such aid. Looking at the instrument will 
also have the same effect. Probably in this case too the 
visual impression helps mainly because it calls up the tone 
of the instrument by association. For it is certain that 
having a memory of the tone is more effective than the 
mere visual impression. 
“We might extend the illustrations to each of the other 
senses. As you .think of an itching sensation on any part 
of the skin you bring out impressions before unnoticed, 
which may become disagreeable in their intensity, and, 
apparently, they owe their origin entirely to having held 
the expected sensation in mind for a considerable period 
of time. It is possible that the tactual impression is compli- 
cated by the vaso-motor changes which attention induces,  
-P-A-G-E-46
36 Altteniton 
and that the impression is actually produced by attend- 
ing rather than that a sensation already present is brought 
into clearer consciousness. But making all allowances, there 
is a large part of the experience, particularly that which 
comes early, which is due merely to the reinforcing influ- 
ence of the idea upon the senscry stimulus which is ready 
to come in. In taste and smell we could find cases that 
would illustrate the same point, but there are none striking 
enough to warrant special mention. 
Everyday life offers very many instances of the same 
principle. It is much easier to see any lost article if you 
have a definite picture of what is sought. In fact, search- 
ing for anything consists ordinarily of nothing more than 
walking about the place where the object is supposed to 
be, with the idea f the object kept prominently in mind, 
and thereby standing ready to facilitate the entrance of 
the perception when it offers itself. It is for that reason 
too that it is much easier to find an object again after finding 
it once, because you can look with a more definite image 
and can apply it more accurately to the right place in the 
environment. 
All these instances, then, go to show that one of the im- 
portant conditions of attending to an object is to have in 
mind at the time it is received an image of the object, and 
they seem sufficient in number and diversity to entitle 
the principle to rank as a general condition of the atten- 
tion. Given any idea in mind and a corresponding im- 
pression offered to the senses, that impression will be pre- 
ferred over the others. [°] 
Not only do ideas that are actually present in conscious- 
ness at the moment have an influence in determining 
what impressions shall become conscious, but other experi- 
ences, which are much more remote in time and not in 
consciousness at the moment, also play a part. We can 
trace these other conditions backward in time, and as they 
become farther distant they also become more general and 
are harder to trace as individual influences because combined 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  The Conditions of Attention 37 
with others in a total complex. We shall roughly endea- 
vour to classify them in point of remoteness and generality, 
and again give illustrations of the effect of each class. Many 
of these influences do not affect the single act of the atten- 
tion immediately, but only indirectly through their influ- 
ence upon less remote conditions. Still they must all 
be considered to be conditions, for if they had not existed 
this particular mental process would not have taken the 
form which it did. For instance, many of the factors 
which we must consider are effective in determining what 
idea shall be in mind at the moment of perception, but 
through that they will also have an important influence 
in determining the direction of the attention. To be com- 
pelled to stop our explanation with the statement that 
the idea in mind at the moment would determine the next 
idea to be received, and not be able to give the conditions 
for that idea, would be no explanation at all. These lat- 
ter conditions then might be looked at as merely condi- 
tions for tracing back the train of conditions to an ever- 
increasing remoteness. In many cases, however, these 
more remote influences seem to act immediately, and not 
through an idea. In such cases the attention attaches 
not to some impression that is in mind, but to something 
entirely different or only remotely connected with the 
idea most prominent at the instant. At these times atten- 
tion seems spontaneous, as there is no foreshadowing of 
the object attended to. 
The most important of these more remote conditions 
is the general mood of the moment—the attitude toward 
the world in general that the individual has at that time. 
This mood or attitude varies with the occupation of the 
hour and with every change in the train of thought, however 
it may be induced. After a portion of an hour spent in 
a lecture-room with a class in mathematics, words and 
figures will be noticed that would not be observed, or if 
observed would be interpreted in an entirely different 
way, in aclass in literature. The mood, the general atti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  38 Attention 
tude toward the world, is changed by the surroundings 
and the things that are said, and with it the object liable 
to become prominent will be entirely changed. In the 
same way a business man will notice events in his office 
that would pass almost unnoticed while at home. If a 
man has several occupations he will change his attitude 
toward the world as he changes his occupations, even if 
the changes take place at short intervals, and with the 
attitude there will be a variation in the object which is 
likely to catch his attention. Let a botanist turn amateur 
gardener, and he notices plants that he would not have 
been the least interested in as a scientist, or which would 
have looked entirely different to him in that capacity. 
The only varieties which he distinguishes are vegetables 
and weeds, without reference to the different forms that 
they present. The only characteristics that strike the 
attention are those that mark the entire group as corn or 
not corn, whereas when he looks as a botanist the minor 
differences are all clearly noticed, and the usefulness or 
harmfulness is not in the least considered. 
Similar instances can be drawn from any profession. A 
flash of light in his laboratory will be at once noticed by 
the electrical engineer, while a light of the same intensity 
in his home would pass entirely unnoticed. The tick of 
the telegraph key in his office will be heard by the opera- 
tor above very much more intense sounds, whereas in the 
street or in a place of public assembly it would be heard 
much less readily. The environment in which the impres- 
sion is received seems to predispose the mind for the re- 
ception of one set of impressions, and it matters not if the 
impression be expected or not, or what the conscious 
mental attitude toward it may be. When the sensation 
is received under these conditions it at once assumes the 
chief place in consciousness. There are also negative 
effects of the same kind, in which it is rendered more diffi- 
cult for impressions of a certain class to enter the mind. An 
odour will pass unnoticed in a chemical laboratory that
-P-A-G-E-49
  The Conditions of Attention 39 
would be noticed at once in a church or a dwelling-house. 
A corpse in a dissecting-room will pass unnoticed, while 
on the street it would strongly attract attention. In 
fact we might add that a positive adaptation to one set 
of stimuli in itself acts as a negative adaptation to all 
others, with varying degrees of intensity. But whether 
positive or negative, one of the factors which plays an im- 
portant part in determining that a certain object shall 
be attended to at a given time is the mood of the moment, 
and this mood is determined partly by the external en- 
vironment at the time, and in part depends upon still more 
remote subjective factors, which we must consider in their 
turn. 
Professor Kiilpe [7] and his students have, in recent years, 
devoted a large amount of work to determine the influence 
of these moods—or, as they call them, tasks or purposes— 
upon the influence of mental processes of several kinds, 
including attention, thinking, and action. The task may 
be set by a definite question from another, or as an experi- 
mental requirement, but whatever the method, when the 
task dominates consciousness it has the same effect that 
we have assigned to the mood. So nonsense syllables of 
different colours were shown for a moment in a dark room, 
and the observer was asked to look at them at different 
times with the purposes in mind: to give the number of 
of letters visible, to give the colours and their positions, 
and to name the letters and their positions. It was deter- 
mined that the best results from looking were obtained 
when the statements that were made coincided with the 
task that had been set in advance. Colours could be given 
more accurately when the task had been to name the colours 
and their positions. In general, observers were relatively 
blind to those phases of the experience that were not re- 
presented in the antecedent task. 
The first of the factors which control the mental attitude 
of the moment is the general training of the individual. 
Under this head the conditions cover so large an extent of
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 Attention 
time, and the number of influences which have been at 
work is so great, that it is not possible accurately to mark 
off one group from another. Any division must be more 
or less arbitrary, and, do the best we can, it will never be 
possible to carry one through completely. There will be 
many conditions that might as well be classified in one 
place as in another. The list of determining factors which 
must be considered in the remaining groups covers prac- 
tically every influence that the individual has been subjected 
to from birth on, and includes also many hereditary influ- 
ences that complicate the situation already sufficiently 
difficult to disentangle. We may perhaps for convenience 
divide the influences into three great groups : the training of 
the individual, the social forces which have acted upon him, 
and his inherited characteristics. It is no more impossible 
to say just how much depends upon one of these groups 
of influences and how much upon another, than it is to say 
how much of any act of the attention depends upon objec- 
tive and how much upon the subjective conditions ; or 
how much depends upon ideas in mind at the moment, 
and how much upon the mental attitude. In any case 
the classification will serve as well as any other as a basis 
for the enumeration of the empirically-given conditions, 
and besides, has the advantage of following the traditional 
lines of division. 
1. The effects of training and of past experience cannot of 
course be shown experimentally, but illustrative instances 
can be drawn in great number from daily life. Every 
large group of the community that has had a peculiar 
training—has been subjected to a distinctive set of ex- 
periences—shows the effects of them in the peculiar way in 
which individuals of the group will react to the various 
stimuli of life—in the impressions which attract their 
attention at any given time. Nearly every trade and 
profession has given ‘its members a mind adapted to re- 
ceiving impressions that would not be received by the 
great mass of men. Much of what passes for extreme
-P-A-G-E-51
  The Conditions of Attention 41 
acuteness of some special sense is nothing more than the 
result of a special training of the attention to greater 
efficiency in one particular line. 
There is a popular belief, for example, that the eye of the 
savage is much keener than the eye of civilised man. It 
is true that he will notice a footprint where the civilised 
man will not be able to see the slightest disturbance of the 
ground. He can follow game when the white companion 
is entirely without a clue to the direction of the trail. He 
will also detect the approach of an animal by the ear when 
another would not be conscious of any sound, and so on. 
Instances of his peculiar perfection of sense could be drawn 
from each class of sensations. It is not that the organs 
are more perfect, however. The results of the tests made 
on savages in different parts of the world by recent scien- 
tific expeditions go to show that their senses are no more 
perfect than those of Europeans, in fact on the average 
are even less sensitive. It is merely that all of their train- 
ing during their lifetime has been concentrated upon 
recognising and interpreting the particular objects and 
differences which have a meaning for the chase, and in 
adult life no element of the perception that can have the 
least bearing upon this point can escape him. His civilised 
companions have no such special subjective preparation, 
and consequently lack the peculiar readiness in noticing 
the slight marks. The acuteness of vision of the sailor is 
to be explained in the same way. For him every mark 
upon the horizon is correctly interpreted, and every small 
object is seen, because there are images in mind ready to 
be called out by any impression that is likely to appear 
there. The passenger by his side sees the same impressions, 
but there is nothing in the mind to favour the entrance 
of the important phases as opposed to the unimportant, 
and he will notice one as readily as the other. That it is 
the special training rather than the keenness of sense that 
makes the difference can best be shown by repeating the 
test with some material for which there has been no special
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 Attention 
  preparation. If you ask the savage to describe the charac- 
ters upon a printed page he will not see as much as a boy 
of six ; or compare the sailor’s perception of a microscopic 
preparation with the trained biologist’s, and you would find 
him placed at a greater relative disadvantage than was 
the passenger at sea compared with himself. 
The ear of the musician is probably not more delicate 
than the ear of the untrained man in the recognition of 
differences of pitch or of intensity, it is only that his train- 
ing has prepared him to notice combinations and shades 
that will escape other men. The education of the tactual 
and auditory senses in the blind is probably due to a simi- 
lar change in mental disposition and acuteness of the atten- 
tion rather than to any increase in the accuracy of percep- 
tion in the sense organs themselves. The blind can, it is 
true, recognise differences in stimuli of the most rudimen- 
tary kind, such as the distance between the two points of a 
compass, much more accurately than the normal man ; 
but the normal man can also increase the accuracy of these 
same discriminations by any practice which furthers atten- 
tion to them. So that it seems probable that the educa- 
tion of the dlind is also due to a development in the ade- 
quacy of the attention rather than to any development of 
the sense organ. The extraordinary acuteness of sense 
developed by tea-tasters and others who rely upon one sense 
almost exclusively for complicated determinations is to be 
traced similarly to mental rather than to sensory training. 
Another instance of the effect of training upon the atten- 
tion is to be seen in learning a foreign language. When 
first heard the spoken words are a jumble of confused sounds ; 
nothing is heard for itself, although all the tones strike upon 
the ear. As time goes on and practice is continued, the 
mass is broken up into its component parts and each is 
heard. The feeling that the speech is unusually rapid 
decreases with familiarity, and the different parts stand 
out for themselves. There has been no change in the 
ear; it is merely that training has increased the facility
-P-A-G-E-53
  The Conditions of Attention 43 
with which attention can be given in this particular field. 
The effect is central rather than peripheral—mental, not 
physical. 
Besides the influence which practice has upon increasing 
the adequacy of attention, it has an almost equally marked 
effect upon determining the direction of attention at any 
given time—of determining the object that shall be attended 
to. This can perhaps be best illustrated by considering 
what two men of different education would see under pre- 
cisely the same objective conditions. Suppose a geologist 
and a builder to take a walk through a rocky country new 
to both of them. Ask each what he has seen on his return, 
and the replies will be as different as if they had traversed 
an entirely different region. The geologist will be full of 
discussions of topics in connection with his science. He 
will tell you of glacial scratches, of drift from northern 
ledges, tilting of strata, and of faults. The builder will 
have seen none of these. His report would be of granite 
and of sandstone, of the colour and friability of the stone, 
and of the means of quarrying and transportation. You 
would imagine from the conversation that the two men 
had traversed an entirely different country. And the same 
difference would appear if any two men of dissimilar train- 
ing were exposed to the same stimuli. It has been said 
that it is possible to judge a man’s occupation by his 
answer to a single question ; much more is it true that you 
can tell pretty accurately what his training has been from 
a statement of what he has seen during a certain interval 
provided only that the situation in which he is placed is 
complex enough, and he be not too polite to mention the 
things which he has really been interested in, rather than 
those which he thinks will interest the listener. The world 
is presented in almost infinite possibilities of perception, 
but each man takes from it only what his previous training 
has prepared him to receive. What he has seen at one 
time is very largely instrumental in determining what he 
shall see later, each experience prepares the way for another.

We can obtain a good proof of the part which more re- 
mote experiences play in determining attention from the 
experiment with the stereoscope on retinal rivalry, which 
we cited in discussing the first group of conditions. If one of 
the eyes be offered an unbroken surface while the other is 
diversified in any way, it will be found that the one marked 
will ordinarily hold the field of consciousness against the 
other, no matter how strongly we attempt to see the first. 
Dr. Breese found that if one surface had figures of any 
kind upon it, it would hold the attention for from 64 per 
cent to 79 per cent of the time against 21 per cent to 36 per 
cent of the time for the other homogeneously coloured 
field. The variations were for different arrangements of 
the lines and for different experiments. That the con- 
tours should hold the field is probably due to the fact that 
in our experience contours have always meant objects, and 
so something that must be attended to for procuring food 
or for avoiding danger, while the homogeneous surface is 
comparatively meaningless from every standpoint. An 
educated man, too, will always see a printed page when it 
is offered at the same time as a field of straight lines. This 
again is due to the fact that the words have acquired a 
greater meaning for him from the use to which they are put 
and the frequency with which they are used—another 
expression of the general rule that a man attends most 
easily and frequently to the objects most closely related 
to the great mass of his experience. 
Usually education influences attention secondarily only, 
through the mediation of the earlier mentioned conditions. 
Training serves to evoke and direct the purpose of the 
moment, that arouses an idea, and the idea in turn deter- 
mines what shall enter consciousness. The zoologist, e.g., 
is led by his earlier knowledge to expect a definite form of 
life in the cold and darkness of the depths of the ocean. 
This gives a purpose to his examination of the contents of 
the dredge. The purpose gives rise to a definite premoni- 
tory image of minute shells, and the corresponding beings
-P-A-G-E-55
  The Conditions of Attention 45 
at once take shape among the grains of sand. Most seeing 
is the result of a similar self-conscious purpose. But far 
from lessening the importance of education, a recognition 
of this fact serves rather to emphasize the wide range of its 
action. And there are innumerable instances, too, in which 
education acts directly without premonitory purpose or 
idea. A telegrapher, imprisoned or in some other environ- 
ment where nothing suggests his occupation, will recognize 
the Morse code in faint taps, while another would overlook 
the very sounds themselves as well as the order in their 
recurrence. 
2. The social factors in determining the attention are also 
of a very general nature, and take us even farther back in 
time than any of the others so far considered. They might 
for the most part be almost as well discussed under the 
head of the training, but as they usually appear most fully 
during the early years of life, and before training has ad- 
vanced very, far, and are most important elements of train- 
ing, a separate treatment offers numerous advantages. 
Only in recent years has there been any adequate concep- 
tion of what the individual owes to his fellows in society 
for his stock-in-trade and for impetus to effort. Partly 
through tradition, including the printed book, partly through 
immediate contact with his neighbours, every child comes 
into touch with the experience of the race already pre- 
pared for assimilation. A large part of the knowledge 
acquired in the process of training is drawn from this source. 
In so far, the social factors may be said to have been con- 
sidered in the preceding discussion. 
But another and more distinctive side of the social in- 
fluence is to be found in the pressure that society exerts 
to force its standards upon the individual. Its standards 
are enforced in part directly through the respect that is felt 
for the opinions of others, and in part indirectly through 
physical force wielded by the parents, and in rarer instances 
by the officers of the law. Much of what we know popu- 
larly as duty resolves itself on careful examination into 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
46 Attention 
  the fear of public opinion, to the fact that mankind in 
general looks with favour upon certain forms of action and 
disapproves of others. Were it not for this set of condi- 
tions the training of the child would be largely a matter of 
chance, and the attention of any moment would conform 
to no general law. As it is, the child is impressed with the 
importance of adapting himself to the social order from 
the very beginning. There is unconscious pressure in the 
attempt to learn to speak. The interest which the child 
feels in the speech of parents and others about him—the 
first incentive to speech—is undoubtedly a case of social 
pressure. These beings are for him the source of food 
and of all good things of life, and an important part of the 
total series of impressions that results in the acquirement 
of the comforts is the spoken word, passed to and fro as 
the preliminary to most actions which benefit him. Atten- 
tion to the people about soon irradiates to the spoken 
word which is so frequently associated with them. With 
attention once fixed upon the word the only further condi- 
tion necessary for speech is that some chance movement 
of the child’s vocal organs should produce one of the sounds 
that have already attracted his attention. With the coming 
of this sound it too is attended to, and there follows a fre- 
quent repetition which establishes the connection between 
sound and movement, until it becomes so close that there- 
after it is only necessary to have the picture of the word 
come up in consciousness for the word itself to follow. 
The social impetus helps indirectly at each stage of the 
process. The exclamations and general excitement which 
greet the first word, and the advantages which accrue at 
a later stage from communication with his fellows, are all 
strong incentives to make every effort to perfect the process. 
As the child grows older the pressure from society be- 
comes ever stronger. He is held to most of his tasks, 
after the first interest which comes from their novelty has 
worn off, by the desire of approbation or by the fear of 
blame, His early attendance at school comes from paren-  
-P-A-G-E-57
The Conditions of Attention 47 
tal desire or from a liking for the society of children of his 
own age, and once in school approbation of the teacher 
and of his mates are the strongest incentives to further 
progress—particularly to continued application in the less 
congenial tasks. Gradually there comes from the frequent 
repetition of the pressure the feeling that to be inattentive, 
to do nothing, or to waste time, is not in accordance with 
social tradition, is wrong. It is this habit once formed 
that brings him to hold himself to some one line of work 
until the end is attained, without much conscious reference 
to that end or to the passing pleasure that comes from the 
work itself. What the line of work shall be is also in large 
measure determined by family or neighbourhood tradi- 
tions, and the standard of excellence that he shall aim to 
attain in that line is fixed very largely by the ideals of his 
community. In short, the impetus to attention which 
leads to training, as well as the direction which that train- 
ing shall take, are both very largely derived from social 
influences, and the rewards which come from attainment 
of the ideals of training and the punishments which follow 
failure are almost entirely social in their nature. Without 
these elements no man would give prolonged attention to 
any one thing—education in the present sense would be 
an impossibility. And as without preliminary training 
the natural attention would not attach to anything above 
the commonplace, and there would be no continued atten- 
tion even to that, there could be no advance beyond the 
stage of barbarism. 
Finally, we must consider the most remote set of condi- 
tions of all, those which are derived from heredity. It is 
again very difficult to distinguish between hereditary con- 
ditions and those which are due to the more general expe- 
riences. There are certain circumstances which attract 
the attention so universally both in animals and in men 
that it seems safe to regard them as due to the common 
experience of the race, rather than as acquired during the 
lifetime of the individual. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 Attention 
Most striking of these is the influence of movement. It 
is true of both the spatial senses that any moving object 
holds the attention against almost any other form of stimu- 
lation, and there are analogous facts that might be men- 
tioned in the non-spatial senses. An object in motion 
in any part of the field of vision will at once attract the 
attention, and will hold it as long as it continues to move. 
Many an object that can be seen perfectly easily as it 
moves across the field of view, is lost to sight when it comes 
to rest. A distant golf ball is plainly visible so long as 
it continues its course, but seems to disappear utterly 
when it stops, even if it is not hidden by any intervening 
object. An after image again is never seen while the eye 
is moving, although it again becomes visible as the eye 
stops, and this in spite of the fact that the image is fainter 
at that time than it was before. The shadows of retinal 
blood-vessels which we have overlooked all our lives because 
they do not change their position with respect to the retina 
will suddenly become visible if the source of light changes 
its position rapidly enough to throw the shadows into 
pronounced movement. 
This effect of movement in attracting the attention is 
common to many different grades of animals. The kitten 
pricks up its ears as soon as the ball starts to roll across 
the floor, a horse shies when a bit of paper blows across 
the road, while both animals would remain unaffected 
by the same objects at rest. Wild animals are startled 
by the movements of the hunter, while they fail to notice 
him under the same conditions if he is perfectly still. 
Dr. Breese, in his experiments on retinal rivalry, also obtained 
striking experimental proof of the importance of movement. 
He found that with one field of vision in movement, the 
other at rest, the moving field was seen 53 per cent to 60 
per cent of the time instead of about 50 per cent in the 
normal experiments. And so, from the lowest animals 
which possess eyes upward to man, any object that 
moves in the field of vision will attract the attention,  
-P-A-G-E-59
  The Conditions of Attention 49 
even if the object in itself be inconspicuous and the 
attention be claimed by attractive objects of other 
kinds. 
On the skin the same law holds. It is much easier to 
perceive a moving object than a resting one. A weight 
too light to be felt while at rest becomes easily felt when 
drawn across the surface. The distance that an object 
must be moved before the movement is noticed is con- 
siderably less than the least distance between two 
resting points which permits them to be felt as two. And 
the moving object also will attract the attention here as 
in vision when there has been no preparation for attend- 
ing to the stimulus, and attention to a moving object is 
also more effective when it occurs. 
The fact that change in general is a condition for the 
attention might have the same explanation, and even be 
made a sub-head under the law. Motion may be regarded 
as a form of change in intensity. It consists of an increase 
of intensity at some point, accompanied by a decrease on 
the place last stimulated. Owing to the inertia of the 
sense organ the stimulus appears gradually at one point 
and dies away just as gradually, so that all parts stimu- 
lated are undergoing a change in the intensity of stimula- 
tion. On the other hand, it is quite usual to speak of 
changes in intensity and quality as movements through 
different degrees. So we have in music the statement that 
the moving part is attended to in spite of a low intensity. 
Advantage is taken of this to make the relatively weak 
solo part stand out above the accompaniment by giving 
it a different direction on the scale from the orchestral 
parts. In this particular case the change impresses the 
hearer as very much like a movement. And there are 
other changes both in quality and intensity that make 
the same impression. In a similar way anything that is 
new in our experience tends to attract us. A new picture 
on the wall, a new face at the table, will draw all eyes, 
whether there be any other striking feature or not, And 
E 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
50 Attention 
also a tree in a plain, or a black face in an audience of Cau- 
casians will be noticed at once. 
MAt first sight this seems to be out of harmony with the 
statement in the earlier part of the chapter, that ideas 
which had previously been in consciousness facilitated 
the entrance of the corresponding sensation when presented 
again. The opposition is only apparent. Both statements 
are true, but in different connections. The new thing will 
draw the attention, but not to hold it for long, while the 
known both attracts the attention and holds it. We see 
the new as easily, perhaps, but we certainly see more in the 
old. The child or savage is more astonished by the loco- 
motive than the engineer, but the latter sees infinitely 
more in it than the former. Furthermore, when the atten- 
tion is held by the new thing it is frequently because the 
new is not entirely new, and the familiar serves with the 
new to attract the attention. The two principles do not 
conflict, as has been asserted, but are complementary. 
Either the new or the old will attract the attention, but 
for different reasons. 
That movement and these related changes attract the 
attention is very evidently to be explained from the evo- 
lution of the race. A moving object means either a bit 
of food or an enemy. In either case it must be observed 
if the animal is to survive. This tendency must have be- 
come ingrained in the animal series at a very early age by 
the process of eliminating the unfit, and its wide distribu- 
tion throughout the animal kingdom shows that none of the 
animals above the most rudimentary has escaped it. The 
same evolutionary explanation that applies to movement 
will also apply to change and the effect of the new or un- 
known in attracting the attention. A sudden increase 
in the intensity or even change in the quality of a stimulus, 
means that a new adaptation to the environment is neces- 
sary, and that failure to adapt oneself may be disastrous. 
The unfamiliar is in the same way a possible source of dan- 
ger, and attention must be given if there is to be survival.
-P-A-G-E-61
  The Conditions of Attention 51 
When we are dealing with an inherited tendency that is 
as widespread as this among animals and men, it is difficult 
to decide whether the condition is to be regarded as objec- 
tive or subjective; whether its explanation is to be his- 
torical, or whether it depends upon the general nature of 
nervous tissue. The basis of settlement is to be found in the 
fact that there seems to be no purely physical reason why 
a moving or changing stimulus should have a greater effect 
upon the nerve than a constant or stationary one, while 
there does seem to be a historical reason for its effect. In 
this it differs from intensity, which can be seen to have a 
greater effect in disturbing the chemical equilibrium of a 
nerve, 
In addition to these very general hereditary conditions 
of the attention, there are undoubtedly certain elements 
in each individual which are peculiar to him, on account 
of his descent, which he has inherited from his immediate 
parents, and which make him attend more readily to one 
set of stimuli than to others. Galton, in his “ Hereditary 
Genius,” shows that sons tend to follow the professions of 
their fathers, and excel in the same directions. This 
would depend in the last analysis very largely upon atten- 
tion. The whole question is clouded, however, by the fact 
that it is very difficult to decide in any case whether we 
have to deal with heredity pure and simple, or with the 
social factors of family tradition. {In_nearly every case 
fathers educate their own children, and it is therefore 
equally easy to assume that the similarity in taste and 
ability is due to the inheritance or to the trainingy With 
man there are so few instances in which enviroriment can 
be distinguished from heredity, that it is impossible to give 
an example of attention that can be clearly shown to 
be due to heredity alone. That some part even of this level 
is derived from heredity is probable from the innate char- 
acteristics of animals. A setter dog, for instance, has its 
attention drawn at once by a game bird, while a pug or a 
Saint Bernard would hardly notice it at all. A kitten will
-P-A-G-E-62
52 Attention 
be attracted by the odour of a dog on the hands of the per- 
son who fondles it before she has seen anything of a dog. 
Other instances to the same purpose might be given in 
great numbers. These seem sufficient, however, to indicate 
that the attention is in part determined by heredity in 
the animal series,’and probably the same circumstances 
are at work in man. | 
Altogether, then, it seems that the conditions of the at- 
tention are as widespread as the conditions of conscious- 
ness itself. Every event that has at any time affected the 
individual in any way is at some time likely to determine 
in some degree the direction and efficiency of his attention. 
Not only, moreover, must we regard all the experiences 
of the individual as determining any given state of the 
attention, but also through heredity and social environment 
everything that has helped to select for survival his ances- 
tors or the race at any time will play some part, great or 
small, in deciding between the many stimuli offered on any 
occasion. 
SUMMARY 
1. The conditions of any act of attention are to be found 
in the present environment (objective conditions) and in 
the past experience of the individual (subjective condi- 
tions). 
2. The main objective conditions are the intensity, ex- 
tent, and duration of the stimulus. 
3. The subjective conditions are to be found in the idea 
in mind at the time, in the mood of the moment, the edu- 
cation, previous social environment, and heredity of the 
individual.

CHAPTER IV 
INTEREST AND FEELING OF ACTIVITY AS CONDITIONS 
OF ATTENTION 
aA) have failed to consider in the last chapter two con- 
ditions of the attention that are ordinarily regarded 
as of the first importance. They are, in fact, the only con- 
ditions that are mentioned popularly. It seems well, 
therefore, to ask whether they are to be retained at all in 
the list, if a part shall be ascribed to them. 
We may begin with interest, as it is the easier to dispose 
of, and seems to stand first in the frequency with which 
it is mentioned. In its simplest form we are always 
making the statement that we attend to an object because 
it is interesting to us. As a basis for our discussion let us 
ask what things are usually interesting. 
In the first place, we find that we are interested in those 
things most closely related to our own past life. We are 
interested in the “local” items of our own town paper, 
while similar items when read in the paper which we pick 
up on the table of a friend seem ludicrous in their puerility. 
A student is interested in anything that is new to him, but 
at the same time is so closely related to the things which 
he has known before that he has no difficulty in connect- 
ing it with some previous bit of knowledge. And the 
closer the connection, and the more important to the person 
the things with which it is connected, the stronger is the 
interest. We say that a novel is interesting if it contains 
a sufficient admixture of human emotion, of love and hate, 
revenge and forbearance, to permit us to live again some 
53
-P-A-G-E-64
54 Attention 
phases of our own experience in a new setting, if we can 
feel with the characters and make them a part of our lives. 
A young boy who has not yet known what love is, is not 
interested in a love story ; nor is a girl ordinarily appealed 
to by stories of adventure. 
The play of children again throws light upon their inter- 
ests ; their games are in general a reproduction of the 
things in which they are interested. We can trace the 
effect of heredity and of the social environment .upon the 
nature of the games. It isa matter of frequent remark among 
travellers that the play of the children of any race is merely 
an imitation of the activities of the adults of the same 
tribe. Play among savage boys is largely made up of 
mock representations of incidents of the chase and of war- 
fare. Among civilized children these elements still hold 
a large place, but there is in addition a large increase in © 
the number of games taken from mercantile and agricul- 
tural pursuits. Savage and civilised girls show the same 
differences, but the games of both are imitations of the 
duties of the home and of domestic labour generally. 
In all of these cases we find that what is interesting,is 
identical with the things which, as we have seen above, 
must be attended to from subjective reasons. They are 
the things that demand attention, because they are related 
to our previous experience, because our social environ- 
ment compels it, or because of hereditary influences. 
Interest then is not dependent upon the object, but 
upon the nature of the man to whom the object is pre- 
sented. As we develop, many things become interesting 
that previously were uninteresting. Interests grow with 
knowledge, and, in fact, are made by knowledge ; they are 
not fixed once and for all, even in the same individual. 
Of course it has been noticed almost daily that interests 
differ from individual to individual. What appeals strongly 
to one man will not call forth the least response from 
another. These differences can, of course, only be co- 
related with the different experiences and the different 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  Conditions of Attention 55 
hereditary influences in the life of each. The objects 
which are interesting to all men alike are so, not because 
of a peculiarity of the things themselves or of any common 
characteristic of the things, but because of the common 
nature of man. That men have common interests is due 
to the common heredity—to the fact that men are born 
into a social environment in a large measure the same for 
all, and to the similar experiences to which they have been 
subjected. So we have seen that man is interested in the 
moving things because heredity has forced the race and the 
animal series as a whole to notice them. In the same way 
man must be interested in other men because heredity, 
social environment, and his individual experience have all 
combined to force that interest upon him. If the human 
race is to survive it must work in harmony, and if any 
individual is to survive he must co-operate with his fellows 
and consider their interests and desires at every step. The 
basis of such unity and consideration is an interest in every- 
thing that they do, and an understanding of their motives 
in the fullest sense. If the actions and feelings of others 
failed to attract our attention, and the expression of anger 
or of satisfaction upon a human face were no longer of 
interest, co-operation would become much more difficult 
than it is at present. 
Interest then is but the objective way of looking at the 
conditions of the attention. It is merely ascribing to the ob- 
jects processes and qualities that have their real originjin 
the man himself. Things are interesting because we at- 
tend to them, or because we are likely to attend to them ; 
we do not attend because they are interesting, to para- 
phrase Professor James’s familiar saying about emotion. 
While a thing that attracts the attention is interesting, 
not all the objects that attract the attention have the name 
applied to them. We do not think of those sounds as in- 
teresting to which we must attend merely because of their 
intensity—which force their way into consciousness whether 
permitted or not. In the same category fall all the things
-P-A-G-E-66
    56 Attention 
to which we attend from objective conditions. It seems 
that if there is anything in the nature of the object which 
accounts to us for its entrance, we are satisfied with as- 
cribing that as the reason for the entrance, and do not men- 
tion the less apparent and more subjective term, interest. 
On the other hand, in the very complex case in which we 
attend from what we know as a sense of duty, we also do 
not think of saying that the object attended to is interesting, 
but think rather of the related considerations as accounting 
for its entrance. In other words, whenever there is any: 
condition that may be named as the reason for the coming 
of the idea we do not say that it is interest which deter- 
mines the attention, but when there is nothing that can be 
pointed to as the occasion for the attending we say that the 
object is interesting. It seems, then, that interest is applied 
to those conditions of the attention which are neither too 
subjective nor yet too objective, although an exact line of 
demarcation cannot be drawn. It is evident in any case 
that it is not in itself a separate condition of attention, 
but merely a name for one class of conditions, which by 
some curious development of popular consciousness has 
become referred to the object instead of the mind itself. [5] 
There is another sense in which interest is used popularly, 
that is, as a word for a pleasant feeling that comes as we 
attend. We are said to be interested in anything that holds 
our attention, and this is pleasant. This fact and use 
raises the question of the relation of pleasure and pain 
to attention. It is frequently said that we attend to things 
‘because they are pleasant, and avoid attending to them if 
they are unpleasant. The argument tends to overlook 
two facts: that feeling comes after attention has taken 
place, and that attention is given to unpleasant as well as to 
pleasant objects. As to the first, it is evident that the 
pleasure or pain never comes until after the object has 
been attended to, and it is therefore very evident that it 
is not the pleasure or the pain in itself which produces 
the attending. We see the thing fully before it can give us a  
-P-A-G-E-67
  Conditions of Attention 57 
feeling tone of any kind, and by that time of course the 
attending is complete. The only fact that could be alleged 
then is that the pleasure would serve to hold the attention, 
once it had been drawn, while a painful impression would 
be at once banished from mind. But Kiilpe has pointed out 
in the second place that even this is not the case. We 
attend with equal readiness to unpleasant and to pleasant 
sensations. Tragedy holds us as long and as continuously 
as comedy. An accident in which human life is lost claims 
our attention as fully as the most entrancing landscape. 
It is evidently not pleasure alone that would be effective 
in determining the attention if we were to give feeling any 
place in the process. 
That pleasure was ever considered to be a factor in the 
control is probably due to the fact that attending is itself 
a pleasant event. Things which are interesting please us, 
as we see from the ordinary connotation of the term in- 
terest ; and if the interesting things are merely those which 
attract our attention, as we concluded in the last chapter, 
then it seems that we are driven to the inference that atten- 
tion in itself is pleasant, without any reference to the feeling 
tone that may accompany the idea. If the feeling which 
is aroused. by the idea attended to per se is unpleasant, it 
will lessen or destroy the pleasure of the total process ; 
but in the majority of cases the attending seems pleasant. 
Pleasantness, then, in the popular regard has, like interest, 
passed over from being an acompaniment or product of 
the attention to be regarded as its condition, or one of its 
conditions. 
Probably a large part of the opinion that pleasure and 
interest are conditions of the attention has arisen from the 
fact that there is in many cases a preliminary knowledge 
that a certain object is to come into the range of actual 
sensation. This preliminary knowledge takes the form 
of a centrally aroused sensation, either of a memory image 
or an imagination. It is attended to in that form, and 
this attention may give rise both to interest and pleasure.
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 Attention | 
The pleasure which is thus derived from the anticipatory 
process is astrong stimulus to seek to put oneself in a favour- 
able place to receive the expected impression, and then, 
as we have seen in the last chapter, having had the idea 
before is a favourable condition for receiving it again. So 
that attending to a premonitory image is a real condition 
for receiving the corresponding external stimulation when 
it comes, particularly if the first be accompanied by pleasure; 
but the real condition of the attending throughout the 
process is to be found in the conditions of the first act of 
attention to the memory image, and: this can be neither 
the interest nor the pleasure, for the idea—the attending— 
must have come before its entrance. 
Another popular explanation of the conditions of atten- 
tion which needs to be considered in this connection is 
that attention is the result of subjective activity, and that — 
attention is effective when the self acts to produce a change ~ 
in the mental field—in the clearness or intensity of the — 
ideas. The evidence usually adduced for this view is that 
when we attend we feel ourselves active, we feel that we 
are in some way directly responsible for the change which 
is going on, we feel that we are struggling for greater clear- 
ness in some direction, or to retain a process already present. 
In recent years this phase of the attention process has been 
subjected to very close analysis by several writers, and 
the conclusion has been reached that it does not constitute 
an essential condition of the attention, but is merely a con- 
comitant or sign of the attention. It is a feeling of the 
same kind as that which comes when one is lifting a heavy 
weight, or making other movements that involve much 
exertion. At that time it will be noticed that there are 
sensations of strain in all parts of the body, as well as from 
the muscles directly involved in the lifting. These sensa- 
tions correspond to the contraction of the muscles which 
were mentioned in the chapter on motor concomitants. 
The contraction of the scalp muscles, the setting of the 
teeth, and the contraction of the other muscles of the body  
-P-A-G-E-69
  Conditions of Attention 59 
re all accompanied by strain sensations. These sensations 
are so widely diffused throughout the body, and the total 
complex comes to consciousness in one mass so often, and 
the separate elements appear in isolation so seldom, that 
an accurate analysis is extremely difficult, and the whole 
mass is regarded as a unit. From the regularity with 
which they accompany the movement they have been 
regarded as its real cause, and as something which has 
independent existence without any relation to the muscles 
or to any part of the physical organism. Careful analysis 
shows, however, as we have seen, that the feeling of activity 
is but a complex of sensations coming from the muscles, 
and that they only succeed or accompany the putting 
forth of energy—do not precede it—and so cannot cause 
the movement. There is nothing of an essentially new 
or distinct kind involved; we are dealing with a new 
manifestation of the sensation that comes with each con- 
traction of a muscle. 
The same processes are involved in the attention. The 
feeling of activity is the same for both attention and vol- 
untary action, just as we saw that there was the same 
overflow of nervous energy to the various muscles of the 
body in both, and consequently the same mass of strain 
sensations is present during attention as during physical 
effort. When attentive, sensations come from the con- 
tracted scalp muscles, from the muscles of the jaws, and 
from the voluntary muscles in the different parts of the 
body. If this instance, too, it is easily seen on careful 
observation that we begin to attend before the strains 
arise, or at the same time that they appear. Moreover, 
the most intense strain does not correspond to the period 
of greatest efficiency of attention. On the contrary, the 
strains are most pronounced when we are just beginning 
to attend, while we are warming up to the work, and are 
still not working to advantage ; they die away when the 
work alone is present in consciousness and we have reached 
the maximum of effectiveness. It is not when trying
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  60 Attention 
hardest that we obtain the best results, but when there i 
no need for effort, when the occupation of the moment 
seems to carry the attention, and nothing else is needed 
to reinforce it. It is when there is a sudden change in the 
direction of the attention, when there are two sets of con- 
ditions working to determine the attention from opposite 
sides, and the issue between them is in doubt, that the 
sense of effort is strongest. The rule is that when the 
conditions of the attention are most equivocal the sense — 
of effort is greatest, and that there is no relation, except 
perhaps an inverse one, between efficiency of the attention 
and the accompanying feeling of activity. When the one 
set of conditions has obtained full control and the other 
is entirely excluded there comes a diminution, usually 
almost a complete disappearance, of the effort. While, 
therefore, this sense of activity is one of the most charac- 
teristic marks of attention, there is definite proof that the 
feeling of activity itself is not a condition, but an accompani- 
ment of the attention process. It is a sign of the atten- 
tion, or more truly of the struggle, that comes when several 
sets of conditions are striving for the mastery in conscious- 
ness, rather than a condition of the attention. 
Against the position that the greatest strain was an 
accompaniment of attention under the greatest difficulties 
rather than of the most efficient attention, one who believed 
that the strain was a real sign of the activity of mind might 
argue that this was what one would expect if there was 
an active mind that was always striving to aecomplish 
a certain result. If this result could be obtained easily 
there would be little necessity for effort, while when there 
was opposition much effort would be put forth, just as one 
puts forth more effort to accomplish the same result under 
unfavourable circumstances. We should also expect the 
least result under the same condition. 
An argument of this kind, however, is at best but an 
analogy, and we do not know that any of the elements in 
the two cases are strictly analogous. Certainly one im-
-P-A-G-E-71
Conditions of Attention 61 
portant factor in the analogy is lacking. That is that the 
forces which oppose are not external to the mind, as are 
the physical. forces which oppose the bodily movement, 
but are just as much within as are the conditions which 
impel to the successful activity. When there is a struggle 
between the influences which would make one attend to 
work and those which impel to reading a novel, both are 
equally subjective. There are many factors of social and 
hereditary origin that impel toward the novel—our interest 
in man and human character, our love of adventure, of 
courage in a struggle, and of the heroic in general. On 
the other side there are other social and experiential fac- 
tors—the feeling that one cannot afford to be regarded by 
his fellows as lacking in industry, the feeling that it is one’s 
duty to work during certain hours enforced by the standard 
of work in the particular community and profession with 
which one’s lot has been cast, the fear of consequences if 
the work is not completed, and so on throughout a long 
series. One set of influences is just as subjective as the 
other, and yet we have an apparent struggle, and the feel- 
ing of activity is present in large degree. Evidently then 
our analogy does not hold. We can hardly picture our- 
selves as fighting ourselves, and we cannot to-day take 
seriously the popular figure of speech that there are two 
selves, two attentions which are fighting each other, and 
that the strains are the signs of their conflict. All talk 
of such activity and opposition is purely figurative, and 
most of the metaphors are seen to be badly mixed when 
closely examined. There is no place for any activity of 
the kind in the process that actually takes place. The 
only thing left to do with the strain sensations is to regard 
_ them as a concomitant of the attention, arising through 
some overflow of motor energy which originates when two 
sets of conditions oppose each other. 
The only effect which the contraction of these numerous 
muscles has upon the efficiency of the attention, is that it 
may slightly increase the adequacy of the attention beyond  
-P-A-G-E-72
eA SA ot ALR 
62 Attention 
that which it would have had if the strain sensations were 
not present. It is found by a method tvhich will be de- 
scribed in the next chapter that one can attend slightly 
better if he is exerting muscular force in some way—if he 
clenches his fist or presses upon a dynamometer. When 
the normal strain sensations are present, there is probably 
an effect of a very similar kind, but of slighter degree. 
This result is entirely analogous to the fact that it is pos- 
sible to exert greater force with one hand when the other 
is also contracted. Both effects are probably due to an 
irradiation of nervous force from one nerve cell to another, 
which serves mutually to reinforce each. But you can no 
more regard the widespread contraction which follows the 
attention as the cause of the attention than you could call 
the contraction of the left hand the cause of the contraction 
of the right in the other instance. 
Dr. W. MacDougall [3] records an experiment which prob- 
bably affords the most satisfactory evidence we have that 
the back-stroke from muscle directly helps attention. He 
made use of an experiment similar to rivalry in the stereo- 
scope. He varied the experiment by paralysing the ciliary 
muscle of one eye with atropine. Under these circum- 
stances the field before the normal eye was seen much the 
greater part of the time, while with both eyes uninjured 
each was seen about the same length of time. 
If now neither interest nor the activity-process is of any 
real value in determining attention, and neither can be 
added to the factors which we have considered before, we 
are left with the view that we owe attention not to any one 
particular circumstance, but rather to the sum total of 
influences, external and internal, that are working upon 
us at any moment. These conditions include all of the 
actions of the individual, all of the impressions that have 
been made upon him in any way, and go back beyond the 
lifetime of the individual to the events that have affected 
his ancestors on the one side, and to the activities and re- 
lations of his fellows in the same society on the other. If  
-P-A-G-E-73
  Conditions of Attention 63 
any one of these events had been different we must believe 
that some aspect of the attention would have been changed 
in greater or less degree. The amount of change would 
depend upon the remoteness of the influence, upon its in- 
tensity at the time it was originally active, and upon the 
closeness of its relation to the other influences which have 
been at work at any time. 
In any case the conditions of the attention cannot be 
dismissed with either of the popular formule that we 
attend because we are interested, for this statement is a 
tautology ; or that we attend because we try, for the “try”’ 
consciousness is but a sign of the working of certain factors 
which make for the attention, it is not in itself a realcondition. 
SUMMARY 
1. Neither interest or ‘‘ mental activity ’ can be regarded 
as conditions of attention. 
2. Interest is either a general name for the subjective 
conditions of attention when ascribed to-the object, or 
it is used to designate a mood which accompanies all 
attending. 
3. ‘“‘ Mental activity” is really bodily activity—a mass 
of sensations that comes from the contraction of muscles 
in different parts of the body. The contractions result 
from motor innervations which accompany attention.

  CHAPTER V 
THE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS 
HERE are several facts in connection with the atten- 
tion and its results in consciousness that are of con- 
siderable interest in themselves, and throw light upon 
problems of practical value for teachers and others, as well 
as being very important for the theory of the attention 
which must be discussed in a later chapter. Of these we 
shall consider the number of objects to which attention 
may be given, the time that it is possible to attend, and 
the effect of the attention upon the rate of perception and 
movement. 
The first question is one that has played a considerable 
part in the older history of psychology and philosophy. It 
has long been a dogma of common sense, and was an ac- 
cepted principle of the_old rational psychotogy; that man 
can attend to but one thing at a time, fore than 
a singtet jausness 
a % i ft. The dogma undoubtedly has a 
purely a priori origin, and was deduced from the principle 
that the mind-was a simple indivisible substance, and there- 
fore could contain but one idea at a time. Recently this 
statement has been subjected to experiment and found not 
to be in harmony with the facts of experience, or at least 
not to be true in the naive way in which it was formulated. 
The experiments consist in exposing a number of objects 
for an interval of one-hundredth to one-fifth of a second— 
a time much too short to permit the impressions to be 
counted during the exposure—and noting the number of 
64
-P-A-G-E-75
  The Effects of Attention tn Consciousness 65 
objects that can be correctly recognised in the period. 
Two facts of importance for our discussion were obtained. 
It was shown that four or five impressions could be noticed 
at one time instead of one, as the rational psychologists 
had assumed, and also that the number of objects which 
could be recognised was almost entirely independent of 
their size or complexity. Goldscheider and Miiller [*5*] found, 
for example, that it was as easy to perceive acomplex group 
of dots arranged in some regular order, as it was to perceive _ 
asingle dot, that the complex which goes to make up a letter 
is as easily recognised as the simplest impression. Finally 
it was found that a short word was seen as easily as a 
single letter. In spite of the great difference in size, and 
the greater number of elements in the word, it is in its con- 
nection just as much a single object as the single dot, and 
in spite of the fact that it is itself made up of letters, which 
in isolation are themselves objects, the word is as much 
a simple object as is any letter. This result is confirmed 
by the work on time of recognition first carried out by 
Cattell and repeated by Erdmann and Dodge. They all 
found that it took less time to recognise a word than a 
single letter, provided the word was short, and that words 
of eight letters were recognised as quickly as the separate 
letters. 
There is a very similar set of facts in connection with 
auditory impressions. It was found that if a monotonous 
series of clicks were given in such rapid succession that 
counting was impossible, eight single sounds could be per- 
ceived in a single act of the attention. But if the sounds 
were rhythmically united into groups, either by varying 
the intensity of the external impression or by subjectively 
accenting some of the tones, it was possible to receive forty 
impressions in a single act of consciousness. That is, 
nearly as many rhythmical units could be noticed as single 
clicks. The combination into rhythmical groups renders 
the group a unit of the same kind as the single object. 
These two groups of facts seem to show that what we 
E 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 Attention 
call the object, the simple existing thing, is not so much 
determined by its physical characteristics as by the use 
to which it is put and the attitude of mind at the time 
they are perceived. A thing may just as well be large as 
small, complex as simple. It is equally unitary at the 
moment of perception, no matter how many different ele- 
ments goto makeit up. It is as easy to recognise a landscape 
as any single grain of sand that contributes to some simple 
feature of the view. If aspects or attributes, sensations, 
or things, to speak metaphysically, psychologically, and 
popularly at once, have been used together, or have fre- 
quently come into consciousness at one time, they come 
to be regarded as a single object, they become isolated 
from everything else, and when they come to mind again 
they are treated as a unit. What determines the number 
and kind of elements that shall compose any object when 
there are several different combinations which can be made, 
is always the set of conditions that happens to be dominant 
in mind at that particular time. If the circumstances of 
the moment make the letter more important it will hold the | 
chief place, will constitute the unit of perception at that 
time ; if on the other hand the word is adapted to the 
mental setting of the moment, then it becomes the object 
of the moment and the letters are not seen separately. 
The same statement holds of the landscape and its elements, 
for the picture and its details, for the locomotive and the 
minute oil-hole upon some insignificant part. What deter- 
mines which shall be regarded as the object is in every case 
the mental attitude, not the physical mass which is offered 
to consciousness. 
This line of argument brings us into conflict with the 
facts from which we started our argument, or at least 
with the bald statement that was made that it was possible 
to see four or five or eight single impressions at the same 
instant. From the present standpoint it would mean 
that there could be dominant in mind, without interfering 
with each other, four or five different mental settings,
-P-A-G-E-77
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 67 
and that each was instrumental in bringing to mind some 
one of the objects, a conclusion which is plainly impossible 
if we are to abide by the results of our discussion of the con- 
ditions of the attention, and if accepted would alter our 
idea of the nature of attention itself. We are left then 
with the alternatives of regarding the process that results 
in the perception of the numerous objects either as the 
result of a series of successive attentions, or as the percep- 
tion of a single object made up of a number of different 
parts, with which we have formed the habit of associating 
the numeral because of frequent counting. [?7] 
A study of the details of the experiments should permit 
us to decide between the two possible explanations. At 
the moment of perception there is either a group of homo- 
geneous objects, a number of dots of the same kind, or 
there is a grouping of dissimilar things that can be thrown 
together as belonging to the same class, a number of letters 
that can be at least said to unite to form a mass of letters. 
In either case it would seem that the first perception is of 
a single object of many parts, but what is seen is the object, 
not the parts that go to make it up. The recognition of 
the parts takes place later as a result of analysis, and the 
analysis consists of nothing but a separate attention to each 
element. 
That the counting should take place as the result of 
attention to the separate elements, and come after the first 
perception of the group as a unit, is made more probable 
from an examination of the time relations of perception in 
general. We know from experiments in reaction times 
that the process of recognition takes longer than the time 
necessary to give an impression of the objects to be seen. 
It must be true then that a part of the recognition process 
goes on after the impression has ceased to affect the retina. 
Recognition must be a result of the nervous processes of 
lone kind and another which continue to run their course 
lafter the physical stimulus has disappeared. If these 
ervous processes can continue long enough to be recognised     
   
                            
   
            
-P-A-G-E-78
68 Attention 
after the stimulus has ceased, there is no reason why they 
cannot also continue a sufficient time to permit a number 
of separate recognitions to go on. Introspection seems 
to bear out the same conclusion. The counting in many, 
if not in most cases, seems to goon after we have turned the 
eyes away from the screen, or piter the objects are no longer 
exposed. It is the memory image or the after-image that 
is studied to obtain an idea of the number of objects, rather 
than the original impression. Everything seems to point 
to the conclusion that a separate act of the attention is 
required for the recognition or the counting of each separate 
dot, rather than that the whole process goes on in a single 
act of the attention. This, of course, excludes those simpler 
cases in which the grouping is familiar, and the word for 
the number comes up by immediate association as soon as 
the group enters mind. 
What constitutes an object in the light of this discussion 
is not any definite amount or kind of external stimulus, 
but a collection of stimuli to which circumstances have 
compelled us to attend as a whole. A letter, a word, a 
group of dots in some particular arrangement, have been 
many times isolated and united by the attention, and so 
have acquired meaning as a unit, and it is that which makes 
them an object. The process of counting the objects con- 
sists in nothing else than in first receiving: the large group 
as a whole, and then in going through the same process for 
each element whether it be large or small. The experi- 
ments which we have described prove not so much that we 
* can attend to more than ee defining object as we 
have, but that four or five things may fall upon the retina 
together, be recognised as a whole, and persist while we 
attend to and count each separately. 
Hylan [”*] has confirmed this opinion experimentally since 
the above was written. He measured the duration of the 
memory after-image in a number of individuals, and mea- 
sured the number of objects that could be perceived upon 
a single exposure. The results show that those individuals
-P-A-G-E-79
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 69 
who had a longer persistence of the memory after-image 
were the ones who could see the greater number of objects 
with the brief exposure. 
The fact that objects of greater complexity can be seen 
as easily as those of less complexity is the foundation for 
the word-method of teaching reading that has found so 
much favour in recent years. If the adult can perceive 
a word as easily and as quickly as a letter, it seems a waste of 
time for the child to spend his energy at first with the letters. 
It is a great saving of time and drudgery to make the word 
the unit from the first, and postpone the analysis into its 
elements until the words are acquired. 
Corresponding to the problem of the number of objects 
to which attention may be given, is the question of the 
length of time that it is possible to attend to a single im- 
pression without flagging. That there are limits is a fact 
of daily observation. One cannot keep the attention 
directed to any line of work, however interesting or varied, 
without tiring and being compelled after a time to turn 
to something else. The length of time that one can apply 
oneself to these stronger impressions will of course vary 
with the individual, with his condition, and with the nature 
of the task. Its widest limits are marked by the length 
of the waking period of the day, and the time that can 
elapse before nourishment is required. There is no means 
of answering the question in this form. The truer test is 
how long one can attend to a single monotonous stimula- _ 
tion without losing it. When the student is engaged in 
studying even a single proposition the attention is constantly 
changing its direction and bringing out now one thing, 
now another. For stimuli of ordinary intensity there has 
been no investigation. It would probably offer a great 
many introspective difficulties, even if it were possible 
ever to reach a satisfactory result. 
Much work has been done, however, on the limits of at- 
tention to very weak stimuli, with results that are inter- 
esting both in themselves and because of the light which  
-P-A-G-E-80
  
  70 Attention 
they throw upon the general theory of attention. The 
first observations of the phenomenon were made by Urbant- 
schisch, a German specialist in diseases of the ear. While test- 
ing one of his patients for accuracy of hearing, he found that 
with no change in any of the physical relations of the sound, 
there seemed to come an alternate dying away and reap- 
pearance of the sounds, and that this alternation took place 
at fairly regular intervals. Similar experiments were set 
on foot in other senses, and it was found that there was a 
constant alternation in slight sensations from all sense 
organs. There was a constant reappearance and disappear- 
ance of the sensation no matter how strongly the attention 
was kept upon the stimulus. Many elaborate experiments 
were made upon the phenomena by Lange and others at 
Leipzig and by Miinsterberg, and all with very much the 
same results. The period of the fluctuation varies from 
3 to 25 seconds with different persons and under different 
conditions, but is very much the same for the same person 
under one set of conditions. It is slightly different for the 
different senses, but not very markedly. 
These experiments can all be repeated with great ease by 
any one. If you will hold a watch at such a distance from 
the head that its ticking is just audible, it will be noted that 
for several seconds the sounds will be heard and that they 
will then disappear for a second or so. This appearance 
and disappearance will alternate with considerable regu- 
‘larity. For sight it is most satisfactory to use a rotating 
disc of sufficient rapidity to mix colours thoroughly. If 
on a white disc of this kind you will paste a bit of black 
paper that will give a just noticeable gray ring when re- 
volved, it will be seen that the ring comes and goes in very 
much the same way as the ticking of the watch, and at 
about the same rate. A still simpler method that will 
often prove successful is to make a dot upon a bit of paper 
and move away from the paper to a distance so great that 
the dot will be barely visible. It will then be noticed that 
the image of the dot comes and goes as did the gray ring.
-P-A-G-E-81
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 71 
Any faint sensation will show the same alternations. A 
very light constant pressure, a weak electric current, or 
any other weak stimulus that suggests itself, may be used 
to advantage. 
The same rhythmic alternation shows itself when, under 
any circumstances, two nearly equal stimuli of different 
qualities which will not combine are applied at the same 
time to the same sense organ. One good instance of this 
has already been noted in an earlier chapter in connection 
with the experiments of Dr. Breese on retinal rivalry. 
The alternations between the colours presented to either 
eye go on at much the same rate, and are undoubtedly due 
to the same conditions as the coming and going of the 
faint stimulus. Dr. Breese found also that there would be 
a similar fluctuation if by means of mirrors two colours 
were thrown upon the same retinal area at the same time. 
Lange also found that if a prism were drawn in ambiguous 
perspective so that it might be interpreted to be either 
concave or convex, it would be found that the two inter- 
pretations would succeed each other at regular intervals as 
soon as both became equally familiar. The rate of fluctua- 
tion, again, is not so very different from that of the same 
individual for the minimal stimuli or for retinal rivalry. 
Memory images undergo the same change. If you will 
think intently of some simple stimulus, it will be seen that 
it does not remain permanently before the mind, but comes 
and goes rhythmically in a way similar in every respect to 
the changes shown by the weak sensation. 
Of much greater interest than the facts themselves are 
the interpretations that the different investigators have 
put upon them. These theories fall into three distinct 
classes: the theory (1) that the fluctuations are due to 
fatigue of the muscular mechanism of the sense organ or 
of the central nervous system, (2) that we have to do with 
a rhythmic activity of some special mental function like the 
attention or apperception, and (3) that there is a transfer 
in some way of the rhythms of circulation or respiration to
-P-A-G-E-82
  92 Attention 
the activity of the central nervous system. There are 
different subdivisions of each theory, and in some cases 
there has been an attempt to combine several theories in 
one. 
1. There are three forms of the fatigue theory. The oldest 
of these makes the fluctuation depend upon the fatigue 
and recovery of the muscle of accommodation in the eye, 
and of the tensor tympani in the ear. This was first pro- 
posed by Miinsterberg, and was later supported by Hein- 
rich. The second form of the theory is that it is the nerve 
itself that is fatigued, and the third is that the fatigue has 
its seat in the sensory cells of the cortex. This is the ex- 
planation offered by Professor Titchener. The first two 
forms of the theory may be disposed of very quickly. Ex- 
periments by Pace have shown that the fluctuations continue 
even after the muscle of accommodation has been deadened 
by homatropine. Dr. Slaughter experimented on a man 
who had had cataracts and had had the lenses removed, 
and found that the fluctuations still continued as in the 
normal person. In neither of these cases could there have 
been fatigue of the muscle of accommodation, and in the 
last case there was no chance for fatigue of convergence 
to play a part, as only one eye was used. Eye movements 
of sufficient size and regularity to affect the results would 
easily be observed. Moreover Miinsterberg himself has 
shown that the fluctuations go on unchanged except in 
rate during voluntary eye movements. Thus it seems im- 
probable that involuntary movements would have a dif- 
ferent effect. And if eye movements were held to account 
for the change there would be no reason for stimuli of 
greater intensity not showing the same phenomena. The 
muscles of the ear, as we have seen, probably play no part 
in the accommodation process, and we should therefore 
hardly expect fatigue to play any part in explaining the 
fluctuation in the auditory stimulus, even if Urbantschisch 
had not already shown, before Miinsterberg wrote, that a 
patient without the tympanum could still notice the fluc-
-P-A-G-E-83
/ 
  The Effects of Attention i Consciousness 73 
tuations. On the skin the muscles play so small a part 
in the perception that it would not be possible to explain 
the fluctuations by them. The theory of fatigue of the 
sensory apparatus then seems to be absolutely untenable. 
The theory of Urbantschisch that the fluctuation is the 
result of recurrent fatigue of the sensory nerve is not in 
harmony with the results of modern nerve-muscle physi- 
ology. There is no evidence that a nerve fibre is ever 
fatigued, or at least the fatigue comes on so slowly that 
it is of no value in explaining the phenomenon in question. 
A discussion of the part to be assigned to fatigue of the 
central cells can best be understood if taken in connection 
with a later theory. 
2. The theory that the fluctuations are the result of 
the periodic functioning of the attention, of appercep- 
tion, or of some other mental function, is in effect but 
a restatement of the facts in terms of a more unknown 
process, and in no sense an explanation. The observations 
which Lange made in connection with his theory, and 
which in part led him to formulate it, are of some value 
for the general explanation. These are in general the fact 
that a figure in ambiguous perspective seems to change 
its outline in connection with a regular alternation of the 
accompanying ideas in mind. Just before the convex 
pyramid becomes concave there is a change in the domi- 
nant idea from a support or weight to a receptacle of some 
kind, or if the object drawn in ambiguous perspective is 
a flight of stairs the ideas would change from thinking of 
walking upon them to an idea of some kind of shelter from 
the rain. His theory was that there was a periodic change 
in the ideas, and that this periodicity resulted in the cor- 
responding change in the interpretation of the drawing. 
Later he came to speak of it as due to a periodic function- 
ing of apperception. This is of course nothing more than 
a verbal expression for the fact that there is a rhythm in 
the perception. As we have seen, nothing is known of a 
force which could be subject to a change of this kind. The
-P-A-G-E-84
    74 Attention 
facts are equally well explained on the assumption that 
there is a periodic fatigue and recovery of the nerve cells 
which reinforces one interpretation or the other. When 
the cells that have made for the interpretation of the figure 
as convex are fatigued, their activity is cancelled by the 
action of the cells that turn the interpretation to make the 
figure concave. These two sets of cells, as first one, then 
the other, is fatigued and recovers, are sufficient to decide 
between the two interpretations equally favoured by the 
objective conditions. At the same time, however, there 
is undoubtedly a corresponding fatigue in the cells which 
are actually involved in the sensation or perception. From 
this simple physiological point of view the theory of Lange 
and the theory of Professor Titchener become practically 
identical. 
Eckener suggested the theory that there are two kinds 
of fluctuations of the attention, one objective, the other 
subjective ; but later authorities seem not to accept the 
distinction as valid. Dr. Hylan recently revived the theory 
and. attempted to prove that the objective fluctuations 
were due to the fatigue of the mechanism of accommoda- 
tion, the other to some central change. His only ground 
for the assumption is that during the time that the minimal 
stimulus cannot be perceived, it is still possible to imagine 
the corresponding sensation. This he thinks shows that 
the central cells are capable of receiving the impression 
when the stimulus is imperceptible. A very slight exami- 
nation shows the flimsy character of the argument. We ° 
must of course assume that the central cells would respond 
to an impression of moderate intensity during their period 
of least sensitiveness, and it is apparent from daily experi- 
ence that it is possible for the central stimuli from asso- 
ciation to excite the cells more strongly than the minimal 
excitation from the external world. In that case a memory 
image would occur during the time that the cells were too 
exhausted for an external stimulus of such small inten- 
sity to be perceived at all.
-P-A-G-E-85
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 75 
But there is still needed to complete the explanation 
some factor that will account for the regularity of the fluc- 
tuation. It does not seem probable that a cell would of 
itself grow fatigued and recover with such constancy. The 
suggestion of Exner, Roy and Sherrington, and Patrizi, con- 
firmed by the experiments of Dr. Slaughter, fill this gap. 
These distinguished physiologists suggested independently 
that attention waves are probably connected with Traube- 
Hering waves. Dr. Slaughter found as the result of a 
number of experiments that the alternations were corre- 
lated with changes in circulation and respiration. The 
most frequent rate of fluctuation he found to run parallel 
with a rhythmic increase and decrease of the volume of the 
finger. This change in volume is produced by the con- 
traction and relaxation of the muscles in the walls of the 
arteries. It is controlled again by the rhythmic action 
of a centre in the medulla, as was shown conclusively by 
the discoverers, Traube and Hering. These Traube- 
Hering waves run through a complete cycle in from 6 to 
15 seconds, but in a time of mental strain, as during the 
period of concentration required to mark the fluctuations, 
their rate is kept pretty constantly at the shorter period. 
This corresponds very closely to the time given by most 
investigators as the average length of the attention wave. 
Mr. Taylor rendered the explanation even more probable 
by showing that the waves change their rate when the 
organism is affected by various kinds of stimuli, in very 
much the same way that the respiration and pulse rates 
do. So, if while watching the gray rings on a disc the sub- 
ject is stimulated by an electric current, there will be either 
an increase or a decrease in the period of fluctuation de- 
pending upon the intensity of the stimulus. Muscular 
exertion, strong odours, and even mental excitement, have 
the same effect. Dr. Breese, in the work mentioned above 
on retinal rivalry, found that the rate of change in the 
alternation was influenced by the intensity of the illumina- 
tion of the fields and by the contraction of muscles in dif-
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 Attention 
ferent parts of the body, but he did not offer any explana- 
tion for the phenomenon. Further confirmation of this 
theory is offered by Mr. Galloway’s results that the length 
of the Traube-Hering waves is always increased by sen- 
sory stimulation in subjects whose attention waves are 
also lengthened. He also finds that in three individuals 
the average length of attention and vaso-motor waves is 
almost identical. ['] All these results serve to make more 
plausible the theory that the fluctuations are closely con- 
nected with the vaso-motor rhythm. 
Lehmann had already shown that the waves were closely 
related to the changes in respiration. In an investigation 
of the relation he found that the great majority of changes 
in the perception, whether towards appearance or disap- 
pearance, took place in a particular phase of the respira- 
tory process—at the beginning of inspiration. There was, 
however, no relation between the length of the two rhythms. 
Mr. Taylor confirmed Lehmann’s results in this regard, 
and Dr. Slaughter discovered one subject whose attention 
waves were of the same length as the respiratory cycle. It 
would seem then that the breathing rhythm takes the 
place of the Traube-Hering wave in some individuals, 
and that in the others it has an influence in determining 
the place of change by prolonging the time of perceptibility 
during the active part of the respiratory process after the 
effect of the longer wave has disappeared. 
Both Dr. Slaughter and Mr. Taylor found indications of 
a still longer wave also correlated with a longer circula- 
tory rhythm of unknown origin. In one person this be- 
came the predominant element, and determined the length 
of the attention wave as a whole ; in most persons, how- 
ever, it showed itself only in a rhythmical increase and 
decrease of the primary wave, the mental correlate of the 
Traube-Hering wave. The length of this wave is approxi- 
mately 25 seconds, and is probably identical with the long- 
est of the waves mentioned in the literature of the earlier 
period of investigation. Dr. Bonser has confirmed the 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 77 
relation between the Traube-Hering and the attention 
waves. [7] 
If we can feel assured of the fact of a close relation in 
time between these physiological rhythms and the atten- 
tion waves, there is yet to be faced the problem of the 
explanation of the facts and of bringing them into harmony 
with the well-established parts of the other theories. Prob- 
ably it is simplest to think of the physiological rhythms 
as merely marking off the temporal relations of the fluctu- 
ations, while the variations themselves are due to fatigue of 
the cells involved in the sensation, either as the correlate 
of the sensation itself or of the reinforcing influence. We 
might think of the cases of attention to a minimal stimulus 
as due entirely to some reinforcing influence from the cells 
of the medulla, that when the reinforcement was strongest 
it was possible to perceive more accurately than when it 
was weakest ; but when we consider the cases of retinal 
rivalry, and of the alteration in the interpretation of a 
figure drawn in ambiguous perspective, it is evident that 
this will not suffice. There is no reason to assume that 
one set of nerve cells, whethér those correlated with the 
sensation itself or with related ideas, will be subject to the 
reinforcement and not the other; and there is no reason 
why one should be weak while the other is strong, and vice 
versa. If, however, it is a fatigueBprocess, the first set of 
cells involved would become fatigued during the first period, 
and would be overcome in their influence by the fresh cells 
that were in every respect as ready to be thrown into exci- 
tation as the first. That the substitution should come in 
the same rhythm as the physiological process would be 
due merely to the fact that the sudden decrease in the re- 
inforcing process would still further increase the effect of 
fatigue. The fatigue plus the decrease in the reinforce- 
ment are together sufficient to give the rested cells an ad- 
vantage. Here the physiological rhythm would be the 
influence that gives regularity to the fluctuation. It is 
but one element in the total complex of determining factors.
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 Attention 
We can bring the apparently simpler case under the 
same head if we think of the minimal stimulus as one of 
the opposed members of the pair, and all of the other sti- 
muli that are possible objects of the attention as the oppos- 
ing member. The fresh cells that should replace those 
fatigued during the attending to the gray ring, would be 
those that were appealed to by any objective or subjective 
stimulus, not some particular one. This, too, would then 
be a case of alternate fatigue and recovery in cortical cells, 
and the physiological rhythm would be but the agent in 
determining the rate of change. 
There are again two ways in which it is possible to think 
of the activity of the vaso-motor centre as influencing the 
central nerve cells. The first suggestion would be that 
there was an increase in the activity of the cells when the 
cerebral blood-vessels were in one state of relaxation or 
contraction, and a decrease in the activity when the blood 
vessels were in the opposite phase. There are several 
objections to this view from a consideration of the general 
physiological principles known to be involved. In the 
first place, it is regarded as doubtful if the nerve cell 
would be so quickly affected by change in the blood about 
it. Probably at the lowest stage of blood supply there is 
a sufficient amount to permit the cell to be completely nour- 
ished, and any increase would be in excess of the demands. 
A fuller discussion of the objections to a theory of this kind 
must be given in a later chapter in connection with the 
circulatory theory of attention in general. We shall be 
satisfied here with the statement that there are grave doubts 
as to the validity of the theory in terms of blood supply, 
and proceed to discuss the other explanation. 
The second explanation is in terms of the spread of ner- 
vous activity from the cells in the vaso-motor centre in 
the medulla to the central nerve cells as a whole. The 
picture of the spread of activity must be developed in detail 
later, but we may look upon it for the present as of very 
much the same kind as the spread of energy from one
-P-A-G-E-89
  
The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 79 
motor cell to another. It is found in general that if two 
groups of muscles are excited both will respond more 
vigorously than if either alone is excited. A greater pres- 
sure can be exerted upon a dynamometer, even if held in 
one hand, if the other hand is contracted at the same time 
with the one which holds the instrument. There is similar 
reinforcement in case any other muscle is contracted. 
More closely related to the phenomenon in question is the 
effect that the vaso- motor rhythm exerts upon the heart 
rate. It is found that the rapidity of the pulse increases 
and decreases at regular intervals in time with the Traube- 
Hering waves. This effect can only be explained in terms 
of an overflow from the vaso-motor centre upon the centre 
that controls the heart rate—the vagus centre. The 
respiratory impulse spreads to the heart centre in the 
same way, and also to the vaso-motor centre. To assume 
that there is a similar overflow to the cells of the cortex 
is but to extend the explanation in degree, not to change 
the principle. 
A complete theory of the attention waves then would 
involve three of those given above. A fatigue of the cor- 
tical cells that are the accompaniments of the sensations 
themselves, a fatigue of the reinforcing cortical cells which 
correspond to the ideas which Lange found to precede the 
change in the fluctuations in the interpretation of figures 
drawn in ambiguous perspective, and finally the physio- 
logical rhythms which originate in the circulatory and 
respiratory centres in the medulla. No one alone is suffi- 
cient, but all taken together seem to furnish an explanation 
for nearly all the points which the experiments cover. 
Recently Hammer and Ferree have suggested that the 
visual attention wave is to be explained in terms of retinal 
adaptation coupled with eye movement: that the retina 
becomes exhausted during steady fixation, and the impres- 
sion is brought back by slight eye movements. The weak 
points in the suggestions are : (1) that the attention waves 
are found where the object fixated is too small to be con-
-P-A-G-E-90
80 Attention 
stantly fixated, if we accept the results of McAllister that 
the eye is continually making movements of several angular 
minutes ; (2) that there is no reason why eye movements 
should occur with the regularity that attention waves 
show. 
Hammer also asserts that with sounds of constant inten- 
sity the auditory waves are not present. This, however, 
is contradictory to the results of other investigators with 
equal control of sound intensity, as Dunlap, Seashore, and 
Jackson, and observers in my own laboratory. 
Heinrich and a pupil have brought forward additional 
proof of the Miinsterberg peripheral fatigue theory. For 
sounds Heinrich finds that noises fluctuate, tones do not. 
This he would explain on the assumption referred to in 
Chapter II, that the tensor-tympani accommodates for 
noises, not for pure tones. Ostmann, however, found that 
intense sounds alone produce changes in the muscle, and 
the lower limit of response is far higher than would be 
necessary to justify Heinrich’s theory. Visual fluctuations 
seem, according to Heinrich’s results, to correspond to 
changes in the lens. 
All the explanations of these later observers are incon- 
sistent in ways that the authors have not considered with 
tesults previously obtained. While, then, one must admit 
that the question is still open to dispute, there seems no 
reason to assume that these fluctuations are not central, 
as the earlier experimenters demonstrated them to be. 
There are two other effects of attention upon the tem- 
poral aspects of consciousness which need to be considered 
briefly. In the first place, attention seems to hasten the 
entrance into mind of the idea attended to. The classical 
experiments in this connection were performed by Wundt, 
and were later repeated by Professor Angell and Dr. Pierce. 
In outline these consisted in comparing the time at 
which a single impression entered consciousness from one 
sense with the entrance of some one of a series of impres- 
sions received through another sense. Usually the con-
-P-A-G-E-91
  The Effects of Attention in Consciousness 81 
crete experiment has been to decide where a moving pointer 
stands upon a dial when a sound is heard. It is found that 
by attending to the sound it is possible to hasten its en- 
trance by from ‘020 to ‘o60 seconds, while attention to 
the dial and pointer delays the entrance of the sound, and 
hastens the entrance of the visual impression. The results 
were also modified by the rate at which the different sounds 
succeed each other, by the number of impressions that 
were given at once, and by the senses that are used in the 
comparison. All of these circumstances may be thought 
to have an effect through their influence in determining 
the ease and accuracy with which we can attend to the 
stimuli. 
The influence was one of those which played a part in 
the personal equation of the astronomer in the old method 
of taking the transit of a star by the eye-and-ear-method. 
The astronomer watched for the passage of the star across 
_ the wire of his telescope, and at the same time tried to de- 
termine the relation of the observation to the strokes of 
a bell that marked the seconds. Each observer developed 
a peculiar habit of attending during the process, one chiefly 
to the visual impression, the other mainly to the sounds 
of the bell, and each obtained correspondingly different 
results. The differences were great enough to lead to 
confusion in the observation, and finally brought about the 
abandonment of the method and the substitution of a 
registration method which makes the personal error more 
constant, and more nearly alike for all observers. 
The small difference that is shown always to be present 
by the experimental method corresponds very closely to 
the fact that we all notice very frequently in daily life that 
a sensation not attended to comes to mind very slowly. 
So frequently when working we will rouse ourselves to re- 
member that the clock has struck some time ago. In a 
case of this kind the sound has often been kept from con- 
sciousness for several minutes by the fact that the atten- 
tion was already engrossed by some other matter. All 
G 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
82 Attention 
the physical and physiological conditions for the entrance 
to consciousness, other than those involved in attention, 
have been completed, as is shown by the persistence of the 
impression below the threshold for such a long period and 
its final entrance into mind. 
Another effect of the attention that deserves mention 
is its influence upon the rapidity of movements. It has 
been found that the reaction time is considerably shortened 
when the attention is complete, as compared with a period 
of relaxed attention. Professor Cattell found that there 
was a difference of from two to three hundredths of a second 
between the length of a simple reaction when the attention 
was voluntarily relaxed and when voluntarily strained 
upon the stimulus to which the reaction was to be made. 
In the same way any stimulus that distracts the attention 
has a very marked influence upon the time of the reaction. 
An irrelevant noise at the moment that the reaction was 
to be made might increase the time of the reaction by eight 
hundredths of a second. 
Another experiment of similar import has reference to 
the preparation of the attention. It is found that unless 
the attention is aroused by a suitable signal, given about 
two seconds before the stimulus that is to call out the re- 
action, that the movement does not reach its maximum 
quickness. The signal gives the highest degree of adapta- 
tion of the attention, and so is but a sub-head under the 
preceding. , It is also significant that the period by which 
the signal must precede the stimulus is nearly half of the 
length of an attention wave, so that part of the adapta- 
tion may consist in the time it takes for the attention to 
tise to its highest point.

   SUMMARY 
     
      1. The number of separate objects that can be attended 
to is four or five for vision, five to eight for audition. But 
probably this result is to be interpreted to mean that the 
result of a single glance persists long enough for four or five 
attention to take place. 
€ act of attention is from 3 om 
24 seconds ; most usually 5 to 8 seconds. 
3. These fluctuati i © be explained 
in part by the fatigue of cortical cells ; in part, so far as 
the length is concerned, by the overflow of the rhythms 
of the respiratory and vaso-motor centres of the medulla 
upon the cortical cells. 
       
    4. Attention increases the quickness of entrance of a 
sensation to consciousness, and shortens the reaction time.

CHAPTER VI 
THE METHODS OF MEASURING ATTENTION 
N recent years many attempts have been made to find 
ways of comparing the mental capacities of indivi- 
duals. The ultimate end of the attempts has usually been 
practical in its character. Education and psychiatry, as 
well as many more immediately practical fields, would be 
much benefited were it possible accurately to measure 
the attainments and capacities of individuals in advance 
of actual trials, or even to draw a sharp line between 
the normal and the abnormal. Obviously, if one could by 
a series of tests decide in the psychological laboratory what 
children were capable of profiting by different kinds of 
training, select men for the various employments of life, 
and say for legal purposes what men should be confined in 
asylums, psychology would become a practically important 
science. While the advance that has been made is not yet 
remarkable enough to justify the assertion that we are near 
the goal, it may be worth while to consider the results so 
far as they concern attention. For attention, as one of 
the central mental processes, has shared to a considerable 
extent in the lists of tests. 
There are two great difficulties in the way of selecting 
tests for attention. The first is that it is almost impossible 
to discover tests that shall give the basal capacity for atten- 
tion, rather than some special facility that has been acquired 
through training. In the second place, it is almost impos- 
sible to find a test that shall not in part depend upon other 
capacities—upon the acuteness of the sense organ, upon 
84
-P-A-G-E-95
  The Methods of Measuring Attention 85 
the retentiveness of memory, quickness of motor response, 
or some other extraneous capacity—that really accounts 
for the difference between individuals, which on the gross 
result of the test we should be inclined to attribute to the 
attention. There can be no certain method of differentia- 
ting the two processes involved. 
Tests of attention may be divided into three groups. 
One sort of test would measure the adequacy of attention 
directly in terms of the amount of accomplishment in some 
task that involves attention in as high degree as possible. 
A second makes some secondary change in the course ‘of 
the operation stand as a measure of attention. So, for 
example, the fluctuations of the minimal stimuli or stimu- 
lus differences, and the variability in the performance from 
moment to moment, have been used in this connection. 
The third general group would make the breaking strain, 
or the amount of stimulus that is necessary to distract at- 
tention, the gauge of the strength of attention. Each of 
these may again be divided into sub-classes, in so far as 
they are adapted now to the determination of the capacity 
for attention over long intervals, and now to brief acts of 
attending, or to pulses of attention. 
1. The more important tests of the first class that 
have been used are the discrimination of two points 
on the skin, reaction times, memory span, the time, accu- 
racy and number of observations necessary for copying 
figures, letters and geometrical patterns, counting dots, 
marking the letters of one kind in a page of a foreign lan- 
guage or printer’s “‘ pie,” and filling out omissions in a dis- 
course. Each of these tests is open in some degree to both 
of the objections that were mentioned above. Perhaps 
the most complete test that has been made of them is by 
Binet. [*] 
Binet chose for his subjects eleven school children, who 
had been divided by their master into five bright and six 
dull. It was assumed that the intelligent children would 
have greater powers of attending than dull, and that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
86 Attention 
degree with which the results of the experiments harmon- 
’ ised with that assumption could be regarded as significant 
of the value of the test. If we run through each of the 
tests, partly with reference to his results and partly to 
a priori considerations, it will be seen that each is open to 
the objections mentioned above. The accuracy of dis- 
criminating two points upon the skin is open to both objec- 
tions. It is known that the points just noticeable as two 
are at shorter distances after practice than before, and 
also that the accuracy varies from individual to individual, 
and in places very close together in the same individual, 
merely because of the distribution of the sensory nerve 
endings. As a measure of fatigue it has been found en- 
tirely unsatisfactory by recent workers, and it is highly 
probable that attention must be subject to fatigue in high 
degree. Binet found this “limen of twoness”’ [*] one of his 
most significant tests, but only, it must be confessed, in the 
earlier experiments of the series. With practice bright 
and dull pupils became very much alike. The differences 
disappeared at the third set of measurements. [7] 
Very much the same assertions must be made of reac- 
tion times. As we have seen, in any given individual, re- 
action times are shorter when close attention is given, but 
apparently any individual is capable of attending to so 
practical a process as the reaction in sufficient degree to 
give his maximum rate of response. Then, too, natural 
motor quickness undoubtedly cuts across the influence of 
attention, and it is difficult to say that any difference may 
not be due to that rather than to attention. Reaction times, 
again, are subject to training very markedly, and while 
perhaps few individuals are specifically trained in them, 
it is not yet demonstrated that training in neighbouring 
fields might not have sufficient influence to destroy the 
significance of the result. The theoretical refutation is 
not necessary, as both Binet and Whipple [3] have found in 
practice that simple reaction times are not significant. The 
more complicated forms of reaction times, choice and asso-
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Methods of Measuring Attention 87 
ciation times, are more significant in showing mental dif- 
ferences, but the processes involved get farther and farther 
away from attention as they become more complicated. 
They involve, it is true, related processes, but the thing 
measured would not be identical with what was measured 
in the other tests. 
The memory span again depends in part upon attention, 
but it also depends in part upon native retentiveness, and 
one could not say what was due to one, what to the other, 
in any given result. The copying test in its various forms 
is in part dependent upon memory, and is still further 
influenced by special training in attending to one thing 
rather than toanother. The artist copies much more quickly 
than the layman because he has been trained to see as well 
as because he has been trained to do. The method of 
counting dots was significant at first for Binet, but was 
found to be very closely related to training. As a result 
the unintelligent did as well as the intelligent after a very 
brief period of practice. Chance training in this test then 
could obscure any defect of attention that might be present. 
The Ebinghaus method of filling in omissions in connected 
discourse has proved successful as a measure of fatigue and 
of intelligence in general, but it is too little dependent upon 
attention in any strict sense to be considered in any detail 
here. The detection of the omissions could be regarded 
as a function of attention; the process of supplementa- 
tion, however, would involve more general, if related, 
processes of understanding what was intended and asso- 
ciation processes in supplying the omitted words. 
Perhaps the most satisfactory method of all that come 
under this head, is the marking of the “a’s”’ on a page of 
print. It has been used frequently with satisfactory re- 
sults, and is open to few theoretical objections. There 
is more dependence upon the quickness and certainty of 
noticing the sensory elements relatively to the extraneous 
motor and other processes ; it is dependent on an activity 
that is relatively rarely subjected to special training, and
-P-A-G-E-98
88 Attention 
  such general training, from reading, e.g., as is beneficial, is 
practically universal and equally common to all. The 
only extraneous element that is important is motor quick- 
ness, and this plays a much smaller part relatively here 
than do the disturbing and variable factors in the other 
tests. 
This list does not, of course, exhaust the possible tests. 
Any operation that can be subjected to measurement is 
certain to involve attention in some degree, and so might 
be regarded as a measure. Any of the usual Weber’s law 
experiments might be used, as might any of the other 
memory experiments. The tests that have been mentioned 
are those that have been used most frequently. 
2. Of the second group,Wiersma, Heymans, and the author 
have made use of the attention wave as a measure of fatigue, 
in a way that should also show variations in the capacity 
for attention. The ratio of the period of visibility to the 
period of invisibility was taken as a measure of perceptive 
capacity, and it was found that this varied with the state 
of rest or fatigue of the subject and his general mental con- 
dition. It would probably be an accurate indication of the 
general adequacy of attention, apart from any special train- 
ing. This is particularly probable in view of the fact 
proved by Marbe, confirmed by Wiersma, that the ratio 
increased with increase in the intensity of external stimu- 
lus. The disadvantage of the method is that you cannot 
compare one individual with another with any degree of 
certainty. The ratio of the periods would vary so much 
with the acuteness of sense organs that any influence of 
attention would be lost in the other variation. Perhaps 
a truer test would be the amount of distracting stimulus 
that would bring about a decrease in the ratio of visibility 
to the total time. It will be remembered from the discus- 
sion of attention waves in an earlier chapter, that the time 
of visibility was first increased and then diminished by any 
extraneous stimulus. Moderate stimuli ordinarily increase 
the period; stronger stimuli decrease it. The strength
-P-A-G-E-99
    The Methods of Measuring Attention 89 
of the exciting stimulus that could be endured without 
producing a decrease in the period of visibility might serve 
as a measure of the capacity of the individual to attend 
against distraction which is at least one form of effective- 
ness in attention, if not the same capacity that has been 
measured by the methods discussed above. 
Another method, related to the preceding in so far as 
it uses a variation in the continuous accomplishment as 
the measure of attention, has been suggested by Oehrn. [*] 
It is that we use the mean variation, the average departure 
from the average accomplishment, as a measure of the 
degree of attending. If we make any series of measure- 
ments under the same objective conditions, it will be found 
that no two are exactly alike, and in one series the varia- 
tions from the average will be large, in another small. 
Since the objective conditions are alike, the variation 
must be in the subjective factors, most important of which 
is attention. The mean variation would then indicate 
variation in degree of attention, and since that is assumed 
to be variation from a maximum, it follows that the mean 
variation indicates the degree of attention during the 
series. The results of any experiment whatever, properly 
interpreted, would furnish a measure of attention. There 
are probably other factors involved in the variation than 
attention, and it is by no means certain that the greatest 
variation would come with least attention, but it is a 
measure that is promising for further testing. 
3. The third form of test was first suggested by Kraepe- 
lin, [5] although independently by Kiilpe, and was tested by 
the latter, Miinsterberg, and Miss Hamlin, having already 
been experimented upon by Bertels, at the suggestion of 
Kraepelin. The method was suggested to Kraepelin by 
the fact that what most clearly marked off the insane 
from the sane was the ease of distractibility. They can- 
not long be held to any one thing. Effective attention, 
on the contrary, is marked by ability to attend in spite of 
difficulties. Kraepelin suggested then that if one could 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  go Attention 
measure the amount of stimulus necessary to distract 
from a task of any kind, we would know how much atten- 
tion was being given to the operation. The suggestion 
was seconded by Kiilpe, and practically tested by him- 
self, Miinsterberg, Miss Hamlin, Mr. Moyer, and Miss Birch. 
All used as the primary task comparison of two liminal 
stimuli, and as distracting stimulus mental computation, 
counting the strokes of a metronome, or identifying odours. 
In each of the investigations the primary operation required 
but an instant of concentrated attention, and as a con- 
sequence it was found to be performed in some interval 
of the distracting process. The only exception was in 
some experiments of Miss Birch, where the attention de- 
manded by the recognition of odours was sufficiently ab- 
sorbing to prevent noticing one or the other of the two 
stimuli to be compared. In the other experiments the 
distraction served rather to increase the attention given 
momentarily to the comparison, and the experiments 
failed of their purpose. Miss Sharp [°] applied the method 
to experiments that should produce continuous distrac- 
tion, and with satisfactory results. It was found that 
if one attempted to read aloud, and at the same time write 
a” or the alphabet, there was a considerable loss of time 
as compared with the time required for reading alone, and 
that the more complicated operations delayed the reading 
more than the simple. In each of the actual investigations 
that have been carried out there has been failure to comply 
strictly with the conditions that Kraepelin set. In no one 
of them were the subjects working with full attention to 
one task alone, to be distracted in part by some extra- 
neous stimulus that should draw him against his will. In 
each, on the contrary, there is merely an attempt to attend 
to two things at the same time, each of which is known in 
advance by the subject. It is a problem in the distribu- 
tion of attention rather than in distraction, and it is known 
that attention can be distributed successively only, not 
simultaneously. Probably, however, as Stern [7] has pointed
-P-A-G-E-101
  The Methods of Measuring Attention gl 
out, it would be very difficult to realise Kraepelin’s condi- 
lions that the object attended to should be the only thing 
the observer was prepared for, and the distracting stimu- 
lus should always come unexpectedly and unwillingly. 
At best, the distracting stimulus could be given but rarely 
under those circumstances, if the observer is not to suspect 
it is really a part of the experiment and become prepared 
for it as one part of the regular task. 
And even were all of these difficulties overcome, it would 
be no easy matter to measure the amount of distraction 
that could be attributed to the stimulus. This would not 
depend altogether upon the physical intensity, but must 
vary from individual to individual with the amount of 
interest that the process could excite. Probably, after 
long practice, it would be possible to arrange stimuli in 
the order of their distracting effect for one individual, but 
the series must be worked out anew for each individual, 
and this before the experiments on measuring attention 
could be begun. When the preliminaries were out of the 
way, there would already have been determined one set 
of values for attention, and the distraction method would 
be needed to answer but one small part of the problem. 
The value of the distraction would depend upon the way 
the stimulus attracted attention. One must therefore 
measure attention before the distraction values can be 
determined. It would probably be almost as satisfactory 
to make the test by the first direct method and very much 
quicker. 
Each of the three methods is still in a tentative, experi- 
mental stage. There is no one of them that does not re- 
quire extended use before it can be asserted that it is applic- 
able, or if applicable how satisfactory it may prove. Before 
much can be accomplished it will probably be necessary 
to work out a long series of comparisons between different 
methods, so that results obtained by one method may be 
comparable with those obtained in others. Attention, in fact, 
is a word that covers so many different processes that no 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 Attention 
single test will probably ever be devised that shall measure 
all the part processes satisfactorily. Now we mean capa- 
city for attending in general without reference to any single 
content, which may not exist at all. Again, we may mean 
capacity for long continued attention under difficulties, 
and we may mean ability for accurate observation in some 
one field, or even a determination of the field in which the 
individual as he is at any one time can attend most easily 
and effectively. Tests of any one of these capacities might 
be called tests of attention, and yet a test for one would 
throw very little light upon any other. One cannot say 
that any one is more valuable than any other, to say nothing 
of asserting that one measures attention and the other 
does not. The tests that have been developed do not dis- 
tinguish between these different phases, and have not been 
adapted one to one phase, another to another. 
If we may be permitted to suggest tests on a priori 
grounds, with the full consciousness that any suggestion 
must be tried time and time again before one can be at 
all certain of its value, some such distribution as the fol- 
lowing may prevent our coming to an entirely negative 
conclusion. Ability to attend against odds might be 
measured roughly by one of the distraction methods, or 
perhaps more easily by the method of recording attention 
waves and noting when the period of visibility was dimin- 
ished by an extraneous stimulus. The capacity for atten- 
tion due to training would require a test of ability to notice 
some element of a complex that was perceivable with diffi- 
culty, and the test would needs be different for each pro- 
vince of perception to be measured. The most general of 
these tests is apparently marking some one letter or letters, 
preferably on a page of some unfamiliar language. Natural 
acquired interest could be tested by presenting a large 
assortment of objects, and requesting the subject to select 
those that were first noticed. A very similar test in a re- 
lated field is to ask the individual to describe what is seen 
in an ink blot, or to draw the first figure that comes to
-P-A-G-E-103
  The Methods of Measuring Attention 93 
ind by Royce’s method. Capacity for attention in general 
s inherited, and not in any way due to training, probably 
could not be analysed from the complex. The nearest 
lapproximation could perhaps be given by averaging a num- 
ber of tests in which the individuals had been as little 
trained as possible. A thorough test in all of these re- 
spects would, of course, give a measure not alone of atten- 
tion, but of general intelligence and capacity as well, a 
conclusion that harmonises with the far-reaching relations 
of attention discovered on the theoretical side. 
SUMMARY 
Measures of attention may be divided into three groups : 
direct, by means of accomplishments in some operation 
or other ; indirect, by fluctuations of attention or by the 
mean variation in a set of measurements ; and by the 
amount of stimulus necessary for distraction. 
No one of the methods is altogether satisfactory, and 
no two measure the same capacity. 
Taken together they aid in giving a knowledge of the 
capacity of an individual, but they all need further investi- 
gation and comparison one with another before they can 
be regarded as satisfactory.

CHAPTER VII 
ATTENTION AND IDEAS 
  TTENTION is effective not only in determining 
what sensations shall come into consciousness, 
but it also has an effect in controlling the course of sen- 
sations once in mind upon their return to consciousness. 
We have to deal not merely with the sensorial attention, 
but also with intellectual attention, to use the somewhat 
objectionable terms of the older psychology. By intel- 
lectual in this connection, however, we mean to indicate 
no higher or more important form of mental processes, 
but merely to designate those which come to mind without 
external stimulation, but in accordance with purely men- 
tal laws. They include the fundamental processes of 
memory and imagination, and in fact all processes other 
than perception. 
That attention does play a considerable part in control- 
ling the course of these processes is evident from the sim- 
plest observations of our daily life. We very often catch 
ourselves studying the field of thought in much the same 
way that we study a landscape, or the field of sensation. 
There is the same apparent running the mental eye over 
some scene that was real years ago, the same series of 
strain sensations, the same successive coming into clear 
consciousness of one feature after another that is so familiar 
in the so-called sensorial attention. All these facts, then, 
point to an identity with, or at least some relation to, the 
phases of attention that we have already considered, and 
suggest that it may be possible to bring the centrally ex- 
94
-P-A-G-E-105
  Attention and Ideas 95 
cited ideas into close connection with the simple percep- 
tions. 
We must, in beginning the work, undertake an exami- 
nation of the nature of the raw material of the ideas, and 
attempt to determine the conditions which govern their 
entrance. While we could in a large measure take for 
granted the action of the external objects upon the ner- 
vous system, and start with the sensation as already in 
mind, it is not so easy to assume an immediate knowledge 
of the way in which impressions once vanished return to 
consciousness. There is a greater difference between the 
popular and the scientific conception of the matter, and 
also, be it confessed, a greater variety of opinion among 
scientists. 
The treatment of centrally aroused ideas is rendered 
easier by the present day assumption that memory images 
and the original sensation are of precisely the same char- 
acter. The memory of the face of a friend seen years ago 
is of precisely the same kind as the visual impression of 
the face. Our mental image of the old homestead is not 
different in outline or colouring from the perception of our 
childhood, and what variations there are in details are only 
sufficient to prevent confusion between memories and 
perceptions. In fact, recent work by Professor Kiilpe [7] 
proves that centrally excited sensations are very easily 
confused with peripherally excited at slight degrees of 
intensity. Trained psychologists, in many instances, could 
not decide correctly whether to call faint sensations from 
the eye or skin real impressions or imaginations. A de- 
cision could be made only on the basis of secondary char- 
acteristics, such as the stability of the impression or the 
after-image which is left. We seem to be justified in calling 
the elements of both memory image and perception, sen- 
sations, as Kiilpe has suggested. 
It would render our statement much stronger if we could 
affirm positively that the same cortical cells were involved 
in memory as in perception. A decision in regard to this
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 Attention 
point would seem to depend largely upon an interpreta- 
tion of pathological cases. If we could find patients suf- 
fering from loss of memories of a certain kind, and still 
capable of perceptions from the same sense organ, we would 
probably have to grant that there were separate memory 
centres ; if, on the other hand, memory and perception 
disappeared together in every instance, we could assume 
that memory was merely the re-excitation of the parts 
of the cortex originally excited in perception. Unfortu- 
nately, however, there is so little agreement as to the mean- 
ing of observed phenomena, that we cannot say that either 
opinion is generally held. The patients are usually very 
little skilled in introspection, and so are often incapable of 
deciding whether they remember the object in terms of 
the same sense which is affected in perception or not. It 
is perfectly possible that a man who has lost his visual sen- 
sations through injury of the visual area of the cortex 
could remember the objects once seen by means of the 
words they had previously suggested, or from the tactual 
sensations which had been received from them, and still 
be incapable of seeing them. Unless accustomed to study- 
ing his mental imagery, he would not notice the change in 
the material of his ideas, and might very easily assert that 
he could picture the object to himself as well as ever. 
In the light of so much uncertainty in the pathological 
evidence, it would seem that we are justified in looking 
to the facts of normal life in deciding the question. One 
consideration appears so be decisive. That is the close 
connection which must exist between the area which re- 
' ceives the sensation and all other sensory areas, including 
even the memory centre, if we assume that it exists. We 
never have a sensory impression that is not connected 
with very many returned sensations. This we shall see 
in detail in the next chapter, and may take for granted 
now on the basis of a few simple facts in perception. When 
you feel an object 'in the dark you do not merely feel it, 
but also have a mass of impressions from vision which 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
Attention and Ideas 97 
are called up, and which make the impression what it is 
You see with the mind’s eye before you feel assured of the 
real nature of the impression. When you hear a dog bark 
at a distance, you again have a picture of the dog at the 
time the impression is received. And so, in general, any 
impression that is received does not come in alone, but 
has connected with it a mass of remembered impressions 
which give it a great part of the form and content, which 
change it from a mere sensation to an object. You can- 
not, then, separate the sensation of peripheral origin from 
the centrally aroused sensation, and it is very difficult to 
decide how much is mere sensation and how much is mem- 
ory image in any given case. And similarly you cannot 
cut the memory image off from the sensation. If there 
is a different area at the basis of the memory, it must at 
least be excited simultaneously with the sensory area, or 
there would be no possibility of its re-excitation at the 
time of recall. But if both the memory area and the sen- 
sory area are in activity when the sensation is received, 
who can say which is responsible for the sensation ? Both 
centres must be involved in perceiving as well as in re- 
membering, and this indissolubility in function constitutes 
unity in the only meaning that can be given to the term. 
The close connection between the memory image and the 
perception compels us to assume a constancy of interaction 
between the corresponding cortical areas that, in practice 
at least, makes them indistinguishable. 
If, then, centrally and peripherally aroused sensations 
are of the same nature, and are due to the excitation of 
the same cortical cells, the only important difference would 
lie in the way in which they are brought to consciousness. 
We may, in fact, think of remembering as merely a second 
excitation of the nervous elements originally involved 
in the sensation. 
The second activity can be said to be an expression of 
the general biological law that any tissue will do more 
easily later whatever has once been performed. The only °

difficulty which remains, then, is to determine the con- 
ditions which lead to the renewed activity. 
Assuming as our starting-point that we are dealing with 
a process of exactly the same kind as in the preceding chap- 
ters, our first problem is to consider the way in which the 
raw material of memory comes to consciousness, the laws 
of entrance of the centrally excited sensation, and the 
ways in which its entrance may be influenced by the atten- 
tion. The centrally excited sensations, like the peripheral, 
have their primary origin in the senses, come in from the 
external world ; but their return demands a new set of 
conditions distinct from those that lead to the entrance 
of the original sensations. The laws which determine the 
entrance of the stored impressions, and which correspond 
to the laws of the physical world for the original sensations, 
are known as the laws of association. Just as the external 
world offers an immense number of impressions to the 
mind from which certain elements are selected by the at- 
tention, so association may be said to offer the mind num- 
bers of re-entering impressions from which the attention 
must select. ‘In each case the raw material is offered 
by mechanical laws, and from the raw material selection 
is made before the impression really enters mind. But 
before we can understand the effect of the attention, we 
must turn to a study of the way in which these impressions 
are brought back. 
The primary fact upon which all explanations of the 
re-entrance of ideas is based, is that when a connection 
has once been made between sensory processes it tends 
to persist throughout the lifetime of the individual. Just 
as we saw above that each impression upon a sensory cell 
seems to modify the cell in such a way that there is a ten- 
dency for the cell to act in the same way again, so when 
two cells have been active together, or in immediate suc- 
cession, there is left a tendency for one cell to become active 
again whenever the other is excited to activity. There 
are, of course, some complications which must be considered, 
wa.
-P-A-G-E-109
Attention and Ideas 99 
but this is the fundamental fact, and all others are-modifi- 
cations of it. On the mental side, where we can observe 
the process directly, we find that any sensation is constantly 
calling up some older impression for which there is no 
occasion in the external world, but which has been received 
at the same time as the first sensation at some earlier time 
in the life of the individual. The sensation of pressure 
received from a billiard ball at once suggests the visual 
impression of a white glistening object ; the sight of a 
candle flame at once awakens in the mind of the child 
who has had his fingers burnt, the sensation of pain from 
the burn ; the roar of the sea reinstates the image of the 
dashing waves and so on ad infinitum. These are all 
instances in which the excitation of one sensation implies 
the return of a number of other impressions which have 
been connected with it at some previous time when the 
element now first and the element it excites were both in 
mind as parts of a single whole. We may regard this as 
the simplest form of recall. 
The second form, less different from the first than one 
would suppose at first thought, is that in which the exciting 
impression disappears as its successor enters. We find 
an analogous case in sensations which are excited by a 
stimulus of such short duration that the sensation does 
not arise until the stimulus which produced it has ceased 
to act. If, for example, the eye be stimulated by an 
electric spark, which persists only a few hundred thou- 
sandths of a second, the spark will first be seen a tenth of 
a second or so after the stimulus has disappeared. In 
the same way the centrally aroused sensations which are 
called up by association may only appear when the exciting 
process is no longer conscious. We have an instance of 
the phenomenon each time we think over any series of 
words as we expect to speak them, or whenever we recall 
a number of events in the order in which they occurred. 
The Associationist school of psychologists opposed succes- 
sive association to simultaneous as an entirely different

100 Attention 
process. It is probable, however, that the causes for 
the succession, if analysed, would not be found to be other 
than the causes for the simultaneous return which were dis- 
cussed above. The second element comes back because 
of a connection established at the time of the previous 
presence in consciousness, but it does not enter conscious- 
ness until the earlier process has disappeared. Probably 
very few of the concrete thought processes are composed 
exclusively of either form of association ; in much greater 
measure they combine both. 
Most often the starting-point is an idea composed of 
a group of centrally aroused sensations due to simultaneous 
excitation of a group of cortical cells. This would probably 
in every case be in large part the result of association by 
contiguity in terms of the older classification, although 
there might be some part played by the immediate excita- 
tion of the separate cells by an external stimulus. Starting 
from this given mass of central elements, all change comes _ 
from the fact that some of the elements disappear and are 
replaced by others through a second series of associations 
by contiguity. The parts of the original idea which remain 
serve as the excitants for the new elements which arise. 
The nature of the process is exactly like that by which 
the elements of the first idea were excited, and no new 
process comes in. These successive associations are thus 
really in their mechanism but a series of simultaneous 
associations in which the elements that make up the different 
ideas are constantly changing, but with some elements 
that persist from idea to idea. There is thus a constant 
flux of the ideas, but there is always a part of each idea 
that persists over into the next and serves to start the 
mechanism of revival. There is never an entire stoppage 
in the course of the ideas, never an absolute break in the 
series, but the second idea is joined to the one that precedes 
by an identical element in each. In its simplest terms, then, 
all association and all reappearance of ideas that have 
once been experienced is to be explained bythe fact that
-P-A-G-E-111
  Attention and Ideas 101 
sensations once united in mind tend to return together 
when any part of the group returns. The only modifica- 
tion of this principle which needs to be made is that there 
is a continual dying out and renewal of the sensations that 
are present, but the renewal, the entrance of the new 
impression, takes place always in terms of the same general 
law. So, for instance, when one building reminds us of 
another, there is first a vanishing of parts of the one, 
and then the remaining part, the feature that is common 
to both buildings, brings into mind the other elements of 
the new building, as in dissolving views part of one of the 
pictures gradually fades over into and is replaced by another. 
The effects of attention upon this process must be con- 
sidered in exactly the same way that they have been in 
connection with the entrance of the sensations which 
come directly from the sense organs. The laws of associa- 
tion have exactly the same relation to the intellectual 
attention that the laws of sensation and of the physical 
universe have to the sensorial attention. Both furnish 
the raw material upon which the attention acts, the crude 
first product that must be worked over again before there 
is any consciousness. Association alone no more explains 
the presence of a thought than sensation alone explains 
a perception. The later stages are those of greatest import- 
ance, although, of course, neither could be present without 
the other. 
As in the case of sensorial attention we may divide the 
conditions of attention into two great groups, the subjective 
and objective conditions, so we have two sets of conditions 
of the coming to consciousness of the remembered impres- 
sions. Corresponding to the first, which in perception were 
to be found mainly in the nature of the external stimulus, 
in the sensation itself, we have on the central side the 
nature and strength of the tendency to associate. Cor- 
responding to the subjective factors in perception we have 
also subjective conditions of association or of return, which 
are to be found in the more general conditions of conscious-
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 Attention 
ness just as were the subjective conditions of the attention 
in the earlier chapter. We might as readily divide the 
two sets of conditions into laws of association and laws of 
attention, but it seems more in accordance with the earlier 
precedent to use the terms we have. 
In a general way we may formulate the objective condi- 
tions in the statement that the stronger the associatory tie 
the more likely is the corresponding mental element to 
enter consciousness. The concrete factors which deter- 
mine the strength of association were very well formulated 
by James Mill, and may be taken over almost bodily from 
his discussion. They can be classed under the various 
attributes of the sensation, intensity, duration, and extent, 
in very much the same way that we classified the objective 
conditions of the sensorial attention. These conditions 
are as purely mechanical and as simple in their action as 
are the conditions that bring the external stimulus into 
contact with the sense organ and through that to con- 
sciousness. 
Under the first head, intensity, we can only say that two 
impressions tend to become more closely connected the 
more intense one or both of them may have been at the 
time of their original entrance. The mutual irradiation 
of one upon the other, which may be regarded as joining 
them, is stronger the more intense the sensations them- 
selves. A very bright flash of lightning, @ very loud clap 
of thunder, will be more likely to be recalled by some con- 
temporaneous event than a very weak one. A severe 
pain, a strong pressure, or a very intense odour will be 
more closely connected with other sensations which came 
at the same time than would a weaker sensation of the 
same kind. The size of the object on the skin and the 
retina has an exactly analogous effect to intensity, as was 
the case for the external impression. 
But in addition there are several subjective factors 
that serve to strengthen the connection between the two 
events associated. What is at the time of its activity a
-P-A-G-E-113
  Attention and Ideas 103 
decidedly subjective condition becomes in its later effects 
on the same level and of the same kind as the purely objec- 
tive intensity of the sensations which are joined. Most im- 
portant of these is attention. If both of the events are 
attended to carefully at the time of their original entrance 
there will be a greater tendency for one to recall the other 
than if either or both has for any reason received but slight 
attention. The more interesting two events are at the 
time the more closely will they become welded together. 
There are daily instances of this fact in the class-room. 
Two interesting statements always tend to recall each other, 
whereas if one or both seem commonplace or unimportant 
at the time there will be no close association between them. 
It is a familiar experience that any statement that has 
been accompanied by a story will be remembered, even 
if everything else of the hour’s work be forgotten. 
Another influence of very similar character is the 
emotional attitude toward the experience. Objects that 
have called out an emotional mood, whether pleasant 
or unpleasant at the time, gain greatly in their effec- 
tiveness for association. Any other impression received 
at the time, no matter how indistinct it may have 
been, inevitably recalls the event that excited the 
emotion, even after a considerable number of years. 
The witnesses of a tragedy find it for days continually 
recurring to them. Every tree or stone that bears the 
slightest resemblance to those that were seen at the time 
brings back with a rush the whole harrowing scene, and 
every event of the daily life seems to furnish some resem- 
blance to the scene which is sufficient to recall the complete 
event. In the same way if,there has been a striking per- 
sonal victory achieved in any line it is constantly recalled 
even by events that seem to be only remotely connected 
with it. In both cases we have the highly subjective pro- 
cesses that control the emotions, becoming of the same 
effect as the objective conditions in their control of the 
associatory processes.
-P-A-G-E-114
  104. Attention 
The temporal conditions of association are just as im- 
portant, although not quite so simple in their method of 
action. There are two ways in which associatory processes 
are affected by time. They are more closely connected 
the more recent the time of their appearance together, 
and also the more frequently the elements in question 
have been united. The first of these laws needs to be little 
more than stated to have its validity accepted. It is a 
familiar fact that what we have learned to-day is much 
more easily recalled than what we learned a week ago 
even if the conditions are exactly the same both in the 
external world and in the mind of the individual in ques- 
tion. Professor Ebbinghaus has made an experimental 
determination of the way in which the closeness of this 
connection decreases with the time, and found by a method 
to be described in Chapter IX that there is a very constant 
tule that governs the dying out of the connection between 
impressions once associated. The loss of the association 
is most rapid soon after the association is formed, and 
decreases in rapidity, so that after the first day the de- 
crease in the strength of association in a week is not much 
greater than on the first day in a single hour. In mathe- 
matical terms it is asserted that forgetting is a function 
of the logarithm of the time. 
Another law, sometimes called the law of primacy, is 
that the first association is the strongest. Associations 
formed in early childhood seem to persist more strongly 
than those which have been formed at a later date. This 
tendency for the connections of a relatively early period 
to be preferred to the associations received late in life, in 
spite of the temporal remoteness of the period, depends 
in all probability upon the greater plasticity of the nerve 
cells in youth and the consequent greater strength of the 
connections which may be formed, together with the fact 
that associations become more effective with age, if of 
equal strength with recent associations. 
The third law under this head is equally a fact of every- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  Attention and Ideas 105 
day remark. Repetition is the one means ordinarily 
relied upon to produce and strengthen associations. From 
the experiences of the lowest animals up to the most im- 
portant operations of mankind, frequency of repetition is 
counted upon to strengthen associations and to facilitate 
recall. It is probable that this principle plays some part 
in the explanation of the strong associations formed in 
early childhood. The associations are frequently repeated 
because they are relatively so few, and it may be this 
frequent repetition in part that produces the increased 
liability to recall in later years. However, the progress 
of the same tendency in old age, where the impressions 
of middle life always die out before the events of childhood, 
would point to the change in the nature of nerve cells as 
accounting, at least, for the greater part of the effect. 
In all these cases of the objective conditioning of the 
association, we may say that the whole process depends 
upon the degree in which the elements in question were 
interwoven at the time of their original entrance. There 
is probably an increased closeness of connection between 
cell and cell, which makes for a greater likelihood of recall 
for one when the other comes into consciousness. The effect 
of the conditions mentioned up to this point is as definite 
and unvarying, so far as one can see, as the conditions which 
cause any external disturbance, light wave, mechanical 
pressure, or chemical change on the tongue to enter con- 
sciousness at any moment. If there were no other factors 
to be considered it would be a simple computation to 
determine what idea should come to mind at any time. 
There would be no variety, and the number of ideas would 
be extremely limited. At most we could but live over 
our recent and striking ideas in the same order in which 
they had previously entered, and our mental life would 
be much less rich than that which we actually experience. 
The variety and completeness of our consciousness is 
due to the operation of the subjective conditions, just as 
all forms of control of what shall enter consciousness for
-P-A-G-E-116
106 Attention 
the first time depends upon the subjective conditions. 
The subjective conditions work upon the materials which 
the objective conditions offer in very much the same way 
that the subjective conditions of the attention work upon 
the material offered to the senses. Every thought process 
is the resultant of both subjective and objective conditions, 
and can be explained by neither alone. It was a neglect 
of the subjective conditions and the insistence upon the 
objective side of the problem that has led the English 
Associational School into disrepute. The explanations that 
they gave were true as far as they went, but their incomplete- 
ness vitiated the conclusions as soon as they laid claim to uni- 
versality. There are two points in the associative train where 
the subjective factors make themselves felt. The first 
corresponds almost exactly to the effect of the attention 
in the field of vision or upon the entrance of any sensation. 
When a remembered object appears in consciousness it 
is acted upon by the attention in exactly the same way 
as a perception from the external world. The only differ- 
ence is that whereas in the latter case the attention deter- 
mines what impressions shall enter, in this case the atten- 
tion determines what parts shall remain. The parts 
which are attended to become clearer and are retained 
in consciousness, while the others die out and disappear. 
This is of particular importance in the course of ideas, be- 
cause it is the portion of any image retained that serves 
as a starting-point for the next image, and consequently 
as the part attended to varies, the course of thought will 
change. 
The conditions which are effective in determining what 
shall be retained are the same as those which we have 
already discussed in connection with the sensorial attention. 
The ideas that have been in consciousness just before are 
the immediate conditions, but there are to be added the 
general purpose or set of the mind at the time, and the 
more general effects of training, social environment, and 
heredity, as they have crystallised in what we call the
-P-A-G-E-117
Attention and Ideas 107 
character of the individual. Each is effective in exactly 
the same way and in approximately the same degree as 
we found it to be in the sensorial attention in Chapter IV. 
In part each acts directly upon the retention of the par- 
ticular element, in part only indirectly through the influence 
of those factors, in determining the purpose of the mind at 
the moment. In this, as in all other aspects, there is very 
little difference between the subjective conditions here 
and the subjective conditions of attention in general. 
The second way in which the subjective conditions affect 
the course of ideas is in choosing between the different 
possible associates which might attach to this particular 
retained element. Not only must we regard the strength 
of the connections as due to the intensity of the sensations 
at the time of the original entrance of the different elements 
involved and the time of that entrance, but we must con- 
sider all of the contents of the mind at the time and much 
of the preceding mental life of the individual. 
The easiest way to show that there are these subjective 
elements which determine the course of associations is 
to see what results would follow if these elements were not 
considered. If we were to consider only the objective 
conditions there would be no chance but that a given 
element A should excite some second element B without 
lany reference to the circumstances under which it entered 
ind. We could not have “a’’ calling up now “b”’ as 
e recited the alphabet and now “‘ man” as we were speak- 
ing in a general conversation, but it would suggest either 
me or the other, according to the circumstances under 
hich the two sounds had last entered consciousness. In 
uch an instance the many times that the letter had been 
sociated with ‘“‘b,”’ and the early age at which the con- 
ection had been begun, would for ever forbid its use as 
n article, or the entrance of any other connection. In 
he same way the first strong connection of one impression 
ith another would tend to persist for ever and preclude 
he association of that impression with any other under 
      
    
   
    
   
    
       
   
    
      
-P-A-G-E-118
108 Attention 
any circumstances or at any time. It could only be broken 
by some very powerful new impression, and then would 
be lost for ever. It is at once evident that no such relations 
hold between our ideas. It is only in some form of mental 
derangement that we find hard and fast connections that 
are never broken or varied. In a well-balanced, normal 
man such cases never occur. What we really do find as 
we study mental processes is that the associations into 
which one element or sensation enters constantly change 
from moment to moment. A evokes now B, and now C; ‘‘a”’ 
is the article in one sentence of the word “ man”’ and at 
the next with the word “ plant,” and it is not possible to 
prophesy from the past history of the connections from 
one moment to the next what the direction of the associa- 
tion shall be. 
It is evident then that a very large and very important 
part of the problem of association is yet to be discussed. 
All the variable elements which make and break what 
would otherwise be rigidly fixed connections have not yet 
been considered. For it is no more thinkable that the 
variation which we find should be a matter of chance, 
than that there is no variation present. These conditions 
are to be found in very much the same series of circum- 
stances that we saw before to make up the subjective condi- 
tions of the attention. For them we must look to the 
present state of that particular consciousness and to its 
past history. 
We may again begin our enumeration of the different 
conditions with those that stand nearest the particular 
connection in question and go backward to the more remote 
and general. The first of these factors is to be found in 
the context of the moment, the general purpose of the 
thinking at the time. That in reciting a verse of poetry 
one word rather than another shall follow any particular 
word is determined by the meaning that the verse has, 
your intention in reciting it, and other related circumstances 
of the kind. No one can believe for an instant that the  
-P-A-G-E-119
  Attention and Ideas 109 
strongest associate of a word that occurs twice in the 
same line will vary between the time of the first and the 
second recital. What does change is the thought that 
the word is to express, the mental situation of which the 
word is the outcome. In the same way any train of mental 
images is not a mere aimless wandering from picture to 
picture or from point to point in the experience, but is 
strictly subordinate to the general aim, to the general line 
of thought at the moment. You do not find, for instance, 
that the physicist working with coils of wire in the galvano- 
meter recalls the garden hose, however close the recent 
connection between coils and hose may have been. The 
line of thought will continue toward a solution of the 
particular physical problem that he has been working upon. 
That problem constitutes the purpose which for the moment 
dominates his mind and excludes all associations that are 
not in harmony with it and which do not tend toward its 
solution. In every mind at any time there is some general 
tendency due to the conditions of the moment in the sur- 
roundings, to the ideas that were in mind just before, or 
to even more remote conditions, which decides between 
the different possible associates and selects those that are 
in harmony with the tendencies. 
Dr. Watt [5]has very completely demonstrated experi- 
mentally the influence of purpose in the control of associa- 
tions since the above was written. He asked men to give 
the first word that came into mind after a printed word 
was shown when first one, then another task had been set. 
At one time, for example, they were asked to name the 
class, and at another to give an instance under the class 
which the word shown designated. It was found that 
the word suggested always, and automatically, corresponded 
to the purpose dominant through the task that had been 
set. Not only the course of association, but the average 
time required to make response, and the character of the 
sensory image, varied with each purpose. These facts, with 
the observations of the experimenters, are convincing
-P-A-G-E-120
  ] 
110 Attention 
proof that the purpose is fully as important as the direct 
connection in determining the course of ideas. 
The experience that set the problem for solution con- 
stitutes the conditions of the attention on the second level 
of generality and remoteness. These conditions are to be 
found partly in the larger whole of the science in which the 
particular individual is engaged and in his knowledge of 
that science. In part, again, they are to be found in the 
general principles of the science, in the earlier trains of 
thought, in the events of the preceding days, and farther 
back in all of his previous experiences that have had a 
bearing upon the question in hand. If you ask why the 
physicist is interested in solving a problem of magnetic 
activity, you must consider the previous advances of know- 
ledge in relation to that subject so far as they are known 
to him, the related facts in the science that depend upon 
a solution of this problem, and the different theories that 
will be rendered more probable or destroyed by the facts 
that may be established. If you would know why any par- 
ticular scientist is working with a particular problem at 
a particular time, you must know the other related prob- 
lems upon which he has been previously engaged, the 
difficulties that have confronted him in them, and a thou- 
sand details of his past life and work that the scientist 
himself could not tell you at the time. They are the 
essentials of his workaday life for a long period back. 
Still more remote in time we find the entire training and 
experience of the individual. To continue our illustration, 
if we would know completely why our imaginary physicist 
is devoting himself to the solution of this particular 
problem, and why the associations are such as we see them 
to be, we must go back to those experiences of his early 
life that led him to become interested in that science 
and finally to become its devotee. Some chance remark, 
some presentation of a phase of the subject that was at 
the time in harmony with another experience that was 
absorbing his attention, may have furnished the first in-
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  Attention and Ideas III 
centive to the study that has largely engrossed his later 
life. Every element that led to the choice of his pro- 
fession, and every circumstance that has strengthened that 
purpose, may be considered among the conditions that 
are now effective in determining the course of his associa- 
tions. In general, every circumstance that we found to 
be effective in controlling the attention would also be 
effective here in governing the course and strength of the 
associations. 
Here, too, we are driven back to the hereditary and 
social factors, and find in them an explanation for so much 
of the associatory process as is not supplied by immediate 
experience. The hereditary influences have been covered 
over in this case, too, by the results of later experiences, 
but it is hard to think that heredity does not exert some 
influence, which although its immediate effect upon the 
particular association may bealmost negligible, yet indirectly 
through determining the nature of the earlier experience 
at critical points has had in the total a decided part. The 
social forces can be more easily illustrated. Any one 
who has seen how the ideas of a people, political, religious, 
and ethical, will persist unchanged in a particular commun- 
ity, how the course of their associations will be the same 
under the same circumstances for generation after genera- 
tion, while the neighbouring race will think entirely differ- 
ently under the same circumstances, is prepared for the 
conclusion that the society in which a man is born exerts 
a great pressure in directing the train of his thought. More 
immediately it is undoubtedly social pressure that impels 
one to keep one line of thought constantly and persistently 
in mind in spite of the greater present pleasure to be de- 
rived from another series or from letting the ideas come 
“at will.” \It is the ideal of future accomplishments, of 
social approval, or of social blame that makes an unpleasant 
series of impressions dominate a pleasant one\ that over- 
comes the present temporary tendency of the course of 
ideas by a more permanent controlling force.
-P-A-G-E-122
    112 Attention 
As the result of our investigation of the course of ideas 
we find that they too are subject to the control of the same 
factors which we found to be active in the control of sen- 
sorial attention. The ideas in mind, the general attitude 
of the hour, the past experience of the individual, and the 
social and hereditary influences to which he has been 
subjected constitute in both cases the factors which finally 
determine the nature of the process. Here, as in the pre- 
ceding instance, however, we cannot regard either the 
subjective or the objective conditions as alone effective 
in determining any mental process. In association, as 
in attention, the outcome in any case is the result of 
the action of both sets of influences. When two subjective 
tendencies are pretty evenly balanced, the objective ele- 
ments will decide; if the objective are of nearly equal 
strength, the balance will be turned by the subjective 
conditions. In any given case both will be effective, 
but each in a different degree. There are some states 
of mind, such as reverie and dreams, where the objective 
seem largely to predominate, but even in them.the sub- 
jective factors play their part. The course of the dream, 
and of the ideas in a “ brown study,’ depends upon the 
past experience, the mood of the moment, and the other 
more remote influences that have played upon the in- 
dividual. It is only by an abstraction from the real con- 
crete experience that one could say that the laws of associa- 
tion are really the determining causes even in an extreme 
case like this. That would omit the more important for 
the less important. On the other hand, it would be just 
as far from the truth to mention only the subjective factors ; 
but it is not necessary to devote so much attention to this | 
side of the question, because so far no one has sinned 
by excess in that direction. A complete explanation of | 
association demands that both sets of factors be taken’ 
into account ; to omit either is to fail in the solution of the 
problem. If either is to be omitted, it is probable that 
the objective conditions could be dispensed with more
-P-A-G-E-123
  Attention and Ideas 115 
easily than the subjective. Association, like attention, is 
not the outcome of any one set of conditions, hut is an 
expression of the totality of mind at the time the associa- 
tion takes place. 
SUMMARY 
1, Attention plays very much the same part in control- 
ling the centrally excited processes as the peripherally 
excited. 
2. We may regard all centrally excited processes, im- 
agination, etc., as the outcome of two sets of conditions, 
association or objective, and attention or subjective con- 
ditions. 
3. The closeness of association depends upon the inten- 
sity of the two sensations when they first entered conscious- 
ness, upon the attention that was given them at the time, 
and upon their frequency and recency. 
4. The subjective conditions which decide between the 
possible associations are practically identical with the sub- 
jective conditions of attention, the mood of the moment, 
the general training of the individual, his social environ- 
ment, and heredity.

  CHAPTER VIII 
ATTENTION AND ASSOCIATION IN PERCEPTION 
N this chapter we seem from the title to be harking 
back to a subject that has already been treated, or 
at least to one that logically precedes the last chapter. 
It certainly seems, in the light of the ordinary opinion, 
that perception would be a simpler problem than associa- 
tion, and that sensations must get into the mind before 
they are associated. While this is true of sensations, ideas 
or objects are not recognised so immediately, and are much 
more complex than they seem at first glance. In reality 
all perception involves association. Objects are largely 
‘built up in consciousness, they do not merely walk in 
through the senses in their completeness. We have omitted 
all consideration of the entrance of objects from this aspect, 
and have allowed it to appear that as soon as an object 
was attended to every condition for its entrance had been 
completely satisfied. This is by no means the case. The 
group of sensations which constitutes the object for us 
is only partly given in peripheral sensation ; for the most 
part the idea or object is merely suggested by the elements 
that come in through the senses, the remainder is supplied 
by centrally excited sensations, by material already in 
mind. 
Take any single concrete perception and determine 
by analysis how much comes from the senses immediately, 
and what comes indirectly through association. It will 
be found that by far the greater part is made up by the 
latter, while the immediate sensory elements contribute 
114
-P-A-G-E-125
Attention and Association in Perception 115 
but an extremely small part. The sensations that you 
receive from any article-of furniture form only patches 
of colour upon the retina, but the object that you see is 
hard, smooth, has solidity and strength.. Each of these 
qualities comes not through the senses, but from associa- 
tion. The smoothness is a tactual element that arises 
by association with the visual impression, and could not 
come at once from the eye. The immediate occasion for 
its appearance is the lustre or sheen of the surface, and 
this, again, is due to nothing else than the fact that the 
source of light is rudely reflected upon the surface. Re- 
flection can take place only if the surface be smooth, and 
therefore serves to call up the sensation that we have pre- 
viously received when the fingers are passed over a polished 
surface. The texture suggests the hardness, while the 
solidity of the object is a complex association in part made 
up of movements, of tactual impressions, and of the know- 
ledge that the object would show another similar surface 
if it were turned in either direction. The whole complex 
is called out by an equally complicated set of sensations 
made up of the shadows upon the surface of the object, 
the double images that it casts upon the two retinas, and 
of eye movements. ‘The whole process is very much in- 
volved, and while we cannot go into the details, it is prob-= 
lably safe to assume that the whole perception is made up 
lof a complicated series of associations recalled from past 
xperience. ~ 
Much more evident and natural for most of us is the 
ssociation that leads from the other senses to sight. As 
e run our fingers over the surface of the table in the dark 
e are usually not so much conscious of what we feel as 
f the way the table would look were there light. The 
hanges in the sensations of pressure and movement call 
ip at once by association the visual picture that we would 
eceive of the outline and of the nature of the unevennesses 
n its surface if we were studying it with the eye. So, 
oo, the sound of hammering upon the building across the 
        
     
   
     
   
    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-126
116 Attention 
street brings to mind the uplifted hammer, the nail half 
driven and the beam and board-which it is to hold together. 
Visual impressions received in past experience return to 
cluster about the sound that is entering and give it 
meaning, transform it from a mere sensation into the per- 
ception that makes the experience a real event in our 
consciousness. 
A more complicated instance of the same general prin- 
ciple is offered by the interpretation that we put upon the 
facial expression of our friends and acquaintances. We 
can at once decide whether a companion is provoked, 
amused, well disposed, or ill disposed toward us at the 
moment, but very few people could tell at once exactly 
what the difference in the features is that leads to the in- 
terpretation. A slight contraction of a muscle in the 
forehead or about the mouth, and we feel a change in the 
mood of the friend, and modify our later remarks in terms 
of that feeling. But it would be extremely difficult, even 
if we were studying the face at the time, to pick out the 
particular change in the features that leads one to the 
conclusion. What we get in perception is not a series of 
muscular contractions, but a total_impression-of—a_frien 
angry, or a friend delighted, of a mood serious, or a moo: 
playful, and we adapt our action. and our_conversatio 
to the perception as a whole. The specific sensations upoi 
which the perception is based are-entirely lost in the in 
terpretation that we give them. The interpretation is 0 
course due to associations on the basis of numerous experi 
ences with people in general, and with this person in par 
ticular, which now come in to supply the perception fro 
many memories of the remarks or actions that have followe 
the various expressions. at different times in the past. 
Another instance of very delicate decisions on ver 
slight sensational basis is offered by our reading from th 
eye of another the direction and distance of the object a’ 
which he is looking. We can tell at a glance and wit! 
great accuracy what the object is that is attracting hi    
    
    
    
        
  
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Attention and Association in Perception 11" 
attention. The far-away look in the eye is very character- 
istic, and in conversing with a person is as effective in 
stopping one’s remarks as a request. Delicate estimations 
of the distance of the object looked at are possible to a 
very surprising degree. The data for these estimations 
are always extremely slight. It is only the relative amount 
of white sclerotic and conjunctiva that shows on either 
side of the dark iris, as the eyes are converged or turned 
to one side or the other. The changes in these distances 
are very small, and it would be very difficult to notice them 
even if that were the object of the moment. But again 
the estimation is never made in that way. One is seldom 
if ever conscious of studying the area of white exposed 
on the outside or inside of the eyes. As soon as the posi- 
tion of the eyes is noticed, we have the impression that 
the person is looking at an object at a certain distance. 
We think nothing of the position of the eyes and usually 
almost as little of the eyes themselves. What does come 
into mind is that there is some interesting object at a 
certain distance from the person observed and this alone. 
Another excellent. illustration of the- participation_of 
other mental processes than sensations in the perception 
is given by the familiar process of reading. Experiments 
by Erdmann and Dodge, by Huey and others, have shown 
that a very small proportion of the matter read from the 
printed page is really seen in the individual letters. Nearly 
all is supplied by association under definite subjective 
and objective laws. Erdmann and Dodge proved that 
the eyes in reading do not move constantly and smoothly 
over the line, but go by a series of short movements with 
rests between. Reading takes place only when the eyes 
are at rest. It is quite easy to-determine from the length 
of the line and the number of rests the number of letters 
which-are-read at a single glance. It was found that this 
was considerably greater than thé number that could fall 
at one time upon the area of the retina sensitive enough to 
permit them to be read. The other letters must, it is

118 Attention 
evident, be supplied by association from the material 
gathered in the earlier experiences. Reading has peculiar 
advantages for the investigation of processes involved in 
perception, because the conditions that control the associa- 
tions can be more readily made out there than elsewhere, 
and the experimental results are more Clear°cut-and easier 
of interpretation than in_most~of-the other domains of 
perception. For that~réason we shall draw-largely upon 
it for illustrative material in discussing the nature and 
control of the processes involved in perception. 
In none Of these cases do we ordinarily analyse the total 
impression into its elements or distinguish between the 
sensations that come at once from the senses and those 
which are centrally excited through association. The 
object seen is taken as a whole, and it is very difficult to 
tell where the immediate contribution of the senses ceases 
and the work of association begins. The whole is what 
we know as the percept or the object, and we never 
think of questioning how it is made up. In fact, it is 
very doubtful, in spite of much careful investigation, as 
to how much of any perception can be called immediate 
sensation, and how much is due to association at second 
and third hand. Certainly very much more than one 
ordinarily suspects of what is said to have been seen has 
not been seen at all, but has been supplied by association. 
It was this supplementing of the sensations by centrally 
excited sensations that led Helmholtz to speak of many 
processes of the kind as unconscious inference. He pictured 
the process as unconsciously deducing the real nature of 
the object from the incomplete sensation that was obtained. 
A similar interpretation of the relation leads Binet to assert 
that all perception is judgment. Both of these terms serve 
merely to point out the similarities of the perception pro- 
cess to the more complicated mental processes, and in so 
far we may accept them. But neither really gives us 
an idea of the details of the process, and if all perception 
follows this pattern, as we seem justified in assuming on
-P-A-G-E-129
  Attention and Association in Perception 119 
the basis of the illustrations, it is not of much advantage 
merely to note the similarity and emphasise it in a classi- 
fication. Moreover, as we shall see in the next chapter, 
judgment and inference can be reduced to processes not 
so very different from perception. Whatever the advan- 
tages for general philosophy of recognising the higher in 
__the-lower, it is more in harmony with the axiom of science 
to bring the simpler under the head of the more complicated. 
Clearly, if perception depends to so large an extent upon 
association of old impressions with the newly entering ones, 
we have a problem to solve very similar to that which we 
have already treated in association. We must, that is, 
decide what the conditions are that lead us to make the 
associations at the right time, that always bring us to see 
the same thing under the same circumstances, and con- 
sequently make the world the same for everybody. For 
it would seem at first sight that if the perception is thus 
dependent upon association or other purely mental pro- 
cesses there could be no agreement as to what was seen 
under the same conditions, but as each man’s mind is 
different, so even if the same object were offered to the 
senses each man who looked would receive a different 
perception. 
The factors that are at work here are almost identical 
with those which were found to be active in the control 
and production of associations. We have to do again with 
an association under the influence of attention and the 
more general subjective conditions derived from the ex- 
perience of the individual and the race, which we have 
already found to play so large a part in the control of 
attention and association. The simplest determinant is 
the association in its physical form depending upon the 
intensity, recency, and frequency of the original connec- 
tion. Of these the frequency of the previous connection 
is probably the most important. There are some instances 
in which apparently this mechanical connection is the 
only determinant, or, at least, the element that finally
-P-A-G-E-130
  126 Attention 
wins in the struggle. Reading under unfavourable condi- 
tions furnishes many illustrations. If single words are 
shown for a very brief time, or in a weak light, the associa- 
tory influences are given full sway and can be studied for 
themselves. The effect of the central conditions of mental 
environment and context are reduced to a minimum by the 
fact that the words are given singly, and so the simpler 
conditions of recall run their course unhindered. The most 
marked results here are the tendencies of the more frequently 
connected letters to recall each other when one is seen. 
In English it is found that ‘“t’’ will very often bring up 
“h” when it is seen alone in the midst of a number of 
blurred letters, or of letters indistinctly seen. Similarly 
“n” is succeeded by “g” or ‘‘t,” and “1” by “y,” on 
account of the many times these combinations occur in 
English, when the first letter is near the end of the word, 
or the letter that follows is indistinctly seen and not enough 
of the word be read to preclude the possibility of the connec- 
tion. In some cases a word will be built up by association 
to fit a combination that has been made in this way. Some- 
times, indeed, we find that the element supplied by associa- 
tion will conquer against a component actually given in 
senses, and again the letter supplied through association 
will alternate with the actual sensation; first one and then 
the other will gain the chief place. 
Miss Hempstead [3] obtained instances of the same phe- 
homenon in some experiments on the perception of geo- 
metrical figures in a faint light. It was found that there 
was always a tendency to extend lines whenever the exten- 
sion would unite parts of the figure that were disconnected. 
Whenever there were two or more points from which 
lines radiated which were themselves disconnected, a line 
was usually supplied that should connect them. This 
is probably because in ordinary drawings two centres of 
radiation of this kind are connected, and when the two 
points were seen they called up by association a line that 
should join them. The instance is not so simple as in
-P-A-G-E-131
Attention and Association in Perception 121 
the case of the letters in the word, but still the more im- 
portant element of the perception is undoubtedly the 
mere association of element to element. Another instance 
in still a different connection is furnished by the simple 
conjuring trick of Hermann and others, in which a ball or 
other object is made to vanish when thrown into the air. 
The trick consists in going through the movements of 
throwing and so skilfully concealing the object at the 
moment it should leave the hand that the mind supplies 
the actual flight through the air. The movements call 
up their most usual associates, and all the other conditions 
are so favourable to the, interpretation that the movement 
through the air is taken for real. Many other conjuring 
tricks have a similar explanation, but further elaboration 
would probably not make the principle clearer. 
The same law is at work in every perception, but in 
most the association is in harmony with the sensations 
that would be received if the examination were more care- 
ful, and it is therefore impossible to prove that it is not 
the sensation which comes into consciousness rather than 
the association. Only when the processes that ordinarily 
give rise to what we call true perceptions give false results 
is our attention attracted to them. Perhaps the clearest 
lexamples of the process from the range of normal percep- 
tion are to be found in the instances where impressions 
from one sense call up sensations from another, owing to 
tthe frequency with which they have appeared together. 
‘The visual impression that comes up when we hear a dog 
ark at night, the tactual qualities that we ascribe to a sur- 
ace as we hear a metal rod drawn across it, and the idea 
hat we get of the nature of a surface as we run a pen or 
cane over it, are all evidences of the immediate effect 
f the simple mechanical associations in perception. There 
re undoubted influences of the process to be seen within 
he same sense as when we fill up the area in the field of 
ision corresponding to the blind spot with the colour of the 
urrounding field, or extend the colour of the visual field

to the area beyond the range of vision. There is probably 
no case of perception in which these objectively conditioned 
associations do not play a part. 
The subjective conditions are just as important in deter- 
mining the course of association in perception as in the 
association of ideas. In discussing them here we must 
go over almost the same ground that we have covered 
in enumerating the conditions of the attention and the 
subjective conditions of association. But the repetition 
may be pardonable in view of the fact that new illustrations 
may be used, and that each exposition may make clear 
some point left dark in the others. Certain of the condi- 
tions are best illustrated by processes in one of the mani- 
festations of subjective control, others by those in another 
field. Illustrations from all mutually supplement each 
other, and it is to be hoped that the gain will outweigh the 
disadvantages of the threefold repetition. 
The first condition here, as before, is to be found in the 
mental content at the moment of entrance, in the setting, 
mental or physical, at the moment the sensation enters. 
In reading we can find many instances of this. The associa- 
tions between the letters of the isolated words are largely 
determined by the word that has been already recognised 
from its outline and the very few letters which are read 
accurately. What word shall be made out from these 
impressions is again largely determined by the context, 
if the word is given in a sentence, or by the mental content, 
if the word stands alone. Experiments by Professor Miin- 
sterberg, repeated by the author, demonstrated that if 
an associated word were called just before the word were 
shown it facilitated the reading of the word and prevented 
the noticing of misprints. The word of related meaning 
at once made more certain the association of the word 
as a whole with the impressions received, and strengthened 
the effect of the word in controlling the associations be- 
tween the separate letters. When the words are given 
in a context, as in reading ordinary matter, there is a very
-P-A-G-E-133
  Attention and Association tn Perception 123 
much stronger directing force at work in the general mean- 
ing of the article that is being read and in the trend of the 
discussion that has already been received from the earlier 
sentences. The large gaps between the words and letters 
which are actually read are supplied by association in 
terms of the knowledge of what is to be said, as was shown 
by the results of Erdmann and Dodge. They found that 
the more familiar the subject-matter and the language, 
the more rapid was the reading and the fewer the words 
actually seen. In terms of our problem, the more definite 
the control by knowledge, the greater the amount that 
could safely be trusted to the associative factors, and the 
less that need be seen. This is evident again in the fact 
that in reading a work that is very familiar it is possible to 
gather the meaning of the pages by noting merely the 
more striking words, and inferring from them what is 
printed on the pages. The more adequate the control 
of the subjective factors the less need there is for the ob- 
jective. Dr. Bagley found the same general principle to 
hold for the perception of the spoken word. It was much 
easier to recognise the spoken word in the sentence than if it 
stood alone, and much more difficult to recognise mispro- 
nunciations and omissions. As the context became more 
definite, more was left to association under its control and 
less attention was paid to the actual sensations received. 
The same principles hold in general perception. The 
pateh of white in a stage scene would be recognised in- 
differently as a rock or as a sail according as the surround- 
ings were representative of the meadow or of the sea. The 
mental setting is just as important. The change in the 
interpretation of the figure drawn in ambiguous perspec- 
tive was seen in a preceding chapter to be due in part to 
the changing of the other ideas in mind at the time. Much 
of the interpretation is undoubtedly due to the associated 
impressions that are aroused by the lines actually drawn, 
and the nature of the association is determined by the 
other ideas in mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  124 Attention 
Better instances are to be found in illusions. When 
Sir Walter Scott mistook the hanging garments for Byron 
just after hearing of Lord Byron’s death, and while his 
mind was yet full of that sad event, we have a case of the 
control of associations by the mental content. The sensa- 
tions from the garment, instead of suggesting merely the 
texture of the cloth and the purpose of the apparel, took 
an unusual turn and called out the familiar outline of 
the poet’s figure. The reason for the unusual course of the 
associations was to be found in the fact that the mental 
setting dominated the objective setting and called out the 
corresponding connections. In the same way we can 
account for the great variety of forms that the luminous 
mask takes on for the different persons in attendance on 
the spiritualistic seance by the widely different expecta- 
tions of the different observers. The puzzle picture varies 
its form as the outlines call out one after another of the 
various groups of impressions that have been connected 
with the contours that are seen upon the paper. As you 
look first, you see nothing but the landscape that the 
picture, as a whole, suggests, and look as closely as you 
will there is no departure from the usual outline of the 
verdure. When a friend suggests that there is a face in 
the tree at a given place, and you look again with that idea 
in mind, the face is seen at once, and once seen is never 
missed again. The difference in the two cases is to be 
found in the direction that is given to the course of associa- 
tion by the different mental contents. So, everywhere, the 
mental content at the moment and the general trend of 
the mind at the time exert a powerful influence in deter- 
mining the nature of the perception. 
Behind these conditions stand the past training, the 
general ways of life of the individual in question. This 
is well illustrated by an incident related to the author by 
a well-known school inspector. He was experimenting with 
school children of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., on the recognition 
of different outline drawings, among them a vague sole-
-P-A-G-E-135
  Attention and Association in Perception 125 
shaped contour. Nearly all the boys recognised it at 
once as a paddle, on account, doubtless, of the almost univer- 
sal familiarity with boats and boating in that community. 
The school children of Lynn or Brockport would have re- 
‘cognised it just as quickly and unequivocally as a sole. 
And so each tradesman or professional man is ready to 
see in any object of vague outline some instrument of his 
daily use. An ink blot or the embers in the fireplace 
reflect back the mind and the profession of the man who 
looks into them. The associates which are called up by 
the vague outlines are determined in their course by the 
past experience and by the daily task and the momentary 
thought of the man who observes them. Another excellent 
illustration of the same fact is given by the difference 
between a landscape painting and a photograph, or by 
the difference between two paintings of the same scene 
by different artists. Even assuming the same point of 
view, it will be seen that one man will emphasise one aspect 
of the view and the other, another. The sensations are 
the same for both, but the associations and the elements 
that control them mirror the past life of the two artists. 
The perception is not dependent merely upon rock and 
hill and meadow, but upon the previous life of the man 
who sees and paints it. 
Still farther back we have the constant pressure of 
heredity and social environment. Both of these act again 
mainly indirectly to determine the form that the training 
shall take, the choice of the profession, and affect the per- 
ception itself only indirectly. It may be that heredity 
directly controls the course of the first associations, and 
so the nature of the perceptions in some degree, but that 
is a proposition which admits of no direct proof. Still, 
as we can see that the early movements show the influence 
of heredity, it seems very probable that sensory associations 
also should show some effect of the same influence. Social 
pressure undoubtedly also expresses itself in the nature 
of the perception, although again the only evidence for it 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 Attention 
is to be found in the fact that the different races and com- 
munities give different interpretations of the same objec- 
tive impressions. 
| The whole problem of perception then is in very small 
degree a problem of sensation, and in very large degree a 
matter of association and of the control which is exerted 
by many subjective factors. We see an extremely small 
part of what comes into our mind. An object is made 
up in very slight degree of impressions immediately received 
from the sense organ, and in very large measure by the 
returned elements of old sensations and impressions. Per- 
ception is not the immediate consequence of environment 
and sense organ, but is rather an expression of the entire 
past life of the individual in the fullest sense of that term. 
If perception is so closely related to association, if we 
supply so large a proportion of the object in the external 
world and sensation so small a part, the question naturally 
arises as to why there is such universal agreement as to the 
things that are seen, why the world is so nearly alike for us all. 
The answer is to be found in the common nature of 
human minds and in the identity of the subjective condi- 
tions that are at work at all times in determining and 
controlling the mental processes. Mankind as a whole, 
and members of the same community in particular, have 
a common past as well as a common present. Men of 
the same nation have, as a rule, seen the same things under 
the same conditions, their training has been very much 
alike; and through the widespread systems of communica- 
tion of the modern world, through books and newspapers, 
by post and telegraph, the experience of any man in any 
country becomes promptly the experience of every man 
throughout the civilised world. This fact, that all men 
come into a common tradition, have in large measure the 
same experiences and heredity, is the most important 
factor in making the perception of any object the same 
for all who observe it. The mental setting into which 
the sensations are received is alike for all men as well as  
-P-A-G-E-137
  Attention and Association in Perception 127 
the sensations that are received. It is as much the iden- 
tity of subjective conditions as of the impressions that 
makes agreement in observation possible. But given this 
community of ideas, a true perception of the external 
world is just as possible as if all depended upon the identity 
of physical conditions at the moment of perception. 
More than this, however, man’s interpretation of the 
physical world assumes a constancy of natural laws. The 
associations developed yesterday will only serve to-day 
in place of sensations if the series of events in the external 
world is the same now as then. It is only safe to assume that 
the white patch in the landscape is a rock if you can be 
assured that sailing wheeled vehicles have not come into 
vogue over-night, and that light is always reflected in 
one way from the surface of the sea and in another from 
the grass of the meadow, and that the laws of reflection 
cannot change at random. If there were any such ir- 
regularity in the physical forces, if a cause had one effect 
at one time, and another at another, it would not be possible 
to use associations to determine from some slight sensa- 
tional clue what the entire connection must be. As it is, 
we may regard all perception as based upon the fact of the 
relative constancy of external connections. As a rule a 
given sensation would be accompanied or followed by 
certain others, and it would prove much less satisfactory 
to stop to make a complete test each time than to trust 
that the connections once experienced will remain perma- 
nent. Exceptions are so rare, and the time saved by the 
process so great, that there is immense gain over what 
would seem to be the more accurate method and the one 
which is usually supposed to constitute the process of 
perception. 
When by any chance the idea which the sensations 
suggest is found on closer examination not to be in harmony 
with the sensations received under conditions that have 
been found to be more favourable to accurate observation, 
we have an illusion. This occurs only when there is some 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 Attention 
lack of harmony between the objective and the subjective 
setting, and the factors that control the course of the 
associations are not suited to the circumstances of the 
physical world. Either there is some unusual relation of 
objects or events on the physical side, or the subjective 
conditions are not only very strong, but those which are 
dominant are for some reason not the ones that would 
ordinarily be called out by the circumstances in question. 
When the lack of harmony is more pronounced, and the 
sensory element becomes very much smaller in amount 
than usual, we have an hallucination. In either case 
there is only the operation of the normal laws of percep- 
tion, but they act in some unusual way. The result is 
not that which the mass of people would obtain under the 
same conditions, or which we would obtain under normal 
conditions. Both processes serve to emphasise the earlier 
results of this chapter, that perception is not a bodily 
walking over of objects into our consciousness, but that 
it is, like memory, the result of a mental construction. 
While it obeys a law, its law is not merely physical, but 
involves psychological laws as well. The unusual mani- 
festations in illusion are not mysterious, but are the result 
of the operation in an unusual way of laws which ordinarily 
operate with such great regularity that we have never even 
suspected their existence. 
SUMMARY 
1. Perception is not as it seems, the mere entrance of 
a group of sensations, but an arousal of old experiences 
by a few newly entering sensations. 
2. Attention both determines what sensations shall enter 
and what associations they shall arouse. 
3. Again the conditions of perception may be divided 
into subjective and objective. The subjective, as in 
the earlier discussions, are to be found in the past history 
of the individual, the objective both in the environment of 
the moment and in the mechanical conditions of association.

CHAPTER IX 
ATTENTION IN MEMORY 
O complete our survey of the facts of attention, and 
the place that it holds in mind, it still remains 
to discuss the effects which it exerts in the more com- 
plicated mental activities. We must see what it con- 
tributes to the so-called higher processes. That it will 
play a part even in these processes is evident from its im- 
portance in the simpler ones that go to make them up. 
Attention could not play so considerable a réle in the 
entrance of sensations into mind, and in their combination 
after entrance, without also being a significant factor in 
every other mental state, however complicated, for it is 
a generally accepted fact that all other mental states are 
but combinations of sensations in some form or other. 
In fact, in the words of Professor Titchener, we might regard 
the elementary states so far discussed, if we include in 
them the fact that attention is accompanied by motor 
phenomena, as the structural elements of mind. All the 
others are merely combinations of these for different func- 
tional purposes. All of the processes of cognition and 
action then would be but compounds of the simple elements, 
which because they had different functions, accomplished 
different purposes, had been marked off with separate 
names, but which really in themselves contained nothing 
new, and even demanded no new general principles of 
explanation. All that is necessary now is to study the 
manner of combination of the elements already discussed 
in the more usually mentioned higher mental processes.

  130 Attention 
To avoid dragging the discussion out to an inordinate length 
we may confine ourselves to the three which are most 
often mentioned, and which for the teacher are probably 
the most important, or at least are those most talked about 
in connection with pedagogical questions. These are 
memory, will,and reason. They are moreover the functions 
that are of most interest to the popular reader, and a dis- 
cussion of them will probably suffice to indicate the part 
that would be assigned to the others. 
Perhaps memory, of all these so-called higher processes, 
is the one that is of most general interest. It is the func- 
tion that one most often attempts to train or to strengthen, 
and which seems of most practical value. We may do well 
then to begin our discussion with it, as it is also the simplest 
and the most closely related to the elementary processes 
already discussed. 
As follows from the principles set forth in the earlier chap- 
ter on association, attention would affect memory at two 
points, at the time the impression is first received and at 
the time of its later recall. Both effects are important, 
but in an entirely different way. It is the conditio sine qua 
non of all later recall that the impression be attended to 
at the time that it first enters consciousness. The events 
which pass entirely unnoticed are never recalled. Further- 
more, in very large degree the likelihood of recall varies 
with the degree of the attention. Statements or events 
that are closely attended to are more easily remembered 
than those which are only given passing notice. Every 
teacher has observed how the statements that attract the 
attention are retained. The stories that are told, and 
the facts that are illustrated by them, particularly the 
stories, are sure to be recalled in the class discussions and 
in the examination paper, while more important matters 
that received greater emphasis in the lecture and are: in- 
herently more important seem to have vanished utterly. 
Retention then runs parallel to the degree of attention 
at the time the impression is received. The nature of
-P-A-G-E-141
Attention in Memory 131 
this action was dwelt upon at considerable length in con- 
nection with the problem of centrally excited sensations, 
and needs no further discussion here, as memory is but 
one phase of the general problem of centrally excited 
sensations. 
These statements hold in general for the relation of 
attention to learning and retention. Fortunately, how- 
ever, we need not restrict our statements to these general 
terms. Within the last decade a large amount of experi- 
mental work has been done upon the memory process 
that enables us to state accurately and in much greater detail 
the laws of learning and the influence of attention upon 
these memory processes. The two cannot easily be dis- 
sociated in a discussion of this character, and it is hoped 
that the resulting laws of memory will be to the reader 
interesting enough in themselves, and the influence of 
attention be regarded as sufficiently striking to justify 
what may at first sight seem a digression into a related 
but nevertheless distinct field. 
To understand the results at all it will first be necessary 
to sketch briefly the methods that have been used in the 
investigations. The material most used for the experi- 
ments is the nonsense syllable. Its use has the advantage 
of doing away with any possible influence of earlier formed 
associations that would make words and phrases of vary- 
ing value for memory and serve to introduce numerous 
confusing factors. The nonsense syllables are arranged 
by making all possible combinations of vowels and con- 
sonants that give a consonant at the beginning and at 
the end, and then striking from the list all that make words 
in the language in which the investigation is undertaken. 
These constitute with the German vowels somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of two thousand. From the list, 
series are prepared by lot. These series are pasted 
upon a drum that revolves behind an opening in a 
screen and shows the syllables one by one at regular 
intervals, or some other apparatus is used that will show
-P-A-G-E-142
132 Attention 
them with constant exposure and interval. The syllables 
are ordinarily spoken as they are shown. , - 
There are several procedures for using the syllables in 
the investigation of memory laws, but all are alike in that 
they make the number of repetitions a measure of the ease of 
learning. Ordinarily the number of repetitions required before 
the series can be said once through without mistake is made 
the measure of the ease of forming associations. For the 
degree of retention under different conditions or for differ- 
ent individuals there are three recognised measures. The 
first method, employed by Ebbinghaus [*] in his earlier inves- 
gation was to relearn the same series after the lapse of 
several hours or days, and to use the number of repetitions 
necessary to relearn to the point where one repetition 
could be made without mistake as the measure of retention, 
A second method, used by Miiller and Schumann, was 
known as the method of successes. As the name implies, 
the amount of retention was measured by the ratio of 
times that a syllable could be given correctly when the 
preceding syllable was supplied. Still a third measure 
that has been suggested by Ebbinghaus, although not 
very frequently used, is the method of promptings. This 
makes the number of times a syllable must be suggested 
the measure of the degree of retention. A subsidiary 
indication of the amount of retention, and one that is 
usually taken advantage of in connection with the method 
of successes, is the length of time required to make the asso- 
ciation with the syllable suggested. Each method has 
its advantages, and each probably measures a slightly 
different phase of the memory process. 
The results obtained by these methods have to do immedi- 
ately and directly with the associatory processes. They 
have served to demonstrate or to confirm most of the 
facts of association that were mentioned in the earlier 
chapter, but in addition there are a number of facts in 
connection with memory proper that have developed in 
the course of the different investigations, and these are
-P-A-G-E-143
  Attention in Memory 133 
almost all connected with attention either positively or 
negatively. As there is no way of separating sharply the 
effects of attention from the effects of association proper, 
and no way of making clear the influence of attention 
without giving a statement of the fundamental processes, it 
is necessary to enumerate the more important results and in- 
dicate the way in which they have been affected by attention. 
The fundamental fact which makes the measurements 
applicable directly is that each repetition is of equal value 
in the formation of the association, it makes no difference 
where they may occur in the series. The fiftieth repetition 
increases the strength of the association just as much as 
did the first or the second. It follows from this that the 
number of repetitions may be used as a measure of the learn- 
ing without correction of any kind. This, of course, always 
on the assumption that attention was equally strong at 
each repetition, or that sufficient trials are made to average 
out the deviations from a standard degree of attention. 
Another fact that is of some interest in itself as well 
as for the methods of experimentation is that the number 
of repetitions necessary for learning grows very rapidly 
as the number of syllables in a series is increased. Ebbing- 
haus, again the pioneer in the work, found that the adult 
could learn from six to eight syllables with a single repeti- 
tion ; when the number of syllables in the series is increased 
to twelve, from fourteen to sixteen repetitions are needed 
for a single correct repetition ; for sixteen, thirty or more 
were necessary; for thirty-six, fifty-five. Ebbinghaus [5] 
suggests that the phenomenon is an expression of the narrow- 
ness of consciousness. This statement carries with it the 
implication that a series to be remembered as a whole 
must be grasped as a unit. The number of successive 
impressions that can be thus attended to is limited, and 
as the maximum is more and more nearly approached, 
greater difficulty is experienced in holding the mass of 
material in consciousness, and the greater the number of 
repetitions necessary to unite them. This fact is very
-P-A-G-E-144
134 Attention 
suggestive of the problem of the range of attention. It 
may, by analogy, be said to be an extension of the fact 
that the field of attention is narrow, from the simultaneous 
to the successive realm. 
A third phenomenon that seems thoroughly demonstrated 
is but slightly connected with attention, although the 
general principle is one that is important indirectly in 
explaining the influence of remote experiential factors 
upon attention. This is that memory takes place with 
greater ease when the repetitions are divided among several 
days than when they are all accumulated in a single day. 
So Ebbinghaus showed that a series of syllables repeated 
sixty-eight times in immediate succession required seven 
repetitions the following day to reinstate it. If, on the 
other hand, it was repeated seventeen and one half times 
on one day, twelve times on the second, and eight and a 
half on the third, but five repetitions were necessary on the 
fourth to bring it back. Thirty-eight repetitions extended 
over three days are more effective in forming associations 
than sixty-eight when they are confined to a single day. 
Jost carried the experiments very much farther, and found 
that the same principle held to the end, that the more 
you divide the repetitions the greater the amount of saving. 
The most economical application of twenty-four repetitions 
was to make two repetitions on each of twelve days, rather 
than to repeat more frequently on fewer days. It would 
seem at first sight that the explanation of the results 
was that one could attend better for the first repetitions, 
or that one became fatigued by the earlier repetitions. 
But this cannot be the entire explanation, for Jost [7] noted 
that the principle still held, if the smaller number of repeti- 
tions was preceded by a number of repetitions of some 
other series that was equal in number to, or slightly exceeded 
the number made in a single day in divided learning. 
In spite of the extra fatigue the divided repetitions were 
much more effective than an equal number made in immedi- 
ate succession.
-P-A-G-E-145
  Attention in Memory 135 
Greater attention during the short series may play some 
small part without reference to the fatigue, but it is prob- 
able that the explanation of the phenomenon is to be found 
in the fact that older associations are more effective than 
the more recent of the same strength. Jost demonstrated 
that if two series, one old and the other new, give an equal 
number of successes when tested by the method of successes, 
the old can be brought to the degree of effectiveness neces- 
sary to give one correct repetition much more quickly — 
with fewer repetitions—than the new. Apparently then 
an association which is so far latent that there is little or 
no trace of it in determining the course of recall—that 
seldom supplies the older second syllable when the first 
is ‘suggested—is as easily brought back to full efficiency 
by new repetitions as more recent connections that are 
superficially much stronger. It is consoling to know that 
information that never shows itself in consciousness is 
nevertheless capable of being reinstated when occasion 
demands with very little effort, compared with the pains 
of the original acquisition. As an explanation of the 
advantages of divided learning this fact would involve 
the assumption that the repetitions of the one day actually 
increase in strength during the time that elapses before 
the next repetitions are made. The fact again furnishes 
some justification for the undemonstrable assertion of the 
older psychologies that nothing is ever completely lost 
from memory. In connection with our study of the condi- 
tions of attention it explains how the more remote experi- 
ences may still exert a control upon the course of percep- 
tion and thought without themselves being conscious at 
the instant. 
A law of memory that betrays a more direct influence’ 
of attention than those previously mentioned was first 
suggested by Miss Lottie Steffens. ["*] This is that it is much 
easier to learn a selection by rote if the entire selection 
is read through as a whole than if it is read and learned 
part by part, as one is naturally inclined to do. The in-
-P-A-G-E-146
136 Attention 
fluence of attention here is negative rather than positive, 
the law would hold more completely did not attention 
act in the opposite direction. Miss Steffens found that 
the law held absolutely, and that the saving was greater 
the longer the selection to be learned. But she worked 
with an instrument that compelled the repetitions to be 
made at a regular and pre-determined rate. Pentschew, [**] 
however, performed some of his experiments without me- 
chanical aids, and determined that then while fewer repeti- 
tions were required to learn the material as a whole, yet 
the reading was so much slower under those circumstances 
that the learning really required more time. That reading 
tends to become slow is evidently due to the fact that the 
reader is unable to attend to the matter to be read after 
it had become familiar from the first few repetitions, and 
before any particular accomplishment was apparent. When 
in poetry, for example, stanzas are learned separately, one 
can see at each moment that something has been accom- 
plished and there is constant incentive to attend. Under 
those circumstances, the loss through bad method of as- 
sociating is more than compensated for by increased 
attention. Ebert and Meumann [3] succeeded in combining 
the advantages of both methods. They would have the 
whole poem read through twice each twenty-four hours 
until learned. Attention could be held to the relatively 
new material offered each time, and there were none of 
the needless repetitions of the usual method. The defects 
of the ordinary method are undoubtedly due to two factors. 
(1) There are two associations formed between the last word 
of each stanza, one with the beginning of the stanza as it 
is repeated the next time, the other with the beginning of 
the next, and these two associations tend to interfere with 
each other and partly destroy each other. (2) Certain 
parts of the selection are repeated more often than is 
necessary in order to make the weaker strong enough. 
The earlier learned stanzas are repeated each time a new - 
one is learned in order to connect them with it. The
-P-A-G-E-147
  Attention in Memory 137 
strength of the chain is the strength of the weakest link, 
and some are forged more strongly than is necessary, while 
others are still too weak to hold. 
Still another of these recently recognised laws in which 
attention plays its part is that the rate of repetition has 
a very marked influence upon the ease of learning. Ebbing- 
haus obtained results that would seem to indicate that the 
relation was a direct one; that learning took place in less 
time and with fewer repetitions if the rate were fast than 
slow, and that the validity of the law was not limited 
above or below. Moreover, the gain in ease of learning 
was not counterbalanced by any lack of retention. Fully 
as much of the material was retained twenty-four hours 
later when the learning had been at the rapid rate as when 
the series had been learned by the slower. Ogden,[*?] how- 
ever, repeated the experiments of Ebbinghaus at great 
length, and determined that there was an upper as well 
as a lower limit to the most favourable rate of repetition, 
and that the most rapid rate was less favourable than the 
moderate even when tested by the time required alone. 
Ogden, however, is of the opinion that the time alone is 
not an accurate measure of the energy used in learning, 
but that the number of repetitions should also be taken 
into consideration. He .uggests, therefore, that the pro- 
duct: of the time into the number of repetitions is a true 
indication of the amount of work that is done. On this 
basis the most favourable rate is given by the repetition 
of two syllables per second. There are, of course, consider- 
able individual variations. One of logical memory will 
learn more easily with a relatively slow rate, while a pure 
rote remembering is favoured by a considerably higher 
rate. For all, however, the most favourable rate was one 
that permitted attention 1o be adjusted most easily, and 
with least distraction from an attempt to adjust the repeti- 
tions to an unfamiliar or unusual rate, and which also left 
no time for attention to extraneous material. 
The most favourable rate then is determined very largely 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 Attention 
by the conditions that make for most complete attention, 
although it is not unlikely that the rhythm may influence 
association more directly. This harmonises with the 
familiar experience that often more is accomplished when 
one must work rapidly to prepare a lesson, than when one 
has plenty of time. When working more leisurely much 
time is wasted thinking of irrelevant matters, while under 
pressure attention is concentrated upon the matter in 
hand. There is always gain in rapid work until the attempt 
to hurry produces a flurried condition. Then waste of 
effort appears. 
A law of memory that is very suggestive of attention is 
that things which have at any time formed parts of a 
common whole tend to be remembered together, and also 
to be remembered more easily than isolated things. Here, 
again, we come back to matters that have to do with the 
nature of an “ object,” which was discussed incidentally 
in connection with the “range of attention.’’ As there 
the number of objects that could be attended to was in- 
dependent of the complexity of the objects, so here the 
ease of remembering depends not upon the nature of the 
units, but upon the number of units. Ease and quick- 
ness of learning is the same whether the series be composed 
of one-syllable or two-syllable words, whether of single 
words or of phrases. If the material to be learned is the 
ordinary prose, the unit is the idea, and it makes no differ- 
ence whether it is expressed in a word or a sentence, so far 
as ease of memory is concerned. 
The uniting of separate elements into larger wholes is 
what makes rhythm so great an aid to memorising. All 
investigators agree that nonsense syllables are learned 
very much more easily if repeated in suitable rhythms, 
and in practice all learning is by rhythmic units. One 
reason for the favourable influence has been demonstrated 
by Miiller and Schumann [9] and Miiller and Pilzecker [*] 
in the very close connection that subsists between the 
elements of the rhythmic unit. The connection between 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  Attention in Memory 139 
the elements of a trochaic rhythm is very much stronger 
than between either element and the next succeeding 
unit, or the next preceding. If a series of nonsense syllables 
has been learned in a trochaic rhythm, and single syllables 
are presented with the request to mention the first syllable 
that comes to mind, it appeared that in nearly every case 
the other element of the metric unit presented itself, even 
if the syllable presented were the last in the unit, so that 
the course of the association must run backward. Miiller 
demonstrated the same fact even more conclusively by 
arranging two series, the one composed of five trochaic 
feet selected from a series that had been learned twenty- 
four hours earlier, the other composed of five pairs of con- 
tiguous syllables that did not belong to the same foot in 
other series learned twenty-four hours before. He learned 
the first series in an average of one and seven-tenths repeti- 
tions, while five repetitions were necessary for the series 
made up of contiguous syllables belonging to different 
metric units. This influence of rhythm in facilitating 
learning is in part at least due to the fact that the two 
elements in the foot are attended to together and tend 
to become parts of a single whole. The number of things 
to be learned is thus very nearly divided by two. 
The advantage for learning that ordinary sense material 
possesses over nonsense is in part an expression of the 
same general principle, in part it is due to the greater ease 
of attending to matter that makes sense. Whatever has 
meaning tends to belong to a logical whole, and the units 
are all grouped in lesser wholes which can be attended to 
at once, and tend to become for memory single ideas rather 
than separate disconnected things. That one can remem- 
ber from eight to fourteen times as many ideas in poetry 
as nonsense syllables is by no means strange when one 
thinks of the links of rhythm, rhyme, and logical connection 
that serve to make the apparently distinct words parts of 
larger and larger groups. ; 
That all parts of a series of nonsense syllables that has
-P-A-G-E-150
    140 Attention 
been committed to memory have really been welded into 
a whole was demonstrated in the earlier experiments of 
Ebbinghaus by a highly ingenious method. After several 
series of syllables had been learned in the usual way, new 
series were formed by selecting from them each alternate 
syllable, or every third syllable, and so on, to series com- 
posed of every eighth syllable in different earlier series. 
It was found that there was some slight connection between 
syllables thus separated by from one to seven intervening 
' syllables. The association overleaps the contiguous syl- 
lables and extends in a degree dependent upon nearness 
to all the other members of the series and binds all the 
elements into a unit. As a result the series made up of 
non-contiguous syllables from series already learned could 
be learned more easily than series of entirely new syllables, 
and the greater saving in time occurred when the component 
elements had been nearer each other in the original series. 
The association also runs backward as well as forward. 
Syllables once learned in a given order can be learned more 
easily in the reverse order than they could have been 
learned originally. The larger unity of the whole series 
which we have used to explain the greater ease of learning 
in rhythm, in ordinary sense material and elsewhere, is 
not a matter of supposition, but can be demonstrated to 
have real existence. Things attended to together, or in 
immediate succession, become united into a single whole. 
The influence of age on memory is probably very largely 
dependent upon the influence of attention. Contrary to 
popular opinion, capacity for remembering increases with 
age. One learns most easily and remembers most com- 
pletely when maturity has been reached. There is a 
gradual increase in memory through the earlier years until 
about eighteen, and then no change until the beginning 
of senile decay. All investigations seem to agree on this 
effect of age, no matter what method is used for the test. 
It has been suggested that the only change is in the capacity 
for attention, and that the capacity for bare learning or
-P-A-G-E-151
  Attention in Memory 141 
associating remains constant or decreases slightly. While 
there is no certain method of discriminating between 
attention and memory in this connection, it is probable 
that increase in knowledge is effective both in increasing 
interest in widely divergent fields, and so makes attention 
more certain and more strong, and that it prepares more 
associative bonds to receive the new material, and so makes 
association possible in more directions, and thus indirectly 
aids in remembering. In addition, firmness in holding 
oneself to the task increases with years, and in part explains 
the increased memory. In spite of all of these suggestions, 
however, it is by no means certain that the best time for 
forming the physiological connections at the basis of 
remembering may not be in early maturity rather than 
in childhood. 
Apart from the improvement with age, it is probable 
that all increase in memory is due to factors closely related 
to attention. It is probable that memory increases with 
practice only in fields that are closely related to those in 
which the original practice was had. One obtains a better 
memory for psychological facts as one reads more in this 
field, but the results obtained do not improve memory 
for any other science except in so far as the two sets of 
facts overlap. As one knows more of a subject interest 
in the subject increases, and it is more easily understood. 
Moreover, new facts are no longer entirely new, but they 
can at once be assigned to some familiar head and classified 
with others already known. The work of remembering 
has been already partly done, and the completion of the 
process is much simpler than would be learning from the 
beginning. The previously acquired experiences help the 
elements to be learned into associative bonds in very much 
the same way that they help in the entrance of sensations 
as elements. And while, as was said above, the influence 
of training cannot be said to extend beyond the related 
field, there is so much in common between all kinds of 
knowledege, no matter how far removed they seem, that
-P-A-G-E-152
    142 Attention 
it is impossible to say with any certainty where the indirect 
benefit of any bit of information will cease to make itself 
felt. 
Apart from the training that depends upon acquirement 
of facts, there is apparently a more general effect that 
depends upon/ getting accustomed to the apparatus and 
the particular methods of learning that are used. Ebert 
and Meumann subjected the question to an extended 
experimental investigation, and discovered that the facil- 
ity for learning nonsense syllables constantly increased 
with practice for considerable periods of time. Moreover, 
facility acquired shows itself in learning other than nonsense 
material. It is plausible to assume that much of this, if 
not all, comes from the greater ease in fixing attention after 
practice under the relatively new experimental conditions. 
The authors quoted believe, however, that their results 
indicate that some general training may result from exercise 
in a limited field, and in a measure justify the old doctrine 
of formal discipline. 
If attention is thus at work in determining ease and 
certainty of learning at every point, it is equally a factor 
in deciding what and how much shall be retained. As has 
been seen incidentally so far, those things that are attended 
to closely and so are learned easily are also retained well, 
even better in fact on the average than the things that 
are attended to less completely and so require more pains 
in the learning. We may go even farther, and assert that 
anything that is attended to well and easily, meaningful 
prose or poetry, for example, will be retained for much 
longer times or more completely than material that has 
= appeal through earlier training or mood. 
We owe to Ebbinghaus [5] an investigation of this phenom- 
enon also. His results show that with Byron’s “ Don Juan”’ 
there was a retention of fifty per cent after twenty- 
four hours as compared with thirty-four per cent for non- 
sense material. He asserts, too, that the influence of 
poetry once learned seems never entirely to disappear.  
-P-A-G-E-153
  Attention in Memory 143 
Stanzas of ‘‘Don Juan” learned once showed a saving 
of seven per cent after a lapse of twenty-two years as 
compared with stanzas that had never been learned. 
Stanzas that had been. learned at four different times 
showed a saving of twenty per cent after the lapse of 
seventeen years. In each case there was nothing of the 
poem remembered in the ordinary sense, no parts of it 
could be recalled at will, but the connections once formed 
in the nervous system had left behind some traces that 
could be more or less easily brought to complete effectiveness 
when new repetitions were made. 
An interesting and practically important negative in- 
fluence of attention upon retention has been demonstrated 
by Miiller and Pilzecker. (*] They found that retention 
was much impaired if attention were turned at once to 
something else after a series had been learned, while if one 
rested, thought of nothing in particular, for a few moments 
after the task had been finished, the relearning was very 
much easier. If after a series of nonsense syllables had 
been learned, the learner turned at once to mental com- 
putations, to learning other series or to performing any 
‘other work whatsoever, but twenty-four per cent of the 
series could be recalled six minutes later, while if nothing 
was done in the interval, fifty-six per cent could be re- 
called. Or for relearning an average of eight repetitions 
was required to reinstate the series, while after the same 
interval spent in rest, but four and nine-tenths repetitions 
were necessary. The rest should last approximately six 
minutes, as shown by the fact that after six mimutes forty- 
eight per cent of correct answers were given, while if work 
were first begun after seventeen seconds only twenty- 
eight per cent correct answers were made. It appears 
from these facts that an important part of the process 
of fixing the associations runs its course after the repetitions 
have been finished. An indication as to what this pro- 
cess is, is furnished by the fact of the memory after-image 
that was mentioned in an earlier chapter, or what Miiller
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 Attention 
has called the perseverance tendency of associations or 
ideas, a tendency to remain in consciousness for a period 
after the stimulus has ceased. This period of inertia of 
nerve cells seems highly favourable to the fixing of asso- 
ciations, and, if interrupted by vigorous attention to 
anything else, is correspondingly diminished. Quiet con- 
templation gives the connections time to set and become 
permanent. 
If every feature of learning and of retention is thus shot 
through by attention to so great a degree that it is difficult 
to say at any time whether, in the explanation of any 
phenomenon, the bare capacity for forming associations is 
more important than adequacy of attending it is also equally 
true that recollection is very largely influenced by attention. 
Particularly is it true that if the fact recalled is to be 
suited to the problem in hand, selection from among the 
associations must be made by the wider group of conditions- 
that we know in connection with attention rather than by 
the bare physiological connections dependent upon inten- 
sity, frequency, and recency of occurrence. 
The effect of attention upon the return of the impression 
is again almost exactly the same, in fact, is identical 
with the effect in controlling the direction of association. 
What is recalled at any moment depends upon the idea 
that was in mind just before, and upon the mental attitude 
of that time—the general setting that gives the particular 
association its direction. As attention has a large part 
in determining what shall have been in mind at*the preced- 
ing moment, and as it is also largely effective in turning the 
course of the associations, it is evident that recall as a whole 
is in large part a function of attention. What any event 
shall suggest to you depends not only upon what other 
events you have experienced before, but also upon your 
capacity to see in the present event some similarity to the 
preceding experience that would be useful in this emergency. 
And that, again, depends upon the attitude you can take 
toward the present circumstance. This ability to take
-P-A-G-E-155
Attention in Memory 145 
the proper attitude toward the set of events at the right 
time is also, again, dependent upon your general knowledge, 
upon having an organised system of facts into which the 
new element may be fitted, upon being able to attend to 
it properly, and so observe the features which are essential. 
A large part of what we ordinarily call a good memory 
consists in nothing else than this ability to think of the 
right fact at the right time. The invention of the steam- 
engine was assured when a possible use for its energy was 
suggested by the force that the steam from the spout of 
the tea-kettle exerted. “ Many men knew of the value of force 
in general, and many men had observed that a straw would 
be bent by the steam from the spout, but no man before had 
also analysed the characteristic of force, and had the sug- 
gestion of the adaptation to a practical end, at the same 
time. All other elements were present in the mental 
content except the right conditions of the attention 
to bring about that analysis and to direct the train of 
associations into that particular path. This hung upon 
the presence of just the right knowledge and just the right 
attitude toward the problem at that time. Being in pos- 
session of the fact is not sufficient, there must also be 
sufficient acuteness to apply the knowledge at the proper 
time, and this is largely a problem of the attention. Even 
in the schoolroom inability to answer questions is not 
so much lack of proper knowledge as inability to see in 
the question the proper cue to the answer and lack of the 
proper related knowledge that will direct the train of 
associations to the particular fact desired. All this, of 
course, depends upon earlier experiences, upon knowledge 
in general, as has been pointed out so often before in this 
volume ; it is not lack of the particular bit of knowledge 
in question, but of the more indefinite and widely dis- 
tributed general knowledge, that shall make the particular 
effective at this time and in this connection. 
Recognition, the third phase of memory in the traditional 
treatment, is rather less dependent upon attention than 
L
-P-A-G-E-156
146 Attention 
the two preceding, but nevertheless is by no means un- 
influenced by it. As has been so frequently asserted, 
recognition of the time and place of occurrence of an earlier 
event is essential if recall itself is to have any value. If 
one could not distinguish between an original experience 
and a returning idea, or if the old were known merely as 
old without knowledge of its date and the circumstances 
that attended its earlier appearance, memories would be 
rather a source of confusion than an aid in the mental 
life. Recognition proper is always a mark added to the 
returning impression that stamps the time and place of 
its earlier experiencing, very much as the inscription on the 
coin marks the year and country of its issue. Both marks 
are largely indifferent to the quality or character of the 
thing marked, but are of value only for purposes of 
classification. What the mark of recognition is has not 
altogether been agreed upon. It has been suggested by 
different men that it is an old or habitual mode of reaction 
to the entering mental process ; that it is a mood or feeling 
of pleasure that comes with an old experience just because 
it is old, but which is not further analysable; that it is 
the addition to the returning impression of some distinctive 
other idea that has already been assigned a definite place 
in our experience, or the reception of the new into a familiar 
general class by the addition of a word or other generalising 
symbol. Probably each of these statements will apply 
to certain cases of recognition, but no one will satisfactorily 
cover all. The more self-conscious processes are due to 
the calling up of associated images or events, the inter- 
mediate stage is not infrequently a reference to a familiar 
standard or word, while the most reflex and immediate pro- 
cess may involve easy and ready response in an appropriate 
way. Most of these processes too are accompanied by a 
pleasant mood, although that is probably a resultant of 
some one or several of the processes mentioned above 
rather than itself primary. 
However recognition comes about, we may be certain
-P-A-G-E-157
Attention in Memory 147 
that how we recognise an object depends upon the way 
we are attending at the moment. Every idea is capable 
of being recognised in several different ways. A book is 
at one time a source of information, at another a paper 
weight, and again in an emergency a fuel. Which of these 
divergent things it shall be at any moment depends upon 
the mood one is in and the external circumstances of the 
moment. If we consider recognition of objects rather 
than of ideas, we find that attention of a given kind will 
render one liable to illusions of either a positive or negative 
character. Things will be recognised as belonging to a 
given class when they are of an entirely different character, 
or other objects for which we are not at the moment pre- 
pared will be entirely denied recognition, although as familiar 
as can be in the usual mood. In a strange city, or in a 
foreign land, a familiar face will be denied recognition, 
while the association or mood of recognition will leap out 
too soon to meet an individual when some one in particular 
is expected. 
Very much the same statements are to be made of the 
recognitory process as it attaches to ideas. Some return- 
ing ideas are recognised too easily and falsely, others are 
refused credence momentarily, because we are not prepared 
for them, or are too intently expecting something else. 
Every one remembers in his own experience recognising 
pseudo-facts suggested by an opponent in debate and 
accepted because they fitted in with other facts, only to 
find to his chagrin on reference that the recognition was 
false. Again ideas will be denied recognition if they do 
not harmonise with present conditions, even if they have 
been experienced comparatively recently. Cases of this 
kind suggest that attention and similar processes are at 
the basis of most of the faults of recognition, and indicate 
that it is probably equally important in the normal process 
as well. 
Wherever we turn in the consideration of the memory 
problem, then, we find that we cannot account for memory 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
148 Attention 
even superficially unless we consider its connection with 
attention. Whether it be learning or retention, recall or 
recognition, the key to the effectiveness of the process 
and even to its nature is to be found in attention. A good 
memory is not something that can be acquired in isolation, 
but depends upon adequate attention, wide interests, 
broad knowledge, and manifold experiences. 
SUMMARY 
1. Memory is influenced by attention in each of its 
three processes. 
2. Retention is dependent on the degree of attention 
that was given at the moment of learning. In the ex- 
periments upon memory, most of the methods that are 
favourable to retention are favourable to attention. 
3. Recall is always directed by attention. If the mind is 
attentive in the right way, the correct bit of information is 
recalled, if not, the recall will be in error. 
4. Recognition is influenced by attention both in its quick- 
kness and correctuess. When one is attentive, recognition 
is quick ; when attentive to the object that appears, recogni- 
tion is accurate ; when expecting something that does not 
appear, recognition is likely to be false. 
5. All training of memory is through training of 
attention,

  CHAPTER X 
ATTENTION AND WILL, OR ACTION 
NOTHER function that cannot easily be dissociated 
from the attention is that which results in action— 
what is ordinarily known as will. One phase of the subject 
has already been discussed and has been found to be practi- 
cally identical with the problem of ttention. This is 
what is ordinarily known internal pe he ability ta__ 
choose is to enter conSciousness and to direct the 
a ot ideas WaT Te COREY Bf"the-enteaneeof idags. we have seen to be dependent upon the attention, to be ~~ 
conditioned by a series of circumstances rooted in heredity, 
in the social and chyitat Shvircnmiedtand-norte be fem a 
exhibition Of any new or~pecutiar-process. The control 
of the course of thought is also a function of the same 
influences, and can, as we have seen, be ascribed to attention 
with equal right. There remains to consider the so-called 
external will, or the manifestations of will in the control 
of bodily movements. The close connection of the internal 
will and attention would at least suggest that there was 
a close connection also between the attention and the 
external phase of the will problem, or would at least be 
sufficient to suggest that we consider the relation between 
the two. 
There is one general principle in connection with all 
forms of action which is sufficient to raise the general 
presumption that attention is a highly important condition 
for the voluntary processes. This is that every movement 
must be preceded by a sensation, that without the sensation 
149
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 Attention 
there can be no movement, and that every movement is 
determined both in its intensity and in its direction by 
some sensory process. On the physiological side, this 
means that every movement is the result of the stimula- 
tion of some sensory nerve, that there can be no stimulation 
of the motor nerve in its normal connections except through 
a sensory impression or stimulus of some kind or other. 
So far does this go, that if the sensory nerves from any 
part of the body are destroyed there is a loss of control 
of the corresponding muscles. Under those circumstances 
it is only by guiding the movements of the member by 
vision that any movement, or at least any accurate move- 
ment, is possible. One case of tabes is cited, in which a 
woman who suffered from general anesthesia of the arms 
could hold her child only so long as she looked at it—when 
she closed her eyes or looked away it at once slipped from 
her grasp. If it is so completely impossible to isolate 
movement from sensation, then evidently all the condi- 
tions which control the course of ideas would ipso facto exert 
a very great influence upon movement also. As attention 
is in almost complete control of the entrance of sensations 
and of the course of ideas, we naturally expect it to play 
a large part in the direction of the bodily movements 
as well. 
The concrete facts of our experience bear out the theo- 
retical conclusion. Everywhere we find that attention 
to the movement to be made or to the result to be attained 
by the movement is the conscious experience that precedes 
action. As we saw before in discussing the motor con- 
comitants of attention, if any one object in the field of 
vision catches the attention, there is at once a turning of 
the eye in such a way as to bring the object upon the 
centre of the retina, upon the point of clearest vision. 
There is no intermediate link. Attention to the object 
and movement seem united as parts of a,single process. 
It is only after considerable practice that it is possible to 
observe the object with the side of the retina—to look out  
-P-A-G-E-161
  Attention and Will, or Action i5i 
of the side of the eye without turning the eye to permit 
the impression to be received upon the most sensitive 
portion of the retina. And even when this is accomplished, 
it is by dividing the attention between the object to be 
seen with the periphery and some other directly in front. 
The half attention to the impression upon the fovea keeps 
the eye fixed in the desired position. 
Exactly the same statement holds of the other voluntary 
movements. If you will study the mechanism of any 
action you will see that to keep firmly in mind the move- 
ment that you desire to make, or the object to be attained 
by the movement, is the one prerequisite for initiating the 
movement, or for controlling it when once it has started. 
Picture your hand ina certain place, and it will immediately 
proceed to move towards that place, unless, as in the case 
of holding the eye at rest while attending to an object at 
one side, you also attend in part to the present position 
of the hand. Fix your attention upon an object upon the 
table closely and completely, and you will usually find 
yourself fingering that object before many moments have 
passed. Of course you will answer that looking, even 
with picturing your hand moving towards the object, does 
not, necessarily involve handling, and this must be granted. 
Look more closely, however, and you will see that even 
the refraining is due to the attention. There is always 
a tendency to move with attention, and when the tendency 
does not become realised it is because the attention is 
turned later to something else, or is at the time divided 
between two objects in different positions. Usually the 
restraining attention consists in attending to the hand 
in its present position. 
Much clearer are the instances that come from games. 
“ Keep your eye on the ball”’ in golf is a familiar statement 
of the fact that the movement of the arms is controlled 
immediately by attention to some object in the field of 
vision. There is little or no thought of the movements 
to be made or of anything else except the place upon which
-P-A-G-E-162
  
  152 Attention 
the blow is to be delivered. Again, it is a familiar experi- 
ence that if the mind wanders to any other idea than that 
of the proper place, if you think how far the ball is likely 
to go, or of the position of the arms at any point of the 
movement, or of any other extraneous matter, the wandering 
of the attention will be recorded in the inaccuracy of the 
stroke. The stroke is determined not by one, but by 
many attentions, and the blow is a resultant of the different 
tendencies. The novice at bicycle riding will for the same 
reason run into every obstacle that he sees. The tree, 
the bystander, the stone in his path, are the objects which 
attract his attention, and so are the objects towards which 
he directs his course. It is only as he learns to direct his 
attention to the part of the path where no difficulties lie 
that his way becomes smooth. Similarly, in guiding a 
team around the corner, the beginner must think which 
rein to pull, must attend to the position and movement 
of the hand at each moment ; but with increased practice, 
although the movement is still directly under the influence 
of attention, it is only necessary to attend to the direction 
to be taken. The movement is made without any idea 
of the separate elements involved. The more highly de- 
veloped the movement, the less attention need be given 
to details, the more general is the cue that will serve to 
initiate the entire process. 
This general result is really but an extension of the fact 
mentioned in an earlier chapter, that every act of attention 
tends to pass over into movements which are usually un- 
conscious, but which in what we call voluntary action are 
fully known at the time of their occurrence. Another 
instance that will illustrate the close relation between 
these unconscious movements and the ordinary movements 
of everyday life is found in the control of the organs of 
speech. If you will record the movements of the larynx 
by a suitable mechanism while repeating some verses aloud, 
and then will take a record while you merely think through 
the words without any vocal expression, it will be found  
-P-A-G-E-163
  Attention and Will, or Action 153 
that the two tracings agree at every point except that 
the movements made when the words are merely thought 
are slighter than when expression is given to them. This 
tendency to follow the course of thought by movement may 
go so far that there is an unconscious expression even in 
perfectly normal persons. Lehmann and Hansen [‘] ob- 
tained indications of this kind in some experiments in 
which they attempted to investigate the results of the 
Society for Psychical Research that seemed to show com- 
munication between mind and mind at a distance with 
no known physical intervention. One man was placed 
at a distance from the other and was asked to think of 
letters or figures, while the other was to record anything 
that he might be thinking of at the time. The result 
showed that frequently the second person would write 
down symbols that more or less closely resembled those 
which the first man had in mind. Close examination 
showed that the first man actually whispered the words 
that he thought, and these whispers were transmitted 
farther than was to be expected, because the walls of the 
room were so placed as to form a rude lens that had one 
of the men at one focus, the other at another. Apparently, 
then, all thinking in words is accompanied by an actual 
expression, or at least by actual movements of the vocal 
organs. Under conditions of unusual interest these move- 
ments give rise unconsciously to audible tones, and when 
the inhibitions are removed the ordinary speech follows 
at once upon the idea of the words. The only difference 
between thinking in words and talking is in the degree 
of movement of the organs of speech, and the difference 
is made by restraining the natural tendency in thinking, 
not by the addition of something new when we think 
aloud. The conditions of ordinary speech, then, are to 
be found altogether in the subjective conditions that bring 
the ideas of the words into consciousness. These, as we have 
seen in the earlier chapters, are to be found in the earlier 
experiences of the individual, in short, in the attention.  
-P-A-G-E-164
    154 Attention 
But we must consider the effect of attention not merely 
in the fully developed consciousness, but in the develop- 
ment of action as well. If we find that all action is pre- 
ceded by and dependent upon ideas, the natural query 
comes, how did this particular movement come to be 
connected with this definite idea? In the early stages 
of accomplishment we will many things that we are not able 
to perform. The ideas are apparently present in full 
completeness, but no movement follows, or at least the 
movement that would lead to the end desired does not 
follow. In the course of time and after numerous struggles 
the proper movement is acquired, and after that desire 
leads at once to satisfaction. If we ask the general ques- 
tion how was this brought about, we recognise two classes 
of connections with reference to the time of origin. Some 
are already present in some degree of perfection before 
birth, others are acquired in the lifetime of the individual. 
Some of the pre-natal connections are present fully formed 
at birth, others develop with increasing development of 
the nervous system, but without any learning on the part 
of the individual. These are both known as reflex, or 
instinctive actions, and must evidently be explained on 
evolutionary grounds. 
If we reject all theories that imply the inheritance of 
acquired characters as modern biology is inclined to, the 
explanation of the instinctive and reflex actions would 
depend entirely upon the survival of those organisms in 
which the movements that are suited to the environment 
in which they find themselves make their appeareance 
owing to changes in the structure, and the elimination of 
all others not adapted to react in a suitable way. It is 
a process of trial and error, in which the trying is represented 
by chance changes in the germ plasm, success implies 
increased liability to survive and consequent increase in 
numbers over those species less fit, and failure involves 
increased liability to death from environmental agencies 
or starvation. In all this attenton can play little real  
-P-A-G-E-165
  Attention and Will, or Action 155 
part, for acquired. habits that attention favours would die 
with the body and not be transmitted. It is only in so far 
as the capacities for attention are among the physiological 
characteristics transmitted that it would play any part, 
and then it would not constitute a fundamental principle 
of explanation, but would be one of the many effects 
of the changing nervous organism. 
Adaptation within the life of the individual may be 
made to follow the same general scheme, but here the 
influence of attending is everywhere apparent. Here, 
again, there is little or no conscious foreshadowing of the 
result to be attained, but from among the movements that 
chance to come from organic causes there is selection 
of those which best suit the purpose of the moment or the 
situation. A certain number of responses are predeter- 
mined at birth by the racial acquirements of instinct, 
but in man and the higher animals a vastly greater number 
of movements are possible from the side of the nervous 
connections than are fixed or predetermined. The process 
of learning seems to depend entirely upon selecting from 
the movements that are possible at birth those which 
are either important for the individual or are more im- 
portant than the movements given at birth in full perfection. 
Some instincts are retained and acquire new strength 
from use, others are checked and destroyed, still others are 
modified to suit the new conditions of the individual. 
To the instincts are added new movements selected from 
the indefinite random movements of childhood, become 
definite by selection and fixed by habit. 
Evidently in an animal of fairly high development, the 
movements acquired by a process of selection are even more 
important than the movements inherited, and an under- 
standing of the method of selection is highly desirable. 
That animals learn by this method of chance trial was made 
clear by Thorndike [5] in some experiments on dogs, cats, 
and chicks [3*4*]. The experiments were performed by 
placing the animals in cages, with fastenings of different  
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 Attention 
degrees of complexity, and determining the methods they 
used to free themselves under the stimulus of hunger. The 
method used in every instance was to bite and scratch 
about at random until by a lucky chance some movement 
successfully opened the door. After the first success, 
shorter and shorter times were required until the connection 
became so close between the stimulus provided by sight 
of the catch and the movement of escape that the appro- 
priate response was executed at once, and learning was 
complete. These experiments have been frequently re- 
peated on animals of all grades, and it has been found 
that the method of learning holds from below the verte- 
brates to apes. This seems for animals the only possible 
method of acquiring a new movement. Both scientists 
and animal trainers seem to be agreed that an animal cannot 
be taught a movement by being put through it by the 
hand of the trainer. The impulse to action must originate 
within the animal in an idea or stimulus, if it is to be per- 
manently learned, if any trace of the action is to be 
left in the organism as a basis for later action. So far, too, 
experiments seem to demonstrate no certain evidence of 
imitation in animals. They do not seem to perform a 
movement more quickly or easily from seeing another do it. 
At most, seeing the movement made by another attracts 
attention to the movement when they themselves make it by 
chance, and so indirectly hastens its acquirement, but 
even this aid in animals has not been demonstrated to be 
important. 
Bair investigated the same problem in man where the 
mental processes could be studied directly, and found a 
similar law to hold. Bair chose as the movement to be 
learned the contraction of the retrahens of the ear, the 
muscle behind the ear whose contraction draws it back. 
Few men, and none of those investigated, have control 
of this muscle, although the nervous connections are ready 
to permit its contraction. It stood to the men investigated 
in approximately the same relations as the muscles of the
-P-A-G-E-167
  Attention and Will, or Action 157 
body as a whole to the child at birth. Bair first attempted to 
teach the men experimented upon to use the muscle by con- 
tracting it for them by means of the electric current. The 
method met with very slight success. It seemed to do no 
more than indicate to them the general region in which 
the contractions were to be made, but brought with it no 
power of repeating the movement. There was still the same 
feeling as at first, that one had the same relation to the 
movement as to turning a door-knob on the other side of 
the room. It was perfectly possible to will it to move, but 
no movement followed. The first successful movement 
came by chance in connection with the production of known 
movements of scalp or jaw. Part of the innervation spread 
to the ear muscle, and that contracted with the other 
muscles that were already under voluntary control. When 
the movement to be acquired had once been performed with 
the others it was more and more likely to become an element 
of the complex whenever the others were made, whenever 
the idea of the total was held firmly in mind. 
The next stage was to isolate the new movement from 
the complex in which it had developed. This was entirely 
a result of attention. By keeping attention fixed definitely 
and continuously upon the desired element to the exclusion 
of all other parts of the conjoined movements it was finally 
possible to hold that idea alone in mind, and with that the 
other movements fell away. After the ear movements had 
been isolated from the first complex, both ears still moved 
together with the single impulse; it was not possible to 
contract one alone. By the same process of neglecting one 
and attending to the other, it became possible to move either 
alone at will. 
An interesting by-result of the experiment was an illus- 
tration of the statement that it is the idea alone that pro- 
duces the action. In one set of experiments the men were 
asked to hold the ear relaxed against the current, to prevent 
its contraction. The result was just the reverse of that 
intended. After some control of the movement had been 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 Attention 
obtained, the idea of not making the movement resulted in 
contracting the ear and holding it contracted during the 
entire period that the experiment lasted, acted, in fact, in 
just the same way as did the idea of moving. The specific 
idea, not the general intention, brought about the contrac- 
tion. These results and other observations seem to be conclu- 
sive evidence that all learning is by selection of random 
movements. There is apparently no possibility of learning 
to make a movement on the basis of rational considerations. 
One might have complete knowledge of the anatomy of 
muscle and nerve and still be no nearer the performance of a 
movement than the most ignorant. Unless the muscle has 
at some time been moved in response to an idea, there is 
no possibility of making it contract, no matter how much 
one may know about its connections. 
All of these laws are illustrated to the full in the learning 
of a child. At first all movements are bound together, 
and when any stimulus or idea presents itself, diffuse move- 
ments occur in widely separate parts of the body. The 
first vague reachings of the arms are accompanied by 
corresponding movements of extension in the legs as well. 
As one hand makes a grasping movement the other con- 
tracts, and at times the toes may be seen to make homo- 
logous contractions. From the mass are selected those 
elements that produce satisfactory results ; all the others are 
neglected, and through neglect die away. At first the entire 
complex that results from a stimulus is often the exact 
opposite of the movement that is suited to the occasion. 
So for days all of the elements of the creeping process may be 
present, but the hands may be put too far forward, with the 
result that all movements are away from the desired object 
rather than toward it. It is only a question'of time until 
the correct complex will appear by chance, ‘and then the 
learning will be complete. That will then be permanently 
chosen and stamped in by repetition, because it brings a 
reward. Thus learning in the child is seldom the result 
of intention, rather the child selects the best from what
-P-A-G-E-169
  Attention and Will, or Action 159 
comes out of its organism by chance. Fortunate it is 
that the responses of the organism are so varied and 
persistent that all of the valuable movements make their 
appearance sooner or later, and can be seized upon by 
attention and made permanent by repetition. Even in 
adult life the acquirement of a new movement is by much 
the same method. The more important difference is that 
we already have control of a series of movements that are 
similar to the one desired, and we need only to modify them 
to suit our immediate need. The modification, however, is 
one of chance trial and selection by attention of the correct 
variant. In learning a stroke at golf we adapt the swing of 
an axe or similar swing in a way to make it useful in the new 
connection. The adaptation is not immediate, and trial alone 
will enable one to hit upon the correct complex; when it 
comes attention is given, and habit confirms the acquirement. 
Learning to move then is at every stage very largely a 
matter of attention. We select the complex of movements 
that is most suitable from the movements that chance to be 
made, and then from the complex we select the element 
that is important and neglect all else. The selection of 
both complex and element is the result of attending to the 
sensations that come from the movement or to the result 
that is attained. When, later, either the original stimulus, 
the idea of the sensation of movement or of the general result 
attained comes to consciousness the movement is reinstated. 
When series of movements have thus been learned and 
frequently repeated in the same connection, they become so 
chained together that one idea will suffice for the reinstate- 
ment of the entire series. That idea is usually some rela- 
tively remote end, rather than something connected with 
an individual element. Thus in walking, the desire to 
arrive at a remote place leads to a very complicated set of 
movements with very little thought for the intervening 
details of the execution. In writing, the idea of a general 
sentiment serves to initiate a whole series of movements 
with little or no thought of the separate parts. But even in
-P-A-G-E-170
    160 Attention 
these more complicated cases the initial stage is an idea, 
and the idea is selected and determined by attention. Here 
the idea is often general and remote rather than particular 
and immediate. 
The more complicated actions that are ordinarily denoted 
as volitional offer even more striking illustrations of the 
influence of attention. By volitional action we designate 
those highly developed actions in which decision must be 
made between two opposing courses before movement can 
begin. In these instances too the action is always fore- 
shadowed in idea. The choice is primarily between ideas 
rather than between actions. The alternatives are pre- 
sented in the ends to be attained, and decision is-complete 
when one of the ends is held firmly in mind and the other 
banished. If the choice is between going to one’s room 
to read or going for a stroll, the decision is made when one 
idea or the other holds the centre of consciousness. The 
two ideas are balanced in terms of the relative desirability 
of the two ends. But this means, in terms of our conditions 
of attention, that one appeals to one set of conditions the 
other to another, and whenever one set of conditions pre- 
dominates, the corresponding idea will gain the mastery. 
With that mastery of the idea the movements that have 
been associated at once come into play. When the day is 
pleasant and duty not pressing, or the company unusually 
agreeable, the idea of the stroll wins, and we start for the 
walk. Are the conditions reversed the idea of study table 
predominates ; we return to our rooms and work begins 
forthwith. 
When the problem to be decided upon carries with it the 
performance of acts at a remote time or place the essential 
conditions are similiar, except that the movements are 
delayed to await an appropriate immediate stimulus in 
another set of circumstances. The choice of a profession 
or other life work evidently is a process in which no move- 
ment necessarily follows at the moment, but the decision 
is none the less effective. It narrows the range of indecision  
-P-A-G-E-171
Attention and Will, or Action 161 
for all later decisions in that group, and carries with it, 
directly, decisions on a number of subordinate questions. It 
is decided e.g. that if sufficient money is available one univer- 
sity will be attended, if not another will be chosen, or work be 
begun on the apprentice system, if that be permitted by the 
rules of the community in which the youth resides. Each act 
is prepared for immediately, but its performance awaits the 
presence of suitable occasion and conditions. The decision 
acts at once to control and influence later attention. On the 
other side it is itself the outcome of present attention in- 
fluenced by still earlier conditions. The decision may even 
act in advance to make attention at the moment practically 
unnecessary, or may at least do away with the necessity for 
any idea to intervene between stimulus and response, and 
produce what might be called a voluntarily prepared reflex. 
When the stimulus that has been awaited presents itself, 
the action decided upon in advance is performed at once 
without any intervening idea, although the movement in 
question may not have been performed before in that 
connection, or not frequently enough to have made the 
response automatic. Cases of this kind apparently have 
made Woodworth question whether ideas are essential 
for movement[*]. Woodworth leaves the problem with the 
not very definite or satisfactory statement that the move- 
ment follows upon a disembodied thought, after he has 
given experimental results which indicate that there is 
often no idea discoverable just before the movement is 
made. Dr. Ach [*] worked under rather more definite con- 
ditions, and was able to assign the determining elements 
in the process with considerably greater certainty. He 
employed reaction experiments, in which the observer was 
asked to respond, now to one stimulus, now to another, 
according to directions given in advance for each group 
of experiments. In many instances it was observed that 
the movement followed the stimulus that had been agreed 
upon when there was no definite idea of the action in 
advance of the response, and when nothing intervened 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
162 Attention 
between stimulus and response. Under these circumstances 
Ach found that the task that had been set for the ex- 
periments dominated consciousness, and prepared the way 
for the response. When the stimulus came it resulted at 
once in the action, just as if there had been earlier practice, 
or as if some idea of moving had intervened. The physio- 
logical side of the preparation alone is in evidence in these 
cases, but for action the lack of consciousness is a matter 
of indifference. Attention is to the stimulus, not to the idea, 
and nothing else is necessary for the action to be performed. 
The same anticipatory readiness for action is induced by 
the decision as in the delayed action that was considered 
above. When the occasion implied in the decision presents 
itself, the response is rendered automatic in advance of 
practice, provided, of course, that the action is already under 
control and can be made in response to some other cue. In 
both cases the process is almost identical with the influence 
of mood or purpose in the control of association, as brought 
out in Watt’s experiments. As the mood or question favours 
the rise into consciousness of the object that corresponds to 
it over all impressions not thus favoured, or the task makes 
inevitable one of the possible associates, so the decision 
or task set by another prepares the way for the action 
decided upon when the predetermined stimulus appears, 
and that without the intervention of any idea or other 
intermediary. It is a matter of one or more of the condi- 
tions working directly upon action ; it is attention to the 
stimulus taking the place of attention to the sensation or 
idea. We are dealing with nothing that involves a new 
principle, it is but a slightly different application of an old 
principle. 
If, then, all choice is in the last analysis reducible to the 
selection of one idea from among other ideas, or to 
direct selection of a movement by factors that are almost 
identical with those that control attention, it would follow 
that the conditions of attention are the real determinants of 
action. The ends that we desire are those that appeal to us  
-P-A-G-E-173
Attention and Will, or Action 163 
because of heredity, training, or momentary mood, or those 
that have been forced upon us or made valuable by social 
convention. These are the forces that really choose when 
opportunity is offered. In fact, most difficulties in decision 
come because different sets of conditions favour opposed 
courses of action. Ordinarily, instinct or mood is in conflict 
with the social influences. Choice is the outcome, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, of the struggle. The struggle 
is not often conscious, and decision is marked by no new 
mental process. The only sign of conflict resolved is the 
serene dominance of the one idea or set of ideas that serves 
to initiate the movement. 
t« Will, then, if we are to give the ordinarily accepted 
facts that are designated by the word a place in our scheme, 
might be designated as the dominance of the social factors 
and the appreciation of remote goods against the immediate 
goods that have the guarantee of chance mood and instinct. 
/ One may be said to have a strong will in whom the in- 
fluence of remote social influences is strong and the in- 
fluence of temporary mood and hereditary impulse is 
relatively weak or well subordinated; while a man is of 
weak will in popular estimation if he is not capable of 
retaining permanently or even for long periods the influence 
of general social standards. This difference is undoubtedly 
innate and but slightly subject to the influence of environ- 
mental forces. Whether a strong man takes good or bad 
standards will depend very largely upon the society into 
which he has been born and the educational influences that 
work upon him. Will in this sense is exactly in line with the 
social forces that we have seen to be at work in sensory 
attention, in the control of thought and now of action. 
In one sense we may say that these forces are identical 
in all four fields, and so justify the use of the word will as the 
most general influence in the control of mind, and dis- 
tinguish two effects, external and internal. But in this we 
must be careful to insist that will is no thing or force, but 
merely a convenient term 1o designate the fact that the 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
164 Attention 
early and general social influences hold attention, thought 
and action toward the things that are permanent rather 
than to those things that are transient. 
It seems that the problem of voluntary action is largely, 
if not entirely, a problem of attention, and a complete 
understanding of attention with its nature and conditions 
will also imply an understanding of movements. Some 
forms are more, some less closely connected with the atten- 
tive consciousness, but all are in some measure, and at some 
stage dependent very largely upon the ideas, and must 
also, in so far, be subject to the control of attention. Fur- 
thermore, the more volitional the movement, the more fully 
conscious the action, the greater is the amount of control 
that attention will exert upon movement.{ In common 
language, the more the will is involved in the action, the 
more completely it is subordinated to the attention. This 
phase of the problem of the will also seems to resolve itself 
into a sub-form of the general problem of attention that we 
have been discussing before. The processes which are effec- 
tive in the control of a man’s ideas are ipso facto effective in 
the control of his movements. The course of one’s actions is 
to be explained in terms of his inherited tendencies, from his 
social environment past and present, and from his experi- 
ence reacting upon the stimuli which he is receiving at the 
time in question, just as is the course of his ideas and the 
decision between the various sensations that shall enter con- 
sciousness at any given instant. A man’s action is an ex- 
pression of himself in the widest sense of the term, in- 
cluding in that term every experience that has affected 
him from before birth to the present moment. 
SUMMARY 
x. Action in general is dependent upon sensation. _Move- 
ments only take place after corresponding sensations have 
been in consciousness. It follows, then, since’ attention 
controls the entrance of sensations that it must alsofcontrol 
action.

2. In the developed action of the adult attention to a 
sensation is the practically invariable antecedent to action. 
3. In acquiring a movement for the first time attention is 
effective in three ways: (a) it selects from the chance move- 
ments those that are interesting for further repetition ; (0) it 
selects from the complex movements thus first acquired the 
essential part, and the elements not attended to drop out 
from the complex ; (c) when there is necessity for modifying 
a familiar movement there is first attention to some move- 
ment already known which causes that to be made, and 
then selection from the chance variations in that movement 
of the most desirable variant for the purpose in hand. 
4. Choice is a result of attending to one of two possible 
sensations or ideas with its corresponding movement. 
5. In general, will may be defined as. attention applied 
to the control of movement.

  CHAPTER XI 
ATTENTION AND REASON 
HE third of the more commonly mentioned “faculties ”’ 
that we must examine for its relation to attention’ 
is reason. The part that attention plays in the reasoning 
process comes out very clearly from the similarity in the 
conditions which control the two processes. That the 
mental environment, the traditions of the race or tribe, and 
many other elements of experience, if not of heredity, play 
an important part in determining the nature of reason is to 
be seen from even a casual examination of the inferences 
which different people draw from the same data. The 
Irishman who said on seeing a locomotive: “ Faith ! what 
a lot of horses there must be inside,’ was reasoning from 
his past experience with as much cogency asthe engineer 
who could deduce the horse-power that would be produced 
by a given amount of coal. In actual practice human 
reason is not independent of individual experience, but is 
merely the expression, at a given instant, and with reference 
to a present event, of the history of the race and of the 
particular member of the race in whose consciousness 
the reasoning goes on. 
What distinguishes reasoning from imagination and 
memory is not the way in which the process originates, or 
the nature of the mental process itself, but is our attitude to- 
ward the mental state or the use that we make of those states. 
The thing that we imagine, merely, and do not believe to 
exist in reality, has all the substantive mental character- 
istics of the thing that we reason must exist in a certain 
166
-P-A-G-E-177
  Attention and Reason 167 
place under definite conditions. The event that we recall 
and the one that we argue must take place in the future 
may be pictured in exactly the same way, may have exactly 
the same ideational content. Again, we can trace out 
associations for the remembered, the imagined, and ration- 
ally demonstrated event by exactly the same laws—all 
connections that appear in any one can be traced to older 
connections reinstated under the influence of more” general 
factors, whether the resulting process is what we call reason, 
memory, or imagination. We must turn to their accom- 
paniments of one form or another for the factors that shall 
distinguish them. 
There are two criteria that mark the groups off as distinct. 
One, recognition, has already been considered. It serves 
to distinguish memory from imagination and reason alike. 
When the mark of recognition attaches we say at once 
that the product of our associatory processes then present 
is something that has been experienced before. The other 
events are denied the reference to the past, although they 
may be in all other respects identical. Imagination and 
reason are new constructions that lack the tag of antiquity. 
Imagination is marked off from reason and memory again 
by the fact that we believe the latter process to be true, while 
we doubt the former or believe it to be but partially and 
reservedly true. The fundamental questions, then, with 
reference to all the stages of the reasoning process are, what 
is belief? when do we believe? and when do we doubt? and 
what are the conditions of belief? Here, again, in the 
answer to our problems, we get back to the conditions of 
attention. We can best understand belief from a study of 
the cases in which it is first lacking, and later appears, for 
belief is so generally present in our ordinary conscious 
states that it is hard to find a point for analysis. As Bain 
says, the natural state is belief, and the departures from 
that to doubt or disbelief are the states that really need 
explanation ; they alone are the unusual, if not the positive 
processes. If we examine some case in perception where 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 Attention 
there is doubt, we find that doubt comes whenever two 
interpretations of an event are striving for the mastery. So 
if one is examining an object from a distance, an ocean 
liner for example, one finds that he is in doubt as long as he 
makes first one interpretation, then another. When some 
one near by suggests that it is one well-known boat you 
agree until you remember that you had read that the boat 
had sailed from a distant port so recently that its arrival 
would be impossible ; to another interpretation that comes 
to your mind you find some other strong objection in the 
number or the colour of the funnels, or there is some 
element in your experience that refuses to harmonise with 
the assumption that the boat seen is the one in question. Just 
as long as there is alternation between two possible inter- 
pretations there is doubt; whenever one conquers com- 
pletely and entirely, there is belief. 
The same processes operate to produce doubt when 
one is dealing with more abstract problems, and with 
things remembered or imagined rather than with the 
immediately seen. So when you hear of any distant 
event you judge of its truth by the degree to which it can 
be made to harmonise with what you already know. 
Whenever there are some groups of experience with 
which it will harmonise, and others with which it will not, 
you doubt. When the statement is seen to harmonise with 
one and not to be in conflict with others, you believe. Ordin- 
arily the weighing is not conscious. The systems which 
interpret the statement are not consciously present. There 
is only the presence of one of the alternative explanations, 
then the other, and neither persists. When one interpreta- 
tion wins, it is believed, but the belief may be stated posi- 
tively, or negatively, as disbelief of the alternative. Ordin- 
arily, disbelief is merely belief in something else along with 
the consciousness of the rivalry past or present, not a third 
form of consciousness added to doubt and belief. The one 
possible exception is found in the case in which there are 
many possible interpretations that exclude each other, and _
-P-A-G-E-179
Attention and Reason 169 
  no one wins ; under these circumstances and these alone do 
we find disbelief that is not really belief in something else. 
In each of these cases the conditions that make for 
belief or doubt are the same as the conditions which we have 
seen to account for the original entrance of a sensation ; for 
the interpretation of an object of perception in one way or 
another, and for the control of association. It seems that 
the activity of these conditions not merely determines the 
course of consciousness, but also by their action induces a 
feeling that is for us the mark of the truth or lack of truth 
of the process in question. Just as there may be a tempo- 
rary dominance of one group of factors, to be followed 
at the next moment by another group, so we may have a 
permanent control of belief by one system that is inten- 
tionally or unintentionally in control of mind. Thus the 
artistic attitude toward a novel or a painting or a statue is 
one in which we permit ourselves to feel under the dominance 
of one system, although we know it does not result in the 
production of complete truth. The artist has been con- 
trolled in his production by a limited set of considerations, 
and we, for the moment, accept the same set of experiences, 
and we believe in a partial way as long as he follows com- 
pletely the tacit assumptions he has made. Here we have 
judgment of truth in terms of an artificially limited ex- 
perience, and the result is a belief that is partial, but with a 
suppressed background of knowledge that the statements 
are not true finally and ultimately. Similarly in dreaming, 
part of the brain is asleep, and consequently what association 
processes are present are controlled by a partial, one-sided 
experience. Nevertheless, as long as the parts of know- 
ledge that judge are also the parts that control the course 
of associations, the results are believed. When, however, 
we wake, and the results of the activity of the partial 
consciousness are judged in the light of the whole, the 
product seems at once bizarre and unnatural. 
In every case then we find that belief grows from harmony 
of a particular interpretation with the total experience
-P-A-G-E-180
    170 Attention 
active at the moment. Whether there is a positive belief 
feeling-complex that arises from the interaction of part on 
part when the idea enters, as there is in recognition, or 
whether belief is but the absence of the positive doubt 
process, is difficult to determine from observation, and is 
not a matter of agreement. If the belief-feeling exists it is 
the conscious concomitant of the action of many physio- 
logical processes, themselves unconscious, but due to earlie1 
experiences, which control the course of thought and per- 
ception in the many ways that have been noted in the 
earlier portions of the work. They would correspond to the 
processes mentioned in the last chapter as preparing for 
action when the stimulus was presented, even when there 
was no evidence that preparation had taken place. In the 
opinion of the writer, it is probable that the latter alterna- 
tive is the correct one, that belief is the absence of the 
particular marks of doubt. Where there is conflict between 
two interpretations, or between the one interpretation 
and the whole of knowledge, there is a positive sign or mark, 
but there is no positive mark of harmony. In that case 
Bain would be right in his assertion that the natural pro- 
cess is belief, and that every experience that comes to con- 
sciousness unopposed is believed. 
That the nature of belief, like the course of attention, is 
dependent upon the amount and kind of knowledge at any 
moment, is evidenced by the way beliefs change with 
growth of knowledge in the race or the individual. Many 
things believed at any one stage of knowledge are rejected 
at the next. Belief seems to be just as much the inevi- 
table accompaniment of the knowledge of the man, and of 
the part of his knowledge active at any moment, as is 
attention. 
Belief, then, as a mood or mark that attaches to mental 
states, characterises the results of reasoning as distinguished 
from imagination, as the mood of recognition distinguishes 
memory processes from reasoning and imagination. But 
to describe the results of reasoning in terms of belief tells
-P-A-G-E-181
  Attention and Reason 171 
us little or nothing of the actual forces that lead to the result. 
We must turn then to a more detailed discussion of the way 
in which the processes of association and attention are 
effective in reaching conclusions that shall be believed. 
It will perhaps be best in this discussion to follow the nomen- 
clature of formal logic, in spite of the fact that there can no 
longer be said to be any agreement as to what the words 
shall designate either in modern logic or in psychology. 
This difference of usage may justify any departures that 
we may ourselves make from the definitions of any par- 
ticular school. 
Following current usage, we may say that the first stage 
in the development of reasoning is seen in the process 
of judgment. By judgment many different facts have 
been indicated in logic and in everyday life. All, however, 
have some points of similarity—more, it must be confessed, 
in extension than in intention, for while the actual pro- 
cesses designated are all somewhat similar, the definitions 
that are given are widely divergent. On the strictly 
psychological side, and apart from all considerations of 
language, we may distinguish four different facts that 
have been designated judgment in most recent times. 
These are comparison, evaluation, the ascription of mean- 
ing, and the addition of belief. 
If we begin with the historically first, we find that Bren- 
tano defines judgment as the process of testing the bare 
mental contents with reference to their truth or falsity. He 
insists that there is a first stage of perception in which there is 
neither belief nor disbelief, and that a judgment is passed 
as soon as the process is affirmed to be true or false. We 
shall have reason to conclude that this unbelieved stage 
has no real existence in mind, but that every process is 
accepted or rejected immediately upon its first entrance 
into consciousness. Furthermore, belief is an outcome or 
an incident of the process of entrance into consciousness, 
and nothing new and distinct. While, therefore, belief 
is essential to judging, it is not the characteristic phase.
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 Attention 
The important contribution of Brentano to the theory of 
judgment lies rather in his insistence upon the singleness of 
the judgment process, than upon his actual contributions 
toward a decision as to what the single process might be. 
More widespread is the use of the term judgment to 
designate comparison. Popularly we speak of judging 
weights when we decide which is heavier, and we speak of 
judging when we compare time and space relations as well. 
Psychologically Kiilpe and Marbe have given the use 
currency as a technical definition. Comparison falls easily 
under the description that has been given of attention 
in what precedes. It is a process that follows immediately 
upon attentive observation of two objects when the ques- 
tion in mind as we look is which is greater, better, brighter, 
or what not. The resulting process is always a word, or 
other symbol. All that can be noted in the process 
consciously is attention to the elements and the outcome of 
the entire process in a word. What is common, however, 
to all comparisons is the mood or question that precedes the 
decision and determines what it shall be. If the question 
in mind be which is larger, one judgment will be passed, if 
which is heavier, another, and if it is a question of colour 
or position, still other comparisons will be made. Inno case 
does any demonstrable conscious process intervene between 
observing with the suitable question in mind and the out- 
come in decision. The conditions, process, and result, are 
practically identical with those in attention to a single 
object. The distinction is only that two objects are attended 
to instead of one, that the question involves relation instead 
of one single quality. When we recall, however, that whether 
an object be two or one depends very largely upon how 
we attend, and that what is at one moment one may become 
two or more at the next, the difference is not great enough 
to make the two classes entirely distinct. Moreover, the 
relations that we have in comparisons are not markedly 
enough different from form or number or even quality to 
prevent them from falling under the general head of
-P-A-G-E-183
  Attention and Reason 173 
aspects of the larger whole, that are distinguished by 
attention. : 
Judgments of evaluation are similar to the foregoing, save 
in the single particular that comparison is made between 
the presented object and some earlier developed standard 
ornorm. In many cases the standard is not in consciousness 
at the moment the judgment is made, and the only evidence 
of the comparison is the relative way in which the judgment 
is expressed and the implied presence of the standard. But 
absence of the standard is not characteristic of the process 
of evaluation alone. In cases of delayed comparison or of 
comparison in memory, where one is comparing a colour 
seen yesterday with one shown now, it has been noticed 
repeatedly that the first or standard impression is not 
ordinarily in mind when the comparison results. Further- 
more, the cases in which the image is present are not those 
that give the most accurate results. All that is necessary 
is that the determination to judge be present when the 
second term is shown and the result appears immediately. 
Another phase of the memory experiments that is suggestive 
for the more general judgment of evaluation is that the 
standard often develops during the course of the investiga- 
tion. Lehmann, for example, noted that his observers 
could remember as many shades of gray as there were 
common names in the vocabulary of the individual in 
question. When a set of numbers was learned in connection 
with the grays, the number of shades that could be 
accurately recognised increased from six to nine. The 
different shades were evaluated as before, but new 
standards had developed, and evaluation was corres- 
pondingly more accurate. Very much the same process 
goes on as we judge a painting. The standards have 
developed gradually, and are not necessarily conscious. 
Evaluation, then, falls very readily under the head of com- 
parison. It is comparison with a standard slowly crystallised 
from numerous experiences that may be represented by an 
image, a word, or may not be represented at all; in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 Attention 
latter more usual case the only conscious processes are the 
mood or attitude that serve as condition, and the outcome, 
the evaluation of the object. The mood is as important 
here as in comparison. An object may always be evaluated in 
more than one way, by reference to more than one standard. 
A book may be an excellent paper-weight and a very poor 
treatise on psychology. If your mood or purpose is of one 
kind, the judgment good is passed ; if of another, bad or 
unsatisfactory. 
This takes us even a step nearer the simple perception 
process than before. As we look at a simple object with a 
question in mind, we at once interpret it in terms of earlier 
experiences, and the character of the interpretation varies 
with change in the group of experiences with which it is 
compared, and by the mood we happen to be in as we look. 
Moreover, the interpretation is always a process of reference 
to types that have grown up gradually in our observations, 
and the attempts we have made to harmonise our perceptions 
one with another. To use our old instance, the table that we 
see is no particular single perception, but is unlike any single 
experience, in that its angles are all right angles, and it has 
solidity, while neither the rectangular surface or solidity 
are represented on the retina or have been immediately 
given in any single retinal image. Every interpretation 
as we look is thus, to repeat the statement of an earlier 
chapter, a reference to a norm that has arisen to standardise 
experience. As the mood or purpose determines the norm to 
which the object to be evaluated is referred, so the mood 
determines the way the object shall be interpreted, the 
particular crystallisation to which it shall be referred. As 
an object is satisfactory at one moment and unsatisfactory 
at the next, so it is now a beautiful mountain and again an 
example of volcanic action. Evaluation is closely related 
to comparison on the one side, but is difficult to distinguish 
from a simple case of attending on the other. 
Still more obviously related to the attention process is 
the fourth process that has been designated judgment,
-P-A-G-E-185
  Attention and Reason 175 
probably the most technical of them all: that judgment is 
the ascription of meaning to the given. If we may be per- 
mitted to assign to meaning, as used by the neo-Hegelian 
logicians, any analogue in the concrete conscious process at 
all, we should {find it in the general schemata that we have seen 
to constitute the interpretation of the immediately given 
conscious experience. The meaning of a table is the 
standardised table that is seen in perception in place of the 
surfaces we must draw. The tendency to proceed from 
sensation or group of sensations to the typical experience is 
general, so general, in fact, that it is difficult to say whether 
.there is ever present in consciousness a mere sensation or 
given except as embodied in meaning. If we accept the de- 
finition of Bradley and Bosanquet, that it is the attachment 
of meaning to the given, we would have the process of 
perception at every stage a process of judging, a process 
of passing from the individual to the general, from the 
particular present to the universal past. All perception is in 
this sense an evaluation, although the question of value may 
not be prominent at the moment of perception. Yet never 
is an impression received for itself alone, but always we have _ 
a testing by old developed standards. What we shall judge, 
what meanings shall attach, depends again, as in attention, 
upon present purpose and past knowledge. Whether we 
shall at any moment be concerned with a bit of coal as a 
weapon of defence or a fuel, whether as a fossil tree or 
a relatively pure form of carbon, depends upon what the 
appreciated need of the moment may be, and what we have 
previously learned of the substance, its origin, chemical 
composition, and uses. In every case the nature of the 
judgment is dependent upon the same conditions that we 
have seen to be active in attention. In this, too, judgments 
of the simple ordinary kind are practically identical with 
judgments of comparison and evaluation. The two latter 
are but sub-forms of the former. The problem or need of 
the moment differentiates them. There must always be at 
least two objects, or two aspects of a common object
-P-A-G-E-186
    176 Attention 
present in comparison and evaluation, instead of one 
as in the attachment of meaning and attention. In other 
respects the process is similiar in all three, and all are 
identical in essential elements with the processes involved 
in attending. If we summarise the three latter forms we 
may say that judgment consists in attending to a simple or 
complex content with a definite purpose in mind, and that 
as a result there starts into mind a meaningful standardised 
object that we accept as true, as real. Moreover, it must be 
insisted that there is no sign of the uninterpreted given or 
sensation in mind. The pure sensation of the psychologist 
has existence only as another interpretation or meaning 
which the psychologist gives or applies as his interpretation 
of the experience, an interpretation under a new purpose, 
and consequently of different character, although it may 
be equally true with the interpretation of the scientist or of 
everyday life. 
All this leaves out of consideration the process that the 
formal logician has designated as judgment, time out of 
mind. The formal logician has insisted that judgment is 
always a combination of at least two elements in a single 
whole. This definition has developed from the fact that the 
formal logician is concerned with reasoning primarily as it is 
expressed in words rather than with the mental processes 
that lie behind. The connection of subject and predicate 
in the sentence was made the type of the logical connection, 
and all the judgments of thought were crowded into 
that same mould. That the attempt has not been satisfac- - 
tory, altogether, is evidenced by the great uncertainty 
among those who accept the statement as to what the rela- 
tion is between the two elements in question. The attempts 
of the more modern logicians to find in the proposition 
the analogue of the attachment of meaning in the sense 
considered above can hardly be said to be more satisfactory. 
Ordinarily, as in Bradley and Bosanquet, it is asserted that 
the given is represented in the subject, and that the meaning 
that is attached is represented by the predicate. We have
-P-A-G-E-187
  Attention and Reason 177 
seen, however, that the given is probably not represented 
in consciousness at all, but that the meaning alone comes 
to mind. It is hardly likely that we should find expressed 
what is really not in mind. It is probable that there is no 
one to one relation between thought and language in this 
connection, but that what is single in mind is represented 
in language at one time by two terms, and again that two 
meanings are represented in a single proposition. Ordinar- 
ily, it is true, the meaning in the predicate is alone prominent 
at the moment the judgment is passed, and that the 
subject represents something that was attended to at the 
moment just preceding. Sometimes, too, the subject seems 
never to have been essential to thought, but to have been 
added by force of habit in speech. It would take us too far 
into the technicalities of formal logic to attempt to reduce 
each of its forms of judgment to a psychological equivalent. 
Suffice it then to say that in the proposition, or in each term of 
the proposition, we have represented a judgment, a process 
of ascribing meaning to the entering sensation, a process 
of affixing some one of the ready-made predeveloped 
schemata to the stimulus that presents itself from the 
external world, or is brought in by some one preceding link 
in the chain of thought. 
Inference, the next stage in complexity in the reasoning 
process, is no less influenced by attention than is judgment. 
If judgment may be defined practically as the appreciation 
of a situation, inference is the imagined remedy for the 
situation, the means of meeting the situation. In inference 
something is added in thought that will remove the obstacle 
that has been recognised. The suggested improvement 
develops on the basis of earlier experience. If we have 
made perception or attention the correlate of judgment, 
association would offer the correlate of inference. In the 
simpler forms of reasoning we first appreciate the difficulty, 
we then look for means of obviating it. When we have 
opened a window and find the catch is broken and it will not 
remain open, we look about for a substitute of any kind, 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
178 Attention 
The first step in the practical bit of reasoning is to appreciate 
that the catch is broken ; the second is a mental suggestion 
of a makeshift that will replace it. When the image of the 
window supported by a brush or ruler enters mind, it is 
accepted as a proper solution of the difficulty, and we at 
once turn the head and eyes to look for the object in its 
familiar place. The inference is complete, the conclusion is 
reached in these simple concrete forms of reasoning, when 
the picture of the difficulty remedied rises to mind. Here, 
again, the solution of the difficulty, like the appreciation 
of the difficulty, arises under the influence of definite sub- 
jective conditions. The solution must have been experienced 
before in some similar situation, and ordinarily many 
solutions have been put in practice at different times. 
Which of the many different solutions shall come out de- 
pends upon the character of the momentary mood and the 
education, in the broad sense, that the thinker has enjoyed 
up to the moment in question. One who reasons well in an 
emergency is one who appreciates the situation fully, who 
has an ample array of knowledge at hand to bear upon the 
situation, and whose entire knowledge is active at the 
particular moment in choosing from among the possible 
solutions that are known. 
When one is dealing with more remote problems, problems 
that may be called general rather than particular, the same 
rule holds. In fact, reasoning of a general character is 
really reasoning in concrete terms ; the only difference is 
that the associations and connections are regarded as true 
of all instances rather than of the specific image alone. But 
this is not a marked difference, because, as we have seen in 
discussing judgment, we never even in perception have a 
bare or true particular. As we look at the most concrete 
object, we always see not the bare concrete, but the con- 
crete interpreted by and transformed into earlier and 
developed experience. We see the type in every case, not 
the bare image. So when we talk of man in general the 
same thing holds. We think in concrete terms and reason  
-P-A-G-E-189
Attention and Reason 179 
what man can do on the basis of what we know of man, 
but we know that the concrete imagery means, and will 
hold true for, all men, or the particular group of men to 
whom we intend the property in question to apply. So 
when we assert that man is mortal, we may have in mind 
the death of a particular individual, but in so far as it is 
guided by all our knowledge of the constitution of man we 
believe it to be true of all men, of those now alive as well 
as of the multitudes who are already dead. The degree of 
truth of the conclusion depends, not upon the number 
of specific instances, but upon the amount of knowledge 
the man possesses, and the amount that is active at the 
moment the assertion is made. The concrete, but typical, 
then becomes typical because of the masses of knowledge 
that stand behind it, and is true or approaches truth as the 
knowledge effective at the moment approaches all possible 
knowledge. The course of reasoning is controlled by what 
we have seen to be the conditions of attention in exactly 
the same way as is any association. 
In this discussion we have apparently taken issue with 
the statement of formal logic, that in every bit of reasoning 
there are three terms or three propositions involved. We 
seem to have nothing left but the conclusion, both premises 
have disappeared. This treatment is not altogether re- 
volutionary, for even Thomas Brown had pointed out that 
the major premise really added no truth to the conclusion, 
and was rarely if ever present in the actual thinking process. 
If there is no major premise, the minor would be without 
dependence, and so valueless. If we study the actual think- 
ing process, it seems that we rarely have anything but the 
conclusion when the decision is made. The only occasions 
when the major and minor premises come into play are 
when we would test some conclusion that has already been 
attained. When one asks how we know that a statement 
we have made is true, we refer to some general statement that 
corresponds to the major premise and assert in the minor 
that this case of ours is an instance under the general type. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
180 Attention 
Ordinarily the forces and conditions that lead to the asser- 
tion are in part represented in the general statement, but in 
no case can we do more than point back to some statement 
that has been accepted by speaker and hearer as systema- 
tising and harmonising the experience of each. What has 
led to the conclusion is this experience as a dynamic force, 
and it is part of the same experience that has been tested 
and harmonised in the major premise. For example, when 
one has decided in pictorial form that a rod will support the 
window in the instance first mentioned, it would be perfectly 
possible to construct a whole series of syllogisms to prove 
the truth of the conclusion. One might assert that a 
falling object will be supported by any object whose crush- 
ing point is higher than the force exerted by the earth upon 
the body, with the minor premise that the rod in question 
possesses the sufficiently high breaking point. But the asser- 
tion does not necessarily grow out of the premise. One 
would never take the trouble even to assert the premise unless 
questioned, and then the truth of the major premise is 
already involved in, and consequently adds nothing to the 
truth of the conclusion. And one might construct syllo- 
gism after syllogism as to the relations to gravitation, the 
dimension of the rod, the substance of which it is composed, 
and so on, all of which are representations of different parts 
of the knowledge that leads us to the conclusion, the only 
representative in consciousness of the forces that are at work 
in giving rise to the inference. 
For ourselves, the major premise when it appears in 
answer to our questioning of the truth of some inference 
we have made, seems to serve to give definiteness and 
certainty to the conclusion. If we can see that some 
association, in itself new, is but some one form of an old 
familiar truth, the belief that attaches to the latter seems 
to spread to the former. So, while the major premise may 
be said never to appear before the conclusion in definite form, 
it is of value, where definitely formulated, in giving a resting- 
place for belief, as well as in being a type or sign of the   
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  Attention and Reason S18 
forces that are really effective in governing the train of 
association that leads to the conclusion. 
At every stage then reason is closely related to attention, 
If judgment may be defined as the selecting of the essential 
phase of a given situation and its proper interpretation, 
both under the influence of the forces that condition attend- 
ing, inference may likewise be said to be an association under 
the influence of a complete knowledge that leads to the 
discovery of a needful change in the situation. 
We are forced to the conclusion that reasoning is not a 
process distinct from association, and the other more 
common trains of ideas, but is only a special application of 
those processes in some of their more unusual aspects. In 
ordinary speech reason means either thinking in words 
in a way that enables one to pass from some statement 
already given to some other statement that seems to depend 
upon the first, or it means to think abstractly, to carry 
trains of ideas in symbols that have a general meaning, 
tather than in the concrete experiences. But no one of 
these definitions of reason is complete. We certainly talk 
of reasoning when no words are used ; one infers one object 
or set of relations from others when only the ideas of the 
objects are present, and there are no words attached. 
Again, we very generally speak of reasoning when the terms 
involved are perfectly concrete and involve nothing more 
than the objects offered to sense, or at least come as near 
involving nothing beyond the mere given series of ex- 
periences as any perception can. We have then to regard 
reasoning, by a process of exclusion, as merely thinking in 
succession of different objects or relations of objects on the 
basis of connections that our experience shows to be possible 
and valid. This we have seen also to be the basis of per- 
ception and of all association of ideas. In short, then, any 
purposeful train of ideas, or any one which follows lines in 
harmony with our experience as a whole and not merely with 
partial aspects of our experience, may be called reasoning. 
This harmony with the sum total of our past life, as opposed
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 Attention 
to the particular and temporary groups of experiences, 
constitutes what are for us the general or universal connec- 
tions, and consequently are for the individual the ultimate 
tests of truth in his thinking. Reasoning then is but per- 
ception or association under the influence of the attentive 
as opposed to the merely mechanical or physiological con- 
ditions of thinking. It is a train of ideas or the interpreta- 
tion of a group of sensations in the light of all that the man 
has known or experienced, and of all that the race or com- 
munity has known down to the present time. ‘In that 
sense attention is the controlling influence in reason as it 
is in memory and in will. The conditions of attention 
are at the same time the conditions of reason. One involves 
the other and cannot be separated from it. 
In the same way we might go through the other more 
specialised mental functions and show that the principles 
involved in attention are all implied in them. Imagination, 
for example, is assuredly only different from memory and 
reasoning in that the set of conditions which control 
the associations are recognised as partial, and chosen with 
reference to the mere needs of the moment rather than 
drawn in harmony with the mass of the life’s experiences. 
Each of the other special functions of mind might be brought 
into harmony with the facts of attention in the same 
way, but those already treated are sufficient to show the 
importance of the part it plays in the mental processes in 
general, and the other applications can be easily made. 
It may seem that we have magnified the part played by 
attention in all of these processes, and that one investigating 
the same processes with the purpose of showing the im- 
portance of association or of retentiveness would find that 
each of these processes was equally involved everywhere. 
This is of course true. No one of the complicated processes 
can be explained without considering all of the simple 
processes, but the part played by the other simple processes 
will stand out prominently from our discussion. The 
objection is but one way of stating the now familiar dogma,  
-P-A-G-E-193
Attention and Reason 183 
that mind is not made up of isolated parts, but is a closely 
inter-connected unity. One part cannot be explained with- 
out all others. No treatment of attention can be a treat- 
ment of attention merely. Any explanation of it must 
necessarily involve an explanation of all the other mental 
“ faculties.” 
SUMMARY 
i. Reasoning in all of its phases is a new use of the 
processes heretofore discussed, attention, and association 
under the influence of attention. 
2. What distinguishes reasoning from the related processes 
of memory and imagination is belief. Belief, too, arises 
from an interaction of experience upon the concrete process, 
i.e. from the same factors that are active in the determina- 
tion of attention. 
3. Judgment, the first operation in reasoning, is a process 
of referring the given to a type or meaning under the 
influence of attention. Attention decides to what type 
the given shall be referred, how it shall be interpreted. 
4. Inference is a process of improving or changing the 
given as interpreted in judgment. It is a process of associa- 
tion under the influence of experience as a whole.

  CHAPTER XII 
ATTENTION AND FEELING, OR EMOTION 
HE problem of attention in its relation to feeling and 
affective states in general is much more complicated 
than the relation to the cognitive processes already dis- 
cussed. We can be sure that attention influences the 
feelings at every point, but in the nature of the case the 
relation cannot be experimented upon easily nor can intro- 
spection be very accurate. Consequently there is much 
opinion on all phases of the subject, and comparatively 
little agreement. The most that can be done is to mention 
those statements that are generally agreed upon, and 
endeavour to solve conflicts by reference to the general 
theory we have been following throughout the discussion. 
Superficially regarded, we see in everyday life that the 
relation between feeling and emotion on the one hand, and 
attention on the other, is a mutual one, and in general one of 
mutual opposition. When we are attentive, feelings and 
emotions are usually of less strength ; when we are emotion- 
ally much wrought up, attention is generally difficult and 
more ineffective than in the moments of calm contempla- 
tion. The connection is at least close enough to deserve 
discussion even if the facts that have accumulated are not 
sufficiently numerous to make the conclusion very definite. 
We must begin our discussion in this realm as opposed to 
sensation by asking what we are to mean by feeling and the 
affective states generally. In usage feeling is a word that 
covers an indefinite field. In its broad use it has served 
to designate a mass of vague states, sensations from skin, 
184
-P-A-G-E-195
  Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 185 
vague intellectual processes, feelings of belief as opposed to 
rational demonstrations, the activities of mind in religious 
matters—in fact, it has been used as a catch-all to 
hold all the as yet unanalysed mental processes. In 
this sense feeling is everything that has not been given 
a definite place in our knowledge of mental states. 
It is the original mass from which cognition develops 
by a process of attentive analysis. In this sense, then, 
anything that can be clearly attended to for itself 
ceases at once to be feeling, and becomes perception, or 
some other cognitive process. The narrow and probably 
more usual current use of the word is as the equivalent of 
pleasantness-unpleasantness, as a definite process on the 
same general level of explicitness as sensation. This would 
designate the tone that accompanies the sensation, agreeable 
or disagreeable, as feeling and would leave over the vague 
processes for some other term. We should have to dis- 
tinguish between two fairly definite conscious processes, the 
one designated as sensation, the other as feeling. The best 
instance of the distinction in a single process is between 
pain as sensation and the unpleasantness that accompanies 
it at any moment. As sensation, pain corresponds to the 
direct excitation of a nerve-ending in the skin which always 
gives rise to that one sense quality. Ordinarily the sensa- 
tion is unpleasant as well but occasionally a slight excita- 
tion of the pain nerves in the tingle from cold air or the 
cutting of salt spray is pleasant. The feeling then is the 
tone that accompanies the sensation, whether of agreeable- 
ness or disagreeableness, and this is regarded for purposes 
of description as a relatively independent mental process. 
The third current use of feeling, in a measure a compromise 
between the wide and the narrow uses, is represented in 
the theories of Wundt and Royce. Wundt distinguishes 
two more opposed pairs of feeling, strain and relaxation, 
excitation and depression. Royce has added another, 
excitation and quiescence. Wundt verges still nearer the 
general use in the statement that feelings have different
-P-A-G-E-196
186 Attention 
qualities for each sensation with which they are as- 
sociated. 
With so wide a divergence in the use of the term, it is 
evident that we must discuss our problem of the relation 
of feeling to attention with each use separately. If we hold 
to the first use of the term, that feeling designates the as yet 
unanalysed, it is evident that attention, the fundamentally 
analytic mental function, must ever work destructively 
upon feeling. Whatever we analyse ceases ipso facto to be 
feeling, and in a measure, everything that can be attended 
to for itself is analysed, set apart as definite content, and 
becomes a cognitive process rather than feeling. For the 
narrow second use, very much the same relation is ordinarily 
asserted to hold. As we attend, objects tend to lose their plea- 
santness or unpleasantness and become entirely indifferent. 
Attention, far from increasing the clearness or intensity of 
feeling, causes it to become vague and indefinite, without 
affective colouring. So if we ask ourselves when dis- 
pleased exactly in what the displeasure consists, it will be 
found, it is usually asserted, that the displeasure disappears. 
Similarly with pleasure, if we concern ourselves too much 
with the query: are we really enjoying ourselves at a par- 
ticular task or game, we find that the answer is nearly always 
negative, while enjoyment continues as long as we play the 
game for its own sake without reference to the outcome of 
pleasure or pain. This fact, if we accept it, would make a 
conscious hedonism self-destructive. If we live a life for 
the pleasure there is in it, the pleasure is never found. If, 
however, we work for particular ends without reference to 
their pleasureableness, we find that the striving in itself 
brings pleasure. The statement rests primarily upon in- 
trospection, and seems to be undisputed by those who have 
considered the subject. Meumann and Zoneff investigated 
the problem by means of what is known technically as the 
method of expression. Just as we saw that attention has 
widespread effects upon the vital process, so it has been 
known for some years that feeling and emotion are accom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
    Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 187 
panied by many changes in the vital processes. We need 
not consider for themselves in detail the somewhat ambigu- 
ous results that have been obtained in this field. Suffice it 
to say that Meumann and Zoneff assumed that if one can 
determine the presence of feeling by means of the organic 
changes, one should also be able to decide whether the 
amount of feeling is changed by directing attention to it, 
and how. One would first take records when the individual 
was attending to the stimulus or was passive, and compare 
these with similar records when attention was directed to 
the feeling itself. The results of the experiments conducted 
were largely negative. In ordinary attention to the feeling, 
pulse and breathing were not different from those taken 
during attention to the stimulus. When an attempt was 
made to introspect the feeling, probably merely a heightened 
attention to the feeling, the organic reaction seemed to be 
lessened slightly. The results in themselves would not be 
sufficient to warrant the truth of the statement that atten- 
tion to feeling destroyed it, but they tend in that direction. 
It is growing more probable too that the organic reactions 
depend as much upon the character of the stimulus as 
they do upon the feeling, and if that be true, we would 
expect attention to have little if any effect. Even if 
attending to the feeling destroyed the feeling, the organic 
reaction would run its course unchanged. As matters 
stand, the introspective evidence is universally favourable 
to the assertion that attention is antagonistic to the pleasant- 
ness-unpleasantness process as well as to the vague un- 
analysed processes of consciousness. 
The third group of theories is not related to attention 
in quite the same unambiguous way. Of Wundt’s three 
pairs, strain and relaxation would not be opposed to 
attending. Most attention involves strain, but attention 
either to strain or relaxation does not necessarily diminish 
them or change their character. Of depression and exalta- 
tion it is difficult to speak, but it is by no means certain that 
attention to these processes would either oppose or favour
-P-A-G-E-198
188 Attention 
their presence. The same holds also of Royce’s second 
pair, quiescence-excitation. Attention need not either 
destroy or increase one or the other. Attention then cannot 
be said to act in any definite way upon any of the three 
new pairs of feelings. However, it must be confessed that 
the addition of these new definite qualities to feeling has not 
met with universal acceptance, and it seems probable from 
the different way in which they respond to attention, 
and from other considerations, that they are not processes 
of the same general character as pleasure and pain, but 
come more nearly under the head of sensation or of 
emotion than of feeling in this restricted sense. 
For the purpose of our discussion then we shall restrict 
feeling to the narrow use as the equivalent of the pleasant- 
ness-unpleasantness qualities, although several of the 
conclusions that we shall reach in this use will hold as well 
for certain of the other so-called feelings ordinarily grouped 
in the vague general use. Attention has not only this 
general destructive effect upon feeling, but also when 
directed to the sensation or stimulus it changes the quality 
or character of the feeling processes. Whether we shall be 
pleased or pained by any object depends entirely upon how 
we look upon it. It is now pleasant, now unpleasant, 
according to the setting in which it is placed and our attitude 
at the moment. What to the poor are real hardships are to 
the youth on a hunting trip a source of pleasure. A remark 
which from a friend gives keen pleasure as an exhibition of 
wit, will, when spoken by a rival or a man who irritates us, 
cause keen displeasure. The common saying that there is a 
bright side to every situation is but the embodiment of the 
fact that pleasure or displeasure waits upon attention in 
nearly every situation of daily life. Attention then exerts 
the opposite effect upon feeling from that exerted upon 
sensation. That means, of course, when attention is directed 
to the feeling process itself and alone. When directed 
upon sensation or stimulus, feeling is increased in intensity, 
and also the nature of the feeling, whether pleasant or un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 189 
pleasant or indifferent, depends upon the way in which we 
attend to the sensation or external stimulus by which the 
sensation is originated. Inversely, apparently, states of 
pleasure and pain, when intense, seem to render attention 
difficult. When greatly pleased or greatly pained there 
seems to be no attention. It is a question, however, whether 
there is any decided influence until we reach the stage of 
emotion. Certainly when pleased or pained we can attend 
vigorously to the stimulus that excites the feeling, although 
perhaps, even in the stronger stage of pleasure and pain 
the rules for attending to all else are no longer effective. That 
we do not attend primarily either to the pleasant or to the 
unpleasant has already been seen in connection with interest, 
and will be found to be true when we consider the theories 
of attention. 
If, then, these be the facts as to the relationship between 
attention and feeling, it is evident that there must be some 
deeper-lying connection that should appear in the theoretical 
discussions. We find, in fact, that several of the most impor- 
tant theories of feeling would relate it to a general activity 
that in some degree or other overlaps what is called attention. 
So Herbart made feeling the accompaniment of hindered 
or furthered progress in apperception. When an idea is 
furthered in its entrance into consciousness, we are pleased ; 
when its entrance is opposed, when there is mutual 
opposition between the elements of consciousness, we have 
pain or unpleasantness. In modern form we find this same 
general attitude in Stout and in Dewey and his school, in 
the statement that anything that furthers the course of 
mental or physical activity at the moment is pleasant, 
whatever checks that activity is unpleasant or painful. 
Each of these theories goes back to what may broadly be 
called apperception, and each we shall see to be in part 
dependent upon a process that is similar to attention, 
and is often synonymous with it. More directly connected 
with the attention doctrine is the theory of Wundt, that 
feeling is the subjective side of the apperception process, 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
190 Attention 
the way in which the process of apperception comes to 
consciousness. On this theory feeling arises as a by- 
product of the acceptance of the newly entering sensation 
by the mass of earlier experience. When the earlier ex- 
periences react upon the immediate environment, the total 
process of reaction gives rise to a feeling. Much evidence 
can be adduced to support some such general theory. Many 
of our esthetic and less fundamental feelings seem to grow 
directly from earlier experience. Things pleasant to in- 
dividuals of one training will not please, or will even be dis- 
tasteful to others of a different education. Much of pleasure 
comes not directly, but indirectly, through association and 
the character of earlier experiences of all kinds. 
There are three characteristic differences between sensa- 
tion and feeling that seem to indicate that feeling depends 
upon the reception of the sensation into consciousness, upon 
the way it is brought in, rather than upon anything in the 
stimulus itself. The first of these is that feelings cannot 
be remembered for themselves immediately and directly. 
What happens apparently is that we recall the situation, 
and then are affected by the situation anew, according to 
the way we react now. Consequently we find that an idea 
when recalled has frequently undergone a change since its 
original entrance. Many things that pleased us in the doing 
cause chagrin in recall, and many social faux pas of our 
youth that caused intense discomfort at the moment are 
remembered now with keen pleasure. Our appreciation of 
the event changes with our experience and knowledge, and 
pleasure or unpleasantness corresponds to the nature of 
that reaction. That the reaction then is different in idea 
makes a change in feeling tone as compared with the 
original appreciation. It is the way we attend, and our 
possibilities of attention, that determine the character of 
the feeling. Similar inference may be drawn from the fact 
emphasised by Kiilpe and others that feelings excited by 
remembered or imagined events are equally strong or at 
times stronger than the original event. Very frequently
-P-A-G-E-201
  Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 191 
we find that things indifferent in original experience are 
pleasant or unpleasant in recall, and it is a proverb that 
many events are more pleasant in anticipation than in 
realisation. This fact, again, harmonises well with the 
theory that feeling is a by-product of attending, for certainly 
one attends just as strongly and in the same way to the 
faint ideas as to the strong perceptions. If feeling corres- 
ponds to the reaction upon the entering experience, we should 
expect what we find that feelings connected with memory 
and imagination would be just as intense as those connected 
with sensation and perception. Again, the fact discussed 
above, that attention to a feeling nullifies it, would harmonise 
with the theory. For, if feeling is dependent upon the 
response to a stimulus, then attending to the feeling would 
put an end to the response to the stimulus, and with 
that the occasion for the feeling would at once cease. 
There would no longer be attention of the kind that 
gives rise to feeling. In addition to these more definite 
facts, the pervasiveness of feeling, the fact that it has 
no particular sense organ, and its completely subjective 
character, all are in harmony with the theory that feeling 
is the conscious process which accompanies and corres- 
ponds to attending. While this theory of Wundt and 
Kiilpe harmonises very well with the facts, and would 
explain feeling in general, there is nothing in it to differen- 
tiate pleasure and pain. For this we have one of two 
alternatives—to go to one of the forms of the furtherance- 
hinderance theory already. mentioned—or to turn to some 
form of an evolutionary theory. The former is more 
satisfactory for the complicated active pursuits of life, the 
latter best explains the simple sense pleasure and dis- 
pleasure. The evolutionary theory would make pain and 
pleasure the accompaniment of sense processes that have 
in any way been adapted to improve or benefit the race in the 
course of its development. Whether the theory be applied 
historically or immediately, whether it be evolutionary or 
physiological, makes little difference. In the one case, what-
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 Attention 
ever on the whole has benefited, the race will be pleasant ; 
in the other, anything that now is an incentive to an enhanced 
activity of the organism or benefits it in any way will prove 
pleasant. The former view suffers fewer exceptions than 
the latter, for the saving clause, ‘‘in the long run,” can 
be applied to remove almost all apparent exceptions. If 
this view be coupled with the theory of Wundt, that feeling 
corresponds to the reaction of experience as a whole upon 
the presented stimulus, which explains the occurrence of 
the feeling, while the character of the feeling will find its 
explanation in the evolutionary benefit and injury, we 
have a theory that would cover most cases. 
Even on the evolutionary theory, however, feeling would 
not be an active, causal mental process, but rather an 
accompaniment of other forms of activity. What is essen- 
tial for the organism and makes for its survival is the nature 
of the reaction by which it responds to the stimulus, not the 
feeling process that accompanies the excitation. It is prob- 
able from observations on man that feeling is a mere 
passive accompaniment of sensori-motor action rather than 
an essential active element that intervenes between sensa- 
tion and response. It is in the more fundamental racial 
theory a conscious accompaniment of the response to 
stimulus that makes for the survival of the organism, 
pleasant if the stimulus be beneficial and the movement one of 
approach, unpleasant if the stimulus is dangerous in the light 
of the earlier history of the race and the response is one of 
withdrawal. In the theory that makes feeling in part the 
outgrowth of individual experience, it is again the accom- 
paniment of a reaction, but in this case of the interaction 
between older experiences and a newly entering experience. 
It is now an incident in the action of the forces that serve 
to select one element rather than another for entrance to 
consciousness. And these two theories are not altogether 
different, since we have seen that racial factors act with those 
of individual origin in controlling the entrance of sensations, 
the course of ideas, and the resulting actions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 193 
While it would be rash to pretend that any of the 
theories of feeling here considered are final, yet whichever 
one we accept, we find that the fundamental process has 
greater or less resemblance to the phenomena that we have 
seen earlier to be connected with attention. The roots 
of the theories of feeling are everywhere intertwined with 
the roots of the theories of attention. The relation of 
attention to the more complicated affective processes, the 
emotions and passions, is equally close and of much the 
same character. Emotions are theoretically either in- 
stinctive responses that break the bonds of voluntary 
control, or complex feeling processes mingled with instinctive 
reactions. In either case we find that they are riotings of 
processes ordinarily under the control of attention or 
related activities, and consequently the relation between 
them is one of mutual opposition. When emotions are 
at their maximum, earlier experience is not at work 
in the control of thought and action, but some stimulus, 
owing to its instinctive appeal, has become dominant in 
unusual degree. When all of the conditions of attention 
are active in normal strength, emotion is suppressed. The 
instinctive responses are subordinated to the voluntary 
control, and, as we have seen, feeling is lacking. On the 
other hand, during moments of strong emotion attention is 
ordinarily weakened. At least one is capable in very slight 
degree of attending to anything but the occasion of the 
emotion, although probably anything at all connected with 
the emotion itself is observed with more than usual clear- 
ness. Attention cannot be said to be weakened in general, 
but is warped and rendered one-sided. One might even say 
that attention fer se is not necessarily diminished in strength, 
but that there is a characteristic change in the conditions 
that predominate in the two cases. In the emotional 
seizure, attention comes under the sway of instinctive con- 
ditions. Social and general educational forces lose their 
effect, and always, too, the particular set of instinctive con- 
ditions are those that are grouped around the storm centre. 
oO
-P-A-G-E-204
  194 Attention 
As to the theoretical causal relation between emotion 
and attention, there is nothing new to add to what was said 
of feeling. If feeling be an important constituent part of 
emotion, what holds true of feeling will hold in lesser degree 
of emotion. If we accept some more active theory of emo- 
tion, and regard it as the awareness of instinctive responses, 
attention would play at most a permissive part. Probably, 
even here, however, the appreciation of the occurrence is not 
unimportant to the character of the emotion. If we attend 
in the right way, any event can be classified among the 
mechanical non-personal resultants of some world action, 
and emotion is at best a waste of energy. If we attend in 
another way, the most impersonal mechanical happening 
may take on a personal character and become occasion for 
violent emotion. Seldom do we find purely instinctive 
response uncoloured and unaffected by the acquired con- 
ditions of attending. 
We may say in general summary of the relation of attention 
to the sentiments, that they are mutually opposed. To 
quote Kiilpe, attention is the organ of quiet contempla- 
tion and is the enemy of sentiment in all of its forms, while 
sentiment again, or the conditions that give rise to sentiment, 
are not conducive to sustained or unprejudiced attention. 
When we look more deeply, however, we find that the 
superficial opposition gives way to fundamental unity. 
Attention determines at once how we shall feel, if not 
whether we shall feel, and we find some reason to assume 
that feeling is but the by-play in consciousness of the forces 
that stand behind and determine attending. 
: SUMMARY 
1. The relation between attention and feeling, or emotion, 
is one of fundamental opposition. Attention is not so 
effective when feeling or emotion is strong, and attention to 
a feeling destroys or weakens it. 
2. Feelings seem very definitely dependent upon atten-
-P-A-G-E-205
Attention and Feeling, or Emotion 195 
tion to sensation. The nature of the feeling differs with 
the conditions of attending, and the attitude toward the 
sensation. 
3. Theories of feeling all go back to attention in some 
form or other. Feeling is said to be due to the reaction of 
earlier ideas on the entering idea; to furtherance or check- 
ing of the course of mental activity; or is asserted to be the 
way in which attention becomes conscious: in either case 
the dependence upon attention is evident.

CHAPTER XIII 
ATTENTION AND THE SELF 
NE last general relation remains to be considered, 
the relation between attention and the self. Popu- 
larly the connection between the two is supposed to be very 
close. We talk on the one hand of forcing ourselves to 
attend, and we also talk of attending to the self. One makes 
attention depend upon the self, the other makes knowledge 
of the self, at least, depend upon attention. Many of the 
implications of the relation have been discussed in earlier 
chapters, particularly those that have treated will and 
reason and the relation of effort to attention. It seems 
desirable, however, to bring together in a single chapter the 
results that follow from our general point of view, and state 
them with particular reference to the historical problems 
that cluster about the self. 
It must be evident from the preceding discussions that 
there is no possibility of retaining the older conception of 
the self as something apart from or independent of the 
mental stream. The present status of the problem, as 
very generally agreed upon, is that on the one hand 
nothing resembling the self of the older rational psychology 
can be discovered by examination of the mental stream, 
but it is equally generally agreed that there must be some- 
thing to explain unity and persistent identity, and the fact 
that mental states are known ; and that this cannot be found 
in the mental states themselves as discrete elements. We 
may begin our discussion with the assumption of these two 
facts. 
196
-P-A-G-E-207
  
Attention and the Self 197 
It shall then be our task in this first part to subject the 
doctrines of the self to a rigid scrutiny in two ways. First, 
to examine the axioms or felt needs upon which the con- 
struction is based, secondly to decide how far the solution 
ordinarily attained really satisfies the demands. Of 
the reasons that have been given for assuming a distinct 
mind, three are most prominent: (1) For the known there 
must bea knower. (2) The mental states can receive unity 
only from a unitary substance, and that is not to be found in 
mental states. (3) In a series of discrete mental states such 
as Hume assumed to constitute mind there can be no con- 
tinuity, no real identity. Of the first we may ask, Is it a 
real axiom ; of all, Are they satisfied by a self of the detached 
character? The axiom that everything to be known 
must have a knower may be, and has been, questioned as to 
its validity. True, in a common sense dualistic way we know 
nothing of the objects about without being ourselves present. 
Our bodily presence is essential to knowledge. This, as 
Professor Fullerton has pointed out, is the only conceivable 
way in which an axiom of the kind could originate, the only 
other possible application of the axiom in question. One 
may ask, however, whether the relation holds of anything 
more than the physical, spatial relations of body and object. 
There is no evidence that the same relation would hold within 
consciousness. It does not follow that because you must be 
present to have an idea of a tree or other external object, 
there must be something else present in consciousness to 
know that image. The two are on an entirely different 
level. Moreover, if the analogy hold, any other than a naive 
dualism would probably be stopped from accepting the 
axiom even with application restricted to the relation 
between an external world and the knowing mind. If the 
origin of the axiom of the knower be this relation of body 
to object, or of mental stream to object outside, it is very 
interesting to note that it has persisted after the interpreta- 
tion that gave rise to it has been abandoned. Now that we 
find not infrequently that no distinction is made between
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 Attention 
the existence of an external object and its being known, no 
distinction between its existence in the mental stream and 
its real existence, we should expect that the self-evidence of 
the axiom might at least be weakened. On the contrary, 
some of the writers who feel most keenly the advantages of 
obliterating the old distinction between knower and known 
in the more objective relation seem most loath to give up the 
axiom derived from that in its application to what we might 
call the inner hypostatisation; they still argue for a knower 
to know the content of consciousness although they believe 
there is no necessity for a known and a knower relation be- 
tween outside object and mental stream. Moreover, if we 
are to accept this viewin its entirety, it would be immediately 
destructive of knowledge of self. We must either have an 
infinite regressus of knowers for each of the lower series, 
or we must assume that somewhere there is an element 
that is at once knower and known. If the knower and 
known can thus be united in one member of the series, 
there is no reason why we should not assume that they are 
united at once in the first stage of the process. If there is no 
need of the tenth or millionth member in the regressive 
series, there is no need of the second. Even granted the 
existence of a knower, it is by no means easy to see how 
it can know the mental states. It must either take the 
mental states over into itself as mirror pictures, and then the 
problem comes as to how the knowing goes on ; or it must 
leave them unchanged, that is to say unknown. The re- 
presentatives of mental states are in no different relation 
to the self when thus absorbed than the elements to the 
stream itself, and these are not known according to our 
original axiom. Even the infinite regressus discussed 
above takes us no nearer the problem ; it merely postpones 
its consideration indefinitely. At no stage is there any ex- 
planation that could not be applied also and equally to 
make one distinct idea in the stream know the others. 
The argument from the demand for unity in the conscious 
series seems to lose much force if we ask how unity is given by
-P-A-G-E-209
  Attention and the Self 199 
the self. It is all very well to say that mental states are unified 
in some way, that they are not mere discrete elements in 
the series of experience, but it is not so clear that unity of 
any kind could be given by a unitary something placed 
beside or above the stream. If they are to be unified they 
must be taken up in some way into the unitary subject. 
Mere propinquity with a unitary something cannot conceiv- 
ably give unity, and of the unifying somewhat we have the 
same problems and the same difficulties that face us in 
solving our difficulty where first the problem arose. 
Almost the same remarks apply to the argument that would 
have the self give continuity to the discrete stream, that 
would make it the basis of identity amid change. Neither 
continuity nor identity as an effective phase would be in any 
way explained by the presence in or above consciousness of a 
unitary substance. That might be present, and the other 
elements be discrete. Unless the elements of content work 
in some way upon the self, and it in some way upon them, 
there is no identity for them in any real sense. There is no 
conceivable way in which identity can be given them by any 
added something unless they become part of it or it part of 
them. In either case it loses its absolute identity as well as 
its unity. 
If we regard the states again as receiving identity from 
being taken into the unitary substance, then apparently 
the principle of persistency must again come from some 
relation between the elements themselves or between the 
permanent existing substance and its contents. Mind, then, 
becomes itself changing, and it is just as difficult to conceive 
how changing interacting elements could take on the con- 
sciousness of identity with themselvesinspite of change inside 
of or besidean unchanging somewhat ever identical with itself 
as it is to see how a series might always be identical with itself 
through mere continuity of the elements. If we summarise 
the three advantages that are asserted of the presence of the 
self above or beside content, we find that, examined closely, 
the advantages disappear. They are verbal rather than
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 Attention 
actual. One can no more conceive a knower knowing the 
elements of knowledge than the mental states knowing them- 
selves, and besides, some element must know itself unless 
we are to have an infinite regressus or an unknown term. 
The unity of mental states is no more conceivable with 
an absolute unitary substance in or beside the states than 
would be the unity of the states themselves, uncontained 
or unaccompanied. And the persistence of the substance 
always identical with itself does not immediately account 
for the fact that all experiences seem to belong together, to 
be all my experiences. When we have the immediate con- 
tent all carefully taken up into the self as ordinarily pictured, 
we have all our problems over again in their original guise. 
The assumption that there is some advantage in the unitary 
is an analogy, a picture, and the details of the picture are 
not worked out sufficiently to be helpful. If one is com- 
pelled to have recourse to an act of faith, one may as well 
solve all our difficulties at once, and assert that the mental 
stream knows itself, is of itself unitary, and always identical 
with itself. Solution is no easier than it was when we first 
approached the problem on the known empirical level. The 
solution ordinarily offered tends to hide difficulties, not to 
solve them. 
If we are driven to the conclusion that there is nothing in 
the theory that would satisfy our logical need by putting 
a self of any character in or above the concrete mental 
elements, we have cleared the way for an attempt to find 
characteristics in the mental vontent that give rise to the 
demand and serve to make cunceivable the processes. As 
I conceive it, the whole probiem of the self and its relations 
arises from the fact that structure and function do not 
correspond, that there are certain characteristics of the action 
and general accomplishments of mind that cannot, by any 
analogy, be ascribed to the structures that have been as- 
sumed to exist in mind. The broad general accomplish- 
ments of mind do not harmonise with the asserted capacities 
of the structures upon which most stress has been laid in
-P-A-G-E-211
  Attention and the Self 201 
the more usual descriptions. We may for a time keep 
structure and function divorced, and assert functions for 
which no structure is assignable, but this at best is a 
temporary expedient. Before our problem is complete, 
structure and function must be brought together and made 
parts of a single whole. The hypothesis already considered 
attempts to set up a conjectural structure that should take 
over the functions not assignable on analogy to the elements 
directly and scientifically analysed out. This we have seen 
to be unsatisfactory, and probably such construction always 
will prove unsatisfactory, because there is no possibility 
of testing its truth. In fact, it is made ex hypothest 
incapable of accurate observation. The result is that a 
premium is set upon poetic vague imaginings rather than 
upon careful observation or even logical self-consistent 
reasoning from the premises accepted. While then the first 
falls short in the attempt to develop a structure that shall 
be adequate to the function assigned, the structures ordin- 
arily analysed out for structural psychology also will not 
explain the function that we find mind capable of when 
viewed in the large. The classic attempt of Hume to 
explain experience by discrete ideas is the man of straw for 
all-comers, and deservedly has been much buffeted about. 
If one holds to any similar view, the only consistent course 
is to deny the logical need of a self and to assert that we shall 
keep to the empirical level, with no attempt to go beyond to 
satisfy logical needs or to explain mental functions. This 
we already have seen is by gé eral consent unsatisfactory. 
It would be a sad commentary upon modern investigation 
were there no results since Hume that throw light upon the 
problem from the concrete factual side. It behooves us, then, 
constructively to turn to the known nature of mental pro- 
cesses to see what there is that will illuminate the deeper 
connections of mental states. 
In beginning the investigation, let us accept two general 
principles. First, that one may expect to find no direct 
evidence of self, but that the need for unity and identity of  
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 Attention 
mental states is a real need, and that the problem of 
how mental states are known is areal problem. These needs 
must be satisfied, if possible, even if we have recourse to 
construction on the basis of fact. Keeping these guiding 
principles before us, let us turn to an examination of the 
results of modern psychology. If we ask what there is 
that gives first permanence and then unity, we may find a 
clue in the fact that an experience once present does not 
vanish as is assumed; but there is some evidence that it 
persists as a dynamic force in consciousness from the 
moment of its first entrance to the end of life. That an 
experience may have an effect when there is no possibility of 
definite recall seems one of the striking results of many 
of the memory experiments treated above. So Ebbinghaus 
and many others have found, you remember, that many 
associations years old, of which there was no trace in the 
ordinary sense of spontaneous reinstatement, could never- 
theless be brought back to consciousness with surprisingly 
few repetitions. In fact, there are some respects in which 
these older, long-deposited connections and experiences are 
more effective than those more recently acquired. One 
need not assume with the older men that an experience is 
never lost, but we can assert on definite evidence that there 
are secondary after effects of mental processes long after 
possibility of return as a specific process has ceased, and 
we have found reason to assume that consciousness is 
always in some degree different because of any experience, 
no matter how remotein time that experience may have been. 
Not only, however, is it possible to prove that these old 
impressions exist, by the fact that they can be reinstated 
with greater or less difficulty, but it is also probable, as I 
have attempted ,to show in more detail in earlier chapters, 
that they are active in some degree in the control of later 
mental operations of widely different character. Similarly, 
we have found reason to believe that all the operations of 
mind are an expression of these earlier experiences. Atten- 
tion, association, memory ‘in all forms, action, reason, feel-
-P-A-G-E-213
  
Attention and the Self 203 
ing,—all go back for their explanation to these accumulated 
experiences. 
In every mental act, then, we may find an illustration of 
the fact that experiences do not vanish entirely, and more- 
over that they always seem in some degree to exert an in- 
fluence upon other and later mental states. These effects 
taken together seem sufficient to give two of the necessary 
presuppositions of experience, unity and identity. We 
have unity in mind, because all experiences, past and present, 
interact in the control and constitution of every apparently 
discrete act. Not merely, as Professor James insists in his 
chapter, do two or three succeeding states unite in a single 
one, but in some degree or other all experiences, no 
matter how far separated, in time combine into a single 
element in each moment’s experience. The unity grows 
with each added element, is enriched by each new phase 
of multiplicity. It is, moreover, dynamic, not static, since 
it not merely takes up into itself each added element, but 
directs and controls what shall enter at any moment, and 
the response that shall be made to it. There is continuity 
too, not the continuity of a passive, unchanging onlooker, 
but of the active, all-absorbing kind. The first elements 
are retained for ever, and are constantly growing with each 
later experience. Not one element identical among many 
changing. elements, but we may say with the Eleatics that 
the apparent differences are but phases of the one identical 
whole. The change is in part real, but in greater part it is 
merely a new expression of elements that have been present 
from the beginning. It is an identity from which nothing 
is ever lost, and persists with, if not through, growth. This 
unity and identity is not only constructive, but actual. 
The persistence and mutual interaction of experiences seem 
to carry with them a recognition of self-unity and self-con- 
tinuity. For this we have best evidence in the much 
quoted instances of alternating selves. If we may be per- 
mitted in advance of the author to interpret the case of 
Miss Beauchamp, it is found to be in perfect harmony with 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 Attention 
our assumption that where earlier experiences are joined 
in a single unitary process, there is a unitary self. If we 
examine each of the dissociated selves, we find for each 
different experiences, different accomplishments, different 
organizations of older associations. One remembers within 
but one single group of experiences. This means primarily 
that associations are found or retained between certain 
elements of experience, not all. There is dissociation, 
which prevents recall from one system to another, but still 
permits recall within any given system. The dissociation 
is not complete for early acquisitions—language, the names 
of familiar objects. All the associations that pathology 
in general assures us are more fundamental persist from 
one to the other. But for our argument what is most im- 
portant is that the entire character of the self changes with 
the change in the effective group of experiences. The habits 
of mind, interests, desires, actions, all are distinct from 
one group of experiences to another. So Br, Biv, and Sally 
are bundles of different forms of knowledge, and have a 
character in harmony with that knowledge. Br keeps the 
refinements of the family in tastes of all kinds and in know- 
ledge. She has keen knowledge and appreciation of people 
and their opinions. As a consequence, we may assume, she 
has bookish cultivated interests, is too keenly alive to the 
opinion of those about her, and responds in reasoning and 
in action correspondingly. Biv seems to have taken over 
fewer of the refinements of the total self; her knowledge is of 
the more practical kind, and her appreciation of social de- 
mands and the rights of others is slight. With these different 
memories goes a character of thought and action entirely 
distinct. There is a selfishness and stubbornness at once 
indicative of strong instincts, and of slight guidance by ac- 
cumulated social comprehension and knowledge. Her 
interests and knowledge are at one with the memories that 
predominate. Sally again is all primordial instinct, with very 
little control by accumulated knowledge. She seems to 
have kept none of the later and more complicated attain- 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  Attention and the Self 205 
ments of the original self; her life is the life of a child, 
application of any kind is difficult, for there is no developed 
knowledge to restrain or control the impulse of the moment. 
Of these three persisting and recurring characters, she is 
least developed, least worth keeping alive as a member 
of society. 
This is what one would expect on the basis of the hypo- 
thesis that the mental experiences, recent and remote, 
control later actions and serve to unify them with them- 
selves, and with the earlier experiences. Where all parts 
of early experience act on each new element, there is unity 
in the self and constant self identity. Where the earlier 
experiences are divided into separate systems, the self lacks 
unity, there is no longer identity from moment to moment, 
but unity and identity only within the one partial system. 
One system seems to itself and to the observer an entirely 
distinct self from the other. The nature of the control 
each exerts in every form of mental act is different from 
that exerted by any other, and Harmonises with the nature 
of the experiences that group to constitute it. There is 
a break from system to system, not only in memories, but 
in the self feeling, and in the self as an active, directive 
agent. 
Nor do we need to look to these pathological cases, 
telatively rare, for our only evidence. In every individual 
some degree of dissociation is present with its corresponding 
different self or phase of self. In one’s own home acts and 
feelings may be different in many respects from those in 
the home of an acquaintance. As one thinks or speaks 
in a professional capacity one’s self is different from the 
self as one thinks and feels in a social capacity. If we 
look to the cause, we find different experiences clustered 
about the core of the state, and controlling the course of 
the action. Hypnotism, hysteria, and all forms of dissocia- 
tion will furnish other evidence of the same general principle. 
Few physicians can be trusted to keep their impersonal 
scientific attitude when treating members of their own 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
    206 Attention 
family, and I imagine few psychologists carry their theories 
of thought and action to the extent of interpreting the play 
processes of their lighter moods. When the dissociation 
disappears, the control is again in terms of the total ex- 
perience, and the whole self reasserts itself. With re- 
appearance of continuous memory, there again comes control 
by all factors that can be recalled. Control is apparently 
always exercised by all those processes that are sufficiently 
connected to render associative recall from one to the 
other possible. Nevertheless, always, whether in partial 
separation of the selves in the normal individual, in the 
more profound dissociation of hypnosis, or of alternating 
personality, there is some greater or smaller mass of con- 
trolling experiences that is common. A man’s business 
and his friendly attitudes towards life and morality may 
be different, but there are always some limits that he will 
not pass, there are always some parts of his experience that 
are common, and these constitute what we may call his real 
self. In hypnotism, too, the most fundamental experiences 
still guide, and the somnambulist is not altogether unmoral 
or immoral. In smaller degree the same remark applies to 
the dissociated or alternating personalities. 
x Even the subconscious or unconscious selves, as they have 
been traced in much completeness by Professor Jastrow, 
are not distinct from this dominating unity. They are but 
new groupings of the same elements that for a brief time may 
hold independent sway, and during that time new, or at 
least long-forgotten experiences may co-operate in the 
control of thought and action, but also and more noticeably 
the elements or systems usually dominant are not for the 
moment in control. 
Much has been made in recent discussions of these un- 
conscious or subconscious mental states, and even of sub- 
conscious selves. There seems little reason to assume, 
however, that the phrases are much more than figures of 
speech which cannot be taken with full literalness. As has 
often been pointed out, an unconscious mental state is a
-P-A-G-E-217
  Attention and the Self 207 
contradiction in terms, and even more truly is an uncon- 
scious self a self-contradiction. To be conscious and to be 
mental are identical. We may use unconscious in one of 
two senses. It may mean states that are physiological, 
but not accompanied by consciousness. In this sense there 
are probably unconscious physiological links in most trains 
of association. We may also designate by the term 
nervous processes that reveal themselves in the modifica- 
tions that they’produce in consciousness although they 
themselves are not conscious at the moment. In the latter 
sense we may speak of the nervous processes as experiences 
not now conscious, and by this we mean to deny that there 
is any conscidusness that can attach to them now, although 
they are resultants of earlier conscious processes, and them- 
selves work changes in the consciousness of the moment. 
We are not aware as we select a tool of our profession from 
an indiscriminate mass that it is our early training that 
impels to the choice, we are conscious of the object alone. 
In this use all attention may be said to be the outcome of 
the unconscious. But the unconscious in this sense is not a 
separate personality, it exists only in and for the conscious. 
In that sense too it may be said to be part of the conscious 
self, for the conscious self could not be what it is without it. 
It is just the presence of these unconscious processes that 
makes the conscious personality what it is. 
As ordinarily used, however, subconsciousness or the 
unconscious designates the better organised, and apparently 
more independent groups of experiences. So in hysteria 
there is frequently found, in fact Freud asserts there are 
always found, systematised but unconscious experiences 
that exert an important influence upon consciousness, are 
in fact responsible for the course of thedisease.! This system 
of ideas goes back ordinarily to some emotionally toned event 
in the life of the individual, and is sufficiently strong to 
dominate all actions that are in any way related to it, but 
is usually not conscious in itself. In Janet’s phrase it 
seems to be detached from the personality. It is not com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 Attention 
pletely controlled by other elements in experience, and 
the actions it induces are not rationally appreciated. 
Nevertheless, the course of conscious thought and action is 
governed by it, and until the individual is freed from the 
obsession his actions are not normal. 
Some authors, like Freud and the late F. W. H. Myers, 
would go farther and assert that every individual, no matter 
how normal, has a similar subconsciousness that plays a 
large part in the control of his everyday thought and action. 
Freud would have us believe that these subconscious pro- 
cesses are dominant in dreams," and that they are then known 
for themselves, or more truly that we recall distorted 
fragments of the real dream on waking. In addition he 
would assert that many of the flashes of brilliancy that we 
exhibit in ordinary conversation originate in the subcon- 
scious. The subconscious is responsible for our witty re- 
marks, writes our poetry for us, in fact deserves the credit 
for most of our commendable performances. This, of 
course, suggests Mr. Myers’s conclusion, reached on other 
grounds, that the subconscious is the source of most works 
of true genius. We would be assumed, on a theory of the 
kind, to have two selves on different levels. The conscious 
self is duplicated bya subconscious, organised as is the normal 
consciousness, and presumably self-conscious. 
It seems to the writer that theories of this type have 
developed on the assumption that the operations of mind 
are much more open to observation than they are in fact. 
Even in our most fully conscious moments we are aware of 
but a fraction of the causes that are at work in ruling our 
mental procedure. We have very slight prevision of the 
states that are to succeed those present in mind at any 
moment, and none whatever from direct observation of the 
causes that are at work in determining what elements 
shall succeed, and how the choice shall be brought about. 
In this respect a flash of intuition, or some act of genius, is 
on the same plane as the most ordinary decision or flight 
of fancy. This, of course, follows immediately from the
-P-A-G-E-219
  Attention and the Self 209 
discussions that have preceded. We are conscious of but a 
point in the mass of interacting experiences or remnants of 
earlier experiences. The great bulk of the whole group 
of forces is revealed only in the fleeting fractional pro- 
cess that is conscious at the moment. But the roots of 
that element lie deep below the surface, and without the 
hidden sources the consciousness of the moment would 
not be what we see it to be. If one were to regard all else 
than the spot of light, the centre of the attentive conscious- 
ness, as subconscious, that must constitute the surpassingly 
greater mass as well as the more important part of the whole. 
These other parts of the ordinary mental act are, however, 
not detachable from the central part of consciousness, nor 
do they reveal themselves in any other way than in the 
effect that they exert upon consciousness. They cannot 
exist apart from consciousness, and consciousness could not 
exist as it does apart from them. 
In exactly the same way whenever any of the detached 
elements organise and become dominant, they are self-con- 
scious, but conscious only at one point, although that point 
reveals the operation of all related parts. Still there is no 
evidence that the elements not in the focus of consciousness 
are organised, and themselves individually conscious at 
the same moment that they contribute to the dominant 
consciousness. Rather must we think of them as nervous 
dispositions, which have their effect, to be sure, but are not 
accompanied by any independent consciousness apart from 
their effect upon the whole. This is further substantiated 
by the fact that there is never immediate evidence of two 
consciousnesses simultaneously present. There are two 
possible exceptions to this statement. The most striking 
is Sally in the Miss Beauchamp case. She asserted that 
she had a memory of herself as separately organised at all 
times, no matter what self might be dominant at the time 
in question. We might regard this as a fault of memory on 
Sally’s part, or we may interpret it as due to the fact that her 
experiences were connected with Br’s, and so the memory 
P 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
210 Attention 
was persistent when the other self was dominant, and her 
particular organisation was lacking. Experiences that were 
organised in one way to constitute Bi might be organised in 
another way to constitute Sally, and when recalled by Sally 
might very easily give her the impression that she had been 
in existence at the moment they entered the common 
nervous system. This assumption is rendered less plausible, 
however, by the fact that she also was in simultaneous 
existence with Biv, and had very few common memories 
with her. Then again the automatic writing seems to indicate 
for}Sally, and for many other cases, that there is some trace 
of a subconscious personality when the primary personality 
is dominant. It is not very unusual to be able to receive 
answers from a pencil held in the hand when the person 
is absorbed in reading or some other occupation, and is not 
aware of the question or of the answer that is written by 
the hand. Tests of this kind with Sally confirmed her 
statement that she was often in existence when one of the 
other members of the family was dominant and held very 
positive views on topics under discussion views that were 
in direct contradiction to those held by Miss Beauchamp. 
Even if we give full weight to these facts, the simplest 
explanation is to regard the cerebral cells as respon- 
sible for the actions, rather than to assume a com- 
pletely organised personality that exists more or less per- 
manently in the lower strata of mind. In automatic writing 
the hand would then be controlled by the nerve cells that 
would ordinarily control it, and the words that were written 
would also be represented in the same anatomical elements 
that were effective in ordinary life. The difference between 
the automatic writing and normal writing lies in the way 
the nervous elements are organised, and the principle of 
organisation is again the same in both cases. In automatic 
writing there is a tendency for the two forms of arrangement 
to exist side by side. Giving the greatest weight possible| 
to the facts we have mentioned, there is not enough to make 
the subconscious a distinctly different form of consciousness, 
     
      
                                    
-P-A-G-E-221
Attention and the Self 2z1 
nor even a consciousness distinct from the dominant mind. 
The elements are identical in both, the laws of action and 
interaction are identical, the difference lies merely in the ten- 
dency to combine in distinct ways. We may quite easily 
say with Freud that attention is controlled from the sub- 
conscious, for the elements that constitute the subcon- 
scious are also those that may at another time constitute 
the fully conscious and always control attention. 
I presume the processes that are at work in post-hypnotic 
suggestion are typical of the subconscious. Dr. Ach has 
given us direct evidence that the post-hypnotic suggestion 
may act to control association and action in exactly the same 
way as mood or question. In his experiments upon the 
influence of the task in determining the direction of associa- 
tion, two sorts of reactions were possible. One was with 
complete freedom. Two numbers were shown, and the 
subject was free to add or subtract. In another series 
some definite task was set, as a requirement to add or to 
subtract. On one occasion one of the subjects was hypno- 
tised, and told that in a designated series when the num- 
bers were shown he must always add. In the series, whether 
the same day or the next, the post-hypnotic suggestion 
was followed without exception, and when questioned 
there was no reason assigned as to why the reaction had 
been performed in this way rather than in the other. In 
this case the post-hypnotic suggestion that is typical of 
the action of the unconscious in all of its forms operated in 
exactly the same way as a mood or purpose. It became 
part of the individual’s experience, and appeared later to 
exert an effect upon attention or action just as would some 
bit of practical wisdom that had been acquired in a fully 
conscious moment. And the fact that the reason for the 
action could not be given does not serve to mark it off 
from the ordinary process, because it is seldom possible 
to recall the particular event or events that are responsible 
for the mood. 
While, then, in general and in the abstract we must admit
-P-A-G-E-222
212 Attention 
that Freud is warranted in his assumption that the sub- 
conscious may and does have an influence in the determina- 
tion of attention, we cannot mean by the subconscious 
what he implies. The subconscious is nothing mysterious, 
no new and detached realm of mind, but merely a mass of 
experiences of the same general character as those that we 
have been considering throughout the volume. We can- 
not mean by the subconscious a new level of mind ; we can at 
most mean an organisation of the old experiences in a 
slightly new way. This new unity is ordinarily easily 
broken, and then will recombine with the original systems, 
and acts upon them and is recalled by them as are any of 
the other elements of experience. The facts that have re- 
ceived so much prominence in these theories of the sub- 
conscious are not the expressions of any entirely new set 
of processes, or of entirely new laws, but are rather new 
combinations of the same familiar experiences acting by 
the same old laws, but organised for the moment about a 
new centre. 
Usually the elements that constitute and control thought 
or action merge their influence with the general mass, and 
count in the total according to their relative strength. 
Nothing that is conscious escapes forming part of their 
unity; the larger the unity, the greater the number of 
elements that compose it, the fuller the consciousness, 
the more adequate the knowledge. A sensation or thought 
detached would no more have consciousness than a particle 
of matter without other elements in the universe would 
have weight. In a system of this kind not only do we 
have both a dynamic unity and a persistent effective self 
identity, but the unity is conscious of itself as one, so long 
as the unity is unbroken and the elements are conscious of 
themselves as distinct when the unity is dissolved. It is 
not a mere logical construction, but it is a self-evident 
interpretation of observed fact. 
fF It has been frequently urged as an objection against the 
possibility of psychology that it is impossible to observe     
        
    
                           
-P-A-G-E-223
  
Attention and the Self 213 
mental states without altering them in the very process 
of observation. Since the mind observing itself is not the 
same as the mind observing external objects, and since it 
cannot be both observing something external and itself 
at the same time, we would be prevented from obtaining 
any knowledge of the action of mind. If we consider the 
nature of attending to the objects of the natural world 
and compare it with the methods of observing mental 
processes, we shall see that the difference between them 
is not great enough to warrant the assumption that we can 
know one and not the other. In both we have a process of 
attention that leads to interpretation and classification 
under general heads or types. We attend in one way 
when we observe the process as external, we attend in 
another way when we regard the object as a mental state. 
What makes it possible to attend to the same state 
successively in two ways is the fact that a state remains 
for several seconds in consciousness with slight change, 
a fact that has been designated as the memory after- 
image by Fechner, the primary memory by James, the 
perseverance tendency by G. E. Miiller, and which depends 
upon the inertia of the nervous system. We attend in one 
way for the object, and then as we introspect attend to the 
remnant of the object in another way and obtain another 
interpretation. 
When we perceive an object of any kind or give it meaning, 
we refer it to older established types under the influence of 
some general problem. When, for example, we see a 
colour, we refer it to some earlier standard, and we see it 
and make the reference because we have the particular 
question asked, What is that colour ? or because our mood 
or the task involves recognition of the colour. In brief, 
we perceive an object as an object when we attach a meaning 
to it, and that consists in identifying it with a previously 
developed standard, an earlier crystallisation from ex- 
perience. 
In the same way when we attempt to know our mental
-P-A-G-E-224
| 214 Attention 
states as mental states, we look at them under the influence 
of a question, a different question, to be sure, and refer them 
to other earlier developed types or crystallisations of ex- 
periences. When we say that there is a bare sensation 
of pressure, we are interpreting this particular concrete 
experience by other similar impressions, are taking it 
up into the system of knowledge growing from numer- | 
ous experiences of separate series of pressure and of 
the nature of their excitation by mechanical stimulation. 
We apply an interpretation or standard that has been found 
to harmonise. large groups of similar experiences. A bare 
sensation or image is from this point of view not a datum ; 
it is merely another meaning that may attach to any 
experience. Whether the meaning is one of common 
sense, of an objective science, or of subjective science, 
depends upon the purpose one has in mind at the moment 
and the resulting type to which the experience is referred. 
Obviously each is an interpretation, one is as abstract as 
another. The bare image is no bare image, but a psycholo- 
gical interpretation of what was at the last moment inter- 
preted under the influence of a question of everyday common 
sense. So to know mental states as mental states is not a . 
different kind of knowledge from knowing things—it is 
merely knowing the same thing in a slightly different way. 
It is a matter of taking up the given, whatever it may be, into . 
a different system of experiences from before, of attaching a 
different meaning or different type. So far as immediacy 
and abstractness are concerned both are on the same level. 
And even the process of knowing is not different. It is in 
both cases not a transfer from one level to another, or a 
process of bringing in elements of different grades, but 
merely one of making a reference to other elements pre- 
viously organised into a type. If we attend in one way 
we have a vaulted sky, if in another a bare sensation, blue. 
To know the self as self is, so far as it is possible at all, a 
process of the same kind. It is but to analyse out from one 
experience those phases that make that experience like all 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  Attention and the Self os 
other experiences, a selection of the aspect that is common 
to all experience. The process frequently repeated gives 
rise to the ideafor type of the empirical self to which each 
concrete mental process/adds something. Even when we 
pass to the problem of the self as a dynamic active force, 
we are working along the same general lines. True, the 
experiences have not crystallised so definitely or com- 
pletely that the type is unmistakable from the given, 
or that it seems to be a datum of consciousness as does 
the perception of the table. Still the construction comes by 
looking at the concrete with a definite question in mind, 
and gaining from numerous processes a common character- 
istic that, when combined with other interpretations of 
different phenomena, harmonises with them and can be 
made typical of all action. 
So for example I have been endeavouring in this chapter 
to group the facts that are involved in knowing the self 
with a large mass of related facts. If I have succeeded in 
uniting the picture of the self with other bits of knowledge 
already developed into a system, we have a knowledge of 
the self in what seems to me the only possible way of knowing 
anything. To take some one concrete act, if any act is 
concrete, and to bring it into connection with a wide mass 
of similar phenomena that interpret it on the one side, 
and on the other take it over into themselves to enrich 
them, is to know. Similarly the self as developed socially 
is an interpretation, and as we know it in any of its physical 
or ideational aspects, we are selecting phases and grouping 
them with related phenomena. The data that are inter- 
preted we find first, probably, in the constant mass of sensa- 
tions, strains, bodily feelings, persistent visual impressions, 
etc. etc., that James and others have been so happy in rout- 
ing out from the complex. About these group the socially 
recognised differences from other individuals, and from 
the mass there precipitates an awareness of the self as a 
meaning. In the interpretation the self does not stand 
out with all the distinctness of the desk I see before me.
-P-A-G-E-226
  216 Attention 
It is more confused with the impression of body, more 
vague, more shadowy, but it originates in the same way. 
The difference in substantiality is probably due in part to 
the fact that it will not stand the pragmatic test, will not 
serve as the end of action, or will not give support in any 
physical way when trusted to. Even if the perception were 
more shadowy, if it were a mere logical interpretation of what 
is known, we should have the same principle. In short, we 
may say that instead of the mind knowing mental states, 
mental states know the mind. Knowing, whether of external 
objects, of sensations as sensations, or of the self, is a process 
of selecting some phase of the momentary experience, under 
the influence of mood, purpose or question, and amplifying 
that phase by earlier experiences that have crystallised 
into types. Knowing is a process that comes out of ex- 
perience under the influence of experience and by the 
addition of experiences. And one form of knowing is no 
more complicated, no more mysterious than another. 
To perceive an object, to introspect an image or bare 
sensation, and to know a self are all alike in that each is a 
different rearrangement of an entire experience about a 
common focal point, a different way of attending to the 
same experience, and the different ways of attending are 
due to different questions in mind that lead to different 
interpretations, to different types. We have come round to 
Miinsterberg’s statement that all knowledge is interpreta- 
tion, with the difference that I believe that all knowledge 
is essentially interpretation, and that, far from falsifying 
experience, interpretation is the very life of experience. 
No experience would be possible without it, and the greater 
the amount of interpretation, the greater the number of 
elements that interact in any mental process, the fuller 
the consciousness, the more adequate the knowledge, the 
nearer the approach to the goal of truth. 
The physical side of the self will necessarily be discussed 
later in connection with the physical side of attention. 
Suffice it here to say that what on the mental side is an
-P-A-G-E-227
  
Attention and the Self 217 
organisation of experiences is on the physical side an organ- 
isation of nervous elements. We can parallel the mental by 
the physical at every point, in fact the mental derangements 
already considered have forced us at earlier stages of our 
argument to change at times from the mental to the physical 
in our picture. Further details here would merely dupli- 
cate the later chapter. 
Taken together, the self and attention are so closely 
related as to be scarcely distinguishable. Conditions of 
attention and what we know as the self are for practical 
purposes identical. The self is an organisation of ex- 
periences as a dynamic whole. It is our word to express 
the fact that each man is different in his actions from every 
other man, that his experience is a unit, and that he feels it 
to be always identical with itself. The same process of 
interaction that is responsible for the unity and persistent 
identity of the self, and that makes it possible for the mental 
states to be known as mental states is also the factor 
that we have seen to be at the basis of what we know as 
attention. In short we may say that attention is merely 
the self active in controlling the entrance of ideas, just as 
will is the self active in the determination of action, and 
reason is the self exerted in the ordering of thought. It is 
essential merely to note that all operations arise and are 
determined from within, not from without experience. 
The self is not some part of experience, nor is it some- 
thing above or beyond experience; but it is simply 
the whole or the sum-total of experience. When we say 
then that the self decides to what we shall attend, we do 
not mean that decision is controlled by some experience 
other than those previously discussed ; we desire to designate 
those same conditions regarded from a slightly different 
point of view. 
SUMMARY 
1. The idea of a self has usually been introduced to 
explain the fact that mind shows unity and self-identity, 
and that mental states do not exist merely but are known.
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 Attention 
2. These facts cannot be satisfactorily explained on the 
assumption of a mind apart from the states, but are per- 
fectly explicable if we regard the interacting mass of 
experience as the self. 
3. Unity comes from the mutual interaction of all elements 
of experience past as well as present. 
4. Persistent self-identity finds its explanation in the 
fact that no experience is ever entirely lost, and that new 
experiences are never entirely new but are new arrange- 
ments of old experiences about a new element. 
5. Mental states, like external objects, are known by 
being taken up into existing types earlier crystallised 
from the experience.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE ANATOMICAL BASIS OF ATTENTION 
Ehavenow considered the facts usually grouped under 
the head of attention and the related phenomena 
which seem to be susceptible of explanation in terms of the 
same general theory. It devolves upon us now to search 
out a theory for the facts we have been considering, to see 
how far they may be brought together under some more 
general principle, and to discover any related facts that 
shall throw new light upon those already noticed. 
We may divide all the many theories of attention that 
have been developed in the history of psychology into three 
great groups. One considers attention from the side of the 
activities of the nervous system; a second group brings 
attention into very close connection with apperception in 
some form or other, and would treat it as one phase of this 
general centre of mental activity; and a third makes 
some one characteristic or accompaniment of attention 
fundamental, and would explain every aspect from that 
one feature. These groups are of course not exclusive. 
Some writers have considered different phases of the problem 
and have developed at least two of the theories in a single 
work. The physiological theory is a natural accompani- 
ment of either of the other two, and there are also cases in 
which the first two have been combined. 
We must begin with an examination of the physiological 
theories of attention, but before we can enter upon the 
details of the discussion we must consider for a moment 
the more general question of the relation between body 
219 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 Attention 
and mind, which is presupposed in any “explanation” in 
psychology ; and then pass to a discussion of the anatomical 
substrate of attention. Both factors must enter into the 
discussion of each point, and unless we have some agree- 
ment as to what part each is to play confusion is sure to 
arise. A full treatment of the relation of body and mind 
is out of place here, and would take much more space than 
we have to devote to it. But as there can be no satis- 
factory conclusion reached without reference to both the 
physical and the mental antecedents of attention, and as 
there is always likely to be confusion and misunderstand- 
ing when there is not a definite picture of the relation, it 
seems necessary to give a brief statement of the generally 
accepted theory of their connection. 
Daily experience reinforced by all that we know of 
mental pathology, comparative neurology, and cerebral 
physiology makes certain that there is a very close relation 
between the mental and the bodily states. Anything that 
affects the brain is at once seen to have an influence upon 
the thinking processes. A sharp blow upon the head 
produces unconsciousness, and all similar accidents have 
their corresponding mental effects. Diseases of the brain 
are¥accompanied by mental disturbances, and there is a 
very definite correspondence between the part of the brain 
affected and the nature of the mental perversion. In the 
animal series we find that the signs of intelligence increase 
as the nervous system grows in relative size and becomes 
more complicated in structure, and finally it is possible by 
physiological experiments on animals to show that modify-| 
ing the action of the nervous elements produces movements} 
which ordinarily are the result of conscious states. The 
fact of connection is certain, but when we attempt to thin 
the nature of the relation more definitely we at onc 
become involved in difficulties of all sorts, which up t 
the present time seem to forbid us to bring the relatio: 
under any of the usual categories. 
In the first place we can hardly think of one as cause 
     
    
    
                            
    
-P-A-G-E-231
    The Anatomical Basis of Attention 221 
the other as effect, for both the mental and the physical 
processes seem to go on simultaneously while we think 
of the cause as preceding the effect. Again, if we regard 
mind and body as separate things we can only regard them 
as causally related if we restate some of the fundamental 
hypotheses of the natural sciences, the doctrine of the 
conservation of energy in particular. If physical pro- 
cesses cause mental states, there must be energy used up 
in the process, and this energy can no longer be regarded 
as within the series of physical relations, and hence is an 
incalculable factor from the standpoint of the physicist. 
There seems, then, no escape from considering the mental 
processes as identical in kind with physical processes, a 
conclusion which lands us in materialism. On the other 
side, if we assume that the mental processes can exert an 
influence upon physical states, we have again creation of 
physical energy in an incalculable manner which is also 
opposed to the same fundamental hypothesis. We can 
escape this only by accepting the materialistic hypothesis 
as above, or by assuming that mental processes are the 
type of all processes, and so that all seemingly physical 
processes are at bottom mental. 
Many attempts have been made to retain interaction 
and the doctrine of conservation of energy at one and the 
same time. The method has for the most part been an 
attempt to find some way in which mind may conceivably 
influence physical processes without exerting force upon 
them. One of the most ingenious and frequently quoted 
is the suggestion of Sir Oliver Lodge, that it is possible that 
mind merely controls the direction of energy but does 
not add energy to the physiological processes. In spite 
of the scientific distinction of its author, it seems doubtful 
if there is ever any control of the direction of a force that 
is not due to another force. Change in the direction of 
motion of a projectile or of a stream would be regarded 
as just as certain evidence of the action of some force as 
would change in its velocity.
-P-A-G-E-232
222 Attention 
This and similar theories, of which there have been many, 
are all attempts to make nothing out of something by 
making that something very small, but a violation of a 
general principle cannot be excused on the ground of 
insignificance, and if you make the offence trifling the gain 
for the theory is similarly small. 
We seem compelled then either to give up the doctrine 
of the conservation of energy, to abandon all distinctions 
between the bodily and mental processes, or to deny that 
there is a causal relation between body and mind. Of 
these possible solutions modern psychology has chosen the 
last. There would be no difficulty in modifying the con- 
servation of energy hypothesis to suit the case if there 
were any positive facts that demanded it, but the objec- 
tions which we have to meet do not rest upon positive 
facts but upon difficulties in picturing an unknown relation. 
Again, there might be no objection to identifying the 
physical and mental sides of phenomena. In fact modern 
metaphysics very decidedly inclines to that solution of the 
problem in its most fundamental aspects. But whatever 
we may decide as to the fundamental truth of the relation 
between the two, there can be no doubt that on the more 
concrete psychological plane there is an easily recognisable 
distinction between the chemical change which takes 
place within a nerve cell and the sensation which accom- 
panies it in our mind. A fundamental unification of the 
two phenomena, although demanded by many philosophical 
considerations, can never disturb the fact that these two 
things are different experiences. 
To avoid these many difficulties all use of the term causality 
in the discussion has been abandoned, and psychologists 
have very generally accepted the doctrine of psycho-physi- 
cal parallelism. They assume that the mind and brain 
work on side by side, but they do not assume that either 
influences the other—that there is any interaction between 
the two series of events. Mental processes are explained 
by a reference to preceding mental states, and physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  The Anatomical Bases of Attention 223 
processes by the earlier bodily states, but there is no dis- 
tinct assertion as to what the nature of the relation between 
them may be, although it is added that the same physical 
process always accompanies any given mental process, and 
vice versa. 
The positive empirical facts which have led to this con- 
clusion are easily stated. It depends in the last analysis 
upon the fact that no man has ever seen a bodily process 
pass over into a mental process, and in all probability 
never will see such a passage. Every man is immediately 
conscious of his own mental processes as they run their 
course, but knows nothing directly of his brain, of the 
changes that go on during the same time in his nervous 
system. He can see a rod come into contact with his 
hand and immediately after feel a sensation of pressure 
from the skin, he can see a morsel of food vanish in the 
direction of his mouth and have a continuous series of 
tactual sensations from fingers, lips, and tongue, but he 
knows nothing more of the process until the sensations of 
taste come into consciousness. He knows nothing of 
the nervous processes which intervene between the time 
he sees. the rod touch the hand and the entrance of the 
sensation of touch, or between the contact of the food 
particle with the tongue and the coming of the sensation 
of taste. 
When, on the other hand, the anatomist and the physi- 
ologist attempt to supply the link, to trace the connections 
between the sense. organ and the conscious sensation, 
they can but follow the path of the nerve to the brain, 
trace the connections in the cortex of the hemispheres 
and the motor paths which lead back to the muscles. 
They can nowhere pierce the veil that shuts them off from 
the sensation and from consciousness. Magnify the present 
powers of observation a thousand-fold, and even devise 
experimental means that should permit one to study the 
brain cells during their operation and to watch the changes 
which go on in them while the mind is perceiving external   
-P-A-G-E-234
224 Attention 
objects or following a train of thought, one would still 
be unable to discover what connection exists between the 
mental picture and the chemical changes in the cells. 
The physiologist would know the mechanical side, the 
man whose brain was being examined would know the 
mental side, but neither could know both at once. So far as 
we can predict to-day it will be for ever impossible to have 
the two sides, physical and psychical, in the same conscious- 
ness at the same time. And granting by a stretch of the 
imagination that this difficulty be overcome, and by some 
ingenious contrivance it should become possible for an indi- 
vidual to watch his brain cells in action and to think at the 
same time, to receive impressions from the external world 
and at the same time to study the mechanism by which he 
receives them, there would still be two isolated conscious 
experiences, and the process of transfer from one state 
to the other would even then be hidden from view. Unless 
this process of transformation could be studied for itself, 
there could be no adequate representation of the relation 
between body and mind. At best the two series of pro- 
cesses would be but two disjointed groups of experiences 
which could never be united. 
Moreover, so far as is known there is no relation in any 
way like the relation of mind and body with which it can be 
compared. It stands in our experience as a fact sud generis, 
and will not fit into the forms of causality as we see them 
in the world about, but so far as we can learn must stand 
alone. The reasoning processes of the human mind are 
such that if it is possible to refer one fact to a similar fact 
or group of facts we seem to have it explained, but this 
particular relation can find no explanation even in analogy. 
The picture of an object and the cerebral states which we 
know or can know seem doomed to stand in isolation in 
our experience, although other facts assure us that they 
never exist the one without the other. It is this apparent 
paradox that the two series of phenomena are constantly 
given together but with their form of connection unknown, 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  The Anatomical Basis of Attention 225 
which drives us to the hypothesis of psycho-physical parallel- 
ism. It is justifiable so long as it remains merely a state- 
ment of known fact, and makes no assertions positive or 
negative as to the nature of the connection between the 
two series of events. 
For our purpose, an acceptance of this doctrine means 
that we shall everywhere seek an explanation of the physical 
facts within the physical series, and of the mental facts 
within the mental series. Furthermore, we shall attempt 
to connect the mental facts with the corresponding physical 
facts, but shall not regard one as in any case the cause of the 
other. This involves treating attention from two distinct 
sides, but always endeavouring to point out the elements 
in the two series which are concomitant. The pointing 
out of concomitants will not imply that we are dealing 
with causes, even if we do not definitely deny in so many 
words that there is a causal relation, but will merely be 
an attempt to complete our knowledge of each side as 
best we may from the facts at our disposal. 
As a further preliminary to the discussion of the physio- 
logical theories of attention we must attempt to give 
a brief statement of the structure of the nervous organs 
which are involved in the process, a phase of attention 
which we have so far entirely neglected. 
Roughly speaking, the nervous system is to-day generally 
thought of as made up of a vast number of separate cells, 
each an organism complete in itself, although dependent 
upon the body as a whole for its nourishment and protec- 
tion. Our understanding of the nature of the nervous 
system is very largely confined to knowing the arrange- 
ment of the various organisms and appreciating their 
mutual relations. We know next to nothing of the 
processes which go on in the elements themselves. That 
there is some complex chemical change in the nerve cell 
while it is in action is certain, and we know too that there 
are electrical phenomena associated with the action of 
the nerve cells. Much, too, is known of the ways in which 
Q 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
226 Attention 
nerves may be excited, but after all, so far as inner action is 
concerned, the nerve cell is almost entirely a sealed book. 
Still less is known, as has just been said, of what the 
telation may be between the neural processes and the 
mental states which correspond to them. We must be 
satisfied at present then with what explanations can be 
derived from a study of the paths which the various nerve 
impulses follow from the sense organ to the brain and from 
the brain back to the muscles, with a slight knowledge of 
the different parts of the brain that are involved in the 
several processes. 
The elementary cells of which the nervous tissue is made 
up are of very different sizes and shapes, but they have 
several characteristics in common. Each element consists 
of a cell body and two or more processes or prolongations 
of greater or less Jength. The cell body is the vital centre 
of the element. It contains the nucleus of the entire cell, 
and through it the other parts receive nourishment. The 
nerve fibres all grow out from this cell body originally, and 
when separated from it in any way they at once die. The 
processes vary greatly in length, from a millimetre or so to 
half the length of the body, but they do not vary in the 
closeness of their vital connection with the cell. Even the 
outermost part of the nerve fibre, the longest as well as the 
shortest, is absolutely dependent upon the central body for 
its life. We may crudely picture the nervous system as 
made up of a mass of living organisms with interlacing 
tentacles which connect with the outside world on the one 
side and ramify throughout the body on the other, and 
unite into masses in the brain and lower centres. They 
serve to bring each element into connection’,with many 
others. 
From one standpoint we can think of the function of the 
nervous system as a process of transmitting stimuli from 
the sense organs to the muscles. In the more complicated 
processes the intermediate steps in the transformation may 
be much more important than the contraction of the muscle  
-P-A-G-E-237
The Anatomical Basis of Attention 227 
that results, but there is in every instance, even in purely 
sensory attention, some motor discharge. There are in 
general three levels at which sensory impressions may pass 
over into motor effects. The first and simplest of these is 
the spinal cord, the seat of reflex action. Next come the 
secondary centres of the medulla, the corpora quadrigemina, 
the thalamus, etc., and finally the connections which are 
made in the cerebral hemispheres. The difference between 
the nervous action at the different levels is mainly in the 
degree of complexity, in the number of stimuli that may be 
summed up in the motor effect. In the cord there are only 
a few impressions concerned, mainly those from skin and 
muscle, and the corresponding movement is simple. Nearly 
all of the senses may be concerned in the movements which 
originate in the lower centres, and the movements are 
correspondingly more complex and better adapted to the 
circumstances of the environment at the moment. In the 
ortex the movements are the resultant not only of the 
timuli which are affecting the senses at the moment, but 
f those which have been active in the past as well. It is 
ere that the activities of the cells are accompanied by 
onsciousness in the fullest sense of the word, although it is 
ot at all unlikely that the lower centres also contribute a 
art to the total consciousness. For our present purposes 
e may disregard the lower levels of nervous activity, or 
ink of them only as the means by which the external 
imuli are transmitted to the cortex. 
The problem in connection with the cortex itself deals 
ith the centres for the various senses, and with association 
ths which connect them. Probably the most satisfactory 
count of the architecture of the sensory areas of the 
rtex which we have to-day is contained in the two works 
Flechsig, “ Die Localization der geistigen Vorginge ” and 
ehirn und Seele.” His conclusions are brought to- 
ther in the accompanying diagram on page 228. From 
y diagram of the brain it will be seen that the motor 
a for the control of all the muscles of the body is situated

hemispheres come into juxtaposition. Within this area t

The Anatomical Basts of Attention 229 
have very accurately localised centres, an area for the 
thumb, another for the muscles involved in speech, etc. etc. 
The sensory areas are more widely scattered, and are on 
the whole not so definitely known as are the motor centres. 
The tactile sensations seem to have their seat in the same 
general region of the cortex as the cells for the control 
of the movements of the corresponding part of the 
body. The area for hearing is located in the anterior 
portion of the temporal lobe. The visual sensations are 
received in the occipital lobe on both the external and 
median surfaces. Smell is placed in the temporo-sphenoidal 
lobe, and taste near it, although that is not so well made 
out. The various areas can be recognized much more 
easily from diagrams than from any description. 
The main point for us is that the sensory and motor areas 
are widely separated in the cortex, and that the areas of the 
brain in which it is known that there are definite sensory 
or motor functions occupy a relatively small part of the 
entire cortex. What part the remaining portions might 
play has been long in dispute. The most satisfactory 
explanation at present is the one given us by Flechsig, 
that the function of all the areas is to unite the different 
sensory and motor areas with one another. There are 
apparently three kinds of connections to be distinguished 
in the cortex. A sensory area may be directly joined with 
a motor, two sensory areas may be united, and finally 
there are connecting fibres which form a bond of union 
between all parts of the cortex indirectly through a central 
associating area. The first form of connection is prob- 
ably the simplest. The best instance is to be found in 
the connections which exist between optical and auditory 
centres on the one hand, and the motor centre for speech 
on the other. The fact is best brought out by the different 
forms of aphasia. In one form of this disease it is im- 
possible to hear spoken words, and so impossible to repeat 
them. In another form it is impossible to read aloud written 
or printed words. The functions of the centre for sight  
-P-A-G-E-240
  230 Attention 
are destroyed, and there is no visual cue for speech. When 
the motor centre is itself impaired there is the same effect 
produced, except that both visual and auditory cues fail 
to call out the speech movements, while it is possible both 
to see and to hear. The same effects result from extensive 
degenerations of the connecting paths or of the intervening 
areas of the cortex as from the destruction of either the 
sensory or the motor centre. There must be extensive 
paths which join the two areas. Similar connections can 
be traced between the sensory centres and the motor 
centres for the control of any other part of the body, but 
the connection is not so evident since the centres which 
receive the impressions from the skin and muscles—which 
stand in the closest connection with the movement of the 
muscles—are found in the same area as the motor centres, 
so that the connecting paths are shorter and harder to 
demonstrate. This uniting of sensory and motor areas in 
the cortex is one of the functions of the portions of the 
brain which are neither sensory nor motor. 
Another function is to associate one sensory with other 
sensory impressions. As we have seen throughout the 
book, sensations from one organ are constantly accompanied 
by those from another. To permit of this every part of 
the centre for one sense must be in connection with every 
other sensory area. This function Flechsig assigns almost 
exclusively to the region of the cortex between the visual 
centre in the occipital lobe and the area for the tactile, 
auditory, and olfactory sensations. 
Another area in which no specific sensory or motor 
functions are developed covers the cortex of the frontal 
lobes. These, too, Flechsig found to be closely connected 
with the tactile area, and it is probable that they are also 
closely joined to the other sensory areas. The entire un- 
localised area of the brain is then occupied by these three 
association centres, which serve to make it possible for the 
sensory and motor centres to combine in any order. 
A brief description of the method by which Flechsig has
-P-A-G-E-241
The Anatomical Basis of Attention 2gr 
arrived at these conclusions may serve to make the state- 
ments clearer, as well as to furnish a means of judging the 
accuracy of the conclusions themselves. It depends upon 
the fact that there is a progressive ripening of the fibres of 
the cortex in the child, which begins before birth and con- 
tinues for a considerable period after. The nerve fibre in 
its complete form is made up of two parts, the conducting 
centre and an outer layer of fatty tissue, the sheath of 
myelin. In the first stages of the development of the cor- 
tical nerve fibres the sheath is lacking, and as the different 
tracts take on the sheath or,myelinate at different times 
it is possible to distinguish the paths by the order of their 
myelination. The first to ripen in the hemispheres are 
the sensory fibres, and of these the tactile fibres appear 
first, and are followed in order by those of the olfactory, 
visual, and auditory tracts. The sensory are followed by 
the motor fibres, and these still later by the association 
fibres, which extend from part to part of the cortex. It 
was possible for Flechsig to make out accurately the place 
of origin of the different tracts by studying the brain of 
the child at different stages in its development, while 
the various tracts stand out very much alone in their 
development. 
With this picture of the cerebrum as made up of a number 
of sensory and motor centres with connecting tracts of 
association fibres, we are ready to ask the question as to 
what part of the brain is likely to be the seat of attention. 
The answer is given most directly by psychiatry. Flechsig 
says of patients who suffer from lesions of the frontal lobes, 
with no other injuries that can be discovered in any other 
portion of the brain: ‘‘ The patient now ascribes to himself 
every idea that in reality is to be referred to the external 
world, so that he thinks himself in possession of all con- 
ceivable goods, talents, and deserts. There is lacking the 
associative connection between the external perceptions 
and the idea of his own person, or, on the other 
hand, between the consciousness of his own personality and
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 Attention 
external perception, so that he forgets himself or does not 
attend to his surroundings (there is no ‘active apperception.’) 
There may be no obscurity in the ideas in the usual sense. 
The patient talks intelligently concerning many ideas, if 
he is not under the influence of an emotion, but he is not 
able to distinguish between the really experienced and 
the merely imagined, between the true and the false, the 
possible and the impossible. Along with this defect of 
the logical feeling (based upon imperfect memory) goes 
a lapse of ethical and esthetic judgment which betrays 
him into actions that stand in irreconcilable opposition 
to his earlier character.” [*] We see from this that 
attention, either in its effects upon perception or in its 
subtler effects upon the more complicated processes which 
we have noted to be dependent upon it, disappears or is 
woefully impaired when the frontal lobes are affected. 
Similar testimony comes from many psychiatrists. In 
a list of cases of lesions of the frontal lobes reported by 
Dr. M. Allen Starr, there was a large proportion of cases 
in which there was a lack of interest in the surroundings, 
a general lack of memory, reason, and spontaneity 
of action. Operations upon the frontal lobes of monkeys 
have shown very much the same effects. 
Injuries of the other association areas do not have this 
widespread effect. If the Island of Reil is affected alone 
we have merely a breaking of the connections between the 
auditory and speech centres, and, as has been seen above, 
an accompanying auditory aphasia or partial aphasia, 
paraphasia. Lesions of the posterior association centre 
in the temporal and parietal lobes are accompanied by a 
deterioration in the more rudimentary connections between 
the parts of knowledge rather than by a disturbance of the 
higher functions. There is a lack of recognition of the 
temporal and spatial relations, and a general disturbance 
of the ordinary associative connections. Objects are not 
recognised, and so cannot be correctly used. But there 
is no disturbance of the relations of the self to external
-P-A-G-E-243
The Anatomical Basis of Attention 233 
objects or of the external objects to the self. What we 
denominated the objective conditions of association are 
impaired, but the subjective control remains normal, so 
long as the frontal association centres are not injured. 
Psychiatry then seems to point to the frontal lobes as the 
area which is at the basis of attention. 
Other evidence that would tend to support the same 
theory was adduced by Professor Cunningham in his presi- 
dential address before the Anthropological section of the 
British Association in rg01. He pointed out that the most 
constant difference in the skulls of animals and of men con- 
sisted in the greater width of the skull of man in the region 
of the boundary between the frontal and parietal lobes, and 
the chief change in the brain of man as compared with the 
higher animals lies in the extension of the frontal lobe and 
the anterior portion of the parietal lobe downward until 
they cover in the Island of Reil. Part of this is undoubtedly 
the neural accompaniment of the great development of 
speech in the human species, but part of the increase 
must be ascribed to an extension of the frontal association 
centre. " 
It is significant in this connection that, next to speech, 
power of sustained attention would probably be chosen as 
the distinctive characteristic of the human race. It would 
point to the fact that increase in attention goes on side by 
side with the development of the frontal lobes. There is 
also scattered and less satisfactory evidence that men of 
genius have possessed brains which were particularly well 
developed in this same region. The brain of the astronomer 
Hugo Gylden, of the mathematician Sophie Kovalevsky, 
and of Helmholtz, have shown in this region “‘a marked 
exuberance of cortical growth.” [*] 
What evidence there is, then, from the comparative 
study of the brains of the different species and of different 
individuals goes to confirm the results of pathology in 
assigning attention to the frontal lobes. Impairment of 
the frontal lobes means impairment of attention, increase
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 Attention 
in the frontal lobes accompanies increase in efficiency of 
attention. These two facts, while they do not amount to 
an absolute demonstration of the correspondence between 
this region and activity of attention, do raise a very strong 
presumption that attention corresponds to the anterior 
association centre of Flechsig. 
One other fact remains to be mentioned here in prepara- 
tion for the physiological discussions of the next chapter. 
This is the result of the labours of Theodore Kaes [° 7] on 
the successive medullation of the more minute cortical 
fibres. His experiments carry on the method of Flechsig, 
but apply it to the connecting paths within the different 
areas, and extend the investigation over a much longer 
period in the life of the individual. He found that the 
course of development is much slower than was previously 
supposed. There is an increase in the number of com- 
pletely developed fibres of fifty per cent between the ages 
of eighteen and thirty-eight, and the process is not entirely 
complete at fifty. Moreover, the order in which the different 
areas develop is in confirmation of the results of Flechsig. 
Kaes found that the central and occipital regions develop 
much earlier than the association centres, and that the 
anterior portion of the brain comes to maturity last of all. 
Certainly if medullation is an essential condition of func- 
tion we should expect the association centres to appear 
later than the centres which they connect, and the most 
complicated association centre, the frontal, to ripen last 
of all. 
We must leave over to the next chapter the attempt to 
construct a picture of the physiological action of the 
anatomical mechanisms here sketched. 
SUMMARY 
x. As a starting-point for a nervous explanation of 
attention we may accept the hypothesis of psycho-physical 
parallelism; that mind and body run along side by side, but 
with no assertable causal connection between them.

2. The anatomical seat of attention is apparently the 
frontal lobes. ; 
3. The frontal lobes are not the seat of spontaneous 
energy, but are shown by Flechsig to be association centres 
that mediate between sensory, and sensory and motor, areas 
of the cortex.

             CHAPTER XV 
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ATTENTION 
HEN all has been said that can be said from the 
anatomical side, we are still without an understand- 
ing of the way in which the structures act in making one 
obj and out clearly at one time and another at another. 
To know that a is in some way connected wi 
the frontal lobes, and that the 
although situated in different parts of the cortex, are con- 
nected with the frontal lobes and with each other by 
association fibres, is still to know nothing of the physiological 
functions involved in attention. Even the discovery of 
Kaes that the association fibres develop as the man grows 
older, and thus increase the number of connecting paths 
between the various parts of the cortex, is merely suggestive 
of a theory of the action of the cerebral structures, and is 
not in itself an adequate explanation. 
Our problem here is as to how a group of cells in the 
frontal lobe with its connecting fibres can make now the 
paper on which I write, now the inkstand, and again the 
words that I am striving to put on paper, stand out clearly 
before me, and monopolise my consciousness. Facts are 
not as yet known which will give an absolutely 
conclusive answer to this question, but there are many 
known physiological activities which raise a presumption 
in favour of one theory or another. It is our purpose in 
this chapter to state as many as possible of the facts that 
seem to have a bearing, and then to attempt to harmonise 
these physiological processes with the psychological observa- 
236
-P-A-G-E-247
The Physiology of Attention 237 
tions that we have collected in the earlier parts of the 
book. 
There are three ways in which one nerve element may 
affect another : (1) by direct transmission of the impulse, as 
when the excitation of a sense organ affects each successive 
neuron between it and the cortex ; (2) by another influence 
that tends to increase the activity of the second cell, but 
not to excite it if it is not already in activity ; and (3) by 
a similar influence that will decrease the activity of the 
cell below its normal. The first of these forms of influence 
is the simplest, and the one which is regarded as fundamental 
for all nervous action. What the nature of the transmission 
may be, or how it is possible for the activity of one cell to 
excite another to activity, are both matters of which ‘we 
are as yet ignorant, but action always takes place by reason 
of some direct contact between the parts of the cells. It 
is improbable that this simple form of transmission should 
constitute the basis of the activity of the frontal lobes. 
For, in the first place, there is no original source of excitation 
in the frontal lobes that might serve to initiate the series 
of activities, and, in the second place, the frontal lobe does 
not itself excite the cells of sense, but merely increases their 
tendency to act when an immediate stimulus is given. 
The other two forms of stimulation are much less direct, 
and consist simply in a tendency to influence in one way or 
another the action of a cell when excited from some other 
source. We must turn for the type of both forms of action 
to the relations between the different motor centres, and 
preferably those of the cord. Perhaps the simplest in- 
stance of the two processes are to be found in the knee jerk, 
- which has been worked out in great detail by Jendrassik, [7] 
Dr. Weir Mitchell, [*7] Professor Lombard, [*4] and Professors 
Bowditch and Warren. [5] Every schoolboy knows that if 
he sits with his legs crossed, his neighbour can excite a 
vigorous kick by gently tapping the tendon just below the 
knee-cap. A careful study of this phenomenon has shown 
that the extent of this kick varies with the condition of
-P-A-G-E-248

238 Attention 
excitation of the nervous system as a whole. The experi- 
ments show that the contraction of any other muscle in 
the body tends to increase the extent of the kick. Clenching 
the fist, talking, setting the teeth, in fact, any movement 
however remote from the part of the body in question, will 
serve to reinforce the movement, and in many cases will 
considerably more than double it. Another instance of much 
the same kind was worked out by Professor Loeb. Professor 
Loeb found that it was possible to exert a greater amount 
of strain upon a dynamometer with the right hand if not only 
the muscles of that hand were contracted. but those‘of the 
left as well and all the muscles of the body. It was pointed 
out in connection with the strain sensations, and is also a fact 
of general observation, that when one exerts himself to the 
utmost in the performance of any bit of work, there is con- 
traction not only of the muscles which are directly in- 
volved but of nearly all the other muscles of the body in 
addition. When gripping with one hand the other too is 
tightly shut, the muscles of the scalp are contracted, the 
teeth are set, and the whole body is braced, although none 
of these movements are of any direct advantage to the 
movement in question. Loeb showed that these other 
contractions were not mere useless grimaces, but that with- 
out them it was impossible to exert the full force of the 
tight hand. If you check the contractions of the other 
muscles, you not only do not seem to be trying so hard, but 
you are really accomplishing less in the task that you have 
set yourself. Here, as in the preceding case, we cannot be 
concerned with the mere transmission of impulse from cell 
to cell, but must look to reinforcement as an explanation. 
Each motor cell, simply because it is active, will tend to 
increase the amount of activity of the other motor cells in 
the body, whether near or remote in their seat. 
The evidence that under other circumstances the activity 
of one motor cell may tend to decrease or inhibit the activity 
of another is just as direct. One of the first instances of 
this kind of action to be made out was the effect of the
-P-A-G-E-249
The Phystology of Attention 239 
vagus nerve upon the heart. It is known that the con- 
traction of the heart muscle would go on at a regular rate 
much faster than the normal, were it not that it is held in ~ 
check by the activity of the vagus nerve. Stimulation of 
the vagus tends to slow the heart, cutting the vagus or pro- 
ducing a partial impairment of its function, as in a fever, 
will release the heart from the inhibitory control, and 
permit it to assume its own rate, or to approximate to 
that rate. There seem to be similar but less well-known 
inhibitory influences exerted by the other functions of the 
medulla upon one another. The respiratory rhythm seems 
to check the activity of the vaso-motor centre at certain 
points in its activity, and both the vaso-motor and the 
respiratory rhythms affect the vagus centre, and through it 
the rate of the heart. 
There are also many instances of inhibition between the 
voluntary motor cells. Bowditch and Warren found that 
all the impulses which Professor Lombard and Jendrassik 
had shown to reinforce the knee-jerk if they were received 
at the same time as the blow which called out the kick 
would inhibit the movement, if the stimulus preceded the 
blow by 0°4 of a second or so. The primary effect of the 
contraction of any other muscle of the body is to increase the 
amount of the movement, but its secondary or delayed 
effect is always to decrease or even to destroy the move- 
ment. Even more striking and important are the results 
of Professor Sherrington [** *°] and his students. They have 
shown that with every stimulation of a motor area in 
thejcortex there go out two innervations. One will exert 
an ‘influence to contract a group of muscles, while the 
other at the same time inhibits the activity of the 
antagonists. The same stimulus, then, will at one and the 
same time excite the muscles which bend the arm at the 
elbow and decrease the tonus of the muscles which tend to 
straighten the arm, and thereby remove any possibility of 
interference of that group with the movement of flexion. 
On the basis of these results we are safe in formulating  
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 Attention 
the general principle that any motor cell will by its activity 
increase or decrease the activity or tendency to activity of 
other motor cells, however remote the two may stand in the 
body, and, apparently, however devious the connection 
between the two cells may be. Whether it shall increase 
or decrease the activity will depend in part upon the tem- 
poral relations between the two excitations, and in part 
upon the paths that connect the two cells. What the other 
elements are which determine whether the effect shall be of 
reinforcement or inhibition have not been made out. We 
can still further extend this law of reinforcement and in- 
hibition by making it include the effect of sensory cells upon 
motor cells. Professor Lombard found that music, a 
dream, a knock upon the door, or any sensation of sufficient 
force and suddenness, would reinforce the knee-jerk. Drs. 
Bowditch and Warren still further extended these results 
to show that a loud sound, a bright light, a puff of air against 
the skin, would act in the same way as the contraction of 
a muscle, would first reinforce and then inhibit the activity 
of the cells that control the knee-jerk. It seems that we 
can say that the activity of a motor cell is influenced 
positively or negatively by the activity of very many cells, 
both motor and sensory, in other parts of the body. These 
forms of influence seem as frequent, if less marked, as the 
direct effect of cell upon cell in transmitting a sensory 
stimulus from the sense organ to the cortex, or a motor 
innervation from the cortex or other centre to the cell in 
immediate control of the muscles. [5] _ 
What the nature of this effect may be it is very difficult 
to say. It is probably carried by the same paths as the 
directly transmitted stimulation, and differs from the direct 
effect only in so far as that does not of itself excite the nerve 
cell, but only increases or decreases the tonus of the cell 
upon which it acts as shown in the effect of any direct 
excitation. 
It seems probable that we must look to these facts of 
reinforcement or of inhibition as the basis of the explanation
-P-A-G-E-251
  The Physiology of Attention 241 
of the nervous processes which accompany the mental 
changes of attention. In fact the three physiological 
theories of attention which are now most current, all 
put the emphasis upon one or the other of these effects. 
Beginning in the order of historical development, we find 
that G. E. Miller would make attention almost entirely 
a phenomenon of reinforcement ; Wundt insists that it is 
entirely a result of inhibition ; while Exner would combine 
the two, and regard it as both inhibitory and reinforcing in 
its activity. Miiller [?*] sees three ways in which attention 
may be regarded as a reinforcement. It recalls memory 
images which serve to hold the corresponding new im- 
pression in consciousness; it produces an adaptation of 
the sense organ which permits a greater accuracy of ob- 
servation, and it also produces changes in the circulation 
in the sensory centre and makes the nerve more sensitive. 
The physiological side is not developed in detail, so that 
it is not quite clear that a certain amount of inhibition is not 
also provided for in the theory, but the main emphasis is 
clearly put upon reinforcement. 
Wundt [3°] is a little more definite in working out the 
physiological processes. He assigns to the frontal lobes 
the seat of the attention phenomena, and insists that it is 
due to an inhibitory influence which the cells there exert 
upon the other parts of the brain. At the time of attending 
to any one sensation all other processes are excluded, and 
this alone is permitted to come to its full natural strength. 
He admits that there is no physiological objection to as- 
suming that there is reinforcement as well as inhibition 
between the different parts of the cortex, but, as we saw 
in the earlier chapter, he feels assured that attention does 
not increase the intensity of the sensation attended to, but 
merely its clearness, and as it is hard to see how reinforce- 
ment could avoid influencing the intensity, he inclines to 
the opinion that it is safer to regard the entire process as 
one of inhibition. The argument does not seem to be 
entirely valid, for. as was seen in chapter 1, it is by no 
R
-P-A-G-E-252
242 Attention 
means satisfactorily established that attention does not 
increase the intensity of the sensation attended to, and, 
furthermore, it is barely possible that there might be an 
influence of reinforcement exerted by nerve cell upon nerve 
cell which would increase the efficiency of its action, and so 
the clearness of the corresponding sensation, and not in- 
crease its intensity. As was pointed out also in the earlier 
chapter, all the arguments which hold against assuming 
that attention increases the intensity of the stimulus would 
also hold against having it decrease the intensity of all the 
others. It is a relative increase in intensity which offers 
difficulty to the theorist, and this would be present whether 
obtained by increasing the one or decreasing the many. 
Further criticism must be left over until we have an oppor- 
tunity to consider the concrete facts. 
Exner [8] combines the two possible effects in a single 
theory. He points out that we find reinforcement and inhibi- 
tion both going on together all through the nervous system, 
and sees no reason why we should not also use both in our 
explanation of the attention phenomena. He formulates 
his theory of the physiological processes in attention in the 
statement that one set of paths is made much more per- 
meable, while the permeability of all the others is greatly 
decreased. As a result one set of processes is increased in its 
activity, while all others are decreased. He does not dis- 
cuss the probable point of origin of the inhibiting or rein- 
forcing stimulus. 
We can of course decide between theories of this kind 
on the basis of such concrete facts alone as we can find in 
the literature. It is evident from the theories mentioned 
above that it is theoretically possible for either or both pro- 
cesses to be at work, and which is to be actually effective 
must be decided from the experimental evidence at hand. 
Fortunately there have recently been several pieces of 
experimental work that bear upon the problem and will go 
a long way toward deciding it. 
The experimenters who have contributed to the solution
-P-A-G-E-253
The Phystology of Attention 243 
of the question have all been working more or less con- 
sciously to discover a measure of the attention process, 
There have recently been three methods suggested and 
used more or less extensively. The first would measure 
the attention by determining its effects in some concrete 
process which can itself be measured. The activity chosen 
was the discrimination of difference as it is ordinarily 
employed in the experimental verification of Weber’s Law, 
or the quickness of reaction to some simple sensory stimulus. 
Both have been found to be very closely dependent upon 
attention, and any variation in the one can be taken to in- 
dicate a change in the other. 
The second method is more indirect. It consists in 
measuring not the strength of attention itself, but the 
amount of distraction which is necessary to destroy the 
attention to any other process. The method is analogous 
to testing the strength of materials by measuring their 
breaking point. In practice it is probably not easily 
applicable because the only means of distracting atten- 
tion is by attending to something else, so that the method 
in practice is reduced to determining the effect upon one 
attention process of attending to something else at the 
same time. And as any attempt to attend simultaneously 
results merely in an alternation from one thing to another, 
what we get in reality is a measure of the results of attending 
successively to two processes of different kinds. 
The third method makes use of the fluctuations of 
ttention. It will be remembered from chapter v. that 
stimulus of very slight intensity does not persist con- 
inuously in consciousness, but alternately appears and 
isappears. Marbe discovered that the length of time a 
ensation would remain in consciousness depended upon 
Ihe intensity of the stimulus which occasioned it. If the 
rey line on the Masson disc increased in distinctness it 
ould be a relatively longer time in consciousness than 
efore. It occurred to Mr. Taylor [78] that the time during 
hich the line remained in consciousness, or the relative 
       
           
    
   
    
      
    
    
    
   
        
-P-A-G-E-254
244 Attention 
proportion of the time seen to the time not seen, might be 
made to serve as a measure of the adequacy of attention 
under any set of circumstances. When attention was at 
its best it would be seen for a comparatively long time, the 
ratio of the period of visibility to the period of non-visi- 
bility would be comparatively large, and would decrease 
with the adequacy of attention. This method is very easy 
to apply, and gives results that record very slight changes. 
Since Mr. Taylor published, Dr. Wiersma [*°] has applied the 
same method to a study of the influence of fatigue and of 
drugs upon attention. After he had thoroughly con- 
firmed Marbe’s results as to the effect of the intensity of 
the stimulus upon the time of visibility, he showed that 
the period of visibility undergoes very marked changes in 
the course of even a five-minute experiment. There was in 
the case of one man a decrease in the ratio of the time of 
visibility to the time of invisibility from the beginning to 
the end of the period; in the other, first an increase in the 
ratio, due to practice, and then a decrease, as the result of 
fatigue. In both cases the method proved its adequacy as a 
measure of the efficiency of attention. 
Each of these methods, with the possible exception of the 
second, has given us some results which will have a bearing 
upon the general question as to whether reinforcement or 
inhibition is the predominant influence in the physiological 
processes which accompany attention, and the results of 
the attempts to apply the second method have proved 
very valuable, although the method itself has not, shown 
itself to be theoretically well founded. It will probably 
prove most satisfactory to violate the temporal sequence, 
of these theories, and begin with the application of the} 
third and most recent, and then come back later to consider} 
the results of the earlier in its light. 
Three men have published results that have a bearin 
upon the problem as to whether the attention process is on 
of inhibition or reinforcement, using the attention wave a: 
a measure of the adequacy of attention. Dr. Breese [*] 
        
          
     
     
   
   
    
   
    
    
  
-P-A-G-E-255
  The Phystology of Attention 245 
the earliest, looked upon his results as an evidence of inhibi- 
tion, of the effect of one stimulus to decrease the efficiency of 
another, and did not connect it with attention at all. 
Dr. Breese worked with the rivalry of stereoscopic fields as 
the basis of his experiments. It will be remembered from 
chapter v. that when two fields of different colours, or of 
any other two different kinds that appeal almost equally 
to attention, are brought before either eye, there is a 
constant fluctuation between them—now one will appear, 
now the other. If the two colours are complementary, so 
that there is no possibility of fusion to form a third, the 
alternation will come at very regular intervals, and the line 
of division will be sharply marked. The colours chosen 
were red and green. It was found that it was impossible 
to control the rate at which the two colours succeeded each 
other, but that it was possible voluntarily to keep one colour 
in the field for a longer time than the other, and that the 
period for one colour could be influenced in various other 
ways. This is of course entirely in harmony with the 
results obtained on the perception of the grey rings of the 
Masson disc, and, since the time relations are the same, 
would point to the vaso-motor rhythm as the condition of 
the fluctuation. It would seem, then, that just as any 
influence that increases the activity of the central cell 
would make the grey ring of the disc remain in conscious- 
ness for a longer time, so the same factors would tend to 
alter the time relations of the periods of alternation between 
the two colours. This is in harmony with the work of Dr. 
Breese. He found in the first place that one colour could 
be held for a longer time than the normal by an act of will. 
The red could hold the field for sixty-eight per cent of the 
time, as against a normal fifty-three per cent, if one strove 
vigorously to retain it. It was found, however, that the 
essential part of the so-called act of will consisted of making 
vigorous eye movements, and that when these were sup- 
pressed there was practically no difference to be noted 
between the voluntary effects and the normal. It was 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  
  246 Attention | 
found also that the introduction of conscious eye movements 
had exactly the same effect, even when there was no effort 
to hold the colour, and that a drawing upon one surface 
which would tend unconsciously to induce eye movements 
would have exactly the same effect, would retain the field 
upon which the drawings were made. In the same way it 
was shown that varying the colours upon the surface, 
placing a patch of blue upon the red, or surrounding the 
red with a white border, made that colour remain a greater 
proportion of the time. Moving one field while the other 
remained at rest, or increasing the intensity of the light 
which fell upon the one, produced an identical result. 
It is evident that we have to deal here with the effect of 
one sensation or stimulus upon another. Eye movements, 
motion of one field, etc., are all stimuli which call up other 
sensations, and these, by their simultaneous presence in 
consciousness, tend to make stronger one of two other rival 
stimuli which are otherwise very evenly balanced. Dr. 
Breese thinks of the entire process as dependent upon the 
activity of the new stimulus in inhibiting the one which 
seeks to enter consciousness, but it seems much easier to 
regard the process as a reinforcement. Of course the 
matter here reduces to a question of words, for it is as easy 
to think of one as inhibited as of the other as reinforced. 
Introspection, however, seems to show that the red is the 
positive process all through, and that the conscious en- 
deavour so far as it is present tends to hold the red rather 
than to exclude the green. This is even clearer in some 
experiments which have been performed in the laboratory 
of the University of Michigan, but not yet published, which 
show that certain unpleasant stimuli tend to have exactly 
the opposite effect, and to decrease the period in conscious- 
ness of the field that is emphasized, and which is kept in 
consciousness by the pleasant or exciting stimuli which 
Dr. Breese used. Here, then, we would have a reinforce- 
ment of the green if we had previously had an inhibition, 
while if we think of both effects as working upon the red,
-P-A-G-E-257
  The Physiology of Attention 247 
we have an inhibition of that colour. We have inhibition 
and reinforcement in either case, and it seems simpler to 
think of the pleasant or milder stimulus as the reinforcing, 
and the stronger or unpleasant as inhibiting, than to re- 
verse the ordinary relation, and regard the pleasant as in- 
hibiting. This seems even more true when we consider the 
results of work upon the minimal stimuli, where the re- 
lations are those which would normally be expected. 
Mr. Taylor used the grey rings of the Masson disc, but 
made the same use of them as did Dr. Breese of his stereo- 
scopic slides, except that he regarded them definitely as 
a measure of the adequacy of attention under different 
circumstances. In this method, instead of having but two 
stimuli which can enter consciousness, or which are pre- 
eminently favoured, but favoured in equal degrees, there 
was one principal stimulus, the grey rings on the white 
ground, and when they disappeared, only the white 
ground was left, unless the mind wandered off to some 
unrelated stimulus. However, the results in both cases 
seem to show that, just as the rings are favoured 
here, and held in consciousness, whenever conditions 
permit, so one of the colours in the field of vision 
tends to be favoured, and all factors which increase the 
efficiency oi the cerebral activity, tend to hold that in 
consciousness rather than the other. Mr. Taylor’s experi- 
ments are different, too, in so far as he worked not with 
stimuli that were closely connected with the stimuli in ques- 
tion, but with those which were of only general influence. 
His results show that the first effect of a moderate stimu- 
lus was to increase the relative time of visibility. A further 
increase in the intensity of the stimulation (an induction 
current was used as the stimulus) was to decrease the period 
of visibility, and to increase the time of invisibility. Dr. 
Slaughter [*7] found in another investigation that straining 
upon a dynamometer had the same effect as a slight stimu- 
lation in increasing the period of visibility. Accompanying 
these effects upon the adequacy of attention were always
-P-A-G-E-258
  
  248 Attention 
some apparently almost independent effects upon the 
length of the entire attention wave. This we must regard, 
however, as the direct effect of the stimulus upon the vaso- 
motor centre, which is apparently affected by a stimulus 
in the same way that the respiratory or heart rhythm is 
affected. It has nothing to do with the effect of the stimulus 
upon the adequacy of attention, and may vary indepen- 
dently of it. 
We must then picture the effect upon attention as an 
immediate reinforcement or inhibition exerted by the ex- 
citation of the sensory cells in the area for touch upon the 
cells of the cortical area for vision. This process makes 
them more capable of function, and so capable of acting for 
a longer period of time than they act normally. The 
peculiar thing in the results of both Mr. Taylor and Dr. 
Breese is that the effect seems to be selective, and to increase 
pre-eminently the cells which are concerned in the action 
which is desired at the time. The grey dots are always 
affected rather than the white surface, the red field rather 
than the green. This means, of course, merely that the 
reinforcement or inhibition acts upon those cells only which 
are at work in making these two processes prominent. 
Probably part of the reinforcing influences go over to the 
secondary cells which are determining that the grey ring 
or the red field shall occupy the centre of consciousness. ~ 
We have an effect here that seems exactly parallel to the 
reinforcement and inhibition of one motor nerve cell by 
another in the cases discussed in the earlier parts of the 
chapter. Just as we think of the impulse that passes out 
of the cell which controls the left arm as producing an 
increased amount of action in the cell that controls the 
tight arm, so we must think of the activity of one sensory 
cell in the cortex as increasing the activity of the other 
sensory cells merely because it is itself active, or in the 
case of the contraction of the arm in squeezing the dynamo- 
meter that the action of a motor cell has the effect of in- 
creasing the activity of sensory cells as well as of other motor
-P-A-G-E-259
  The Phystology of Attention 249 
cells. There is a possibility, of course, that the effect in 
this case is due to the sensory impressions which come in 
from the muscles, but there is no great difficulty in as- 
suming that motor cells reinforce sensory cells, any more 
thangthat sensory cells reinforce the motor. Whether 
there, be a reinforcement or inhibition seems to depend upon 
the strength of the stimulus in this case, just as in the case 
of the knee-jerk it depends upon the time relations be- 
tween the two phenomena. 
Professor Miinsterberg [9] and Dr. Hamlin [7°] obtained re- 
sults by means of the first method, or by a combination 
of the first and second methods, which seem to be analogous 
to these, although both writers have given them another 
interpretation. They both found that the ability to dis- 
criminate between two slightly different sensations increased 
when the subject was attempting to do something else at 
the same time. Many different senses were investigated, 
and the distraction was given by asking the subject to’ 
perform operations in mental arithmetic, to learn nonsense 
syllables, or count the beats of the metronome. In every 
case it was found that, if there was attention to the judgment 
at all, there was greater accuracy while the distraction was 
operative than if there was no distraction. The simplest 
explanation that offers itself for these results in the light of 
the later investigations is that activity of the cells em- 
ployed in adding, etc., reinforces the activity of the other 
cells, so that they are more adequate to their work than 
when they are in the normal state. The only difference 
between this and the preceding is that the two operations 
are successive, not simultaneous. The adding does not take 
place at the same time as the estimating of differences, but 
comes in the intervals between two judgments. But the 
activity has the same reinforcing effect that the electric 
stimulus which Mr. Taylor used had upon the simultaneous 
attending to the grey rings. Later experiments by Mr. 
Moyer [**] and Miss Birch [*] go to show that if the distraction 
becomes too great there is a reduced accuracy of judgment,
-P-A-G-E-260
    250 Attention 
which would correspond to the inhibition that Mr. Taylor 
found for the stimuli of a greater degree of intensity. 
Successive stimulations of two cells, then, may modify the 
action of each other either positively or negatively, just 
as does the simultaneous stimulation of the two cells. 
Taken together, the results of these experiments go to show 
that the activity of any one sensory cell in the cortex has 
a tendency to increase or decrease the activity of all other 
sensory cells which may be active at the same time, whether 
the two groups of cells be situated in the same sensory areas 
or in areas which are widely separated. The sensory and 
motor areas would, then, seem to be on exactly the same 
level, so far as the question of mutual interaction is con- 
cerned. 
But still we have not solved the question of the physio- 
logical basis for the selective activity of attention. All of 
the effects which we have considered so far would affect the 
entire cortex alike; there would be reinforcement or in- 
hibition, not only of one set of cells, but of all at once. 
We must find some physiological basis for the fact that 
the grey rings only are made more prominent by the 
electric current, or for the fact that it is the red field alone 
which is retained for the greater length of time, and that 
necessarily at the expense of the green. We must con- 
siderably extend our view if we are to obtain an explanation 
of this phase of the phenomenon, although it must be an 
extension of the same general principle, not the introduction 
of anything new in kind. 
If every sensation has an influence upon every other 
sensation, it would only be natural to suppose that it would 
have a more marked influence upon the related sensations 
than upon those which are entirely foreign. And this is 
what we find on the side of consciousness. G. E. Miiller 
lays great emphasis upon this aspect of the problem. In 
the terminology of the day he wrote, he said that mind holds 
one sensation before consciousness by calling up from 
memory other ideas which are related to it, and that these
-P-A-G-E-261
  The Physiology of Attention 251 
serve to retain it. Nicolai Lange, working with the 
fluctuations of attention, obtained very similar results. 
He noticed that if one looks at a figure drawn in ambiguous 
perspective, its form will change as one changes the secondary 
associated ideas in consciousness. The truncated prism 
which we mentioned in chapter v. as constantly changing 
from a concave to a convex figure, seems in the earlier 
changes at least to make the transformation in time with 
the coming and going in consciousness of associated ideas. 
If a receptacle of some kind was thought of the figure be- 
came concave, if a paper-weight was the object expected 
the form became convex. From the physiological side we 
should think of the process as a reinforcement of one set 
of nerve paths exerted by the cells at the basis of the one 
idea in the one case, and with the other in the second. 
As the idea changes, of course there would be a change in 
the nerve cells which are active, and corresponding to that 
a change in the other cells which would be reinforced. The 
idea of the receptacle would make the tendency to see the 
object as concave strongest, while the idea of the paper- 
weight would reinforce the cells at the basis which compel 
the perception of the prism as convex. 
We can run through all the various subjective conditions 
of attention that we have considered earlier, and reduce 
each to some such selective process of reinforcement or in- 
hibition. The first set of conditions, the conscious process 
which had just previously been in consciousness, would act 
by making the path which it had traversed more per- 
meable for a short period after the excitation had died away. 
The tendency to act would not cease at once, but would die 
away gradually, and if one of several stimuli which pre- 
sented themselves tended to excite that path, or set of cells, 
the corresponding sensation would be preferred over the 
others, and would become conscious, while the others would 
be excluded. 
The second great group of conditions would find their 
explanation very much on the same basis as the effect of the
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 Attention 
related ideas in determining the way the figure in ambiguous 
perspective should be seen or interpreted. Not merely 
the paths directly traversed would be made more permeable, 
but the associated or connected paths would have their 
tonus increased, and would be more easily excitable by all 
stimuli which might appeal to them. These stimuli would 
be selected above all others that might be offered. There 
would be a spread of tonus or of reinforcing impulses to 
those cells most closely connected with the impressions in 
question, that would be of the same kind as the spread from 
the electric stimulus to the cells of the cortex as a whole. 
The only difference is that in this case the reinforcement is 
limited in its action, or at least it spreads most completely 
to certain elements, less completely to all of the others. In 
this instance, too, it seems quite possible to assume that 
there is not merely a reinforcement which spreads to one 
set of cells or fibres, but that there is an inhibiting influence 
that goes out to all the other cells in the cortex. This 
would be in harmony with the results of Sherrington for 
motor action, and would also be made possible by the 
known fact that there is an inhibitory effect exerted in 
certain cases by one cell upon another in the sensory areas. 
At the next level of remoteness in the series of conditions 
of attention we would have to introduce a new principle, 
but one that is after all but an extension of those already 
considered. In the circumstances of the hour, the general 
setting of mind at the time, we have merely a whole system 
of paths connecting various nerve cells in a condition of 
tonus, of slight excitement, that makes anything which 
tends to excite any one member of that group take prefer- 
ence over all stimuli which are entirely unrelated. 
Slightly more complicated, but still similar in kind, is 
the explanation of the influence which we found past ex- 
perience, remote as well as recent, to play in any state of 
consciousness. This influence takes two forms. It is in 
part undoubtedly due to the fact that‘the earlier experiences 
tend to organise the cells affected into groups, and so to
-P-A-G-E-263
  The Phystology of Attention 253 
determine the paths along which any reinforcement from 
a given stimulus will extend. But, more than this, we may 
look upon the sensory area in the cortex as in a constant 
state of slight excitation, comparable to the tonus of motor 
cells which holds the muscles contracted as one stands 
erect. What Exner calls the tonus of the sensory nerve 
cells would be constantly exerted upon all the connected 
cells of the group, and would, within limits, control the 
nature of their activity. It would be an expression in 
kind of the nature of the influences that had acted upon 
that cell in the earlier life of the individual. It would be 
the same in quality as that which the cell undergoes when 
the earlier events are consciously recalled to memory, the 
difference would be but one of degree. Just as the original 
activity of the cell would recall, or tend to recall, other im- 
pressions, and its influence would spread as a reinforcement 
to an entire group, so the slighter activity would contribute 
its share in deciding what elements would respond at any 
given time. Where the activity is so slight, the corre- 
sponding influence would be small, but in the mass would 
play its part in determining every later activity. That 
every mental process will have its effect upon all later 
experiences we found to be a fact in an earlier chapter. 
We now see that the fact can be brought into harmony with 
what we know of the action of the nervous system. 
The effect of the social influences which required separate 
treatment psychologically will find its explanation in the 
same physiological principle. They are themselves direct 
sensory stimuli, and the cells which they affected would 
bear the impress for all time in the same way that they retain 
and continue the influences of all other impressions. They 
are merely of earlier growth, and so more deeply rooted than 
the others, and therefore are of larger influence. Hereditary 
effects probably exist in the form of a liabilily to action of 
certain paths in preference to others. They too would 
serve mainly in the organization of the different systems. 
It is very evident from the facts of attention that the
-P-A-G-E-264
254 Attention 
reinforcing and inhibitory impulses which we have been 
considering could not originate in any centre. In the first 
place, it is impossible to think that an isolated centre would 
have any motive for action, or that its action should be in 
any way in harmony with the circumstances of the moment. 
Furthermore, we have seen that the activity of attention 
is too closely related to concrete events of the present and 
of the immediate past to suppose that it is an irresponsible 
and unmotived action, as the reference to a centre of this 
kind would require it to be. Again, we have seen that the 
pathological facts would compel us to assign attention 
to the frontal lobes, and these, anatomy teaches us, are 
nothing more than association areas, areas not for the 
origination of activities of their own, but merely for trans- 
mitting and co-ordinating the activities of the other parts 
of the cortex. : 
If we discard the centre theory as obsolete so far as 
attention is concerned, we find that the facts of psychology 
and physiology can be brought together with comparative 
ease. We have only to think of the frontal association 
centre of Flechsig as providing the lines of irradiation for 
reinforcement and inhibition, as they spread from one 
sensory centre to another. When a sensory area in the 
cortex is excited, it probably not only calls up its direct 
associates in the centres for the other senses through the 
posterior association centre, but there is also a secondary 
effect of reinforcement or of inhibition, which spreads 
through the frontal lobes to more widely scattered areas 
and renders these cells more capable of function. In 
addition to the direct transmission there is a very much 
more widely spread effect that is mediated by the frontal 
lobes, where the different stimuli are received and whence 
they may make connection with all of the other areas, and 
where the many influences of inhibition and reinforcement 
may be co-ordinated before they go out. 
We must also assume, in view of the psychological facts, 
that the various paths gradually become organised into
-P-A-G-E-265
  The Physiology of Attention 255 
systems which are closely related on the nervous side to 
what Stout calls apperceptive systems on the mental side. 
Apparently a group of associatory fibres becomes in the 
course of time so closely connected that when any general 
or specific stimulus arouses one part of the system the other 
parts are thrown into a state of greater or less activity. 
The instant that a locomotive engineer steps into his cab 
the group of impressions from eye, ear, and hand arouses 
a closely-knit set of paths that are thereby at once prepared 
to receive the sensations that belong to his profession, 
which would not be received under ordinary circumstances. 
Usually, of course, these systems are closely interconnected, 
the outer fringes overlap, and the same elements may be 
involved at different times in more than one system. In 
fact we must assume that all parts of all the systems are 
connected with every element of every other, and any ex- 
citation of one will affect all of the others ; it is merely that 
the effect of the different elements of the same systems 
is more marked. Every cell that is active at any time in- 
fluences all other cells, but its activity is exerted most 
strongly upon a certain group, and the influence decreases 
in amount as you get farther away, down to a vanishing 
minimum. In the normal man every act of attention is 
controlled in greater or less degree by the activity of every 
cortical cell. There is no isolation of part from part. In 
pathological cases, however, there is often an apparently 
total separation between systems, in which a system or 
group of systems becomes broken off from the others and 
controls consciousness without reference to any other 
group of experiences. These conditions must be discussed 
in detail later. They serve here to illustrate by contrast 
the closeness of the connection which exists between the 
elements of different systems in the normal man. 
Again, we must assume that there are not only different 
systems, but different levels of systems, in the organisation 
of the nervous mechanism. Systems upon one level would 
control directly the systems at the lower level, just as the
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 Attention 
lower systems control the activity of the single cells. The 
larger, more general, systems would at any time be in com- 
paratively slight activity, while the one subordinate system 
would be in a relatively high state of activity. These 
different levels would correspond in general to the different 
levels of conditions of attention which we have pre- 
viously discussed at length. The physiological differences 
between a man’s brain at one time and another, which 
makes him attend to different things, lie in the differing 
groups of nerve cells which are effective at the two times. 
The difference between two men while dependent in part 
upon the different experiences that each has been subjected 
to, depends in very much larger measure upon the way in 
which their nerve paths are organised, upon the con- 
nections that have been made between the elements of the 
experience. 
Each system, looked at from its physiological side, as 
we are now doing, is made up of a certain number of sensory 
cells together with the associatory cells of the frontal lobes. 
The multiplicity of connections in the different systems is 
made possible by the millions of cells in the association 
centres, which may be regarded as the stations for varying 
the connections between cells and groups of cells. There 
is necessity for this possibility of innumerable connections, 
for each sensory element undoubtedly enters into many 
different systems, is combined at different times in its 
reinforcing action with practically every other cell. Each 
cell in the association centre would probably stand in con- 
nection with many sensory cells, and with many other 
association cells, and thus make possible the great variety 
of connections which we see must be provided. 
The results of Kaes, mentioned in the preceding chapter, 
tend to show that development of these associatory paths 
goes on side by side with the increase in knowledge. Kaes 
found, it will be remembered, that while the association 
centres in the new-born child were entirely non-medullated, 
there was a much greater proportion of fully-developed
-P-A-G-E-267
  The Phystology of Attention 257 
fibres in the adult, and the medullation seemed to increase 
throughout life, or at least up to the beginnings of old age. 
It would be very satisfactory if we could assume that the 
action of the associatory fibres produced the medullation, 
but there is no warrant for this assumption in anything 
that we know of physiology. We must rest content with 
the fact that the development of the nervous system is 
progressive in this respect, and that there is increasing 
possibility of organisation with advancing years and 
experience. 
One further question remains to be discussed, and one 
objection of a theoretical character to be met. The first 
is: “ How does this reinforcement control the course of 
association ?’’ And, secondly, “Is this system of control 
which we have been developing anything more than the 
physiological basis of what is known in psychology as 
association ?’’ An answer to one of these questions will 
involve an answer to the other also. 
Flechsig assumes that the associatory processes take 
place between the different sensory areas in the association 
centres of the parietal and occipital lobes, in the region 
between the visual centre on the one side, and the auditory, 
olfactory, and tactual centres on the other. Lesions of 
these centres are not accompanied by any loss of attention, 
disturbances of personality, or the like, but impressions 
and ideas simply fail to call up their usual associates. The 
interpretation of temporal and spatial relations is disturbed, 
tight use is not made of the different articles which are 
seen or handled, and the direct associatory processes in 
general are impaired. Evidently what we have called the 
relations that constitute the mere objective physiological 
connections have their seat in this area, but we must look 
to the same area that controls attention to external objects 
for the subjective conditions of association, for the more 
general considerations which determine that an unusual 
association shall win against a more usual, a stronger, or 
more frequent. The reinforcing and inhibiting excitations 
s
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 Attention 
which arise in the frontal lobes would not be restricted to 
affecting the cells in their relations to the stimuli which 
come in from the external world, but would also make it 
easier for the excitation coming from another sensory cell 
to arouse this particular cell rather than some other which, 
from the closeness of the connection alone, would be aroused 
just as easily. This influence might exert itself either by 
making some link in the associatory chain more permeable 
than another possible path, or it might directly increase 
the excitability of some sensory area. In either case the 
explanation would be the same fundamentally as for the 
simple sensory attention discussed above. 
The differences between this indirect reinforcing and 
inhibitory effect of one cell upon another and the physio- 
logical process at the basis of association are numerous and 
marked. First, the reinforcement is not the chief factor in 
exciting the cell to activity, but merely modifies the activity 
when it has been aroused in some other way. It is very 
similar in this respect to the difference between direct 
transmission and simple reinforcement between the different 
motor cells in the cord that permit of being studied directly 
by physiological methods. In the second place, the action 
of the cell that exerts the modifying influence need not be 
accompanied by consciousness, in fact in by far the greater 
number of cases it is not conscious at the time that it exerts 
its influence, while the direct incentives in the case of 
association are usually conscious. Thirdly, the cells at 
the basis of the activity of attention are very much more 
numerous than those which are involved in association. 
The reinforcement which affects any act of attention 
involves masses of cells in all parts of the cortex, which 
have been active at all times, past and present, in varying 
degrees—is an expression of slight activities in cells every- 
where—while the association is directly due to a few 
definitely localised cells. Although the two processes 
of association and the reinforcement which is involved in 
attention are alike in that on the physiological side they  
-P-A-G-E-269
The Phystology of Attention 259 
depend upon the mutual action of cell upon cell, the differ- 
ences are sufficiently great to require that they be dis- 
tinguished by different names. 
We are compelled to assume, then, from our present-day 
knowledge of the nervous action and from the psycho- 
logical facts, that attention physiologically is due to the 
reinforcing and inhibiting effect of one group of nerve cells 
upon another group, which makes the group affected more 
easily excited by impressions coming in from the external 
world or from other cells in the cortex. The relative 
excitability of the cell depends upon its relation to other 
cells, either those which are active at the time, which have 
just been active, or which have been active in the past, 
and that the activity of these cells themselves is in turn to 
be explained by earlier excitations of other cells, as well as 
by the conditions of external stimulation at the time. Each 
stimulus is effective not merely during the time that its 
stimulation lasts, but helps in varying amount in the de- 
termination of all later activities of the cells which are in 
any way related to it. — 
We have been assuming throughout that there is both 
reinforcement and inhibition involved in the attention 
process, without, however, definitely deciding between the 
three theories which were mentioned at the beginning of the 
chapter. As we have seen, it would be perhaps easier to 
explain the attention process as one of reinforcement alone, 
but there are facts which make it certain that inhibition 
plays a part at times. A strong stimulus appealing to one 
sense tends to decrease the activity of attention in the other 
senses, and, as Sherrington’s experiments show that every 
motor impulse from the cortex involves both reinforcement 
and inhibition, it seems necessary to assume that with each 
increase in the excitability of one set of cells there goes 
corresponding impulse to decrease the activity of all 
ther cells whose activity could in.any way conflict with 
he effectiveness of the first. But there is certainly no 
‘oom for the assumption of Wundt that attention is an    
         
     
                  
   
   
-P-A-G-E-270
260 Attention 
inhibitory process alone. Not only do Bianchi’s experi- 
ments on monkeys and pathological cases show that the 
frontal lobes do not exert a pre-eminently inhibitory in- 
fluence, but we have positive experimental proof that 
attention may be a reinforcing process. Exner is in this 
respect considerably nearer the truth than any of the other 
writers who have proposed theories. 
Another theory explanatory of attention from the physio- 
logical side uses the circulatory changes which go on 
in the brain during its activity as the principle of explana- 
tion. As was seen in chapter 11., the contraction of the 
blood-vessels in all parts of the body is an invariable con- 
comitant of the attention process. Mosso also proved that 
the volume of blood in the brain increased during the period 
of attention. On the basis of these facts Lehmann has 
attempted to construct a theory that shall explain attention 
in its details. His theory is that the action of any part of 
the brain depends upon its blood-supply, and that the 
portion of the brain which is best supplied with blood at 
any time will be predominant in its conscious activity. 
Attention for him would be entirely a matter of the state 
of the capillaries in different parts of the brain at any given 
time. If a certain area of the optic lobe should happen to 
have its capillaries dilated, attention would be directed to 
some visual impression ; if some part of the auditory tract 
were favoured in the same way, an auditory impression 
would come to consciousness. 
There are three objections to this theory. First, there 
is as yet great doubt as to whether the blood-supply of 
different parts of the cortex changes separately, without 
involving changes of a similar kind in all other parts of the 
brain. There is even some question as to whether the blood- 
supply of the brain varies independently of the other parts 
of the body. There could be no explanation of such selective 
action of parts of the brain, as would be necessary in at- 
tention, on this theory, unless the blood-supply of the 
different areas could change independently. And even  
-P-A-G-E-271
  
The Physiology of Attention 261 
if it could, it seems hardly likely that in an impression 
which involved sensations from several senses a few capil- 
laries scattered here and‘there over the cortex would all 
chance to be dilated orj,contracted simultaneously, even 
if we could assume that it was possible for the blood-supply 
to be so minutely divided as to provide for the separate 
action of the small mass of cells that would correspond to 
seeing the point of the pen at which I look to make sure 
that it is clean, or to any similar minute and qualitatively 
simple object. Secondly, it seems hardly probable that 
the activity of the nerve cells should be so closely dependent 
upon an increase in the blood-supply beyond the normal. 
It seems plausible to assume that under ordinary conditions 
there must always be more blood about the cell than is 
needed for its momentary activity, and that increase in 
the amount of blood available would be in excess of the 
actual demand, just as increase in the proportion of oxygen 
in the air beyond a certain point is of no importance, 
because it is not absorbed.[*?] And, thirdly, the reaction 
time for the vaso-motor system is so slow that it would be 
impossible for attention to follow the contraction in time.* 
There is a further general difficulty with the theory, which 
is that, granting its truth, it still is not sufficient to decide 
that we shall attend to one object not another at any 
particular time. There is nothing in the theory to tell us 
when the blood-vessels of the brain are likely to contract 
or to connect their contraction with anything else. 
That the variations in blood pressure are accompanied 
by changes in the activity of consciousness we have seen in 
* Mosso asserts, loc. cit., that in the case of a patient with exposed 
brain, he has seen the attention completely aroused before the change in 
the colour of the cortex indicated the beginning of increased blood-supply 
to the brain. 
¢_Inhis latest work, ‘‘ Kérperliche Ausserungen Psychischer Zustande.” 
vol. II, pp. 237 ff., Lehmann definitely abandons his vaso-motor theory and 
adopts one that makes attention depend upon the inter-relations of 
psycho-physical units. Since the vaso-motor theory as he presents it is a 
possible theory, and has been held at different times in one form or 
another, it seems well to permit the criticism to stand as first written 
before Lehmann’s last volume appeared.  
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 : Attention 
an earlier chapter, in connection with the attention waves, 
but, as was seen there, it is extremely doubtful if these are 
not produced by irradiations of reinforcing impulses from 
the medullary centres rather than by the direct changes in 
the blood-supply. 
A subordinate physiological theory of which there is a 
first statement in G. E. Miiller, ‘‘ Zur Theorie der sinnlichen 
Aufmerksamkeit,” p. 51, is that there is in attention an 
actual excitement of the sensory nerves, or sensory end- 
organs, that produces actual sensations when no stimulus 
is present, and increases the effect of stimulation when it is 
present. There are cases cited in which there is an after- 
image of an imagined colour, and sensations in the skin, as 
a result of thinking of some one point, so strong as to compel 
one to touch the spot, before there can be certainty that 
no object is in contact with it. Miiller suggests generally 
that there must be a spreading of the nervous process to 
the lower sensory tracts, if not to the sense organ. The 
theory has recently been revived, apparently in ignorance 
of Miiller’s suggestion, by M. D’Allonnes, [7] in a form that 
makes use of the centrifugal sensory fibres that have been 
discovered in the optic nerve at least, and may exist elsewhere. 
The theory in this form is that the excitation spreads over 
these fibres to the sense organ, and there excites the same 
kind of process that is ordinarily excited by the external 
stimulus. 
The theory seems unnecessary, even if we accept unre- 
servedly the existence of the fibres in question. Every pro- 
cess before it becomes conscious must come to the cortex, 
and it seems as easy to assume that the intensifying process 
takes place there immediately as it is to take it out to the 
periphery and back. 
SUMMARY 
1. The physiological processes that are peculiar to at- 
tention are reinforcement, or facilitation, and inhibition. 
2. Reinforcement may be defined as increase in the

activity of one nerve cell by the action of another cell or cells 
not in the direct line of transmission, while inhibition is a 
mutual opposition of two cells in their activity. 
3. The subjective conditions of attention can all be 
paralleled by various forms of reinforcement; the idea in 
mind by the vanishing effect of earlier excitations ; mood 
or purpose by an aura of excitation from some one centre ; 
education and the social factors by the tonic influence of 
remote areas exerted in a manner that reveals the nature 
of the earlier experiences. 
4. It is probable in addition that there is an inhibitory 
influence that renders it more difficult than usual for other 
impressions to enter consciousness.

  CHAPTER XVI 
THEORIES OF APPERCEPTION IN RELATION TO ATTENTION 
E may begin the philosophical and psychological 
explanations with the apperceptive theories, as at 
one time and another every phase of the attention process 
has been treated under the head of apperception. While 
the word has at the present time fallen into disrepute 
because of the many different uses to which it has been put, 
and because in the minds of many it has become synonymous 
with wild and unbased speculation, its history is dignified, 
and, what is of greater importance for our purposes, its 
close connection with the more theoretical aspects of 
attention make its history serve also as a history of the 
attention theories. 
The first to introduce the word apperception into the 
philosophical vocabulary was Leibniz. Leibniz used the 
term to distinguish the clear ideas from the vague perceptions. 
The importance of the distinction can be better understood 
from the outlines of his metaphysical system. The universe 
for Leibniz was made up of thinking units, absolutely 
isolated one from the other, but with the order of their 
presentations established in such a way at creation that 
they should always mirror the events in the external world. 
Each “ windowless monad’”’ gave a kinetoscopic repro- 
duction of the changes in the world as a whole, but because 
of the operation of internal laws, not by virtue of any causal 
connection with the world. 
The monads could be arranged in a series in terms of the 
clearness of their ideas. The dust particles had only the 
264
-P-A-G-E-275
  
Apperception in Relation to Attention 265 
vaguest perceptions; plants and animals possessed per- 
ceptions only, but they became progressively more distinct 
as the animals rose in the scale, while men were endowed 
with clear ideas or apperceptions which reached their maxi- 
mum clearness in the ideas of God. 
In the individual man there was the same distinction. 
One had petites perceptions, indistinct ideas, during sleep 
and the less vigorous periods of mental life. These passed 
over gradually into apperceptions in the more active 
moments of the mental life. Leibniz then placed most 
emphasis upon the use of apperception to denote the clear 
as opposed to the vague ideas. : 
There is an occasional passage which may be read to 
mean that he regarded apperception as in some measure 
dependent upon earlier experiences, as in the passage in 
the ‘‘ Nouveaux Essais,” p. 186 (Gerhart’s ed.), where he 
says, ‘“‘ For all attention requires memory, and often when 
we are not so to speak warned and admonished to take 
notice of some of our present perceptions, we let them pass 
without reflexion, and even without observing ; but if some 
one directs our attention to them, and, for instance, bids us 
notice some sound that had just been heard, we remember 
it, and are conscious that we had some feeling of it at the 
time.” From passages of this kind, and from statements 
that clear perceptions may be made up of many #etites 
perceptions it would seem that Leibniz thought of clear- 
ness as in some degree the result of the interaction of many 
mental elements. 
There is also throughout his work a recognition of the 
part which the disposition of the mind plays in the control 
of general mental processes, that could be quoted in support 
of our own theory. To Locke’s famous dictum, “ Nihil in 
intellectu est quod non prius in sensu,’ Leibniz, it will be 
remembered, added, “‘ isi intellectus ipse.”’ In expanding 
the statement he is constantly likening the mind to a 
block of marble, with veins that foreshadow the figure which 
the sculptor is to carve. The mind, like the marble, has 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
    266 Attention 
certain characteristics which make it easier for the resulting 
product to take one form than another, the resultant per- 
ceptions are in part dependent upon the nature of the mind, 
as well as upon the impressions of sense. 
It must be emphasised, however, that the word apper- 
ception was, in spite of its importance for his general 
theory, never used to designate this state of preparedness, 
but was applied only to the resulting clear ideas. For the 
other uses we must look to later writers who have applied 
the term in ways which Leibniz would not have recognised, 
although in ways that were implied in his theory, and were 
in themselves closely related to his apperception. 
Kant,* the next in the historical line of descent to make 
any considerable use of the term apperception, paid too 
little regard to the phenomena of the concrete conscious- 
ness, at least for the sake of the concrete conscious processes 
themselves, to make any very valuable contribution to the 
theory of apperception, from the psychological side. We 
might, by tracing out similarities and analogies, show 
that very much of Kant’s system could be incorporated 
into a modern psychological system, and that the essential 
features would correspond to what we now designate as 
attention or apperception. In the first place, he insists that 
there can be no effective knowledge without the participa- 
tion of the mind’s own activity, and that an essential part 
of all knowledge comes from within. This process of 
addition or of transformation by inner activity was un- 
conscious in perception and imagination, but became fully 
conscious in thought or thought forms. For this he adopted 
Leibniz’s term apperception. He added transcendental, 
to indicate that it supplied the conditions for there being 
any object at all. He uses the term as descriptive of the 
final unifying activity of the self. The transcendental 
unity of apperception is above the categories of the under- 
standing, and is the force that introduces final harmony 
* The suggestion for this treatment of Kant I owe to Professor 
Muirhead.
-P-A-G-E-277
Apperception in Relation to Attention 267 
into the processes that have already been partially unified 
by the categories and by the forms of space and time. It 
is the final expression of the self, the basis of the unity of 
consciousness, and the ultimate condition of the rationality 
of experience. It must be emphasised that while we may 
read these more modern psychological views into his 
system, and find confirmation for them in his doctrine, 
Kant himself explicitly denies the relevancy of psychological 
processes in the individual mind to the development of 
knowledge. Nevertheless, there are passages where he 
shows that the psychological processes were not so unim- 
portant in his regard as he in general asserts them to be. 
The elements in Kant’s theory that have made his discussion 
important for the history of apperception are, first, that 
he, like Leibniz, makes apperception the most complete 
and perfect form of consciousness, the most adequate ex- 
pression of man’s mind; and in the second place, his state- 
ment that this unifying activity is something which is 
entirely spontaneous to the mind itself, something that is 
enforced upon the materials of experience from above, and 
is not derived from the materials of experience. 
The great prophet of apperception in the history of 
philosophy is Herbart. With him apperception becomes 
not an incidental phase of psychology, but is the funda- 
mental principle of the entire system. If Kant’s mind 
was a monarchy in which the lower was always subject to 
the higher, and all to the sovereign transcendental unity 
of apperception, Herbart described the mind as a democracy 
in which all laws were derived from the governed and all 
control was exercised by the separate elements themselves. 
The universe for Herbart was composed of reals, elements 
mot subject to change, but which by their interactions gave 
rise to all change. The human mind is one of these reals, 
and ideas arise originally from the attempt of the ego to 
protect itself against the other reals which constitute the 
external universe. Abandoning this point of view as he 
develops his more definitely psychological theories, he
-P-A-G-E-278
    268 Attention 
carries the analogy over to the relation between the different 
ideas in mind. Ideas, like the reals, are centres of force 
which by their mutual action and reaction produce and 
‘control consciousness. If two ideas of the same kind come 
together in consciousness they mutually help each other, 
and each persists in greater strength than it would have 
had alone, while if the two ideas are at any time in oppo- 
sition they mutually tend to destroy one another, and the 
resultant is the force of the one minus the force of the other. 
All ideas influence each other in this way, and consciousness| 
at any moment is determined in its nature by the balance 
between the conflicting and reinforcing ideas. In practice} 
there are always many ideas in mind that claim recognition, 
These may, for convenience, be divided into two genera 
classes : those already in mind, and those which are comin; 
in or which seek to come in. The older ideas are always i: 
the majority, and so become the dominant or active element: 
in determining consciousness, and are therefore spoken 0: 
as the apperceiving ideas. The newly-entering ideas are 
on the whole, subordinate or passive, and are known a 
the apperceived elements or masses. Mind, then, is th 
resultant of the effects of the apperceiving and the apper. 
ceived masses. A new idea to receive recognition must bi 
in harmony with the ideas already present, must be i 
some way connected with the earlier experiences of th 
individual. In Herbart’s often-quoted instance, schoo! 
boys who are listless and inattentive during the routine o: 
class instruction become at once interested as the maste! 
begins to tell a story. The ideas already in mind hold n 
relation to the matter of the lesson, and so are hostile to it 
but as soon as the story begins ideas are offered which stan 
in close relation to the daily life of the hearers—there ar 
other ideas in mind ready to receive and facilitate th 
entrance of the new. As a consequence attention i 
awakened, the boys are alert, and the entire room still 
except for the words of the tale. So in general what sh 
be perceived, what shall enter mind at any time, depend     
             
       
   
   
        
      
   
      
       
   
   
-P-A-G-E-279
  Apperception in Relation to Attention 269 
almost entirely upon the ideas which are already present. 
Of course, what are the apperceived ideas at one moment 
may become the apperceiving ideas at the next. The ap- 
perceived impression, therefore, is said to react upon the 
apperceiving mass in much the same way that the apper- 
ceiving reacts upon the apperceived. This aspect of the 
process is, however, subordinated to the other. The im- 
portant part is that the course of the mental states at any 
moment is largely determined by the perceptions of the 
periods that had preceded it. It may be regarded as the 
essential feature of the Herbartian psychology, and is the 
point that has been most elaborated upon by his followers 
both in psychology and in pedagogy, and has been the 
most fruitful conception of his entire system. 
Another point of considerable theoretical interest, and 
one which is characteristic of the later developments in 
psychology, is that feeling and will are made subordinate 
to the ideas, and grow out of their interactions in much the 
same way as the other mental processes. While with 
Leibniz, idea and will are on the same level, unless indeed 
the ideas were subject to the will, and for Kant the spon- 
taneity of the mind dominates everything else, for Herbart 
all voluntary action, as all voluntary thought, is entirely 
subordinated to the ideas and their mutual interaction. 
Feeling, too, has no independent place, but depends entirely 
upon checking or reinforcing strains that go on between 
the ideas in mind at the time. In general, then, Herbart’s 
system depended entirely upon the interactions and mutual 
relations between the elementary ideas which are in mind 
at any time. Everything else is derived from and is sub- 
ordinate to them. : 
The last statement of a doctrine of apperception in any 
comprehensive form has been made by Wundt. In large 
measure Wundt combines the position of both Leibniz and 
Herbart, although the starting-point is almost entirely 
derived from Leibniz, with suggestions of modifications by 
Kant, rather than from Herbart. The fundamental mark
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 Attention 
of apperception for Wundt is the clearness of the idea. We 
find in consciousness at any moment that certain processes 
are clear and distinct—stand out for themselves against 
the others, which serve only as a background. These ideas 
are fully in consciousness, are apperceived, while all others 
are merely perceived. To repeat his well-known metaphor, 
consciousness is like the field of vision. There is a clearest 
point in the centre in which everything is sharply defined, 
and the details are all well marked. About that clearest 
point is a region of gradually increasing vagueness of outline, 
until we reach the limits of the visible area. Similarly in 
consciousness we have a point of greatest clearness, and 
about it a large area of indistinct ideas. The point of 
clearest consciousness can be made to wander over the whole 
of the field in very much the same way that the eye can 
be moved over the field of visible objects in the external 
world. An idea that is confused at one instant may become 
distinct the next, and at the same time the idea that held 
the centre of consciousness becomes less clear, and finally 
disappears from mind altogether. Entrance into the field 
of vision in consciousness is perception, while entrance into 
the field of clearest ane of consciousness constitutes ap- 
perception. 
So much of Wundt’s theory is purely Leibnizian. The 
next phase to be considered is in one aspect more nearly 
Kantian, in another more Herbartian. This deals with the 
problem of the conditions of the clearness of the ideas. 
When speaking in general terms, Wundt talks almost as if 
there were a faculty or force of apperception, something 
behind and superior to consciousness, which brings about 
the change in the clearness of the impressions. There is in 
the brain a definite centre of apperception, and in conscious- 
ness a force very closely related to will, that in and of itself 
chooses certain ideas for elevation to the high places of 
consciousness, and equally arbitrarily rejects others. It 
is very much like the self-conscious unity of apperception 
of Kant, which gives the final form and order to the various
-P-A-G-E-281
  Apperception in Relation to Attention 271 
disconnected elements of mind, and is in so far something 
entirely inexplicable, a factor in experience that must be 
assumed without any further discussion of its nature, origin, 
or laws of action. This is the theory which comes out most 
clearly in his latest works and in those passages where he 
makes no attempt at an analysis. Closely related is his 
recent tendency to go over to a doctrine that would make 
the will fundamental in consciousness as it was for Fichte, 
Schopenhauer, and von Hartmann. He recognises, how- 
ever, that this is but a concept, and as such has no place in 
psychology. His endeavour is to keep to concrete con- 
sciousness, but to insist that concrete consciousness is more 
like what we ordinarily know as will than anything else. 
There is another phase in the discussion of the problem 
of apperception as condition which partakes much more of 
the character of Herbartianism than of Kantianism. This 
would make apperception, or the coming of ideas to clear 
consciousness, due rather to the previous experience of the 
individual. Wundt makes this side of his doctrine most 
prominent when discussing the conditions of attention. 
In that connection he insists that one of the factors which 
decide which idea shall come to mind is to be found in the 
ideas that were in mind just before the act of attention, 
and in a more general passage he states that apperception 
is determined in large part by the previous experience of 
the subject. If we attempt to combine this view with the 
one above, it would seem very much as if we were to think 
of apperception as a bearer and communicator of experi- 
ences. Apperception in that case would not be the un- 
conditioned determinant of attention, and so of con- 
sciousness, but would itself be in part determined by ex- 
perience, or might be said to act as an intermediary between — 
the experiences of the past and the mental processes of the 
present. Apperception as a whole, then, would seem to be 
the permanent, fundamental conscious process. It is the 
basis which persists throughout the changes of conscious- 
ness, and the source of whatever spontaneity we grant  
-P-A-G-E-282
    272 Attention 
consciousness, but it is not entirely unconditioned, for it is 
itself subject to the experiences of the individual, and so 
must conform to them. Through the modifications which 
the experiences exert upon apperception they also must be 
regarded as influencing the mental processes. 
The sign or the accompaniment of the activity of apper- 
ception is the “‘ feeling of activity.” As regards the mean- 
ing of this feeling also there are two interpretations of 
Wundt’s position possible. In the earlier works, where 
more stress is laid upon its analysis, it seems to be made up 
entirely of strain sensations, but in his ‘‘ Grundriss der 
Psychologie” he leans very strongly to the view that this 
feeling is in part at least sui generis, and is to be regarded 
as the immediate coming to consciousness of the workings 
of the will, or of apperception used as a name for the causes 
of the changes which go on in consciousness rather than 
for the changes themselves. 
For Wundt apperception has a very large place in con- 
sciousness. Although it is primarily the term for the coming 
to clear consciousness of certain ideas or groups of ideas, it 
becomes soon the condition of this change, or the some- 
thing which stands behind and produces the change. 
From this meaning its use is extended to the process that 
controls the course of ideas. As passive apperception it is 
at least a permissive factor in directing associations, and in 
the active form it governs the “‘ apperceptive combinations,” 
which include judgment, reason, and some of the higher 
forms of imagination. On the other side apperception is 
made the fundamental fact in the feeling processes. Feeling, 
for Wundt, is nothing more than the coming to conscious- 
ness of the activities of apperception. Apperception is also 
closely related to will, if we are not to regard apperception 
as the genus under which will and attention are the two 
species. In the earlier works this view is taken, while in 
the later, “ will” tends to become the more general of the 
two terms. Wundt’s uses of the term apperception include 
all of the activities that we have ascribed to attention.
-P-A-G-E-283
Afpperception in Relation to Attention ove 
Since Wundt there have been two diverging lines in the 
development of the theory of apperception. Professor 
Miinsterberg, in his earlier and more experimental work, 
charged Wundt with implying in the term apperception a 
mental faculty, a metaphysical something that was beyond 
the range of our experience and about which we could know 
nothing. To this Wundt replied that he did not use the 
term to designate any ‘‘ metaphysical completion of ex- 
perience,” but merely applied the word to certain definite 
and well-marked phenomena of consciousness, and that 
the line of distinction between it and all other conscious 
processes was sharp enough to warrant the ascription of 
a separate term. It must be confessed that there is one 
line of statements in Wundt’s earlier works which would 
warrant Miinsterberg’s objections. But, as has already 
been pointed out, these may be in large measure explained 
as due to the necessity for using a shorthand expression in 
referring to a process which has already been analysed in 
another connection. In all the passages in these earlier 
works in which there is any attempt at description or 
analysis there is no doubt that it is the actual concrete 
mental processes which are referred to. 
In the later works of both writers, however, it is clear 
enough that there is an element brought in which they do 
not now so definitely call apperception, but which covers 
very much the same phenomena, and which is definitely 
asserted to be something behind the conscious states and 
more permanent. Wundt meets the necessity for some- 
thing that shall be more stable by asserting that the per- 
sistence of effects in consciousness can be most easily under- 
stood if we regard mind as, in its essentials, like will in the 
popular use of the term. This fundamental extra-conscious 
force becomes then the bearer of all other conscious states, 
and the basis of explanation for everything that cannot easily 
be explained from empirical data. Professor Miinsterberg 
has shifted his position with equal completeness, and, 
whereas ten years ago he contended that one could never 
T 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
274 : Attention 
explain anything in consciousness by an unknown element 
outside of consciousness, he now insists that all consciousness 
is but the manifestation of the unknown will which is never 
seen and never can be recognised for itself, that mind in 
all its phases is but the working of this meta-empirical 
something and constitutes the only explanation of any state 
which shall have the least claim to be final. This is the 
exact counterpart of the apperception of Wundt as he in- 
terpreted it in his earlier polemic. Both have entirely 
changed their original positions and both are united in 
upholding what they previously condemned. 
One other writer who has made notable contribution in 
recent years to the doctrine of apperception is Professor 
Stout. Dr. Stout’s theory has entirely changed its char- 
acte- in the period that has elapsed between his earlier and 
his later writings. In the earlier work, “The Analytic 
Psychology,’’ he held an essentially Herbartian position, 
while in the later “ Manual of Psychology ” he has dropped 
the term apperception entirely and employs the word 
conation instead in a meaning not essentially different 
from Wundt’s earlier use of the term apperception. The 
main advance that Stout has made over his predecessors 
in the doctrine of apperception is in introducing the term 
“systems of apperception.” In brief, this consists in 
picturing the different elements which by their interaction 
were for Herbart the determining factors in mind as in- 
fluencing each other as groups, not as separate individuals. 
He pictures the different processes of mind as standing in 
very much the same relation to each other as do the in- 
dividuals in a society. Different men will combine for a 
definite purpose without thereby losing their individuality, 
or in any way impairing the possibility of entering into other 
combinations at another time. From one point of view 
a man may be a member of a political party, from another 
he may belong to a certain church, while from still another 
he may be a lawyer or a doctor. Membership in one organ- 
isation does not in the least interfere with any of the other  
-P-A-G-E-285
Afpperception in Relation to Attention 275 
activities. But we cannot work actively in more than 
one connection at the same instant. “Brutus in the 
office of magistrate ceases to be a father. In like manner, 
mental elements which share in the activity of one mental 
system, are for the time being disabled from acting either in 
any other systematic combination or independently. When 
we are engrossed in writing or speaking about some serious 
topic, it does not occur to us, unless we are inveterate 
punsters, to play upon the words we use. When we are 
interested in a game of billiards, the idea of the billiard 
balls does not set us thinking about the trade in ivory and 
African slavery.” Our mental states, like our social re- 
lations, are grouped in this way about certain points or 
centres of reference, and form, for the time being, more or 
less complete units. They may aid each other or oppose 
‘each other according to the nature of the systems to which 
they belong or to their own relations, but they always act 
as units towards each other, and in reference to the materials 
which are entering mind. When thinking about one set 
lof objects everything is influenced by consideration of that 
articular kind of process; everything which comes into 
ind must have some relation to that particular system. 
rom this point of view Stout’s theory of mind is different 
rom Herbart’s only in that he gives a more complex and 
omplete organisation. But there are other differences 
hich are even more fundamental between the two systems. 
n the first place, the groups are not, or may not be, made 
p of ideas actually in mind, but may include as well dis- 
ositions or traces left over in a vague form from some 
revious experience, which has long since vanished. Again, 
e are not able to think of the groups as consisting of 
olated elements, but they merely constitute ways in which 
ind as a whole may act. An apperceptive system is 
t so much an aggregation of elements as it is a phase 
aspect of the total activity of mind. Thirdly, apper- 
ption is not complete in itself as it was for Herbart, but 
can only explain it if we consider it in relation to the     
      
    
    
    
    
    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-286
276 Attention 
active will element which Mr. Stout calls conation. Conation 
is defined very much as Wundt defines will or apperception 
in the active sense, as something which is not outside of, 
or superior to consciousness, but is merely a name for the 
fact that consciousness is always changing, or as he puts it, 
is moving towards an end. It is a term which is to cover 
the phases of consciousness which imply searching for some 
preconceived end, and is to include the mental states in 
which there is a striving successfully or unsuccessfully 
toward the attainment of some goal. Here we have the 
most complete statement which he gives us of an attempt 
to harmonise Wundt and Herbart. But it must be con- 
fessed that the exact relation between them is left rather 
indefinite and hazy. There is no very distinct line drawn 
between conation and apperception, nor any very close 
statement of the part which each is to play. They are 
rather affirmed side by side than reconciled, in spite of the 
fact that either alone is sufficient to explain the whole 
series of processes. It seems rather an attempt to keep 
spontaneity and at the same time to recognise the fact that 
everything in mind is capable of explanation. The posi- 
tion finally assumed gives one the impression that it has 
resulted from a tendency to vacillate from one view to the 
other, owing to a disinclination to give up either, rathe 
than to be the consistent working out of a preconceive 
and well defined system. This becomes even more eviden 
from the omission of the term apperception and th 
substitution of conation altogether in the “ Manual o 
Psychology,” the later work. There the pendulum seem 
to have swung entirely to the side of spontaneity, or at leas 
the opposing view has been so far subordinated that t 
peculiar term has disappeared. 
If we attempt in conclusion to bring the scattered threa 
from the history of apperception together into some co: 
sistent whole, we are met by the difficulty that the ter 
has had at least three distinct meanings in modern phil 
sophy and psychology. It is aname for a state of clearn 
        
   
    
   
     
     
   
    
-P-A-G-E-287
  Apperception in Relation to Attention 277 
in the ideas, for a form of organisation‘of mind which results 
in that clearness, and for something outside of the con- 
sciousness which is the condition of that, distinctness. 
This last use as a condition of the change in the clearness 
of the ideas varies between a deus ex machina that is entirely 
outside of the mind or experience and an idea nearly identi- 
cal with the second use of the term as a plan of organisation 
of mind. 
It is evident that consistency requires that these different 
uses be combined, or that some of them be discarded if the 
word apperception is to be kept in psychological nomen- 
clature at all. The first difficulty comes from using the 
same term for the cause and for its effects ; for the state of 
clearness of the ideas and for the conditions which induce 
that state. The only means of avoiding this ambiguity 
is by an agreement to use the term in one sense only. His- 
torically any use can be justified, but since we already have 
the termperception, or clear perception, for the state, it seems 
very much better to retain the word as the condition of the 
clearness. 
When we come to choose between the other two uses, 
between apperception as something meta-empirical, above 
consciousness, and as a word for a method of organising 
consciousness or of a set of relations within consciousness, 
we are dealing at once with a matter of fact and with a 
theory to explain the facts and a decision can not be so 
easily reached. There are three possible theories as to the 
nature of these conditions. Either we can say that past 
experience alone and directly accounts for the present 
clearness of the ideas in question, or that there is a some- 
thing behind consciousness which arbitrarily decides which 
idea is to be clear and what others are to be excluded from 
consciousness, both without reference to anything else 
that has happened to the individual or to any other con- 
sideration whatsoever ; or thirdly, we can combine the two 
theories and assume that there is something behind which 
is the immediate determinant of the change in consciousness, 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 Attention 
but which is itself in turn dependent in part at least, upon 
the earlier experience of the individual. 
Every one admits that nothing outside of consciousness 
can serve as an explanation of the events in consciousness, 
at least for psychology. But every one also seems to feel 
that the easiest explanation, if it only were an explanation, 
is to think of mental states as determined in some way by an 
external agent that we call conation, apperception, or will, 
rather than to think of it as self-determining. This is 
evidenced by the constant fluctuation from one theory 
to the other which we have seen on the part of the last 
three writers examined. 
The only decision that can be reached is in the light of the 
facts of consciousness itself. All that we can say from that 
standpoint is that consciousness changes in certain ways | 
and that the present changes bear a definite relation to the 
past changes and earlier states of consciousness. If we | 
disregard entirely the non-psychological questions we can 
perhaps cut the Gordian knot by saying that apperception 
is the name for the fact that any event in consciousness is 
different in some degree from what it would have been had 
the preceding history of the individual in question been 
different, while everything else in his present environment 
remained the same. Apperception would then be merely 
the general term for condition of attention, the name for 
one relation between observed facts. For psychology, too, 
it is a matter of indifference whether we think of the earlier 
experiences as acting upon present mental states directly 
or through the mediation of an unknown third process. 
If we interpose a bearer which we picture as receiving the 
experiences, retaining them in some way, and then con- 
trolling the later conscious states in the light of them, we 
gain nothing but a metaphor. The ¢ertiwm quid can never 
be directly perceived. All that we can know is that the 
first impression is received and that the others are modified 
by it. The remainder of the process is hidden, and little 
is to be accomplished by speculating concerning it.

  Apperception in Relation to Attention 249 
SUMMARY 
1. Theories of apperception in the history of philosophy 
have dealt with mental processes which are closely allied 
to attention—in fact, nearly every phase of attention has at 
one time or another been related to apperception. 
2. The first use of the word apperception is in Leibniz, 
to indicate the clear as opposed to confused ideas. 
3. In Kant apperception is the term applied to self- 
activity as the supreme determinant of mental operations, 
of the knowing process. 
4. With Herbart we find the term applied to the deter- 
mination of consciousness from within consciousness—as 
the word applied to the interaction of ideas, the forces that 
ultimately decide what shall enter mind. 
5. Wundt in a measure combines the three preceding 
theories. Apperception is the process of clearing up ideas, 
but is also the supreme mental activity that produces the 
clearness, and is in this sense, in part, determined in its 
operations by earlier experiences. 
6. Professor Stout, the last to make a contribution, is 
an Herbartian, with the addition thatthe ideas or experiences 
are organised and act in systems to control all mental 
processes. 
7. Apperception then coincides in the main with attention, 
but must be regarded as a name for a process.or group of 
processes, not as a thing, or a single force.

CHAPTER XVII 
HISTORY AND CRITIQUE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL 
THEORIES OF ATTENTION 
N this chapter I shall endeavour to treat those theo- 
ries of attention which are neither apperceptive nor 
physiological in their nature. Many of them, of course, 
have an apperceptive and nearly all have a physiological 
aspect, but in all, the predominant factors are to be found 
under neither head. There will be no attempt to follow 
any chronological order or to do full justice to all of the 
phases of any one theory. Our purpose is rather to find 
historical instances of the different possible forms that a 
theory of attention may take, than to give an exhaustive 
enumeration of the theories or to state completely those 
chosen as representatives of the different tendencies. 
There is one general characteristic of all the theories of 
this group. They are alike in raising some part of the 
attention process to the rank of a general condition or cause. 
We find that attention has been said to be an intense sensa- 
tion, that it is the result of interest, is due to feeling, is 
caused by movements of various kinds, and is produced by 
the direct action of the will. Each of these must be ex- 
amined in the light of the facts, in the hope that we may be 
able to assign it its proper place in a more embracing theory. 
We have already mentioned most of these views in con- 
nection with our treatment in the earlier chapters, but not 
with definite reference to the validity of the explanations 
themselves. The previous examination of the facts should 
make it easier to deal with them in detail.

Psychological Theories of Attention 281 
The first and simplest which we need to consider owes 
its first satisfactory formulation to James Mill.[7] It makes 
the intensity of the stimulus for the sensation and the 
strength of the association for the idea the only condition 
of its coming to consciousness and of its clearness when it 
becomes conscious. If an idea is intense or interesting— 
and interesting is for Mill the equivalent of being strong— 
it will succeed in getting into mind. In his formulation, 
attending to the idea and having it are identical. This is 
to make what we classified as the objective conditions of 
attention the only ones which need to be considered. If it 
were necessary to refute Mill’s theory at this stage in the 
history of psychology, it could be done most simply by point- 
ing to the fact that weak ideas are frequently preferred to 
strong ones. If more emphasis is placed upon the statement 
that the interest of the idea is responsible for its entrance, 
and interest is interpreted in the ordinary sense and not 
as being another name for the intensity of the stimulus, 
as Mill seems to take it, we have again not furthered our 
explanation very much. As we saw in a preceding chapter, 
interest is not an independent attribute of an idea, but is 
simply another way of saying that a sensation is likely to be 
attended to. It does not at best help us out in explaining 
the attention process. In short, Mill has raised an occasional 
and even unusual condition of attention to the rank of 
a general explanation. 
Ribot [9] is the most important representative of the view 
that attention is fundamentally a motor phenomenon. 
He enumerates the list of movements and the changes in 
movement which accompany every act of attention, and 
finally concludes from the frequency, of the appearance that 
it is movement which is the ultimate cause of attention. 
He divides these movements into three classes: effects 
upon the vaso-motor system, respiratory effects, and 
changes in the voluntary muscles. Attention, he says, 
consists very largely in the accurate adaptation of the sense 
organ, in a checking of breathing and of all other movements 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 Attention 
that can in any way interfere with the perfection of atten- 
tion, and finally of changes in the blood-supply which will 
send a greater amount of blood to those parts of the brain 
which are in a state of activity. Attention, Ribot tells us, 
is in many cases an inhibition, but in by far the greater 
number of cases it is an inhibition of movements rather 
than of cerebral states. Essentially, then, we would say 
on this view that what we call attention in looking in- 
tently at an object is nothing else than the fixed position 
of the body, the accommodation and converging of the eyes, 
the checking or momentary cessation of respiration, and 
' the contraction of the smaller arteries which accompanies 
the entire process. True, he says, that this state is finally 
due to interest, but interest is a feeling or emotion, and this 
too is traced in its turn to movements or tendencies toward 
movement in some part of the organism. 
Ribot’s theory naturally gives rise to two questions. 
The first is a question of fact. Do the movements precede 
or are they even exactly concomitant with the attending ? 
Granting this, and that they are also essential, will the 
movements in themselves suffice for an explanation? No 
one can deny that the movements are always found accom- 
panying the attending process, and that they are very im- 
portant. But our question is, Are they the most important, 
the fundamental phenomena? In the first place, it seems 
very doubtful if the movements can be said invariably to 
precede or even accompany attending. When we raise 
our eyes from the book to look at a clock we would be said 
to be attending during the interval which elapses before the 
eyes can adjust themselves to the new distance, an operation 
that takes an appreciable time if the clock be at any con- 
siderable distance. We have a blurred image in the mean- 
time, it is true, but that occupies the centre of consciousness 
—is attended to as much as the clear image of the clock 
face that succeeds it. There must even have been an image 
of the clock in mind before we raised the eyes from the 
page, or the movements themselves would not have taken  
-P-A-G-E-293
    Psychologual Theories of Attention 283 
the proper direction. This standing in the centre of the 
field of consciousness in itself constitutes attention. Some 
such image must precede all movement of the eyes, as has 
been definitely stated in Wundt’s law of eye movements. 
The same objection holds with even greater force in the 
case of the circulatory phenomena, particularly with refer- 
ence to the contraction of the arteries. This reflex, like all 
reflexes of the sympathetic system, is relatively very slow. 
It takes from two and one half to three seconds for the con- 
traction to begin to show itself after the stimulus has been 
applied. It is certainly absurd to say that attention lags 
as far as this behind the stimulus which calls it out. A 
trained fencer will have made and parried several thrusts 
before the blood-vessels would have time to respond to the 
first stimulus. On the whole it seems very doubtful if the 
temporal relations between the movements and the clearing 
up of the ideas is such as to warrant the statement that the 
one is the cause of the other. 
Neither does movement seem to be essential to the atten- 
tion in all cases. At least a very prominent movement may 
be lacking during the attention process without entirely 
changing its nature. Helmholtz, as was seen in an earlier 
chapter, found it possible to attend to different parts of the 
field of vision when it was impossible that his eyes moved. 
Here, certainly, the most constant and frequent accom- 
paniment of visual attention was absent and attention 
persisted unchanged. It may be granted that there were 
undoubtedly other elements of the normal complex of move- 
ments going on, but if attention is movement and that 
alone, it would hardly seem that so important a factor in the 
usual complex could be missing without profoundly changing 
the entire process. 
Again, even if we assume that the thesis is proved com- 
pletely, what does it tell us of the nature of attention or of 
its real conditions? Does it make it any more possible 
to decide whether a given man in a given mood is likely to 
attend to one object rather than to another ? Does it explain
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 Attention 
the differences in attention which we find in different in- 
dividuals, and in the same individual at different times ? 
To all of these questions it can give no answer. There is 
nothing in the theory to say when these wide-spread motor 
disturbances are to occur, or which movement is likely to 
produce any particular kind of attention. Both of these 
problems must be faced before the theory can expect to have 
any great value as an explanation of the attentive phenomena. 
The incentive to the theory seems to have come indirectly 
from the popular tendency to regard the activity which 
accompanies the attention process as its cause. In dis- 
cussing the feeling of effort in an earlier chapter we saw that 
it can be analysed into strain sensations which arise from 
the contraction of muscles in different parts of the body. 
If we start with the assumption that the feeling of activity 
is the cause of attention, then we are logically driven to 
the explanation which Ribot gives of its origin. Move- 
ment, the real basis of the feeling of activity, would be the 
true cause of attention. We have shown at some length that 
this primary assumption is fallacious, and so Ribot’s entire 
theory falls to the ground. 
Of similar character, but stated in a form that makes it 
more difficult to advance facts either for or against it, is 
the Aktionstheorie of Miinsterberg.[*] It might be called an 
incipient movement theory. Briefly stated, it is that each 
sensory nervous process becomes conscious only as it goes 
over into motor paths, although the discharge need not be 
great enough to produce movements. The vividness of a 
sensation depends upon the degree of excitation that it pro- 
duces in the motor or efferent nerve paths. Most of the 
objections that were raised against the Ribot theory would 
hold as well against Miinsterberg, with the exception that 
no one knows whether all sensory processes do thus pro- 
duce centrifugal effects, and therefore we can know nothing 
of their time relations if the theory is valid. Like the former 
theory, however, it would, if true, give no explanation of 
the likelihood of attending in advance of the process, and
-P-A-G-E-295
Psychological Theories of Attention 285 
there is no explanation in the theory as to why the vividness 
should depend upon the centrifugal effect of the stimulus. 
We may then pass it over as a degenerate form of the motor 
theory, with the remark that it is another instance of the 
author’s taking back without evidence a theory that he 
himself banished from psychology on evidence. It will 
be recalled that Miinsterberg gave the death-blow to the 
sensation of innervation in his ‘‘ Willenshandlung.” 
A third theory of attention which has found very general 
acceptance in competent circles is that attention is condi- 
tioned by the feeling—that the pleasantness or unpleasant- 
ness of the stimulus decides whether it is to be attended to 
or denied admission to consciousness. Typical representa- 
tives of this theory are Bain in England, Horwicz and Stumpf 
in Germany, and Ribot in France, although, as we have already 
seen, the latter reduces the feelings in turn to movement. 
Bain’s theory is closely related to Ribot’s so far as the 
statement of facts is.concerned. He too insists that there 
is a motor element in every mental process, however ab- 
stract. The will acts through the motor element in con- 
trolling the entrance of the ideas. But it all goes back 
ultimately to feeling, for the will, whether exerted in con- 
trolling the ideas and the entrance of sensations, or in 
directing bodily movement, is entirely under the influence 
of the feelings. All will is derived from the fundamental 
fact of animal life that the pleasant is sought and the un- 
pleasant avoided. The ordinary attentive consciousness 
is thus dependent only indirectly upon feeling, but there 
is another case which, although rarer, shows the immediate 
effect of the feeling. This is found in those cases of emo- 
tional excitement when the feeling accompaniments of the 
sensation control the course of ideas even in spite of the 
will. In either case the control of attention goes back 
to the fact that we seek the pleasant and avoid the painful. 
Feeling is the final determinant of attention. Ribot’s 
theory is different from Bain’s only in the part of the pro- 
cess which each makes of primary importance. Bain makes
-P-A-G-E-296
286 : Attention 
feeling act through will and movement, Ribot makes move- 
ment act indirectly through feeling. 
Horwicz is even more explicit in making feeling the 
controlling process.. “ The attention, which we regard as 
essential to perception, actually follows ‘the feelings, and 
the coming to clear consciousness of external stimuli is 
absolutely dependent upon the feelings.” [3] The basis for 
this statement is again that the attention process is nearly al- 
ways accompanied by a feeling, usually pleasant. Stumpf [**] 
is as strenuous for identifying feeling and attention. But 
he means by his statement only that the conscious phase 
of attention is the feeling of interest and that interest in 
itself is always pleasant. He traces the conditions of 
attention to other factors than feelings, and describes its 
results in consciousness in very much the way that we do. 
In the second volume of his work he still further modifies 
that statement to make it apply to passive attention alone, 
and admits that the will can hold the attention upon dis- 
agreeable impressions in certain cases. [**] 
To decide as to the value of the feeling theory also we 
must appeal directly to the facts of consciousness. We 
must put the same questions that we put before. Do 
feelings precede the attention in time? Are they essential 
to the attending process? Should we have a satisfactory 
explanation of attention if we admitted that the atten- 
tion process was always preceded or accompanied by a 
feeling of one kind or another? In answering these ques- 
tions we must distinguish two uses of the word feeling. 
One, the more ordinary, includes only pleasure and pain, 
the other means to emphasise interest as the most important 
element in feeling. The second problem we have already 
disposed of in chapter Iv. The object attended to is always 
interesting, but it is interesting because it is attended to or 
is likely to be attended to, not attended to because interest- 
ing. We need not then consider that form of the feeling 
problem in this connection.* 
* See note at the end of this chapter.
-P-A-G-E-297
  Psychological Theories of Attention 287 
Tf we return to our questions with reference to the feelings 
of pleasure and pain, it seems very doubtful if we can answer 
any one of them in the affirmative. Feeling in the first 
place seems always to succeed attention rather than to pre- 
cede it. We have feeling only toward objects that are 
already clearly in mind. We can be neither pleased nor 
displeased by a sensation that is not yet in consciousness. 
It is true that we frequently have a memory-image that is 
pleasing, and seek to bring back the original impression, 
but in that case attention has already been given to the 
memory-image, and our problem is as to why that attention 
could itself have been given. That evidently cannot be 
answered in terms of feeling, for the feeling succeeds the 
entrance rather than precedes it. 
Moreover, not merely the presence but the nature of the 
feeling depends upon attention. If we are occupied with one 
aspect of an event or object it may be pleasing, while the 
same object from another point of view may be disagreeable. 
There is hardly a circumstance in life which cannot be 
made endurable if one will and can but look on the bright 
side of things. This influence of attention upon the nature 
of feeling can be seen very clearly in the differing views 
which are taken of the same event at different times. Quite 
frequently an event that is pleasing at the time it occurs 
becomes unpleasant later when viewed in another light. 
The new knowledge compels a new attitude to the facts, 
and with that a new feeling tone. 
Again, feeling does not seem a necessary condition of 
attention, because we attend to many objects which are in- 
different to us, or at least have only the feeling that comes 
with interest, which is not a feeling in the real sense, but only 
a phase of the attention process, as has been pointed out 
several times before. And as was instanced in an earlier 
chapter, attention is drawn by the unpleasant as well as 
by the pleasant. Suffering holds the mind equally with 
the happiest event or the most beautiful picture. If there 
were an immediate relation between feeling and attention it
-P-A-G-E-298
  288 Attention 
would seem strange that pleasant, unpleasant, and indifferent 
stimuli should have exactly the same effect. 
There is finally a difficulty of the theoretical sort that 
seems to complete the chain of evidence against this ex- 
planation. This is that many writers have insisted that feel- 
ing in general, as well as interest, finds its ultimate basis 
in attention. Herbart and Wundt, to quote no others, 
are both convinced that feeling can only be explained in 
terms of attention or apperception. It would take too 
much space here to give in full their arguments for the view, 
but it depends in general upon the relations between the 
different aspects of feeling and attention, and upon simi- 
larities in the conditions of the two processes that can best 
be explained by the assumption that feeling is the secondary, 
attention the fundamental process. [If, then, all the argu- 
ments of the people who stand for the causal relation between 
feeling and attention can be as well transformed to prove 
that attention is the basis of feeling rather than vice versa, 
and if the temporal and qualitative correspondences would 
show that feeling could not be the condition of the attention, 
it seems safe to regard the view as inadequate. 
A fourth group of writers hold that attention is controlled 
directly by the will, that attention is but an expression of 
mental activity in some form or other. We have already 
been compelled to consider this theory in a modified form 
in the preceding chapter. One phase of the apperception 
question is identical with the problem of will. We find 
other types of the theory in Sully and Lipps. Each of 
these men represents a different conception of what the 
theory implies. Each endeavours to make it something 
more definite than the will of popular speech or its 
scientific counterpart the will of the faculty psychology. 
Each nevertheless is left with an indefinite idea of a force 
of an unknown kind. Sully [**] says that attention has the 
characteristics of our conscious active states in general, and 
that these characteristics are known by such expressions 
as ‘‘ sense of exertion, effort and strain.’’ This then, so far
-P-A-G-E-299
  Psychological Theories of Attention 289 
as he definitely analyses his process, would mean that he 
considers the strain sensations accompanying the attention 
process to be the cause or condition of the attending. We 
have already had occasion to point out that these sensa- 
tions can in no sense be regarded as causes, but are rather 
the signs or the effects of attending. It is undoubtedly 
implied in the theory that there is an effective force in 
consciousness which is above the strain sensations and 
which acts to control the course of ideas, something that is 
much more positive than any shadowy conscious feeling, 
and this in spite of the fact that Sully distinctly states that 
he is making no assumption with respect to an “active, 
spiritual principle.’ * 
With Lipps [*] the assumption of the spiritual principle 
is more definite, although he too endeavours to avoid the 
much-derided faculty of will. Lipps recognises the fact 
that the conscious sign of activity has nothing to do with 
the clearing up of ideas—is not in any sense the effective 
process in mind—but he states the determination in terms 
of the “‘ unconscious self.”” As he puts it, attention is not due 
to the activity of will but to the activity of the mind itself, 
meaning some unconscious force which lies behind mind 
in the ordinary sense. By this term the use of the word 
will is avoided, there is no breaking up of the mind into 
separate parts ; but it is nevertheless very difficult to assign 
any definite meaning to the word, or to obtain any clear- 
cut picture of the way in which the whole mind is active, 
as has been seen in chapter x11. We have the old ob- 
jection to oppose here to the use of an unconscious mind, 
that it is something that must lie entirely beyond the range 
of our knowledge, and to use it to explain conscious pro- 
* It must be confessed that as an expression of Sully’s most recent 
theory this account is unfair. In the “‘Human Mind,” pp. 141ff., he 
traces the conditions of attention to events in the earlier history of the 
individual in a purely empirical way, and gives will but an unimportant 
part in the control. And even that is always restricted in its action by 
the earlier developed educational influences or interest. The passage 
quoted from the earlier work may stand as an instance of the will theory 
of attention, but not as a fair account of Sully’s most recent position. 
U
-P-A-G-E-300
  290 Attention 
cesses is very obviously an explanation of the known by 
the unknown, and in this case even by the unknowable. 
The fondness of all of these writers, and of popular thought 
as well, for the term will or activity with the implication 
of something beyond consciousness, seems to be rooted in 
the anthropomorphic tendencies of the human mind. Just 
as primitive man tended to see himself writ large every- 
where upon nature—thought of all objects, animate as well 
as inanimate, as if they were human beings or owed their 
actions to men concealed somewhere about them—so at 
a later stage, when he began to think of his mental life, and 
to seek for a cause of the phenomena that go on within him, 
he turned first to the same familiar objects for his explana- 
tion. When he struggled to lift a heavy weight he had a 
picture of himself over against the load and a mass of strain 
sensations coming in with every effort. As he felt the 
same strain sensations when trying to attend or to think 
closely of any thing, he assumed most naturally that there 
must be some man like himself within himself, who struggled 
to produce the changes in consciounesss just as he struggled 
to lift the weight. This picture, which undoubtedly is the 
result of a personification on the same level as that of the 
savage who sees human activity in every action of natural 
forces, has certainly become very firmly fixed in the 
popular thought of the day, and is by no means without 
its echo in the theories of psychologists. That it is only 
a metaphor, and a metaphor which is of very slight value 
as an explanation of the facts, is evident at a glance. If 
this individual, this second self, really existed within us, 
it would be as difficult to assign the conditions of his actions 
as it is to explain our own immediately. It would indeed 
be even more difficult, for he is by hypothesis entirely re- 
moved from observation, and is usually regarded as too high 
to be profaned by investigation. 
It seems, when we go back to consider the facts and drop 
all metaphors, that the term “‘ active will” means either some 
independent and irresponsible agent that stands behind
-P-A-G-E-301
Psychological Theorres of Attention 291 
consciousness, or the strain sensations in consciousness, 
or what Lipps calls the activity of consciousness itself, 
what Stout calls conation or Wundt, apperception. The 
first theory, since Herbart’s attack on the “faculty psych- 
ology,” has been recognised everywhere as an unfruitful 
hypothesis. The second we have already shown to be in- 
consistent with the facts. The third theory, which intro- 
duces an active mental force, requires more consideration. 
For the most part it is merely a combination of statements 
from the two previous theories. For Lipps it is practically 
identical with personified mind. Professor Stout’s ["°] cona- 
tion is merely a statement of the fact that there is a felt 
current in mental processes, while the will or apperception 
of Wundt is but a claim that it is easier to picture mind in 
terms of voluntary processes. In last analysis, the first 
view would amount to the statement that there is a feeling 
of tendency in mind, an unanalysable feeling, but its causal 
efficacy is implied rather than demonstrated. It could be 
met just as well by a recognition of the subjective factors 
upon which we have put so much emphasis throughout the 
entire discussion. Stout’s ‘‘ tendency toward an end” means 
nothing more than that there is a change in consciousness 
and that some of the changes are foreshadowed in earlier 
states. We can only know that there is a tendency toward 
an end from the fact that the end is finally reached. This 
is merely to say that mental states succeed each other and 
that many of the conditions of the succession are to be found 
in earlier mental processes. The view that consciousness 
is itself active must be either another personification or a 
reference to strain sensations as an explanation of the 
changes. In each form of the theory we are dealing with 
a metaphor of one sort or another, and in most cases the 
metaphor serves rather to cloud the facts than to explain 
them. If we leave metaphor out of consideration, all that 
can be asserted is that the experience of one moment is 
different from what it would have been had the previous 
history of the individual and of his ancestors been different.
-P-A-G-E-302
292 Attention 
To attempt any explanation beyond this is to indulge in 
speculation, and in almost every case it would be more 
satisfactory to admit ignorance in the beginning. 
The fifth and last theory of attention which we must con- 
sider is represented by Kohn [*], and is to the effect that 
attention and consciousness are identical. This is not far 
different from the conclusion that we have reached, in so 
far as it must be admitted that attention is involved in all 
consciousness, and that degree of attention and degree of 
consciousness amount to the same thing. This seems to 
be the main point upon which Kohn insists. If he means, 
however, to do away with the word attention we should be 
compelled to take issue with him. There are peculiar 
concomitant phenomena of the attention process, strain 
sensations, feeling of interest, etc., which are definitely 
marked off from the other conscious process and are bound 
to receive a distinctive name. We might agree that atten- 
tion is consciousness regarded from one aspect, but as there 
are other aspects the name must be retained to avoid ‘con- 
fusion. It is as important that the different points of view 
from which consciousness is regarded should have names 
that will enable us to distinguish them, as it is that the 
different states themselves should be distinguished. 
We may say then, in conclusion of our examination ofs 
the various theories of attention from the side of conscious- 
ness, that each has picked out some more or less important 
concomitant process or some aspect of attention and re- 
garded it as the explanation of all the remaining parts or 
aspects. Attention is always accompanied by movements 
that result from attention. These Ribot has emphasised 
and made the cause or condition of attention. Attention 
is followed by interest, and this fact Stumpf has made 
central and a cause. Frequently, feeling precedes or accom- 
panies attention. Horwicz has generalised this fact to make 
of it a cause. Attention involves clear and distinct ideas, 
and sometimes results from the intensity of the external| 
stimulus ; Mill assumed that attention always depended|
-P-A-G-E-303
  Psychological-Fheovies of Aitention 293   
upon the intensity of the stimulus. The various forms of 
the will theory tend towards a personification of the con- 
ditions of attention as a whole, or for Lipps toward a personi- 
fication of the unconscious elements in the conditions, and 
these are then‘designated by a single word as the cause of 
attention. And finally Kohn makes attention the equiva- 
lent of consciousness as a whole, because of the important 
place that attention holds in consciousness. They are all 
right, but all incomplete. Attention is not any one of these 
things alone, but it is all of them taken together, and more. 
Attention as a state is the clearness of some one idea with 
its resulting analysis or synthesis. Attention as a cause 
is an expression of everything that the man has known and 
experienced, and accompanying and colouring the whole 
are the feelings of interest and effort, together with the 
movement processes that make known the degree of atten- 
tion to others. We cannot regard any feeling or sensation 
of the moment as an explanation of even the simplest 
attention process. To understand it we must trace it back 
to the impressions received in the earliest periods of life, 
and to the dispositions with which the man is endowed at 
birth. 
Nortr.—To prevent misunderstanding, it may be well to explain that 
in this chapter ‘‘interest” has been used in the second of the senses dis- 
cussed in chapter Iv, as the pleasant feeling that accompanies attending. 
In the first use, equally general, interest is the equivalent of condition of 
attention, and would therefore be cause, attention effect. The word in 
this sense seems superfluous in psychology, for it is practically identical 
with attention in one of its frequent applications.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
ATTENTION IN PATHOLOGY AND IN DEVELOPMENT 
UCH evidence in favour of the physiological theory 
which was advanced in an earlier chapter is to be 
found in the phenomena connected with the degeneration of 
attention and allied processes in certain pathological cases. 
There is very frequently a dropping out of some of the 
normal factors in the control of attention which serves to 
make clearer the nature and to emphasise the importance 
of the effect which they ordinarily exert in mind. These 
disturbances range in extent from the temporary lack of re- 
straint which we see in dreams and in the ordinary waking 
suggestion to the most complete derangements of all mental 
phenomena found in insanity. We can of course mention 
but a few, and shall attempt to select those which throw 
into highest relief the conditions of attention that we have 
been discussing, rather than attempt a general treatment 
of the changes of attention in mental diseases. 
Perhaps the most striking of all these cases, and those 
which bring out most clearly the relative independence of 
the systems of control, are the so-called alternations of person- 
ality. A favourite theme for the modern novelist is the 
man who contains within himself two separate selves, who 
changes from one individual to another, with loss in the 
one state of all memory of the other and with a correspond- 
ing change in his mental attitude and habits of action. The 
classic instance is Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 
Many cases very similar to this have been subjected to care- 
ful scientific study. So, for example, Dr. Azam [*] found 
294
-P-A-G-E-305
Attention in Pathology and in Development 295 
a woman who during a period of forty years would alternate 
from one state to another. She forgot in one state all that 
had happened in the preceding, and had a different dis- 
position and a different attitude toward life while in each 
condition. There is not only a discontinuity in memory, 
but there is also a different character. The woman was 
essentially a different person in each stage. During her 
normal state she was serious, almost sad, and very indus- 
trious, but in her second self was always cheerful, although 
less industrious. Her memory was perfect from one period 
to another of the same self, but there was no remembrance 
in self number one of impressions received in self number 
two. Change of character in some degree is associated 
with loss of the particular memory processes in all of the 
cases that have been carefully studied. Of course it is 
difficult to trace many of the more minute differences which 
would be interesting for our purposes, but the more pro- 
found changes in emotional tone and in the general attitude 
to the duties of life are well marked and always reported. 
From the physiological facts that have been considered 
in the last chapter, the explanation would be comparatively 
easy. Weneed resort to no fanciful assumption of a separate 
mind associated with the spinal cord, or say that there are 
separate minds for each hemisphere or for any other isolated 
part of the nervous system. All can be explained on the 
hypothesis that there is some breaking up of the associatory 
paths in the cortex, such that one system of associated 
experiences is very largely cut off from the others. The 
result is that the part of the experience which is received 
while the partial brain alone is active will not be recalled 
when the brain is working as a whole, and vice versa. There 
are no direct paths open between the two systems of con- 
nected nerve cells and so there is no possibility of recall 
as well as no possibility that the experiences received in the 
one state will influence the activity of those received in 
the other. That there is not complete separation between 
the two parts is shown by the fact that the more deeply  
-P-A-G-E-306
  296 Attention 
seated earlier associations still persist. The patient recog- 
nises the names and uses of familiar objects, can still speak 
in the normal manner; it is merely that the recently ac- 
quired and more unstable connections disappear. The 
paths which connect the partial system with the whole are 
merely impaired, not broken, and, as is usual in all such 
cases, the earlier associations remain while the newer and 
. less firmly fixed disappear. 
The degeneration may sometimes extend further. In a 
case reported by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, quoted by Professor 
James [5], the discontinuity between the two systems became 
so complete that the patient was compelled to begin her 
education anew and to build up her knowledge from the 
beginning as does a child. Even in this case, in which the 
breaking down of the connections was probably as com- 
plete as in any case which has been reported, there were 
nevertheless traces of the persistence of the old connections, 
for learning went on much more quickly than it had at first, 
and the complete recognition of objects and their uses had 
not disappeared. Moreover, the effect of the earlier ex- 
periences was not completely destroyed, but returned with 
a sudden rush after a period, and the patient became a 
normal woman again. 
By far the most interesting and instructive case of multi- 
ple personality so far reported is that of Miss Beauchamp, 
reported by Dr. Morton Prince. [9] This was a young woman 
of college education who developed a divided personality 
as the result of an emotional shock that acted upon an here- 
ditary nervous instability. The self divided first into two 
selves, then later a third developed, and there could be 
distinguished a dozen or more that were less well developed. 
The three most marked were known as BI, BIV, and Sally. 
The one that first made itself known to Dr. Prince was BI, 
a studious, morbidly conscientious person of poor health. 
Then Sally appeared, first as a sub-self or hypnotic self 
that never had an independent existence, never had “ her 
eyes open” or normal control of the motor mechanism.
-P-A-G-E-307
  
Attention in Pathology and in Development 297 
Even in that condition, however, she announced that she 
was always conscious of BI’s thoughts. Later she developed 
more fully, and would alternate with BI in the control of 
the bodily activities. She was a childlike individual, 
thoughtless, mischievous and vengeful, was not studious, 
had few of the accomplishments of the other, but possessed 
much better health and physical strength. Later, without 
warning, BIV developed with still a third character. She 
was thoughtless of others, a stronger person than BI in every 
way, except for her extreme selfishness. BI and BIV re- 
membered only their own experiences; Sally was familiar 
with the thoughts of BI but did not know those of BIV, 
although she was aware of the external perceptions of BIV 
and of her actions. What added to the dramatic interest 
of the case and to the discomfort of the participants was 
that the selves were nearly always at odds owing to the 
differences in their tastes, and each was usually trying to 
get even with the others for some fancied disregard of her 
own rights. After living the separate disjointed lives for 
several years, BI and BIV were finally amalgamated into 
a single self with memory of the past of each, and Sally was 
put out of existence. We cannot, of course, go into the 
details, interesting as they are. 
The important fact for us in all the cases is that with the 
impairment of the direct associations there is also a diminu- 
tion in the adequacy of the indirect control which we have 
ascribed to the reinforcement and inhibition between the 
separate cells and areas. With the vanishing of the mem- 
ories of a certain period there is also a corresponding change 
in the self. Emotionally, socially, and in every other re- 
spect there is a decay ; the person is no longer the same as 
before the change. From that, too, it is probable that the 
different controlling series of experiences may be regarded 
as relatively independent in their action. For while in the 
normal man the elements are constantly being varied in 
their relations, uniting first with one set of elements and 
then with another, and all systems modify each other in
-P-A-G-E-308
298 Attention 
some degree, in the abnormal states which we have been 
considering the interconnections between certain of the 
systems seem to be broken, and one system or group of sys- 
tems will temporarily take the place of first importance in 
the control of consciousness to the exclusion of all others. 
Under these circumstances the direction of thought and 
action is in terms of a partial experience, and is therefore 
inadequate to the reality of things in general and does not 
even do justice to the knowledge of the individual in question. 
There are many less striking degrees of abnormality 
which show the same general laws. Closely related to 
double personality are the cases of fixed ideas which are 
found so frequently. These vary in degree from the “ crank” 
with his head filled with some one project which is not 
altogether feasible, to states in which the whole conscious- 
ness is dominated by one group of ideas, which alters the 
entire view of the universe through its control of all other 
mental processes. Every one is familiar with the man who 
can think of but one topic and who is reminded of everything 
by that topic, and who, moreover, has all of his mental 
processes determined in the light of that one dominant idea. 
Everything that enters the senses is transformed by it, and 
if there is a choice between perceptions he will see only 
those which are in harmony with the interpretation that 
he has already decided upon. The one circle of ideas rules 
his attention, his associations and perceptions, his actions. 
Every mental process is determined by it. This state of 
mind grows to be permanent in many cases, and is often 
accompanied by loss of sensibility in several domains, by 
loss of power of movement, and other profound mental 
disturbances. It passes over by indefinite stages into the 
state of double personality discussed above. The same 
physiological explanation will serve here as in the preceding 
case. There is an abnormal and permanent domination 
of consciousness by one system of associations at the ex- 
pense of all others, and a resultant loss of mental balance 
and perspective. Other experiences do not play their full 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  
Attention in Pathology and in Development 299 
part in determining the course of ideas, and the one-sided 
control means general loss of efficiency in all directions and 
a complete misinterpretation of all perceptions. 
Hypnotic phenomena offer many examples of a very 
similar condition. Whatever may be the ultimate theory 
of hypnotism, there is undoubted evidence that there is 
a weakening of the control normally exerted by the ex- 
periences of the past and a tendency for some one system 
to become for a moment dominant to the almost complete 
exclusion of others. The system which shall gain the 
ascendancy is determined by the circumstances of the hour, 
usually by some word or sign from the operator who has 
induced the state. When the system has once gained the 
ascendancy every other idea is subordinated to that. Only 
those objects are seen which are in harmony with it, and 
lonly those actions are performed which correspond to it. 
It is possible to reproduce artificially in this way the pheno- 
mena of double personality. During the hypnotic state 
the subject can be made to take on a consistent character, 
or several of them successively, which are entirely different 
from the normal self of the daily life. A hypnotised person 
has been made to assume in succession the part of a general, 
a thief, an empress, and in each case would not only act the 
part assigned so far as he knew it, but would for the moment 
adopt the whole manner of thought and action which the 
character impersonated ordinarily has. For the instant 
every other influence is excluded from consciousness, and 
the avenues of sense are closed to any experiences which 
might reveal the true relations of the individual to his 
surroundings. The hypnotic state is like the alternating 
personality also in that there is frequently memory from 
one hypnotic state to the other, although there is no memory 
in the normal state of events which occurred in the hypnotic 
condition and no memory when hypnotised of the events 
of the normal life. Again, these facts reinforce the old 
conclusion that it is possible for one system of experi- 
ences to become cut off from the others and to take      
-P-A-G-E-310
  300 Attention 
complete control of the mind in disregard of experience 
as a whole. 
We find very similar tendencies at work in a very much 
slighter degree in the normal life of many individuals. 
Quite frequently a man in the full possession of his senses 
will find himself temporarily so strongly under the influence 
of one idea that it is impossible for any other to enter con- 
sciousness. Under these conditions all statements, no 
matter how clearly heard, even if directly opposed to the 
interpretation that has been made, will be understood to 
confirm it in every respect. One who has absolute trust in the 
fidelity of a friend will see in a statement that undoubtedly 
proves treachery to every unprejudiced observer a new 
and convincing instance of his loyalty. Many are the men 
whose belief in themselves and in their good repute in the 
community is so strong that any derogatory remark which 
they may happen to overhear concerning themselves is 
tobbed of its sting by a perfectly honest misinterpretation. 
Numerous instances can be recalled by each reader in which 
a passing remark, surrounding objects, or some event, will 
change completely the ordinary course of thought as long 
as the individual remains under its influence. These con- 
ditions are like all the others mentioned in this chapter 
in that the cause is to be found in an excessive development 
of some one system of ideas, until it for the time will over- 
balance all other ideas, and produce a warped mind that 
will induce a misinterpretation of events about. It is 
unlike all of the preceding in that it is temporary and not 
sufficiently accentuated to lead to any dangerous actions, 
or to mark the man off as in any way different from his 
fellows. 
There are, of course, many instances of similar accentua- 
tion of one system, or of a general decay of all the controlling 
elements in various forms of insanity, but it would require 
a far more extended and more technical treatment than we 
have space to give to bring out those aspects which cannot 
be brought under the head of the different phenomena
-P-A-G-E-311
  Attention in Pathology and in Development 301 
already discussed. And even then we should have but an 
amplification of the facts already treated. 
One other perfectly normal and very common experience 
offers an excellent illustration of the results of the decay of 
mental control. This is the dream. The remarkable 
feature of the dream life is not so much the character of the 
material that is offered, as it is the incongruous way in 
which the elements are united. In most cases the entire 
matter of the dream can be traced to some scene or scenes 
in the waking life, and the sensations of which they are 
composed can be shown to be derived in their entirety 
from our daily experiences. But the course of the associa- 
tions is entirely out of harmony with experience, and brings 
about an irrational, if not uncanny, succession of pictures. 
This is exactly what would be expected on the theory that 
association, like attention, is ordinarily governed by the 
experiences of the past life, or, physiologically, that the 
trend of ideas depends upon the reinforcing and inhibitory 
action of the nervous elements, which in turn owe their effect 
at any moment to the way in which they have been stimu- 
lated in earlier experiences. During sleep a large portion 
of the brain is incapable of function. We need not con- 
sider here whether the inability be due to diminished blood- 
supply, or to some change in the cell or its connections. 
However it may be brought about, we can feel very sure 
that parts of the brain are taking no part in the activity of 
the whole, while in dreams, at least, parts are in a state of 
activity. In the dream the nerve cells which are at work 
are not entirely without control, but the control is exer- 
cised by comparatively few cells, is directed by but a 
partial experience ; and while the dream is true to the mental 
conditions under which it originates, it is not true for real 
life—for experience as a whole. The factors which direct 
the dream life are one-sided representatives of the man as 
a whole ; by far the greater part of himself has no influence 
upon the process, and the result is an unreal and unnatural 
train of thought.
-P-A-G-E-312
302 Attention 
All of the pathological phenomena mentioned, then, find 
a ready explanation in terms of the dissociation of certain 
systems, of the undue prominence of some one or more of 
such systems and the almost complete disappearance of 
others. As a result there is a general decay of control. 
From a dream to the most complete case of double person- 
ality all of the facts, so far as we know them, will fit into 
this theory—that the nature of consciousness, both as to 
the sensations which enter it and the associations of the 
ideas in their course, is to be explained by the fact that 
no element or group of elements is ever found in complete 
isolation in the normal individual, but that every nerve 
process, every experience, depends for its ultimate nature 
upon all the other nerve processes that are or have been 
in action, upon all the experiences to which the individual 
has been subjected at any time in his life. If any con- 
siderable number of these factors fail to exercise their 
normal function, the mind becomes abnormal, its processes 
are uncontrolled, and incoherent. The mental life is no 
longer a true picture of the events in the world without, 
and is not in harmony with the views of others as to the 
nature of the universe as a whole. 
The problems of the development of attention, particu- 
larly the question as to the point of entrance of attention 
in the course of the development of the animal series, find 
their readiest answer in the light of the physiological theory. 
On that view we should have attention as soon as the different 
sensory elements of the nervous system begin to act one 
upon the other in such a way that the entrance of any 
stimulus would depend in part upon the earlier stimuli 
that had entered and upon the previous excitation of the 
organism by other external processes—when the reaction 
of the animal is no longer due to the nature of the stimulation 
and the inherited nervous mechanism, but is also determined 
in part by the various experiences which the individual 
has undergone in the course of its own life. In the animal 
series we could look for attention only when the nervous
-P-A-G-E-313
  Attention tn Pathology and in Development 303 
system had made considerable development ; when the 
different sensory elements were at least closely connected by 
association fibres that could transmit the reinforcing and 
inhibiting impulses from one cell to the other. We should 
also expect that there would be no sharp line of distinction 
between the animals which showed traces of attention and 
those which did not. As the process of development is 
always a gradual one, there would be a shading over from 
the animals whose activities would find their explanations 
in the mechanical action of the nervous system to those 
in which we could trace control by the earlier conscious 
processes. The facts fully justify the expectation of un- 
certainty in deciding where to put the first sign of attention. 
_ There is not as yet even general agreement as to the facts 
upon which we must base our interpretation. Bethe and 
the others who would carry the explanation in terms of 
mechanical reflex to the furthest point find no traces of 
adaptation in any of the animals below the vertebrates, 
while others see striking signs of it in ants and bees and 
many other of the higher invertebrates. 
The problem is still further complicated by the fact that 
the only method of judging the effect of attention or of any 
other mental process is by inference from their actions, and 
these are always susceptible of more than one explanation. 
Still we do find that in the lower forms the stimuli which 
are responded to are those which are of a nature to appeal 
to the animal on account of its hereditary structure, that 
the same stimulus appeals with equal strength at all times, 
and that there is no failure to respond when the stimulus 
is present. Further on there is a selection, certain stimuli 
are attended to in preference to others of equal strength 
which would have been responded to at another time. 
Often the failure to respond comes in spite of the fact that 
the stimulus in all probability has acted upon the nervous 
system. But the inhibition of the response is due to the 
action between nerve cells of exactly the same kind as that 
which is involved in attention. Perhaps the best instance 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
    
304 Attention 
of such an inhibition in a comparatively low vertebrate is 
the experiment of Mébius [7] repeated by Dr. Triplett [*] upon 
the perch. It was found that if a minnow and a perch were 
put in the same tank but separated from each other by a 
pane of clear glass, the perch would at first make many 
vain attempts to seize the minnow and would strike its 
head against the pane in its struggles. In a comparatively 
short time, however, it would discover that the endeavour 
was useless and would give up the struggle. The most 
surprising thing from the human standpoint is that when 
the glass was removed and the two fish were permitted to 
swim together in the same space, the perch still made no 
attempt to devour its natural prey. Here, frequent ex- 
periences had overcome the inherited impulse, the normal 
association of movement with visual impression was de- 
_ stroyed. This is an effect very similar to the inhibition 
which the electric current exerted on the perception of the 
grey lines on the Masson disc in Mr. Taylor’s experiments, 
except that it affects the motor connections as well as the 
sensory. Probably, however, the effect of one sensory im- 
pression upon another would appear at the same time, for, 
as we have seen, the control of the movement is in terms of 
a sensory process of some kind, and one inhibition would 
make its appearance at very much the same place as the 
others. 
Of course the difference in degree between attention at 
these lower stages of development and that which we see 
in man is so great as to amount almost to a difference in kind. 
To take even a fairly highly developed animal like the perch, 
we find that only one aspect of the experience with the 
minnowhas any influence upon the later action—its unattain- 
ableness. In man other phases would have entered as well. 
He would have seen that the minnow was only unapproach- 
able as long as the glass intervened, or as long as it was at 
the other end of the tank. Development of attention from 
this standpoint consists very largely in the addition of new 
elements success vely to modify the one element which
-P-A-G-E-315
  Attention in Pathology and in Development 305 
was prominent in the earlier forms. As more experiences 
play a part in the total determination, as the action is not 
in the light of one phase of the earlier experiences only, 
but takes more and more completely the entire nature of the 
earlier life into consideration, we have a greater adequacy 
of the attention, a truer conception of each separate ex- 
perience which may be offered. The development of the 
nervous system which goes on from the lower animals to man 
renders possible this increased control by means of the 
increasing complexity in the connections between different 
parts of the nervous system. 
Very much the same story is to be told of the develop- 
ment of attention in the child as in the animal series, except 
that the development of the child is very much more rapid, 
and that the child at birth has already reached a point of 
development that corresponds to a comparatively advanced 
stage in the development of the animal series. While in 
the animal the lack of attention is the accompaniment of a 
relatively undeveloped nervous system, of a condition of 
marked lack of connection between the various nervous 
elements, in the child the same mental insufficiency is the 
concomitant of the incomplete state of the nervous elements. 
As was pointed out in an earlier chapter, at birth the fibres 
of the cerebral cortex are not yet enclosed in their sheath, 
and are as incapable of function as a mass of bare copper 
wires would be of carrying separate electric currents if the 
different wires were in contact from place to place, although 
probably not for the same reason. Not merely the asso- 
ciatory fibres of the cortex are lacking, but many of the 
sensory centres as well. Although the influence of cell upon 
cell in the lower centres is being exerted in directing the 
actions of the child to a greater extent perhaps than in the 
lower animals that we have considered to possess a small 
degree of attention, there is little or nothing of activity in the 
cortical cells which are to accompany attention in the adult. 
Attention, then, in the sense in which we use it in regard to 
man’s mental processes, is largely lacking in the child at 
x
-P-A-G-E-316
  306 Attention 
birth, and probably enters at about the third month. Preyer 
mentions an instance in which the child seeks an object 
with its eyes on the eighty-third day, which was for this 
child the first sign of spontaneous attention. In the child 
as in the animal series, we are dealing with a course of 
gradual development, and it is impossible to fix the exact 
period of the appearance of attention in the one case as in 
the other. As has been said, if we should use the strict 
physiological criterion which has been applied to animals, 
we should probably be compelled to ascribe the beginnings 
of the phenomena to a period very shortly after birth ; if, 
however, we take the ordinary meaning of the term as 
applied to adults, consider the presence of an anticipatory 
idea as the criterion, we should see the rudiments of the 
process at about the third month ; but if we emphasise the 
side of social control, the first signs of the determination 
of ideas by the wishes of the other individuals about it, the 
first appearance would be put much later, probably after 
the time of learning to speak. 
In any case, unless care is taken to understand the sense 
in which the words are used, there will be unlimited oppor- 
tunities for misunderstanding, and little hope of a final 
decision. The most important thing is to see that the 
same general laws apply to the lowest mind as to the highest, 
that attention is nothing more than the inter-action of 
different nerve-cells and experiences in the control of other 
cells and experiences, and that in the lower animals few 
cells are involved, in the higher many. If this principle is 
accepted there is little importance to be attached to the 
question as to where attention first makes its appearance. 
SUMMARY 
1. The degenerations of mind are nearly all accompanied 
by weakened or deranged attention. 
2. Two forms of change may be noted in insanity: the 
general instability of attention that forbids any concen-
-P-A-G-E-317
Attention in Pathology and in Development 307 
tration as in mania, and distorted attention that gives rise 
to fixed ideas as of paranoia. 
3. Closely related to attention are the dissociations of 
personality that result from a division of the experiences 
into two or more groups with different forms of attention 
for each. 
4. Attention may be said to make its appearance in the 
race or in the individual whenever the nervous system 
develops to the stage where remote earlier experiences may 
modify the influence of the immediate stimulus.

CHAPTER XIX 
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
T is now time to bring together the scattered threads 
of theory, to attempt to summarise briefly the more 
theoretical conclusions, and to fill in any omissions in the 
discussion which may have been necessary from the stand- 
point of the separate chapters. 
We seem to be compelled to define attention from the 
standpoint of its conscious characteristics, from what 
Professor Titchener calls. its structural side, as an increased 
clearness and prominence of some one idea, sensation, or 
object, whether remembered or directly given from the 
external world, so that for the time it is made’ to constitute 
the most important feature of consciousness. This central 
position of the process in question we have seen to depend 
upon two general factors, the present environment on the 
one side and the entire past history of the individual on the 
other. These two together are of course co-extensive with 
the known universe in the case of the ideal man. Man’s 
experience is not alone composed of the comparatively 
few events which have brought him into direct contact with 
nature, but through tradition and books he has summed up 
within himself the entire experience of the human race as a 
whole in all times and places. On the other side, too, 
through heredity, it would be possible to trace some small 
number of the conditions which have to be taken into 
consideration in explaining any act of attention back to 
the acts and surroundings of his predecessors in the course 
of evolution. While no single man reaches this ideal con- 
308
-P-A-G-E-319
  
General Conclusions 309 
dition, it is yet true for every man that the elements which 
may be said to determine his attention are not to be found 
in any chance movement of the body at the moment, in any 
feeling of pleasure or of effort that may accompany or 
precede the attending, but are to be found in the entirety 
of the preceding life of the individual and indirectly in the 
race history of mankind in general. 
Moreover, it does not seem necessary to assume a par- 
ticular bearer of these experiences under the name of will, 
conation, or apperception. An assumption of this kind 
can at most call up a picture, and the picture in last analysis 
is not adequate to the facts. ...We know nothing in our ex- 
perience but a sense of effort, a change in ideas ; we can dis- 
cover from an examination of other consciousnesses or in 
the actions of other men no facts that demand a picture of 
this kind..-The most we can learn is that the consciousness 
of a given moment is different from what it would have been, 
if the individual had not been subjected to some of the 
earlier experiences which he has undergone. If you care 
to call any one of these concrete processes or facts ‘‘ will” 
or “apperception,”’ very well; but it is also essential that 
you keep in mind what the term implies, and do not assume 
that there is something behind the facts which acts as a 
bearer of the effects which are retained from one experience 
and exerts them upon another. Of such separate entity 
we have no evidence, and to assume it is to complicate 
rather than to simplify the problem. Certain phases of 
consciousness we shall undoubtedly continue to call will, 
and there is great convenience in the use of the term in that 
sense ; but this can no more be taken to justify the separate 
existence of the entity apart from consciousness as a whole, 
than the use of the word memory to designate the fact that 
we remember justifies the assumption of a distinct mental 
being which retains old impressions. All are parts or phases 
of consciousness, not separate existences or consciousnesses 
distinct from the one mind. 
One other question which comes up for mention here is 
=
-P-A-G-E-320
  
  310 Atiention 
the old problem of the “‘ freedom of the will.” Whether we 
are to regard the mind as free or not depends entirely upon 
what we mean by the term. The whole long controversy 
reduces very largely to a confusion of words. If you mean 
that the man as he is at the moment is free to do as he 
pleases, man undoubtedly is free; if you mean that any 
_ man can at any time act without any reference to present 
circumstances or past conditions, if you intend to assert 
the freedom of absolute irresponsibility, then only a negative 
answer can be given. No man but a lunatic would act 
entirely at variance with his past experiences and his reason, 
and if any man should attempt to act freely in this sense 
it would be sufficient ground for his incarceration. If you 
grant that a man ordinarily is and must be controlled very 
largely by the forces which have worked upon him in the 
past, and then ask if there are not still some other elements 
which combine with them in controlling his activity, the 
answer must be a confession of ignorance. No man has been 
and no man probably ever will be able to trace out all of 
the factors that are at work even in any one act of 
attention. There must always be a large part of every 
conscious process unexplained. Whether you insist that 
the remainder is to be explained as the first has been, and 
assert that if we could know more of the past life of the in- 
dividual and of the influences to which he has been sub- 
jected, and had more accurate means of tracing the con- 
nections between them and the present mental processes, 
everything could be explained in the same way ; or whether 
you insist that part of these conditions in some way arise 
spontaneously in the individual, must be decided not by 
facts, but by the general temper of your own mind, and by 
the interpretation of life which appeals to you at the time. 
Practically every one regards himself as a source of energy, 
as a force which can exert itself without reference to any- 
thing else in the universe. On the other hand, nearly every 
one tends to look at others as subject very largely to other 
men and things in his environment. The teacher is given
-P-A-G-E-321
General Conclusions git 
to thinking of his students as so much material to be worked 
up into the finished citizen ; the lawyer of his jury as sub- 
ject to suggestions which shall make the case take on a form 
favourable to his client; the physician must ever keep 
before him the fact that the mind is dependent upon its 
bodily conditions and upon the preceding events in life ; 
while the judge tends more and more to treat the criminal 
as if he were the victim of unhealthy social surroundings 
rather than as the voluntary evil doer. Evidently, then, 
the answer to this question cannot be solved at present as a 
matter of fact, but rather must be left to be answered in 
harmony with the mental attitude of the individual. The 
answer will vary with the individual and at different times 
for the same individual. There is every practical advantage 
in treating every other man as if he were subject to natural 
laws, the product of his surroundings and of his previous 
actions, and of acting toward yourself as if independent 
of everything external, past as well as present.. It must 
be added, however, that this freedom which we ascribe to 
ourselves is believed only, not proven, and that we can 
obtain no scientific conception of such free action. 
If we once accept this general view of attention, we must 
in large measure abandon the old systems of classification. 
There can be very little meaning given to passive and active, 
sensorial and intellectual, voluntary and involuntary 
attention, Classified from the standpoint of the conditions, 
we have only the more objectively conditioned attention 
and the more subjectively conditioned—attention which 
depends upon the strength or size of the external object, and 
attention which depends upon interest or the mental con- 
dition at the moment. But these conditions never or very 
rarely occur in entire separation. Occasionally there comes 
a noise so loud or a light so bright that attention is drawn 
to it without reference to the state of mind at the time ; and 
again, there may be a preoccupation so great that no degree 
of external stimulation seems to disturb the train of thought ; 
but the ordinary attention is the resultant of both objective
-P-A-G-E-322
mse) Attention 
and subjective conditions in which one set tends to pre- 
dominate slightly over the others. There is not a sharp, 
clearly drawn line, but a merging of one kind into the other. 
Most of the other classifications rest upon distinctions 
which are either unimportant or which disappear entirely 
when viewed more than superficially. The division into 
passive and active attention is based upon the absence or 
presence of strain sensations. It is the most satisfactory 
of any, because the characteristic chosen is one that can be 
easily recognised and plays an important part in the popu- 
lar idea of attention. The difficulty with it is that the 
strain sensation is not an essential part of the entire process, 
and, furthermore, that it is not even an accurate sign of 
attention, for the strain sensation does not accompany the 
most adequate attention or the least adequate attention, 
nor is it confined either to the subjectively or to the objec- 
tively conditioned attention. We have seen that strain 
sensations are absent during the moderately adequate 
attention, attention to the external stimulus for its own 
sake; and also during the most adequate and effective 
attention, attention subjectively conditioned, after it has 
become most complete. It is only at the time of transition 
from the objective to the subjective conditions, or when 
there is a struggle between two sets of subjective conditions, 
that the sense of strain is present in any very marked degree. 
This is also usually a period of decreased attention efficiency. 
That there is a great difference in attention which is not 
due to the mere presence or absence of strain sensations is 
shown by the fact that the authors who divide attention 
into the passive and active forms also have other criteria 
of classification in terms of the conditions. They then 
subdivide into the passive attention proper or the objectively 
conditioned and the secondary passive which comes after 
the warming-up process is complete. This secondary 
classification shows the inadequacy of the strain sensation 
to serve alone as the criterion. If, however, it were possible 
to retain the distinction and at the same time to indicate 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  General Conclustons 313 
the more essential differences, it would be very desirable 
to do so; but as the strain sensations are in themselves 
fortuitous accompaniments, and correspond neither to the 
conditions nor to the degree of attention, it seems impossible 
to retain any part of that classification without complicating 
the terminology to a degree which would more than negative 
the original gain. 
The division into sensory and intellectual attention 
would apply only to the nature of the mental processes 
affected by attention, and not to the conditions or to the 
results. It, again, is a division that has had various mean- 
ings in the history of the science. Sometimes it has been 
used as synonymous with the active and passive; again, as 
corresponding to the objectively and subjectively con- 
ditioned. Both these meanings we have already considered. 
The only other use that can be made of it is to distinguish 
between the effects of attention upon sensation and its 
effects upon remembered or recalled impressions. The 
conditions we have seen to be the same in both cases, and 
there is little or no difference in the material which is acted 
upon or in the way in which it acts, except that in the latter 
we have the effect in controlling the course of associations 
as well as in facilitating the entrance or retention of mental 
processes in mind. This one effect does not seem to be 
sufficient to justify the use of the new basis of division. 
As a result of the whole investigation, then, we are left 
with but one kind of attention so far as conditions are con- 
cerned, and judged from the results there is but slight 
difference between the various effects under different cir- 
cumstances. Attention is a unitary process, and while 
there are two sets of conditions that bring it about, these 
merge into each other so closely that only the extremes 
are clearly distinguishable. 
It is easy to show that many of the more complicated 
mental processes involve at basis the same factors, are 
very similar to attention in many of their characteristics. 
Using attention as a type, it is possible to bring many of the
-P-A-G-E-324
    314 Attention 
other mental processes under that head and to make it 
serve as a basis for the classification of states of mind. We 
have seen, for example,-that attention influences recalled 
impressions in practically the same way that it influences 
their original entrance. When a memory image is once 
given in consciousness it will be retained very much as a 
perception received immediately from the external world. 
Furthermore, attention largely determines which of the 
many possible associates of any impression shall become 
actual. In this sense it selects the memories offered by 
association just as it selects the objects of sense that shall 
be permitted to enter. By attention in this sense we mean 
again from the side of the conditions, the effect of the sum- 
total of previous conscious states, as united in the purpose 
of the moment, the general trend of the preceding thought, 
the character of the man, his profession, and further back 
the complete series of earlier experiences and inherited 
tendencies which make him what he is. His thought about 
any subject, no matter what the starting point, is an ex- 
pression of himself in the fullest meaning of the term. His 
associations, then, are not the result of a few isolated ex- 
periences as the English Associationists would have us 
believe, but are an expression of his entire life history, of the 
man in the fullest sense. 
In the same way the perception of an object as an object, 
apperception in the Herbartian sense, is an expression, in 
fact, in very large measure a product of the earlier experi- 
ences of man. The entering sensation serves as little more 
than the occasion for starting up a whole mass of earlier 
perceptions, and these constitute the object that we say we 
see or feel. What the associates are to be depends very 
largely upon the circumstances of the moment, the earlier 
life of the man in question, and of the history of the human 
race as a whole. If it were not that mankind in general 
had been subjected to the same influences, there would be 
no agreement in the perceptions of different men, the world 
would be different for each, and there would be no possi-
-P-A-G-E-325
  
General Conclustons 315 
bility of discussing any external fact with the chance of 
arriving at the same conclusion. It is the common heredity, 
social as well as biological, and the common environment 
which give the worlds of different men such great similarity, 
“not the fact that the external stimulus is the same for all. 
What the extreme Herbartians say about the importance 
of previous impressions is an under-estimation rather than 
an over-estimation of the truth, although we may not agree 
with them as to the way in which the result is accomplished. 
Attention is equally important in memory as in asso- 
ciation. What is remembered at any moment is dependent 
on the objective and subjective setting at that moment. 
The ease with which an event is recalled is largely due to 
the interest with which the impression was received in the 
first place, and to the way in which it fitted in with the other 
elements in consciousness at that period, upon the mental 
systems which were dominant then. Moreover, the attitude 
which will be taken toward the thing remembered on its 
return will be determined by the same conditions that go 
to make the perception what it is. An impression received 
in one way at its first entrance may take on an entirely 
different aspect when it reappears. New interpretations 
may be given it, new meanings put upon it, until it can no 
longer be recognised as the same object or image, and all 
because of the new knowledge which has been received 
between the times of the first and second entrance. In 
every possible way, then, memory is influenced by atten- 
tion, and its conditions as a whole are very similar to the 
conditions of attention. 
Many of the problems of voluntary action are also solved 
when once we have an understanding of the nature of 
attention. The prime condition of action of any kind is to 
keep an idea earlier associated with the movement clearly 
in mind. The idea of movement has exactly the same 
relation to attention as any other idea. Its coming up is 
usually dependent upon an association, and the association 
here as elsewhere is very largely determined by the con-
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 Attention i 
ditions which control attention. Of course, there are 
certain questions relating to the motor side, the physiology 
of nerve and muscle, which are peculiar to action alone, 
but the mental side is completely determined when the 
idea of the movement becomes dominant. So choice is 
but the result of a conflict between two different systems of 
experience, between two ways of looking at a given set of 
circumstances. When one system wins and the mind is 
given over to its complete control, the corresponding 
movement decided upon, the action is determined beyond 
recall. Action, like thought and attention, then, is an 
expression of the entire earlier experience of the man, of 
everything that goes to make him what he is. It is im- 
possible to set off action of any kind from the remainder 
of mind and regard it as unrelated to the rest. One cannot 
constantly think in one way and act in another. The action 
is an expression of the individual’s thought, and that in 
turn of his character. 
Reason itself is dependent upon the same factors. Reason 
is nothing more than thinking in the light of the entirety - 
of knowledge. When an association is formed which is | 
consistent with everything that the man knows at the time, 
you have an inference in the highest sense, and one which 
will be absolutely true for the individual at that time and 
in that environment. The adequacy of the reasoning will 
depend upon the number and nature of the impressions 
to which the man has been subjected, to his knowledge and 
the way in which it has been organised and brought to bear 
upon the particular experience of the moment. 
Practically the same laws hold throughout all the mental 
processes. By far the greater part cannot be explained 
in terms of the conditions of the moment, but their roots are 
to be found far back in the mental history of the individual. 
Attention, perception, memory, action and reason, all alike, 
can be understood fully only in terms of the earlier life of 
the man, and their ramifications extend to the traditions 
of the society in which he has lived, and through these and 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
General Conclusions 317 
the printed books which constitute so much of the environ- 
ment of the civilised man, backward and outward to the 
limits of the experience of mankind in all ages and in all 
parts of the globe. These controlling influences of all 
mental processes are seen to arrange themselves into groups 
which are in part distinct, although each exerts an influence 
upon every other. A man is a different man, is moved by 
slightly different motives, in each of his social and civic 
capacities. He is a different man as a host than as a man 
of business; if he has several occupations he will take a 
slightly different view of the world while engaged in the 
duties of each. As a student turns from one subject to 
another, he tends to change his attitude towards all per- 
ceptions. He thinks and looks only under the influence 
of one particular system of knowledge. A group of facts 
that will be at work in determining his attitude towards a 
problem in physics is too often not serviceable in connection 
with a related problem in botany or chemistry, so that a 
statement which is perfectly intelligible when met in one 
text-book or lecture-room will seem to have no meaning 
in another. All the elements of knowledge seem to be 
marked off into systems, and it is usual for the connections 
to be less close between elements of two different systems 
than between elements of the same system. The state of 
mind at a particular time, then, will depend as much upon 
the system that is dominant as upon the nature of experience 
as a whole. A well organised mind is one in which the lines 
that divide the systems are well-nigh obliterated and all 
bits of knowledge, being fused together into one whole, are 
equally effective at all times in controlling the course of 
the mental stream. When the systems are small and rigidly 
distinct, much of the actual knowledge of the man will be 
almost worthless at all times, and he will necessarily take 
a biased and one-sided attitude toward all questions. In 
no mind are systems entirely merged; no man is capable 
of viewing all questions with entire fairness, or even in the 
full light of his own knowledge. It is the mark of greatness

to approximate it. Genius consists, more than anything 
else in the ability to view familiar experiences from some 
unusual standpoint, in being able to approach a fact with a 
wider system of knowledge ready to interpret it than other. 
men. Most advances in the realms of science and art are 
due to working out new connections between old facts 
rather than to the discovery of new, although, in many 
cases, the discovery of a new fact is necessary before the old 
can be observed from a new point of view. 
The anatomical and physiological facts in connection 
with attention and the more complicated mental functions 
seem to harmonise with the theory that has been advanced. 
The one striking feature of the cerebral hemispheres is the 
richness of the associating fibres—the fact that every part 
is connected with every other part, both region with region, 
and elements of one region with other elements of the same 
region. Nowhere do we find anything like a dominating 
centre in any single part, but rather the structure is such that 
all parts of the hemispheres are united into one complex 
whole. Furthermore, the chief development of the cortex 
after infancy consists in the ripening and coming to maturity 
of these various association fibres. We have only to assume 
that the action of one set of nervous elements has a rein- 
forcing or inhibiting effect upon other related elements, and 
to assume in addition that the action of a nerve-cell at one 
time will have an influence upon the action of all other cells 
at all future times to bring the physiological and psycho- 
logical facts into agreement. The first assumption is 
strongly supported from the existence of analogous re- 
lations between motor cells, and while the latter is less 
strongly supported by known laws, it is not very different 
from the general principle upon which all explanation of 
memory is based, that a bit of nervous tissue undergoes a 
change with each activity which makes it more liable to act 
in the same way for ever after. It is only necessary to 
assume this fact, and that all nerve cells are always ina state 
of tonic activity which exerts an influence upon all related
-P-A-G-E-329
  
General Conclustons 319 
cells, and so contributes its share in controlling the action 
of all parts of the brain. That there are such systems of 
associations on the nervous side is supported from the side 
of pathology by the fact that groups of experiences tend to 
become detached from the whole, and either act alone in the 
control of consciousness or deprive consciousness of their 
influence for the time being. This would hardly be con- 
ceivable were there not an actual physical loosening of the 
associating bonds which could increase to complete dis- 
sociation. 
What, then, from the psychological side is an action of 
each experience upon every other, is from the physical side 
a modification of the brain tissue affected in such a way 
that there is not only a present effect, but that these tissues 
will be for ever different because of that impression, and 
because of that earlier impulse will always exert a different 
impression upon whatever part of the cortex may be at that 
time in action. On both the mental and physical sides 
there can be no separation of the effects of different stimuli, 
no discussion of the action of one part without considering 
all other parts and the past history of the organism.

    CHAPTER XX 
APPLICATIONS TO EDUCATION 
BOUT the facts of attention centre many of the pro- 
blems of the teacher. We may find it profitable to 
consider the conclusions for educational practice that follow 
from the results so far attained. 
The first problem that meets the teacher, and that which 
most concerns us, is how to hold the attention of the child. 
-If this can be satisfactorily accomplished everything else 
_will be comparatively simple ; the battle from the practical 
side is won, and all that remains is to decide what shall be 
taught. . The solution of the problem that is usually offered 
is the adjuration to be interesting, to teach nothing that 
-will not interest the child. But this does not take us very 
far. As has been seen earlier, it means nothing else than a 
reaffirmation of the end to be accomplished, is a command 
to hold the attention. To interest and to hold the attention 
~ are one and the same thing. We are then forced back to 
our original question, What is likely to hold the attention of 
a particular child? The only answer that can be given is in 
terms of the earlier history of the child. Anything will be 
interesting that the child already knows something about, 
and which is neither too old nor too new, which can in some 
way be attached to the pupil’s earlier experiences and 
at the same time is new enough not to seem commonplace. 
Furthermore, the new material must be presented in such a 
way that the connections with the older elements shall come 
out prominently. The first condition of being interesting, 
then, is a knowledge of your child. This knowledge, to be 
320
-P-A-G-E-331
  Applications to Education 321 
effective, must be sympathetic, not merely statistical, al- 
though a statistical knowledge of what children in a given 
community or at a particular age are likely to know may be 
helpful if well assimilated and vivified by a first-hand know- 
ledge. It involves knowing something of the home life that 
the child has had; ideally it involves a personal knowledge 
of the child and his parents for some time back, but this is, 
of course, a condition which cannot be realised in the ordin- 
ary schools with their large classes and exacting duties. 
Still, every teacher must know what the children of the par- 
ticular neighbourhood can be expected to know at the 
different ages, from observation, from statistics, from the 
memories of what he himself knew at that age. Further- 
more, he should be able to make allowance for the different 
temperaments, for the various earlier surroundings and 
other circumstances that make the separate children pecu- 
liar each to himself. 
But even after this knowledge is complete, everything 
depends upon the skill of the teacher. The application of 
the knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself. A 
person of keen sympathies can hardly fail utterly in the 
schoolroom, assuming a knowledge of what is to be taught ; 
whereas without this sympathy and tact the most complete 
knowledge of child-life, and even of the theoretical principles 
of teaching, will not prevent a lamentable failure. But what 
is called tact is very often nothing more than a knowledge 
of children derived from keen personal observation, while 
the knowledge that is found useless in regard to children is 
often nothing but ill-digested masses of facts not really 
understood. It is doubtful if there could be intimate know- 
ledge of child-life and conditions that would not result in 
sympathy and tact. 
It has been suggested that it is possible to tell what the 
interests of a child will be at any time on the assumption 
that the order of development of the child’s activities and 
interests will follow the development of the activities of the 
race as a whole—that the child will have its pastoral stage, 
Y
-P-A-G-E-332
322 Attention 
its stone and iron age, just as the race had them and in the 
same order, This theory may serve as a guiding thread in 
the conduct of experiments, but it cannot be assumed as a 
general law in advance of trial. It is at best an analogy, 
based upon the fact that the body tends to follow in its de- 
velopment the course that the animal series pursued in 
_evolution, so that the mental history of the child will take 
the same order as the history of the human race. Even 
granting the analogy to hold in its entirety, there would be 
difficulties. The physical development of the child does, it 
is true, tend to take the same line as the development of 
the species, but there are many short cuts, many stages that 
are not reproduced in the individual growth. Practically 
it would be impossible to tell in advance of experiment what 
stages would be omitted, what brought in. 
But to decide what shall be taught a child in terms of his 
interests alone is only one side of the question. The aim of 
education is not to interest the child, but to mould the child 
for useful participation in the life of the community, to 
bring him into contact with the experience of the race as a 
whole in such a way that the essentials of human knowledge 
shall become part of the influences which guide and direct 
his thought and conduct for the remainder of his life. 
Society sets the end that the teacher must attain, pleasantly 
and agreeably to the child if possible, but attain at any cost. 
If, the, then culture-epoch theory of education or any other 
method fails to attain this end, and to attain it with a mini- 
mum expenditure of time and the maximum of efficiency, 
it is in so far to be discarded. Undoubtedly many of the 
steps which the race has lived through are not needed for an 
understanding of present-day conditions, or at least for an 
understanding of those phases which are most important 
to the average child in preparation for the active work of 
life. The test which every scheme proposed must meet is, 
does it effectively put the child in possession of those por- 
tions of traditional knowledge which shall most thoroughly 
prepare him for life in the community, taking into con-  
-P-A-G-E-333
  Applications to Education 323 
sideration the time that he is likely to have to devote to his 
preparation? The ultimate test of a system is its product, 
but when the test must be long delayed, as is the case neces- 
sarily with education, it is essential to keep in mind the gen- 
eral aim and to measure the means by their apparent ade- 
quacy to those results. 
Another difficulty in making interest the sole measure of 
what shall be taught is, that while interest is simply another 
name for the probability that a certain statement or body 
of principles will hold the attention of the child, it does not 
take into consideration the entire set of conditions that 
ordinarily work in the determination of any attentive pro- 
cess. /Probably the attention that is ordinarily called in- 
terest is induced merely by those factors which are derived 
from earlier experiences_and heredity, and omits considera- 
tion of the social factors, which are just as numerous and 
effective and accomplish the same result as the others. It 
is only so far as the child is made to feel the social pressure, 
to recognise the demands which society makes upon him and 
take them as his own ideals, that he can be said to be acquir- 
ing an education. These alone will enable him to persevere 
after the guidance of teacher.and text-book have been re- 
moved, and they must also be trusted even in the stage of 
preparation at times when he is not directly under the eye 
of the teacher. The child must begin to feel the responsi- 
bilities of life as soon as he is beyond the kindergarten, to 
understand the social rewards which come with success of any 
kind and the social punishments of failure. All these will, 
of course, appeal but vaguely to the child at first, but with 
growing knowledge they will become more clearly and de- 
finitely conscious. Unless impressed early, they will never 
come to complete maturity. 
The child, then, must always be conscious of his duty so 
far as he is conscious at all of the incentives which lead him 
to work. He should never be permitted to plead lack of in- 
terest as an excuse for neglecting his tasks. Much of his 
attention will, of course, be given naturally and pleasantly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
324 Attention 
with no idea that he is working. This is the ideal condition, 
for the young child at least. But he should never con- 
sciously be permitted to feel that the end of his endeavour 
_is his own pleasure. Interest as a standard of attainment 
is too uncertain, and would necessarily carry with it an 
emphasis upon the nearer rather than the more remote ad- 
vantage. It gives prominence to the momentary rather 
than to the permanent good. Only the pressure of the 
community, of society as a whole, can be relied upon to keep 
his attention long fixed upon one subject. Every appeal 
of the student to his own interest as a standard of educational 
value results in a weakening of the influence of society and 
a softening of the moral fibre. It is a neglect of this phase 
of the subject which seems to be responsible for the wide- 
spread feeling that modern educational methods, with their 
insistence upon interest as a criterion of what shall be taught, 
are in some respects a step backward rather than forward. 
And a use of social pressure, of an appeal to duty as a means 
of exciting interest, is not inconsistent with the theoretical 
laws of attention. Regarding the problem from the stand- 
point of the conditions of attention, these social factors 
undoubtedly furnish a very large and important element 
in the determination of every act. They constitute the 
balance wheel, the elements that make for continuity and 
persistency. It is only an entire misunderstanding of the 
nature of the attention process that would exclude them 
from its practical control. They are just as important as 
the conditions which we ordinarily call interest in governing 
attention, and it is quite as justifiable to make use of 
them in practice. 
In a word, then, the attention of the child must be held to 
all those elements of knowledge which are essential to his 
individual progress at that particular time. Any influences 
which can be regarded as the natural determinants of 
attention must be used, if it is necessary, to accomplish the 
purpose of education. If the teacher can succeed by choos- 
ing those aspects of the subject which are related to past  
-P-A-G-E-335
Applications to Education 325 
experience and so are interesting, well and good; if not, 
he is justified in calling to his aid the effect of social pressure 
as contained in the sense of duty. From the practical 
standpoint it seems that the end of education will be most 
satisfactorily reached if the student constantly feels that 
he is striving for the accomplishment of an ideal which he 
has set himself, while the teacher regards it as his function 
to make every step in the acquirement easy and interesting 
and relies as little as possible upon the aid of social pressure. 
Here, as was seen in the theoretical problem of the freedom 
of the will, we have two opposing attitudes toward the same 
question, each of which seems unavoidable, but each will 
be held by a different person. Fortunate indeed is the 
teacher who can keep both sides of the controversy clearly 
in view, and not confuse the two mottoes in practice. 
A still stronger objection to an insistence upon interest 
as the only criterion of what shall be taught comes out when 
we think that extra application now may be the means of 
new interest in the future. Many subjects can be acquired 
without effort only at the expense of an enormous waste of 
time at the beginning, while the conquest of a few general 
introductory ideas in the early stages, at the expense of pain 
and forced attention, will quickly bring a large return in 
future pleasure, and will produce a healthy interest in the 
subject at a later period. Here again, if pressure of an ex- 
traneous kind, from the feeling that it is disgraceful to fail, 
or from insistence upon the fact that the particular subject 
is necessary for the accomplishment of a more remote pur- 
pose, which in itself appeals to the student, it is perfectly 
possible to develop an interest for the more advanced 
phases of the subject. In fact, to be interested in a subject 
means merely that there have been earlier experiences 
which were related to that subject, and each new experience 
lays the foundation for new interests. Bits of knowledge 
are not only to be thought of as acquired through interest, 
but as the basis of future interests in other subjects. It is 
certainly as laudable to consider the future acquirements 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
326 Attention 
that the knowledge will make possible as it is to think only 
of what present facts will be interesting. 
The general educational principle that a study of the laws 
of attention seems to demand is a reconciliation of the two 
tendencies that are now striving for the supremacy in edu- 
cational theory. In the first place, a knowledge of the child, 
however perfect, will not determine what the child shall be 
taught. That can be decided only in the light of social 
conditions and the needs of the times for men of a certain 
kind and training. On the other hand, the requirements of 
society can have nothing to say as to how or when the know- 
ledge it demands is to be imparted. Child study can reveal 
the laws that tell us how and when certain knowledge shall 
be offered. The standards and demands of the community 
alone can decide what it is that shall be taught. 
| From the theory of attention many subsidiary principles 
may be drawn in regard to the other processes that the 
teacher must deal with. Perhaps most closely connected 
with it are the processes which are concerned in perception. 
Perception, as we have seen before, is not complete when the 
’ sensation is attended to. But there must be added to the 
Sensation a mass of associations which have been acquired 
in earlier experiences. The sensation as it enters is met by 
a group of returning impressions, and the nature of the re- 
sulting idea is largely determined by the mood of the moment. 
It is only when what is seen is supplemented in this way 
that anything can be understood, and the nature and degree 
of the understanding will vary with the number and kind 
of the bits of previous knowledge which the child has al- 
ready acquired. There can be no real interest, no making 
the new knowledge part of the old, without these associates. 
But there may be interest and even continued attention 
when the wrong associates are present, or when they are 
so few that the resulting understanding is imperfect and 
partial. It is necessary, then, that the new object be seen 
in all its useful relations to the earlier facts. The egg for 
Professor James’s child was only a potato, because it could  
-P-A-G-E-337
  Applications to Education 327 
be associated with nothing but the one smooth white object. 
It could not be fully understood even from a child’s{stand- 
point, unless its relations to the hen and the chicken, its 
similarities to other articles of food, were known and 
noted, and of course it could not be fully understood in the 
absolute sense, or even in the scientist’s sense, unless con- 
sidered in the light of related chemical compounds and of 
an untold number of facts in biology and physics. In fact, 
in ultimate analysis every bit of knowledge is in some way 
connected with every other, and a complete knowledge of 
any one bit would involve connecting it with every other. 
Of course, it is impossible to thread the entire universe 
of knowledge for each new impression, but it is equally 
absurd to leave the child without aid in connecting the new 
fact with the knowledge already possessed. The links 
which shall be made with the other facts must be selected 
with reference to the measure of development which the 
child has already reached, and to the purpose of the lesson 
in hand. But the connections must be made and made 
judiciously, for only in so far as it is connected with others 
is the new bit of information really known or likely to be 
of any use. 
An effective and rational exercise of this principle is im- 
plied in the modern term correlation. In spite of the fact 
that a formal and unintelligent application of the doctrine 
has frequently brought discredit upon the term, teaching 
which does not bring about correlation is not education in 
any real sense. Properly used and connected, every fact 
should throw some light directly or indirectly upon every 
other fact, and the acquisition of each new bit of informa- 
tion renders easier an understanding of each succeeding 
statement, at the same time that it modifies and enriches 
the understanding of the knowledge already acquired when 
it comes up for reconsideration. 
Almost the same conditions hold for memory as for per- 
ception. Proper perception may, in fact, be said to be the 
only condition of memory. The only phase of memory 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
328 Attention 
which does not depend upon the physiological structure 
and so can be modified by training, is recall, and recall de- 
pends upon the closeness with which each fact has been 
connected with every other element of knowledge which 
is likely to be in mind at the time that this particular fact 
is needed. If each new perception is seen in relation to all 
analogous objects it will have many associates, many cues 
for recall, and will be available for immediate use whenever 
occasion requires. If, on the contrary, it is associated with 
a few other ideas only, with those that were present acci- 
dentally when it came to consciousness, it will be easily 
forgotten. Principles which are alone considered in the light 
of the other parts of the particular lesson in which they 
are learned will have no connections with the concrete 
events of life, and will prove short-lived and unfruitful. 
There are few if any separate conditions of memory. A 
thing really understood is seldom forgotten. The only 
rule for memory which has any practical value is Understand. 
Training reason is merely another phase of the same pro- 
cess. To reason is but to form associations under the in- 
fluence of the entirety of experience. This means first to 
know and then to have the knowledge so connected that 
each association is controlled by everything that the man 
has learned, and is not swayed by a few considerations to 
the exclusion of others. The first desideratum here is 
knowledge, the second to use that knowledge. And use 
of knowledge depends only upon a proper co-ordination of 
the separate isolated elements. To teach a child to reason, 
then, is, on the one side, to teach him to see truly, to observe 
all of the relations of objects, and on the other to have all 
that he knows ready to test each statement that he hears 
and to govern each thought which is formulated in his own 
mind. The difference between a man who merely knows 
and a man who reasons is the difference between a mere 
accumulation of unassorted facts and an organised body of 
knowledge ready to re-act on any and every occasion. 
There cannot be reasoning without information, but  
-P-A-G-E-339
  Applications to. Education 329 
relatively few facts, if systematised and constituting a 
unified whole, frequently make their possessor vastly more 
efficient than many a man of greater erudition. Reason, 
then, has the same basis as attention, as clear perception 
and adequate memory. 
Much is said in educational circles to-day of training the 
will and the feelings as well as the intellect, and it may be 
well to digress from our more particular subject to point out 
the results of our discussions when applied to that field. 
The earlier chapters have made action almost entirely de- 
pendent upon attention for its control. The cue for a 
movement was seen to be always an idea, and the same 
conditions control the entrance into consciousness of the 
idea which calls out the movement as any other idea. The 
training of will, from this standpoint, is accomplished then 
with the training of attention. A man whose knowledge 
with reference to any circumstance is complete will always 
act properly if he acts at all. Of course, the knowledge 
which controls action is not restricted to merely formal dis- 
ciplines. One must know human nature and the relations 
of the individual to society in ways so delicate that they 
have never been formulated in words. These experiences 
one can acquire only by living the life of the community, 
by understanding the thoughts and feelings of others. But 
this experience every man has opportunity for, and all that 
can be done to help him is to point out the elements in his 
environment which he overlooks. Over and above that, 
every bit of knowledge which affects his relations to man- 
kind or to the world without will serve to direct his action. 
Full knowledge so co-ordinated as to be always effective 
would mean perfect action. 
One fact which seems out of harmony with this state- 
ment is that we often find men who have full knowledge of 
what to do under all circumstances, who never accomplish 
anything, or at least fall far short of their best knowledge 
and even of their intentions. The difficulty in these cases 
is either that their knowledge is badly organised and so
-P-A-G-E-340
    330 Attention 
never available until too late, if at all, or more frequently 
they do not feel the full force of social pressure. They have 
not been forced to see that society demands action from 
them under these particular circumstances. It is, after all, 
an ignorance of certain principles, due to lack of training 
during the earlier years, which has often resulted in bad 
habits of action, and which it is very difficult to overcome 
by the knowledge of later acquirement. Nevertheless, 
failure to act when action is necessary, like improper action, 
has its ultimate seat in ignorance of the full and true re- 
lations of man to man and of man to his physical environ- 
ment. 
From the discussion in chapter x11 it appears that feeling 
has certain obvious similarities to the other processes 
mentioned above. It can be said in general that the 
feeling which one has for any object or process depends upon 
two factors : the knowledge which one has about the object, 
and upon the way in which one happens to be looking at it. 
Both of these are evidently very closely related to attention, 
if not absolutely dependent upon it. Perfect knowledge, 
with that knowledge effective at the moment, would imply 
correct feeling, as it implies correct acting. Training of the 
feelings cannot be an isolated process, but must depend 
upon training.in general—upon the acquirement and proper 
organisation of knowledge.

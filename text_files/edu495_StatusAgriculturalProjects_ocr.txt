Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Purpose of THE STUDY. 
The Smith-Hughes Act, which went into effect July 1, 1917, 
requires that ‘schools receiving Federal aid for agricultural 
instruction shall provide for directed or supervised practice 
in agriculture for at least six months every year. Schools re- 
ceiving’ Federal aid for vocational agriculture are expected to 
devote not less than 50 per cent of the school time to instruc- 
tion in agriculture, including supervised practical work.’ This 
requirement is interpreted to mean that there should be not 
less than 90 minutes :of actual instruction in agriculture at 
the schools and not less than an average of 90 minutes every 
day of supervised practical work. The home project in agri- 
culture, it is claimed, is the most effective method of meeting 
the requirement in supervised practical; work. 
(The Home Project as a Phase of Vocational Agricultural 
Education, Bul. No. 21, pp. 5-6). 
Such quantitative phases of agricultural projects as scope 
(size), net profit, and hours of labor should be measured with 
considerable accuracy. The Federal agents for the South have 
agreed upon minimum standards in scope (size) and hours of 
labor for all agricultural projects for this section. From avail- 
able published data thus far, however, it is practically impos- 
sible to determine the true status of individual agricultural 
projects in the South. The various states report to the Federal 
Board for Vocational Education the total number of pupils 
enrolled in vocational agriculture, the total scope (size), and 
the total net profit derived from these projects. The following 
examples are typical of the annual reports made by the states 
to the Federal Board for Vocational Education: “There 
were enrolled during the year 1921-22 a total of 1,311 pupils 
in all day classes taking 1,078 different farm projects covering 
a scope of 3,388 acres, 2,638 birds, and 898 animals. The su- 
pervised farm project work started during the year 1920-21 
and completed during the year 1921-22 yielded a total profit of 
$26,761.04 made by students enrolled in vocational classes.” 
Another southern state reported: “The 340 all day white 
pupils were enrolled in 344 different farm enterprises as project 
work, with a scope of 1,033 acres, 26,000 nurseries, 1,774 poul- 
try, and 143 animals. The 233 boys in the white high schools 
completed their supervised farm practice work that was started
-P-A-G-E-10
6 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
during the previous year ; these boys made a profit of $12,799.14, 
which was a return of 78 cents on every dollar expended for 
salaries of teachers of vocational agriculture.” 
(Annual Report of Federal Board for Vocational Educa- 
tion to Congress for 1922 pp. 105 and 121). 
The reports mentioned above, and others which could be 
given, serve to show in a measure how limited our knowledge 
is of the true status of individual agricultural projects in the 
South. Occasionally certain states report the average scope, 
net profit, and hours of labor for various projects, but these 
data are not sufficient for reliable comparisons of individual 
projects. To what extent extreme cases have influenced 
the averages cannot be determined when the totals and the 
averages only are given. 
The purpose of this study is to learn the true status of 
agricultural projects in the South. The problems involved 
are: 1. How do the agricultural projects in the South com- 
pare with the standards for measuring projects? 2. How do 
projects vary in size, net profit, and in hours of labor? 3. How 
do the various projects rank in net profit per (hour) unit of 
labor? 4. As measured by net profit per project and net profit 
per (hour) unit of labor, what types of projects are most de- 
sirable? 5. What is the relationship of size to net profit? 6. 
‘What progress has been made by the Southern states in voca- 
tional agriculture, as measured by the addition of new schools 
and the increased number of pupils enrolled since 1917-18? 
Scorz. 
This study is restricted to such quantitative phases of agri- 
cultural projects as scope, net profit, and hours of labor. Scope 
in this study simply means- how large a project is in terms of 
so Many acres, so many birds, or so many animals. Size and 
scope have the same meaning in this study when reference is 
made to the area or the magnitude of projects. The reason for 
using the term scope in the tables is that it was so used in re- 
ports studied. Net profit means the total profit after all ex- 
penses have been deducted. Hours of labor mean the actual 
time devoted to projects. Each project requires a certain 
amount of work, which is measured in terms of hours of labor. 
The various kinds of projects, such as projects on field 
crops, live-stock, dairying, and horticulture are compared in 
scope, net profit, and in hours of labor with the standards 
recommended for the South. (Table 1.) These projects are 
also compared with each other in these respects. 
The material in general is treated on the basis of the indi- 
vidual projects reported by seven of the southern states. It is
-P-A-G-E-11
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South qT 
believed that the states reporting individual projects represent 
a fair sampling of the southern states. However, the averages 
(arithmetic means) of these representative individual projects 
are compared with the averages of all projects completed in the 
South in “scope,” net profit, and hours of labor. 
No attempt is made in this study to show the most desirable 
“scope,” net profit, and hours of labor for agricultural projects 
for the South. No attempt is made to justify the standards 
by which these projects are measured. Such conclusions and 
suggestions are made as the facts in this study seem to war- 
rant. 
Data 
The data used in this study are taken from the reports of 
vocational agricultural teachers of tha southern states for the 
year 1920-21. The data were procured through the state super- 
visors and directors of vocational agriculture of the South. 
Letters were written to state supervisors and directors of vo- 
cational agriculture asking for confidential information on this 
subject. 
The seven states which furnished a complete record of in- 
dividual project data are Texas, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia (Virginia fur- 
nished only a partial report, which made it necessary to sub- 
stitute West Virginia for this state). These seven states re- 
ported a complete record of 2,790 individual projects for 
1920-21. 
In addition to the data furnished on individual projects by 
the seven states referred to above, five other states reported 
partial data on projects for 1920-21. These differed from the oth- 
ers in giving totals only. The states furnishing partial data are 
Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. 
Each of these five states reported the total number of pupils 
enrolled in the various projects, the total “scope,” the total 
net profit, and the total number of hours of labor devoted to 
these projects for 1920-21. These five states included a total 
of 2,599 projects completed for this year. The 2,790 individual 
projects reported by the seven states furnishing complete data, 
and the 2,599 projects reported by the five states furnishing 
partial data combined make a total of 5,289 for the twelve 
states included in this study. 
Without the co-operation of the supervisors and diecios 
of vocational agriculture this study could not have been made. 
It would have been very difficult, if it could have been accom- 
plished at all, to gather these data directly from teachers of

state or Federal reports. 
The statistical procedure used in this study is based princi- 
pally on “Rugg’s Statistical Methods Applied to Education,” 
in which the terms and processes used are clearly defined.

Data in Table 1 show the standards by which agents of the 
Federal Board for Vocational Education measure projects. 
These standards require a minimum of 180 hours of labor for 
all projects. The size of each kind of project is determined by 
this labor unit (180 hours). The projects included in this 
study are compared with these minimum standards.

“Method: 
“The labor involved in the care of a dairy cow for one year 
was taken as a unit. This has been estimated at 18 days of 
ten hours each, or 180 hours. 
“Such numbers of other animals were taken as a’unit, the 
care of which would approximate the same hours of labor. 
“Tt was determined that 414 acres of corn, on the average, 
require 180 hours of labor. This was taken as a basis for 
evaluating all crop projects: that is, if, for example, it requires 
three times as much labor to produce an acre of potatoes as it 
does an acre of corn, the unit of labor for potatoes would be 
1/8 the acres in a unit of corn, or 114 acres, and so on.”

Data in Table 2 show that the number of vocational schools 
of agriculture in the South ranged from 4 to 31 in 1917-18; 
from 10 to 33 in 1918-19; from 12 to 76 in 1919-20; and from 
14 to 74 in 1920-21. Florida had fewer schools than the other 
states for each year, except 1918-19 when Oklahoma and Flori- 
da had the same number. Texas had the greatest number of 
schools each year, except in 1918-19 when Mississippi surpassed 
Texas by two schools. It should be noted that Oklahoma 
dropped from 13 schools in 1917-18 to 10 schools in 1918-19, 
and that Texas dropped from 76 schools in 1919-20 to 74 in 
1920-21. Texas maintained the same number of schools for 
1917-18 and 1918-19, and Mississippi did likewise for 1918-19 
and 1919-20. With the exceptions mentioned, each state in- 
creased the number of schools of the consecutive years indicated 
in Table 2. For growth in number of schools established and 
number of pupils enrolled in vocational agriculture by years, 
see Graphs 1 and 2. 
The total number of schools ranged from 173 in 1917-18 to

ber of schools for the entire South increased each year. There 
was a wide variation from the average each year, except for 
1920-21 when 50 per cent of the states were above and 50 per 
cent were below the average in number of schools. More than 
80 per cent of the states were below the average in number of 
schools in 1919-20. The variation of number of schools per 
state from the average for all the states included in Table 2 
was greatest in 1919-20.

12 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The greatest per cent of increase in number of schools per 
state in 1918 and 1919 over 1917-18 was made by North Caro- 
lina, which increased 175 per cent. Alabama ranked second 
and Florida third in this respect. This large percentage in- 
crease was probably due to the small number of schools estab- 
lished in these states in 1917-18. Arkansas led in the percent- 
age of increase of schools in 1919-20 over 1918-19. Texas ranked 
second in this respect during this period. The percentage of 
increase in number of schools for the 12 Southern states in 
1919-20 over 1918-19 was decidedly superior to any other period. 
To put it another way, the greatest growth in number of 
schools took place during the scholastic years of 1918-19 and 
1919-20. With the exception of Texas, all of the Southern 
states showed a slight increase in number of schools in 1920-21 
over 1919-20. (Table 3). The percentage of increase in num- 
ber of schools for 1920-21 over the preceding year was less than 
for any period previous to this time.

The number of pupils enrolled in vocational agriculture 
ranged from 65 to 815 by states in 1917-18. Of the 3,762 pupils 
enrolled in 1917-18, Georgia ranked first with 815, while Missis- 
sippi ranked second with 725, and Texas third with 553 pupils. 
Florida ranked lowest with an enrollment of only 65, while 
Alabama ranked next to Florida with 97 pupils. Data in 
Table 2 show that the average number of pupils enrolled in 
1917-18 for the 12 Southern states was 313.5. Of the 12 states, 
9 or 75 per cent of them, were below the average in enrollment 
in 1917-18. 
The number of ‘pupils enrolled in 1918-19 ranged from 139 
to 921. Georgia enrolled more pupils than any of the other 
states, with Mississippi a close second in rank. Again the low-
-P-A-G-E-17
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 13 
est rank was made by Florida, which rank wag maintained each 
year. South Carolina was nearest the average in enrollment 
for 1918-19. The average number of pupils enrolled per state 
for the 12 states was surpassed by only 33.33 per cent of the 
states. This means that 66.66 per cent of the states were below 
the average in enrollment. The enrollment in Mississippi and 
Georgia was more than double the average for the 12 states, 
while Florida was less than one-third the average in enroll- 
ment. ' 
The number of pupils enrolled in 1919-20 ranged from 211 
in Florida to 1580 in Mississippi. Georgia came second to 
Mississippi in enrollment, while Texas ranked third. South 
Carolina came nearest to the average in number of pupils en- 
rolled for this year. The enrollment in Mississippi was more 
than double the average. 
In 1920-21 the enrollment ranged from 252 in Florida to 
1477 in Mississippi. As compared with Mississippi in rank 
Georgia was second, Texas was third, and Arkansas was fourth 
in number of pupils enrolled in 1920-21. 
Data in Table 4 show that the total enrollment for the 12 
states ranged from 3,762 in 1917-18 to 10,051 in 1920-21. The 
greatest percentage of increase in enrollment was in 1919-20. 
The greatest percentage of increase for this year over the pre- 
ceding year was made by Arkansas, which increased 167.45 per 
cent. The percentage of increase over the preceding year for 
the 12 states was 76.12, which was more than double the per- 
centage of any other period. 
The total number of pupils enrolled in vocational agricul- 
ture in the 12 Southern states in 1917-18 was 3,762, while the 
total number in 1920-21 reached 10,051, which was an increase 
of 165.57 per cent from 1917-18 to 1920-21. For this period the 
percentage of increase in number of pupils enrolled by states 
in order of rank was as follows: Tennessee ranked first with 
an increase of 621.60 per cent during this period; Alabama, 
second, with an increase of 592.70 per cent; North Carolina, 
third, with 529.20 per cent increase; Louisiana, fourth, with an 
increase of 314.45 per cent; Arkansas, fifth, with an increase 
of 297.64 per cent; Florida, sixth, with an increase of 287.18 
per cent; Virginia, eighth, with an increase of 175.28 per cent; 
Mississippi, ninth, with an increase of 100.95 per cent, Okla- 
homa, tenth, with an increase of 89.15 per cent; Texas, elev- 
enth, with an increase of 83.90 per cent; and Georgia, twelfth, 
with an increase of 52.27 per cent. (Table 4).

Data in. Table 5 show. that Georgia ranked first in number 
of pupils enrolled in vocational agriculture in 1917-18 and also 
in 1918-19, while Mississippi ranked second for this period. In 
1919-20 and in 1920-21 Mississippi ranked first in enrollment, 
while Georgia ranked second. Mississippi ranked first in aver- 
age enrollment for the four years, while Georgia ranked second. 
Texas held the third place in enrollment for each year. Arkan- 
sas rose from rank 7 in 1917-18 and rank 9 in 1918-19 to rank 
4 in 1919-20 and 1920-21, with an average of rank 4 for the 
four years. Florida ranked 12 for each year. Mississippi, 
Georgia, Texas, and Arkansas seem to represent the most uni- 
form growth for the four year period. Oklahoma fell from 
rank 4 in 1917-18 to rank 11 in 1920-21, with an average of 
rank 10 for the four years. The greatest percentage of in- 
crease in enrollment the fourth year over the first year was 
made by Tennessee, while the least was made by Georgia. Ten- 
nessee went from rank 9 the first year (1917-18) 1o rank 5 the 
fourth year (1920-21), while Georgia went from rank 1 the 
first year to rank 2 the fourth year. (See Graph 38). 
Summary. 
The number of vocational schools of agriculture established 
in 1917-18 ranged from 4 to 31, with an average of 14.42 schools 
per state. 
(Table 2). The number of pupils enrolled in vocational 
agricultural schools in 1917-18 ranged from 65 to 815, with an 
average of 313.50 pupils per state. In 1920-21, the number of 
schools ranged from 14 to 74, with an average of 36.28 schools 
per state. The number of pupils enrolled in 1920-21 ranged 
from 252 to 1,477, with an average of 837.58 pupils per state 
(based on 12 states). The total number of schools for the 12 
southern states wag 173 in 1917-18 and 448 in 1920-21. The
-P-A-G-E-19
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 15 
total number of pupils enrolled in vocational agriculture was 
3,762 in 1917-18 and 10,051 in 1920-21. 
(Table 2). The greatest growth for the 12 states was in 
1919-20 over 1918-19, during which time the increase in number 
of schools established over the preceding year was 63.52 per 
cent. 
(Table 3). The growth in number of vocational schools of 
agriculture established and in the number of pupils enrolled 
during these four years indicate an increased interest in voca- 
tional agriculture from year to year. 
As measured by the number of pupils enrolled in vocational 
agriculture in each of the 12 states during the four year period, 
Georgia ranked first in 1917-18 and in 1918-19, while Mississippi 
ranked second during these two years. This order wag reversed 
in 1919-20 and in 1920-21 when Mississippi ranked first and 
Georgia ranked second. Texas ranked third and Florida 
ranked twelfth in enrollment each year. 
(Table 5). When the average enrollment per year for the 
four year period is considered, the order of the states accord- 
ing to rank would be as follows: Rank number 1, Mississippi; 
rank number 2, Georgia; rank number 3, Texas; rank number 
4, Arkansas; rank number 5, South Carolina; rank number 6, 
Tennessee; rank number 7, Virginia; rank number 8, North 
Carolina; rank number 9, Alabama; rank number 10, Okla- 
homa; rank number 11, Louisiana; and rank number 12, Flori- 
da. (Table 5 and Graph 3).

  CHAPTER III. 
A STUDY OF PROJECT DATA RELATING TO FIELD 
CROPS. 
The project data tabulated on the following pages are taken 
directly from the reports of vocational agricultural high schools 
of the Southern States for the year ending in the fall of 1921. 
For a complete report of the original data, see Appendix B of 
this study.* 
For convenience in discussing these data, each state is as- 
signed an arbitrary number. The numbers of the states are 
given in connection with the tables on project data. In connec- 
tion with each table, a reference to the Appendix is given. The 
reference to the Appendix enables one to learn the identity of 
the states. 
Corron Prosects. 
Of the seven states reporting individual projects for 1920-21, 
only five reported cotton projects. These states, however, with 
the exception of one state, represent the leading cotton produc- 
ing states of the South. 
(Appendix B, Tables 1, 12, 31, 40, 49). 
These reports, therefore, should serve as a fair sampling of 
the cotton projects completed in the South in 1920-21. 
The 165 individual cotton projects reported by the five 
states referred to above are grouped in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
The projects reported by states were as follows: State 
Number One, 47; State Number Two, 16; State Number Four, 
62; State Number Five, 23; and State Number Six, 17 projects. 
As compared with the total number of projects completed, it 
is somewhat surprising to note that some of the Southern 
states ranked low in the percentage of cotton projects assigned. 
This point is brought out more clearly later in this discussion. 
  
*Appendix B is composed of tables arranged by states, and includes the 
original data on which this study is based. It is not needed for an understanding 
of this dissertation, but is filed for purposed of varification. It is on file in the 
Library of George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tenn.

Scope or Size.—The data in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 show 
a wide variation in the size (scope) of cotton projects for 
1920-21. The size varied from one-half acre in “State Number
-P-A-G-E-28
  24 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
Six” to 40 acres in “State Number One.” The median cotton 
project ranged in size from 1.62 acres in “State Number Six” 
to 4.67 acres in “State Number Four.” The median in each 
state was above the standard (1.5 acres) in size. (Table 1). 
The median and the average (arithmetic mean) are identi- 
cal in “State Number Two,” but they differ widely for some of 
the other states. As indicated by the upper quartile in Table 
6, nearly 75 per cent of the cotton projects in “State Number 
One” were below the average in size. This simply means that 
the average was influenced largely by a few extreme cases in 
some of the states, and that the average in such cases is not a 
reliable central tendency, so far as pointing out the central 
point in the distribution is concerned. The size of cotton 
projects in “State Number One” was more variable than the 
other states. (Table 6). 
Data in Table 8 show that the median cotton project in 
“State Number Four” was considerably larger than in the 
other states. The lower quartile shows that 75 per cent of the 
projects were above 2.38 acres in size, while the standard calls 
for only 1.5 acres. (Table 1). 
The lower quartile in Table 9 shows that 75 per want or 
more of the cotton projects in “State Number Five” were above 
the standard in size. The largest individual project was in 
“State Number One,” while the smallest individual project was 
in “State Number Six.” (Tables 6, 10). 
The average project was largest for “State Number Four,” 
while the average was smallest for “State Number Six.” 
(Tables 8, 10). 
Net Profit: —The net profit per project for cotton projects 
ranged from zero, or a loss, to $430.83. The net profit for the 
median cotton project ranged from $31.25 in “State Number 
One” to 88.28 in “State Number Two.” The average net profit 
ranged from $57.62 in “State Number One” to $91.59 in “State 
Number Two.” The median net profit per project for cotton 
projects by states in order of rank in 1920-21 was as follows: 
“State Number Two” ranked 1; “State Number Five,” 2; “State 
Number Four,” 3; “State Number Six,” 4; and “State Number 
One,” 5. It should be noted that the median for “State Number 
Two” represents the median number, and not the mid point. 
This is true for all of the data in Table 7. _ 
Hours of Labor.—The number of hours of labor per project 
ranged from 10 in “State Number Five” to 890 in “State Num- 
ber Four.” (Tables 8, 9). 
The hours of labor for the median cotton project in the 
South for 1920-21 by states in order of rank were as follows: 
“State Number Four” ranked 1, with 291.67 hours; “State
-P-A-G-E-29
  Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 25 
Number Six” ranked 2, with 135.00 hours; “State Number Five” 
ranked 38, with 115.00 hours; “State Number Two” ranked 4, 
with 113.00 hours; and “State Number One” ranked 5, with 
53.00 hours. The same order of rank by states was maintained 
for the average number of hours of labor per project for each 
state. (Tables 6, 7, 8, 9,10). 
The median cotton project was up to the standard in hours 
of labor in 1920-21 in only one of the five states reporting, 
namely, “State Number Four.” (Table 8). 
Data in Tables 6, 7, and 10 show that 75 per cent of cotton 
projects in states number “One, Two, and Six” were below the 
standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. The upper quartile for 
“State Number Five” was only 182.25 hours of labor, while the 
standard calls for 180 hours as the minimum for all projects. 
This means that practically 75 per cent of the cotton projects 
were below the standard in hours of labor for this state. 
The net profit per hour of labor for median cotton projects 
ranged from 19 cents in “State Number Four” to 76 cents in 
“State Number Two.” The rank of each state in this respect 
is illustrated in Graph 4. The net profit per hour of labor for 
the average cotton project for each state was as follows; “State 
Number Two,” 74 cents; “State Number One,” 70 cents; “State 
Number Five,” 55 cents; “State Number Six,” 43 cents; and 
“State Number Four,” 26 cents. (Obtained by dividing the 
average net profit for each project by the average number of 
hours labor). 
As measured by the median net profit per project, “State 
Number Two” ranked highest, while “State Number One” 
ranked lowest. As measured by net profit per hour of labor 
for the median project “State Number Two” ranked highest, 
while “State Number Four” ranked lowest. Thus “State Num- 
ber Two” ranked 2 in size and 1 in net profit per project and 
also 1 in net profit per hour of labor. “State Number Four” 
ranked 1 in size and in hours of labor, and lowest in net profit 
per hour of labor. It should be noted, however, that “State 
Number Two” completed only 16 cotton projects, which is a 
small number to compare with the states which completed a 
greater number. Graph 4 shows the scope, net profit, hours of 
labor, and net profit per hour of labor for median cotton proj- 
ects by states. 
Summary of Cotton Projects.—Data in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 
10 are summarized in Table 11. For the 165 projects reported 
by five states, the median cotton project in 1920-21 was 3.11 
acres in size, yielded a net profit of $43.89, and received 141.67 
hours of labor. The net profit per hour of labor for the median 
project was 31 cents; for the average project the net profit per
-P-A-G-E-30
26 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
hour of labor was 38 cents. The median cotton project was 
above the standard (1.5 acres) in size, but considerably below 
the standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. As measured by 
the minimum requirements in labor, the median cotton project, 
which received only 141.67 hours of labor, should have received 
373.20 hours. The co-efficient of variation shows that net profit 
wag more variable than either hours of labor or size. The 
average cotton project for the 165 individual projects was 3.91 
acres in size, brought a net profit of $74.41, and received 
192.87 hours of labor. The average for all of the southern 
states for cotton projects (380 projects) was 3.35 acres in size, 
brought a net, profit of $77.43, and received 201.71 hours of 
labor. Thesé data show that the averages for the 165 individ- 
ual projects compare favorably with the averages for the 380 
grouped projects. 
Correlations.—What is the relationship, if any, of size of 
cotton projects to the net profit? To what extent will the in- 
crease in the size of a cotton project be accompanied by an in- 
crease in net profit? To what extent will a decrease in size be 
accompanied by a decrease in net profit? The relationship of 
size to labor requirements and the relationship of net profit 
to labor requirements will involve similar problems. In order 
to determine these relationships correlation coefficients have 
been used. A positive correlation shows that when one vari- 
able increases, the other increases also, and vice versa. A neg- 
ative correlation shows that when one variable increases, the 
other decreases, and vice versa. (Rugg’s Statistical Methods 
Applied to Education, p. 255). 
A perfect positive correlation gives r (coefficient of corre- 
lation) as plus 1; a perfect negative correlation gives r as 
minus 1. According to Rugg a coefficient of correlation is 
“negligible” or “indifferent” when r is less than .15 to .20; “pres- 
ent, but low” when r ranges from .15 or .20 to .35 or .40; 
“marked” when r ranges from .35 or .40 to:.50 or .60; “high” 
when r is above .60 or .70. (Rugg’s Statistical Methods Ap- 
plied to Education, p. 256). 
The probable error (P.E.) shows the variation in the 
coefficient of correlation. “The chances that the true value 
(of the average, standard deviation, coefficient of correlation, 
ete.) lies within: P.E. are 1 to 1 (50 per cent of measures fall 
within P.E.); 2 P.E. are 4.5 to 1; 3 P.E. are 21 to 1; 4 P.E. 
are 142 to 1. Conservative practice insists that the coefficient 
be at least four times the size of the probable error.” (Rugg’s 
Statistical Methods Applied to Education, pp. 230-231). 
Rugg’s tabular method of computing r is used throughout 
this discussion. (Rugg’s Statistical Methods Applied to Edu- 
cation, p. 263).
-P-A-G-E-31
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 27 
The problem under consideration shows a positive corre- 
lation of a marked degree between size and net profit for cotton 
projects. The coefficient of correlation (r) was .51 with P.E. 
.038. This indicates that an increase in size of these projects 
would be accompanied by an increase in net profit. The cor- 
relation between size and hours of labor is .438, with P.E. .040. 
This is marked and the probable error is low, which probably 
means that the relationship is even greater than the coefficient 
indicates. The correlation between hours of labor and net 
profit is .27, with P.E. .047. This is a low correlation, but it 
is significant because the probable error is low. The regression 
of labor on net profit indicates that an additional hour of labor 
is accompanied by 32 cents in net profit. This compares favor- 
ably with the net profit per hour of labor for the median cotton 
project, which was 31 cents. 
As has already been pointed out, there were positive corre- 
lations between the size and net profit, between the size and 
hours of labor, and between net profit and hours of labor for 
cotton projects for 1920-21. What would be the relationship 
of size to net profit with hours of labor kept constant or con- 
trolled? Partial correlations attempt to determine the cause 
of the correlation of two variables with the effect of other 
variables removed. Would the correlation between the size 
and the net profit of cotton projects remain the same if it were 
not for the effects of the variable hours of labor, devoted to 
these projects? In the problem under consideration, r 12 
represents the total correlation between the size and net profit 
which is .51; r 18, correlation between size and hours of labor, 
which is .43; r 23, correlation between net profit and hours of 
labor which is .27. Yule’s formula for partial correlation is: 
12 3g t3 — 113 123 
mee (TF 13) i (1123) 
(Yule’s Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, p. 238). 
If r 12 (correlation between size and net profit) with 3 out ap- 
proaches zero, the probabilities are that labor and not size is 
the casual factor in r 12. If r 12.3 approximately equals r 12, 
then the probabilities are that hours of labor is not the casual 
factor. The correlation between size and net profit in this 
problem with labor kept constant is .45. This probably means 
that labor was not a cause of the correlation between size and 
net profit, since this approaches r 12 which was .51. Eliminat- 
ing the influence of labor reduced the correlation coefficient 
only slightly.

Scope or Size—Data in Tables 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 
show that corn projects for 1920-21 ranged in size from 0.12 of 
an acre in “State Number Seven” to 20 acres in “States Num- 
ber Four and Six.” The median corn projects was below the 
minimum standard (4.5 acres) in all of the states. As shown 
in Graph 5, the median corn project ranged from 1.28 acres in 
size to 3.50 acres. The lower limit was represented by “State 
Number Seven” and the upper limit by “State Number Six.”  
-P-A-G-E-37
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 37 
The median size for each state is given in order of rank in 
Graph 5. The average (arithmetic mean) size for each state 
was slightly superior to the median. The coefficient of varia- 
tion shows that corn projects were more variable in size in 
“State Number One.” 
Net Profit.—The net profit per project for corn ranged from 
zero, or a loss to $840.00 in “State Number Six.” The median net 
profit ranged from $16.25 to $52.73. The states in order of rank 
were as follows: “State Number Seven,” $52.73; “State Num- 
ber Four,” $44.23; “State Number Five,” $36.67; “State Num- 
ber Six,” $26.18; “State Number Three,” $23.00; “State Num- 
ber Two,” $16.76; and “State Number One,” $16.25. The median 
net profit for each state is illustrated in Graph 5. The average 
net profit per project ranged from $24.61 in “State Number 
Two” to $72.45 in “State Number Seven.” In each state the 
average (arithmetic mean) was above the median in net profit. 
The coefficient of variation shows that net profit was more 
variable in “State Number One.” 
Hours of Labor.—The number of hours of labor devoted to 
corn projects in 1920-21 ranged from 1 in “State Number Two” 
to 1,060 in “State Number Six.” The range in “State Number 
Six” was from 12 to 1,060 hours of labor. The upper quartile 
in only one state was up to the minimum standard (180 hours) 
in hours of labor. This means that 75 per cent of the corn 
projects in each state, except one, were below the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. (Table 15). 
The upper quartile in “State Number Four” was 194.62 
hours of labor, while the standard calls for a minimum of 180 
hours. (Table 1). 
“State Number Four” represented less than 17 per cent of 
the total individual corn projects included in this study, which 
puts these high scores in the upper part of the upper 25 per 
cent of the corn projects. This point is brought out in the sum- 
mary table, which shows that 75 per cent of the corn projects - 
were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. The 
median corn projects ranged in hours of labor from 45.00 in 
“State Number One” to 117.69 in “State Number Four.” The 
median number of hours of labor devoted to corn projects by 
states in order of rank was as follows: “State Number Four,” 
117.69; “State Number Seven,” 102.86; “State Number Six,” 
86.15; “State Number Three,” 84.00; “State Number Two,” 
74.73; “State Number Five,” 54.00; and “State Number One,” 
45.00. Graph 5 illustrates the median hours of labor by states 
in order of rank. The median number of hours of labor for 
five states was less than one-half the minimum standard (180  
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
hours). The median for “State Number One” was only one- 
fourth the standard. (Table 12). 
The upper quartile shows that 75 per cent of the projects in 
“State Number One” were less than one-half the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. The average number of hours of 
labor ranged from 64,49 in “State Number One” to 165.65 in 
“State Number Four.” The average in each state was higher 
than the median in hours of labor. 
The net proft per hour of labor for median corn, projects 
ranged from 22 cents in “State Number Two” to 68 cents in 
“State Number Five.” The net profit per hour of labor for 
median corn projects by states in order of rank was as follows: 
“State Number Five” ranked 1, with 68 cents; “State Number 
Seven” ranked 2, ith 51 cents; “State Number Four” ranked 
38, with 37 cents; “State Number One” ranked 4, with 36 cents; 
“State Number Six” ranked 5, with 30 cents; “State Number 
Three” ranked 6, with 27 cents; and “State Number Two” 
ranked 7, with 22 cents. The rank of each state in this respect 
is illustrated in Graph 5. 
As measured by the median net profit per project, “State 
Number Seven” ranked highest, while “State Number One” 
ranked lowest. As measured by net profit per hour of labor 
for the median corn project, “State Number Five” ranked high- 
est, and “State Number Two” ranked lowest. Graph 5 shows 
that “State Number Seven” ranked lowest in size, highest in 
net profit, second in hours of labor and second in net profit 
per hour of labor. 
Summary of Corn Projects.—Data relating to corn projects 
are summarized in Table 19. The median corn project for 
1920-21 was 2.61 acres in size, brought a net profit of $28.59, 
and received 84.88 hours of labor. The upper quartile shows 
that 75 per cent of the 574 individual corn projects included 
in this study were below the minimum standard (4.50 acres) 
in size. (Table 19). 
The middle bee cent ranged from 1.61 to 4.4 acres, while 
the standard calls for a minimum of 4.5 acres. (Table 1). 
The range in size was from 0.12 of an acre to 20 acres. The 
range in net profit was from zero or a loss to $840.00. The mid- 
dle 50 per cent ranged in net profit from $13.05 to $53.46. The 
range in hours of labor was from 1 to 1,060. The upper quartile 
shows that 75 per cent of the projects were considerably below 
the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. The aver- 
age corn project for the 574 individual projects was 2.99 acres 
in size, brought a net profit of $40.10, and received 111.96 hours 
of labor. (Table 19).
-P-A-G-E-39
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 39 
The average corn project for all of the southern states 
(1,268 projects) was 3.10 acres in size, brought a net profit of 
$35.09, and received 109.06 hours of labor.. (Appendix A, Table 
75). 
The average project for the 574 individual corn projects in- 
cluded in this study compare favorably in size, net profit, and 
in hours of labor with the average for the 1,268 projects com- 
pleted in all of the southern states in 1920-21. 
Correlations.—The coefficient of correlation between size of 
corn projects and net profit was positive, but low. The prob- 
able error was low, which renders the coefficient reliable. The 
relationship was probably even greater than the coefficient of 
correlation indicates. The coefficient of correlation was higher 
between size and hours of labor than between size and net 
profit, r being .53 for the former and .32 for the latter. (Table 
19). 
The coefficient of correlation between net profit and hours 
of labor was .39 with P. E.+-.020. This is a marked correlation 
coefficient, and the P. E. renders it reliable. The regression 
of size on profit indicates that an increase of one acre in size 
would be accompanied by an increase of 25 cents in net profit. 
This seems to indicate that net profit did not depend upon size 
as much as upon some other factor. The regression of hours 
of labor on net profit shows that an increase of one hour of 
labor would probably be accompanied by an increase of 31 
cents in net profit. The regression shows also that if 180 (180 
hours minimum standard) hours of labor had been devoted to 
corn projects the net profit would have been $61.19. This is more 
than double the median net profit, which was only $28.59. The 
upper quartile shows that 75 per cent of the corn projects were 
below this amount in net profit. These data seem to indicate 
that net profit depended more upon: labor than upon size with 
these particular projects. 
What would be the relationship between size and net profit 
with hours of labor devoted to projects constant, or controlled? 
_ The total correlation of size and net profit was .32+.025. With 
the influence of labor controlled or kept constant, this correla- 
tion was reduced to .14. This indicates probably that the 
number of hours of labor devoted to projects of this type was 
an important factor in the relationship of size to net profit. 
The median corn project was 2.61 acres in size and received 
84.88 hours of labor. At the rate of 180 hours of labor for 4.5 
acres, which the minimum standards require, 1 acre should 
require 40 hours of labor. At this rate the median corn proj- 
ect, which was 2.61 acres in size, should have received 104.40 
hour of labor. The upper quartile, which was 4,40 acres, should 
have received 176.00 hours of labor. The upper quartile in
-P-A-G-E-40
40 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
hours of labor was only 142.19, which means that 75 per cent 
of the corn projects were considerably below the estimated 
hours referred to above. 
 Porato Prosects. 
The seven states furnishing data on individual projects re- 
ported a total of 269 potato projects. The number reported 
by each state was as follows: “State Number One,” 35 proj- 
ects; “State Number Two,” 64; “State Number Three,” 26; 
“State Number Four,” 29; “State Number Five,” 10; “State 
Number Six,” 66; and “State Number Seven,” 39. These proj- 
ects are grouped in Tables 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26. All of 
the tables are summarized in Table 27. Graph 6 illustrates the 
median scope or size, the median net profit, the median number 
of hours of labor devoted to potato projects, and the net profit 
per hour of labor for the median project.

Scope or Size.—Potato projects for 1920-21, as indicated in 
Table 27, ranged in size from 0.1 of an acre to 10 acres. The 
range in “State Number One” was from 0.1 of an acre to 1 
acre. In “State Number Four,” the range was from 0.12 of an 
acre to 10 acres. The coefficient of variation shows that the 
size was more variable in this state than any other state. 
(Table 23).
-P-A-G-E-49
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 49 
The median in each state was below the minimum standard 
in size (1.5 acres). The medians in four states were less than 
one-half the minimum standard in size. (Graph 6). 
The average (arithmetic mean) size in each state, except 
in “State Number Two,” was slightly superior to the median. 
In “State Number Two,” the average was identical with the 
median in size. (Table 21). 
Net Profit—The net profit per project for potato projects 
ranged from zero or a loss to $309.50. In each state the lower 
limit was zero or a loss in net profit per project. The highest 
limit (899.50) was reached by “State Number Three.” The 
median net profit ranged from $16.43 to $57.22. The median 
net profit by states in order of rank was as follows: “State 
Number Seven” ranked 1, with $57.22; “State Number Four” 
ranked 2, with $48.30; “State Number Five” ranked 3, with 
$33.75; “State Number Six” ranked 4, with $25.91; “State 
Number Three” ranked 5, with $25.00; “State Number Two” 
ranked 6, with $24.00; and “State Number One” ranked 7, with 
$16.43. (Graph 6). 
The average net profit per project ranged from $34.49 in 
“State Number Two” to $77.44 in “State Number Four.” 
(Tables 21, 23). 
The coefficient of variation shows that net profit was more 
variable in “State Number Two.” (Table 21). 
Hours of Labor.—The number of hours of labor devoted to 
potato projects ranged from 6 in “State Number Two” to 351.5 
in “State Number Six.” (Tables 21, 25). 
The upper quartile in each state was below the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. This means that 75 per cent of the 
projects were below the minimum standard (180 hours) in 
hours of labor. The upper quartile was less than one-half the 
standard in size in States number “One,” “Three,” “Five,” and 
“Seven.” (Tables 20, 22, 24, 26). 
The median number of hours of labor devoted to potato 
projects ranged from 43.65 in “State Number Five” to 62 in 
“State Number Four.” (Graph 6). 
The lowest median was a little more than one-fourth the 
standard in labor requirments, and the highest median was a 
little more than one-third the standard. (Graph 6). 
The average number of hours of labor ranged from 40.01 in 
“State Number Five” to 100.15 in “State Number Six.” (Tables 
24, 25). 
The coefficient of variation shows that “State Number Six” 
was more variable in hours of labor. (Table 25).

ranged from 11 cents in “State Number Seven” to 78 cents in 
“State Number Four.” (Graph 6). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median potato projects 
by states in order of rank was as follows: “State Number 
Four” ranked 1, with 78 cents; “State Number Five” ranked 
2, with 77 cents; “State Number Three ranked 3, with 53 cents; 
“State Number Six” ranked 4, with 49 cents; “State Number 
Two” ranked 5, with 39 cents; “State Number One” ranked 6, 
with 34 cents; and “State Number Seven” ranked 7, with 11 
cents. (Graph 6). 
As measured by the median, net profit per project, “State 
Number Seven” ranked highest, while “State Number One” 
ranked lowest. As measured by net profit per hour of labor for 
the median project, “State Number Seven” ranked lowest, “State 
Number One” ranked second from the bottom, while “State 
Number Four” ranked 1 in size, in hours of labor, net profit 
per hour of labor, and second from the top in net profit. 
(Graph 6). 
“State Number One” ranked lowest in size, net profit, second 
from the bottom in net profit per hour of labor, and 3 from the 
bottom in hours of labor. (Graph 6). 
Summary of Potato Projects—Data in Table 27 show that 
potato projects for 1920-21 ranged in size from 0.1 of an acre 
to 10 acres, from zero or a loss to $309.50 in net profit, and from 
6 to 851.5 hours of labor. The median potato project was less 
than one-half the minimum standard in size, and less than one- 
third the standard in hours of labor. The upper quartiles in 
Table 27 show that 75 per cent were below the minimum stand- 
ards in size and in hours of labor. (Table 1). 
The upper quartile was less than one-half the standard (180 
hours) in hours of labor. The average potato project for the © 
269 individual projects was 0.95 of an acre in size, yielded a net 
profit of $48.41, and received 73.33 hours of labor. The average 
potato project for all of the southern states for 1920-21 (437 
projects) was 0.90 of an acre in size, brought a net profit of 
$45.90 and received 87.38 hours of labor. (Appendix A, Table 
75). 
According to the standards in size and hours of labor, the 
median potato project, which received only 52.61 hours of labor, 
should have received 85.20 hours of labor. To put it another 
way, the median hours of labor devoted to potato projects was 
not sufficient for 0.71 of an acre. 
Correlations —The correlation between size and net profit 
for potato projects in 1920-21 was (r, .85-+.033) marked. The 
regression of size on net profit indicates that an increase of 1 
acre in size would have been accompanied by an increase of 35
-P-A-G-E-51
  
  Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 51 
cents in net profit. The regression of size on labor indicates 
that an additional acre in size would have required only 0.75 
of an hour of labor. The correlation between net profit and hours 
of labor (r, .20+.040) was low, but the probable error renders 
the correlation reliable, since the coefficient was more than 4 
times the probable error. The relationship between size and 
the amount of labor devoted to projects (r, .53-.026) was 
marked, but one would expect a high correlation between these 
two factors. The total correlation between size and net profit 
(rv, 854.033) is reduced from .35 to .29 when the influence 
of labor is kept constant. This indicates that the relationship 
between size and net profit was not influenced to any consider- 
able extent by labor. The total correlation between net profit 
and hours of labor (r, .20- .040) is reduced from .20 to .02 when 
the influence of the factor size is kept constant. This indicates 
that the relationship between net profit and the number of 
hours of labor devoted to potato projects depended upon the 
size of these projects.

crop projects for 1920-21. A total of 58 projects of this type 
was reported. The data relating to these projects were re 
ported in such terms that net profit and hours of labor only are 
included in this study. Since the number of miscellaneous

50 per cent ranged from $10.74 to $76.25. The average net 
profit was $42.87. 
Hours of Labor.—In hours of labor devoted to miscellaneous 
crop projects, the largest project received 90 times as much 
work as the smallest. The range was from 5 to 450 hours of 
labor. The upper quartile was only 134.28 hours, while the 
minimum standard calls for 180 hours of labor. This means 
that 75 per cent of the miscellaneous crop projects were below 
the minimum standard in hours of labor. The median (85.71 
hours) was less than one-half the standard in labor require- 
aments. The average in hours of labor was less than the median. 
(Table 28). 
Net profit per hour of labor was 28 cents for the median 
miscellaneous crop project and 57 cents for the average (arith- 
metic mean) project of this type. For the 168 miscellaneous 
¢rop projects reported by the 12 southern states for 1920-21, 
the net profit per hour of labor for the average project was 30 
cents. As measured by net profit per hour of labor, the median 
miscellaneous crop project ranked lower than cotton, corn, or 
potato projects. 
Summary of Miscellaneous Crop Projects—The median 
miscellaneous crop project brought a net profit of $24.44 and 
received 85.71 hours of labor. More than 75 per cent of these 
projects were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median project of this 
type was 28 cents, which is lower than cotton, corn, and pota- 
toes.

Scope or Size——Sugar cane projects ranged in size from 
0.12 of an acre to 1 acre. The upper quartile was slightly 
higher than the standard, which means that 25 per cent were 
well above the standard (1.00 acre). The median (0.57) was 
below the standard in size. The average was above the stand 
ard in size. The average is probably a better central tendency 
in this distribution than the median, since nearly one-half of
-P-A-G-E-55
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 55 
the cases lie in the interval which contains the average. (Table 
29). 
Net Profit.—Data in Table 29 show that sugar cane projects 
ranged from zero or a loss to $140.00 in profit. The middle 50 
per cent ranged from $23.00 to $65.00 in net profit. The median 
was $36.67 and the average was $47.05. The coefficient of varia- 
tion shows that net profit was more variable than either size 
or hours of labor. 
Hours of labor.—Sugar cane projects ranged from 5 to 288 
hours in labor. The upper quartile shows that 75 per cent were 
below the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. 
The median was less than one-half the standard in labor re- 
quirements. The lower quartile was a little more than one- 
third the minimum standard in hours of labor. The average 
number of hours of labor for sugar cane projects was 107.03. 
The coefficient of variation shows that these projects were more 
variable in hours of labor than in size, but less variable than 
net profit. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median sugar cane 
project was 44 cents. The net profit per hour of labor for the 
average sugar cane project (Average net profit divided by aver- 
age number of hours of labor) was identical with the net profit 
per hour of labor for the median project. 
Summary of Sugar Cane Projects.—Sugar cane projects for 
1920-21 ranged in size from 0.12 of an acre to 1 acre; in net 
profit from zero or a loss to $140.00; in hours of labor from 
5 to 288. The median sugar cane project was 0.57 of an acre in 
size, brought a net profit of $36.67, and received 83.33 hours of 
labor. (Table 29). 
The uper quartile in Table 29 shows that 75 per cent of the 
sugar cane projects were considerably below the minimum 
standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. (See Table 1 for 
standards). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median project was 
44 cents, which was identical with the net profit per hour of 
labor for the average sugar cane project. The net profit per 
hour of labor for all of the sugar cane projects in the South 
(based upon the average for 35 projects) averaged 48 cents. 
(Appendix A, Table 1). 
The average net profit per hour of labor for the 5,389 proj- 
ects for the South in 1920-21 was 47 cents. (Appendix A, 
Table 75). 
As measured by net profit per hour of labor for the average 
project, sugar cane projects were approximately up to the aver- 
age for the entire South. These projects were slightly above
-P-A-G-E-56
56 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
the average for the entire South in hours of labor, but a little 
below the average for the South in net profit. (Table 29, and 
Appendix A, Table 75). 
Correlations.—The correlation (r, .23-+.114) between size 
and net profit for sugar cane projects is positive, but low. 
(Table 29). 
The correlation (r, .19+.114) between size and hours of 
labor is also low. The probable error was sufficiently large in 
each case to render the correlations unreliable. The correla- 
tion (r, .49+.087) between net profit and hours of labor is 
positive and high. The correlation between net profit and 
hours of labor with the size of projects kept constant or con- 
trolled reduced the correlation coefficient from .49 to 47. This 
probably means that the relationship between net profit and 
labor was not influenced to any considerable degree by the 
variable “size” of projects. The regression of labor on net 
profit indicates that for 1 additional hour of labor the net 
profit would have been increased 49 cents. If 180 hours of 
labor (the minimum standard) had been devoted to sugar cane 
projects, the net profit might have been $82.80. The upper 
quartile in Table 29 shows that 75 per cent of these projects 
were below this amount in net profit. With the size of these 
projects kept constant, in all probability more hours of labor 
would have brought greater returns ag profits. As measured 
by the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor, the 
median sugar cahe project should have received 102.6 hours of 
labor. The number of hours actually devoted to the median 
was 83.33.

Scope or Size.—Data in Table 30 show that peanut projects 
for 1920-21 ranged from 0.25 of an acre to 18 acres in size. The 
upper quartile was 5.70 acres, which is above the standard 
(4.50 acres) in size. This means that 25 per cent of these proj- 
ects were considerably above the minimum standard in size. 
(Table 1).
-P-A-G-E-58
58 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The median was considerably below the standard. The 
lower quartile shows that 25 per cent were less than one-third 
the standard in size. Both the median and the average were 
below the minimum standard in size. (Table 30). 
The standard deviation shows that two-thirds of these proj- 
ects were below the standard in this respect. 
Net Profit.—The range in net profit for peanut projects was 
from $1.80 to $272.25. The middle 50 per cent ranged from 
$20.91 to $58.89. The median was $38.18 and the average was 
$50.34 in net profit. The net profit for the median peanut proj- 
ect ($38.18) was a little higher than for sugar cane projects 
(36.67). (Tables 29, 30). 
Hours of Labor.—The range in hours of labor devoted to 
peanut projects was from 16 to 675 hours. The upper quartile 
was only 170.00 hours while the minimum standard calls for 
180 hours. (See Table 1 for standard). 
The middle 50 per cent of these projects ranged from 54.67 
to 170.00 hours of labor. The upper quartile was less than the 
standard and the lower quartile was less than one-third the 
standard in hours of labor. (Table 30). 
This means that 75 per cent of the peanut projects were be- 
low the standard, and that 25 per cent were less than one-third 
the standard, The median number of hours of labor was a lit- 
tle more than one-half the mimimum standard in labor require 
ments. 
The net profit per hour of labor was 38 cents for the median 
peanut project and 37 cents for the average project of this type. 
This is less than the net profit per hour of labor for the average 
peanut project for the entire South (based upon 79 projects), 
which was 42 cents. 
Summary of Peanut Projects—Peanut projects ranged in 
size from 0.25 of an acre to 18 acres in 1920-21. The range in 
net profit was from $1.80 to $272.25, and the range in hours of 
labor was from 16 to 675. The median peanut project was 2.60 
acres in size, brought a net profit of $38.18, and received 99 
hours of labor. The medians were a little more than one-half 
the minimum standard in hours of labor. (See Table 1 for 
standards). 
The average peanut project was 3.28 acres in size, brought 
a net profit of $50.34, and received 135.63 hours of labor. (Table 
30). 
The average peanut project for the entire South (based 
upon 79 projects) was 2.41 acres in size, brought a net profit 
of $41.44, and received 97.93 hours of labor. (Appendix A, 
Table 75.
-P-A-G-E-59
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 59 
. The average peanut project for the 38 individual projects 
included in this study for 1920-21 was superior to the average 
project of this type for the 79 projects in size and in net profit, 
but inferior in hours of labor. (Table 30 and Appendix A, 
Table 75. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median peanut proj- 
ect was 38 cents; for the average it was 37 cents. The net 
profit per hour of labor for the entire South (based upon 79 
peanut projects) for peanut projects in 1920-21 was 42 cents. 
These data show that the average for the 38 individual peanut 
projects differed only slightly from the average for the entire 
South in size, net profit, hours of labor, and net profit per hour 
of labor for this type of project. The average peanut project 
in 1920-21 for the entire South was below the minimum stand- 
ards in size and in hours of labor. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
The standard calls for a minimum of 4.5 acres for peanut 
projects with a minimum of 180 hours of labor. (Table 1). 
At this rate 1 acre would require a minimum of 40 hours of 
labor. The median peanut project, which was 2.60 acres in size, 
should have received 104.0 hours of labor, instead of 99.00 
hours. 
Correlations.—The correlation of size with net profit 
(r, .92-.013) was high. The regression of size on net profit in- 
dicates that an increase of 1 acre in size of peanut projects 
would have increased the net profit 65 cents. The correla- 
tion between size and labor (r, .95-.011) was high. (Table 30). 
The regression of size on hours of labor indicates that an 
increase of 1 acre in size would have increased the labor .95 of 
anhour. At this rate, if the size had been 4.5 acres (standard), 
it would have required 136.79 hours of labor. This is less than 
the minimum standard, which is 180 hours of labor for all proj- 
ects. (See Table 1 for standards). 
The correlation between net profit. and hours of labor 
(r, .86-.027) was .86. This is a high correlation. The regres- 
sion of labor on profit indicates that an increase of 1 hour of 
labor would have been accompanied by an increase of 61 cents 
in net profit. At this rate, 180 hours of labor (minimum 
Standard) would have brought a net profit of $77.40. The 
upper quartile shows that 75 per cent of the peanut projects 
were considerably below this amount. 
The correlation between size and net profit with the in- 
fluence of labor eliminated or controlled is reduced from .92 to 
-67. This indicates that labor was a factor in the relationship 
of size to net profit, but the correlation is high with this in- 
fluence eliminated. The correlation between net profit and 
hours of labor with the influence of size eliminated is reduced
-P-A-G-E-60
    
60 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
from .86 to -.25. This indicates that the correlation between 
net profit and labor was influenced by the size of projects of 
this type. This study, however, is not primarily concerned in 
accounting for the cause of the relationship between net profit 
and the number of hours of labor devoted to projects. Accord- 
ing to the minimum standards in size and labor requirements 
(Table 1), the median peanut project approximately met the 
requirements in labor for its size. If the standards are reliable- 
measures, to increase the hours of labor could not be expected 
to increase the net profit unless the size should likewise in- 
crease.

Status of Agricultural Projects, in the South 61 
Scope or Size—Data in Table 31 show that watermelon 
projects for 1920-21 ranged from 0.33 of an acre to 10 acres in 
size. The upper quartile was considerably below the minimum 
standard (4.50 acres) in size, which means that 75 per cent of 
these projects were below the standard. The middle 50 per cent 
ranged from 0.66 of an acre to 2.50 acres in size. The minimum 
standard is 4.50 acres for watermelon projects. (Table 1). 
The average size for these 29 projects was 1.98 acres. The 
-average size for the entire South (based upon 39 projects) for 
1920-21 was 1.78 acres, which was a little less than the average 
for the 29 projects included in this study on individual projects. 
(Appendix A, Table 75). 
The median watermelon project for 1920-21 was less than 
one-third the minimum standard in size. (Table 31). 
The average size for the 29 individual projects, and the aver- 
age size for the entire South (based upon 39 projects) were 
less than one-half the minimum standard in size. These data 
indicate that the 29 individual watermelon projects grouped in 
Table 31, when measured by average size furnish a fair samp- 
ling of projects of this type for the entire South. 
Net Profit—The range in net profit was from zero or a loss 
to $108.05 for watermelon projects. The middle 50 per cent of 
these projects ranged from $9.06 to $55.83 in net profit. (Table 
31). 
The average net profit was $34.20 for the 29 individual proj- 
ects of this type, while the average net profit for the entire 
South (based upon 39 projects) for watermelon projects was 
$35.14. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
Hours of Labor—Data in Table 31 show a wide range in 
hours of labor devoted to watermelon projects for 1920-21. The 
largest number of hours of labor was 22 times the smallest 
number. The middle 50 per cent ranged from 45.00 to 127.50 
hours of labor. The lower limit was exactly one-fourth the 
minimum standard (180 hours) in labor requirements. Of the 
29 projects, 75 per cent were considerably below the minimum 
standard in hours of labor, and 25 per cent were less than one- 
fourth the standard. (See upper and lower quartiles in Table 
31). 
The average project of this type was less than one-half the 
standard in labor requirements. The average number of hours 
of labor devoted to these 29 watermelon projects was 84.89, and 
the average for all of the watermelon projects for the entire 
South was 76.55 hours. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
The average watermelon project for the entire South was 
less than one-half the minimum standard in labor requirements. 
(Appendix A, Table 75).

The average net profit per hour of labor for the 29 projects. 
was 40 cents. The average net profit per hour of labor for the 
entire South (based upon 39 projects) was 46 cents. _(Appen-

Summary of Watermelon Projects.—Data in Table 31 show 
a wide range in size, net profit, and in hours of labor for water- 
melon projects for 1920-21. These projects ranged from 0.33 of 
an acre to 10.00 acres in size, from zero or a loss to $108.05 in 
net profit, and from 12 to 245 hours of labor. The median proj- 
ect was 1.39 acres in size, brought a net profit of $27.50, and 
received 74.00 hours of labor. The upper quartiles show that 
75 per cent of these projects were below the minimum stand- 
ards in size and in hours of labor. (Tables 1 and 81). 
The median project of this type was less than one-half the- 
minimum standards in size and labor requirements. The aver- 
age watermelon project was less than one-half the standards in 
size and labor requirements. The averages in size and in hours 
of labor for the 29 watermelon projects were higher than the 
averages in size and in hours of labor for the entire South. 
(Table 31, and Appendix A, Table 75). 
The average watermelon project for the entire South was: 
less than one-half the standards in size and in hours of labor. 
The median project, however, received more hours of labor than: 
the standard requires for this size. 
Correlations.—The correlation between size and net profit 
(r, 114.121) was too small to be significant. The same is true- 
for the correlation between net profit and hours of labor de- 
voted to these projects (r, .24+.114). The large probable error 
in each case renders the coefficient of correlation unreliable. 
The correlation between size and labor (r, .69+.060) was high. 
The correlation between size and labor might have been higher, 
had it not been for the fact that the median watermelon project 
received more labor than the standard requires. This is true: 
also for the average project. The standard requires that water- 
melon projects be at least 4.50 acres in size and receive at least 
180 hours of labor per project. (Table 1). 
At this rate a project of 1 acre should receive 40 hours of 
labor. The median watermelon project, which was 1.39 acres 
in size, according to the standard should have received 55.60 
hours of labor. The median project actually received 74.00 
hours of labor which was above the standard for this size. The: 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 63 
same holds good for the upper quartile and the average. As 
measured by the standard, the projects were too small. 
Farm ManaceMent Prosscrs. 
Three states reported data relating to individual farm man- 
agement projects for 1920-21. These three states reported a 
total of 48 projects of this type. The only data reported on 
these projects were on net profit and hours of labor. The scope 
or size of these projects was not reported. These projects are

Net Profit—Data in Table 32 show that the net profit for 
farm management projects in 1920-21 ranged from zero or a 
loss to $737.75. The middle 50 per cent ranged from $56.25. 
to $227.80 in net profit. (Table 32). 
The median net profit was $127.80 and the average was 
$168.79 for the 48 individual projects. The average net profit 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
64 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
for farm management projects for the entire South (based 
upon 57 projects) was $234.24. (Appendix A, Table 76). 
The average for the entire South was considerably higher 
than the average for the 48 projects in net profit, which shows 
that a few cases raised the average. 
Hours of Labor.—Farm management projects ranged from 
40 to 856 hours in labor. The median was more than double 
the minimum standard in hours of labor. The middle 50 per 
cent ranged from 125 hours to 725 hours of labor. The upper 
quartile in Table 32 shows that 25 per cent of these projects 
were more than four times the minimum standard in hours of 
labor. The lower quartile shows that 25 per cent were below 
the minimum standard in labor requirements. The average 
number of hours of labor devoted to these projects was 379.10 
for the 48 individual projects. The average for the entire South 
(based upon 57 projects was 392.48 hours of labor.) (Appendix 
A, Table 76). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median farm man- 
agement project was 34 cents. (Graph 16). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the average farm man- 
agement project for the 48 projects was 44 cents. The average 
for the entire South (based upon 57 projects) was 59 cents. 
(Appendix A, Table 76). 
Summary of Farm Management Projects——Farm manage- 
ment projects ranged from zero or a loss to $737.75 in net 
profit, and from 40 to 856 hours in labor in 1920-21. The 
median farm management project ranked higher than any other 
project in net profit and in hours of labor. (Graphs 14, 15). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median farm man- 
agement project was 34 cents, which was lower than 12 types 
of projects. (Graph 16). 
For the medians of all the field crop projects, except cotton 
and miscellaneous crop projects, the net profit per hour of labor 
was higher than it was for farm management projects. The 
net profit was high, but the number of hours of labor for the 
median farm management project ranked higher than any other 
made the net profit per hour of labor relatively low.

Scope or Size.—The tobacco projects ranged from 0.12 of an 
acre to 3.00 acres in size for 1920-21. The lower quartile shows 
that 75 per cent of these projects were considerably above the 
standard (0.50 acres) in size. (Table 33). 
This means that 75 per cent of the tobacco projects were 
above the minimum standard in size. The median was more
-P-A-G-E-66
66 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
than double the standard in size. The average and the median 
were identical in size. (Table 33). 
The upper quartile in Table 33 shows that 25 per cent of 
these projects were more than three times the standard in size. 
The lower limit was more than three times the standard. This 
gives the middle 50 per cent a good ranking, as measured by 
the standard. The average size of these projects was higher 
than the average for the entire South. The average size of to- 
bacco projects for the entire South (based upon 161 projects) 
for 1920-21 was 0.91 of an acre. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
A few extreme cases might have caused this difference in 
averages. : 
Net Profit.—Data in Table 33 show that the net profit for 
tobacco projects in 1920-21 ranged from zero or a loss to 
$683.00. The middle 50 per cent of these projects ranged from 
$41.35 to $143.75. The medians of only two of the field crop 
projects surpassed the lower quartile of tobacco projects. The 
median net profit for tobacco projects was $105.36. The 
median of'only one project (farm management) was superior 
in net profit to tobacco projects. The average net profit 
($163.51) was considerably more than the median for the 48 
projects. The average net profit for tobacco projects for the 
entire South (based upon 161 projects) was $125.96. (Appen- 
dix A, Table 75). This approximates the median for the 48 proj- 
ects. 
Hours of Labor.—Tobacco projects ranged from 26 to 800 
in hours of labor for 1920-21. The median shows that the upper 
50 per cent of these projects were considerably above the mini- 
mum standard in hours of labor. (Table 33). 
The lower quartile was only 90.00, which is only one-half 
the minimum standard (180 hours) in labor requirements. The 
lower 25 per cent of the tobacco projects was less than one-half 
the minimum standard in hours of labor. (Table 33). 
The average was above the standard in labor requirements. 
The average hours of labor for tobacco projects for the entire 
South (based upon 161 projects) was 140.97 in 1920-21. (Ap- 
pendix A, Table 75). 
This is below the standard, which calls for 180 hours of 
labor for all projects. The average for'the 43 projects must 
have been influenced largely by a few extreme cases, which ac- 
counts for the difference in the averages. Although the median 
number of hours of labor devoted to tobacco projects was above 
the minimum standard in labor requirements, the median proj- 
ect received fewer hours than the standard requires for this 
size of project. The standard size for tobacco projects is only
-P-A-G-E-67
  a Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 67 
0.50 of anacre. The standard calls for a minimum of 180 hours 
of labor for all projects. (Table 1). 
At this rate, 1 acre of tobacco would require 360 hours of 
labor. The median, which was 1.09 acres, should have received 
392.40 hours of labor. Data in Table 33 show that the median 
received only 190.91 hours of labor which is less than one-half 
what the standard requires for a tobacco project of this size. 
The average size was identical with the median, therefore the 
average number of hours of labor (269.03 hours), which was less 
than 392.40 hours was too small. The same is true for the 
upper quartile, which should have been 561.60 hours, instead 
415. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median tobacco 
project was 55 cents in 1920-21. (Graph 16). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the average tobacco 
project (48 projects) was 67 cents. The net profit per hour of 
labor for the entire South (based upon 161 projects) was 89 
cents. (Appendix A, Table 76). 
Summary of Tobacco Projects.—Three states reported a 
total of 43 tobacco projects for 1920-21. The projects ranged 
from 0.12 of an acre to 3.00 acres in size, from zero or a loss 
to $683.00 in net profit, and from 26 to 800 hours of labor. The 
median project was 1.09 acres in size, brought a net profit of 
$105.36, and received 190.91 hours of labor. The median project 
was more than double the minimum standard in size, and 
slightly above the minimum standard for all projects in labor 
requirements. Although more than 180 (standard) hours of 
labor were devoted to the median tobacco project, according 
to the standard for size, the median size of these projects 
should have received 392.40 hours of labor. Data in Table 33 
show the median received less than one-half this amount. The 
median size compared more favorably with the standard than 
the median number of hours of labor. The median tobacco 
project ranked second in net profit and in hours of labor among 
the field crop projects. In net profit per hour of labor, the 
median tobacco project was outranked by only the potato proj- 
ect among the field crop projects. (Graphs 14. 15, 16). : 
Correlations.—The correlation between size and net profit 
(r, .16+.094) was too low to be significant. (Table 33). 
The correlation between size and hours of labor (r, 46+ 
.081) was marked. The correlation between net profit and 
hours of labor (r, .51+.074) was higher than the correlation 
between size and hours of labor (Table 33). 
The regression of labor on net profit shows that an increase 
of 1 hour of labor would be accompanied by an increase of 39
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
cents in net profit. The regression indicates that if the median 
tobacco project had received 392.40 hours of labor, which it 
should have received according to the standard, the net profit 
would have been $173.72, instead $105.36. The upper quartile 
shows that 75 per cent of the projects brought a lower net 
profit than this amount. (Table 38). 
These facts seem to justify the conclusion that if the tobac- 
co projects had received more labor, other things being equal, 
the net profit would have been more.

Scope or Size-—Data in Table 34 show the exact size in 
acres of each soybean project reported for 1920-21. The range 
was from 0.50 of an acre to 6 acres in size. The modes were 
5 acres and 2 acres, and the frequency being four in each case.
-P-A-G-E-69
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 69 
The median (score) was 2.50 acres, and the average was 3.03 
acres. One-third of these projects were above the standard 
(4.50 acres) in size. The average was considerably below the 
minimum standard in size.~ 
Net Profit.—The net profit for soybean projects ranged from 
$10.52 to $96.45. The median was $22.92, and the average was 
$34.44 in net profit. The average is probably a more desirable 
measure with such few cases than the median. The distribu- 
tion in Table 34 shows that the net profit increased gradually 
from the lower limit to the upper limit. No two projects 
brought the same net profit. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median soybean 
project was 46 cents; for the average, it was 69 cents. 
Summary of Soybean Projects—Only one state reported 
data on individual soybean projects for 1920-21. This state re- 
ported only 15 projects of this type. The average soybean proj- 
ect was below the standards in size and in labor requirements. 
(Table 34). 
Only 66.66 per cent were up to the minimum standard in 
size, and only 6.66 per cent were up to the minimum standard 
in hours of labor. The average soybean project for the entire 
South (based upon 23 projects) was inferior in size and ip 
hours of labor to the average for the 15 projects included in 
Table 34. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
The average soybean project for the entire South was below 
the minimum standards in size and labor requirements. 
Correlations.—The correlation between size and net profit, 
between size and hours of labor, and between net profit and 
hours of labor was high in each case. (Table 34). 
Correlations for such small numbers probably have very 
little significance. 
Summary or Fierp Crop Progucts. 
Of the 1,269 individual field crop projects included in this 
study, the medians of cotton and tobacco projects were up to 
the minimum standard in size in 1920-21. The 165 cotton proj- 
ects and the 43 tobacco projects, the medians of which were up 
to the standard in size, constitute 16.39 per cent of the 1,269 
field crop projects. Of the 165 cotton projects, and the 43 to- 
bacco projects, 75 per cent were above the minimum standards 
in size. (Tables 11, 33). 
Of the 574 corn projects and the 269 potato projects in- 
cluded in this study, 75 per cent were below the standards in 
size. (Tables 19, 27). 
If the 48 farm management projects and the 58 miscellan- 
eous crop projects which were not measured in size are elimi- 
nated, 1,163 projects which were measured in size are left. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
70 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
165 cotton projects, 75 per cent of which were above the stand- 
ard in size, represent 14.18 per cent of the 1,163 field crop proj- 
ects which were measured in size. The 574 corn projects and 
the 269 potato projects, 75 per cent of which were below 
the minimum standards in size, represent 72.48 per cent 
of the field crop projects which were measured in size. The 
coefficient of variation shows that watermelon projects were 
the most variable in size, while sugar cane projects were the 
least variable. Potato, corn, peanut, and cotton projects dif- 
fered only slightly in variability of size. 
The net, profit for the 1,269 field crop projects ranged from 
zero or a loss to $840.00. The lower limit in net 'profit was 
zero or a loss for each type of project except peanut projects in 
which the lower limit was $1.80, and soybean projects in which 
the lower limit was $10.52. Corn represented the widest range 
in net profit, the lower limit being zero or a loss, and the higher 
limit being $840.00. The median net profit for field crop proj- 
ects ranged from $22.92 for soybean projects to $127.80 for farm 
management projects. (Graph 14). 
For the 1,269 field crop projects, the net profit for the 
median was $29.58, and the net profit for the average was 
$55.77. (Summary tables on field crop projects). 
The average net profit (2,647 field crop projects) for the 
entire South was $55.05 in 1920-21. (Appendix A, Table 75). 
These data show that the average net profit for the 1,269 
individual projects was almost identical with the average for 
tha field crop projects for the entire South. 
The median net profit for the 1,269 field crop projects should 
not be lower than it would be for the entire South. The net 
profit for median: field crop projects in order of rank was as 
follows: Farm management, tobacco, cotton, peanut, sugar 
cane, potato, corn, watermelon, miscellaneous crop, and soy- 
bean projects. (Graph 14). 
Hours of Labor.—The 1,269 field crop projects ranged from 
1 to 1,060 hours in labor, With the exceptions of the 48 farm 
management projects and the 43 tobacco projects, the medians 
of all of the 1,269 field crop projects were below the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. This means that the medians of 
92.83 per cent of the field crop projects were below the mini- 
mum standard in labor requirement. With the exceptions of 
cotton, farm management, and tobacco projects (20.17 per cent 
of field crop projects), the upper quartiles of all of the field 
crop projects were below the minimum standard in labor re- 
quirement. This means that 75 per cent of the field crop proj- 
ects were below the standard in labor requirement.
-P-A-G-E-71
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 71 
The median number of hours of labor for the 1,269 field 
crop projects was 85.29. This is less than one-half the minimum 
standard (180 hours) in labor requirement. The median num- 
ber of hours of labor in order of rank by projects was as fol- 
lows: Farm management, 375.00 hours; tobacco, 190.91 hours; 
cotton, 141.67 hours; peanut, 99.00 hours; miscellaneous crop, 
85.71 hours; corn, 84.88 hours; sugar cane 83.33 hours; water- 
melon, 74.00 hours; potato, 52.61 hours; and soybean, 50.00 
hours. (Graph 15). 
The average number of hours of labor for the 1,269 field crop 
projects was 127.61. The average number of hours of labor for 
the 2,647 field crop projects for the entire South was 132.21. 
(Appendix A, Table 75). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median field crop proj- 
ects ranged from 28 cents for miscellaneous crop projects to 
58 cents for potato projects. The net profit per hour of labor 
for median field crop projects in order of rank by projects was 
as follows: Potato, tobacco, soybean, sugar cane, peanut, water- 
melon, corn, farm management, cotton, and miscellaneous crop 
projects. (Graph 16). 
Of the 10 types of field crop projects, the median farm man- 
agement project which ranked first in net profit and first in 
hours of labor, ranked third from the bottom in net profit 
per hour of labor. The median tobacco project ranked second 
in net profit, per hour of labor. The \median tobacco project 
ranked second in net profit and in hours of labor and second 
also in net profit per hour of labor. (Graphs 14, 15, 16). 
As measured by net profit per hour of labor for median 
projects, potato projects wera the most desirable, and miscel- 
laneous crop projects were the least desirable of the field crop 
projects. As measured by net profit for median projects, farm 
management projects were the most desirable, and soybean 
projects were the least desirable of the field crop projects. The 
net profit per hour of labor for the median field crop project 
was 35 cents. 
There were positive correlations between size and net profit 
for all of the field crop projects, except for sugar cane, water- 
melon, and tobacco. These projects showed positive correla- 
tions also, but they were so small and the probable errors were 
so large that they were not significant. All of the field crop 
projects showed a positive correlation between net profit and 
the number of hours of labor devoted to projects.

CHAPTER IV. 
A STUDY OF PROJECT DATA RELATING TO 
GARDENING AND TRUCKING. 
GarpvrEn Progxcts. 
Six states reported data relating to individual garden proj- 
ects for 1920-21. The individual projects on gardening reported 
by each state are grouped in Tables 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40. 
The projects reported by states were as follows: State Number 
Two, 47; State Number Three, 32; State Number Four, 14; 
State Number Five, 55; State Number Six, 49; and State Num- 
ber Seven, 42. The scope or size, net profit, hours of labor, and 
net profit per hour of labor for median garden projects by 
states are illustrated in Graph 7. The garden projects for all 
of the states are summarized in Table 41.

Scope or Size.—Garden projects ranged in size from 0.01 of 
an acre in “State Number Seven” to 3.00 acres in “State Num- 
ber Six.” (Tables 39, 40). 
The median garden project ranged in size from 0.26 of an 
acre in “State Number Four” to 0.55 of an acre in “State 
Number Six.” (Graph 7). 
“State Number Four,” however, reported only 14 projects, 
which ig a small number for a median to be very significant as 
a central tendency. The average size for this state was almost 
identical with the median. (Table 37). 
The medians of four of the states were below the minimum 
standard (0.33 acre) in size, but the total number of projects 
in these four states represent less than one-half of the garden 
projects. (Graph 7). 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The average (arithmetic mean) sizes of garden projects 
ranged from 0.25 of an acre in “State Number Four” to 0.74 
of an acre in “State Number Six.” (Tables 37, 39). 
Net Profit—The net profit per project for garden projects 
for 1920-21 ranged from zero or a loss to $838.90. Both of these 
limits were made by “State Number Two.” (Table 35). 
The median net profit ranged from $8.75 in “State Number 
Three” to $49.00 in “State Number Seven.” (Graph 7). 
The upper quartile in Table 39 shows that 25 per cent of 
the garden projects in “State Number Six” brought more than 
$418.12 in net profit. The coefficient of variation shows that 
net profit in this state was more variable than in any other 
state. The average net profit per project ranged from $15.33 
in “State Number Three” to $114.27 in “State Number Six. 
(Tables 36, 39). 
Data in Table 35 show that the average was less than the 
upper quartile in net profit. This means that 75 per cent of 
the projects in this distribution were below the average for the 
distribution. The average in this case is not a reliable central 
tendency. 
Hours of Labor.—The garden projects included in this study 
ranged in hours of labor from 5 in “State Number Seven” to 468 
in “State Number Six.” (Tables 39, 40). 
The median number of hours of labor ranged from 48.33 in 
“State Number Seven” to 94,00 in “State Number Four.” 
(Graph 7). 
The standard requires a minimum of 180 hours of labor for 
all projects. (Table 1). 
The highest median in hours of labor was only slightly more 
than one-half the minimum standard. More than 75 per cent 
of the garden projects were below the minimum standard in 
hours of labor in each state. 
The net profit per hour of labor for median garden projects 
ranged from 10 cents in “State Number Three” to $1.01 in 
“State Number Seven.” (Graph 7). 
The rank of each state in net profit per hour of labor for 
median garden projects is illustrated in Graph 7, It should be 
noted that “State Number Seven” ranked second from the bot- 
tom of the six states in size, lowest in hours of labor, highest 
in net profit, and highest in net profit per hour of labor. 
(Graph 7). 
Summary of Garden Projects.—Data in Table 41 show that 
garden projects for 1920-21 ranged from 0.01 of an acre to 3 
acres in size; from zero or a loss to $838.90 in net profit; and 
from 5 to 468 hours of labor. The median garden project was 
   
-P-A-G-E-81
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 81 
a little above the minimum standard in size, but less than one- 
half the standard in labor requirements. (Table 41). 
Data in Table 41 show that 9 per cent of the garden projects 
received 180 or more hours (standard) of labor. This means 
that 91 per cent of the garden projects were below the stand- 
ard in hours of labor. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median garden proj- 
ect was 32 cents. (Chapter 6, Graph 16). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the average garden 
project (189 individual projects) was 89 cents. The upper 
quartile in Table 41 shows that 75 per cent of the garden proj- 
ects were below the average in net profit. The net profit per 
hour of labor for the average garden project (based upon 354 
projects) for the entire South was 67 cents. (Appendix A, 
Table 76). 
The average in this distribution is influenced largely by a 
few extreme cases. 
Correlations.—The correlation between size and net profit 
was positive, but low (r, .33-+.040). The correlation between 
net profit and hours of labor was marked (r, .40+.041), but 
not as high as the correlation between size and hours of labor. 
The correlation between size and net profit with hours of labor 
kept constant or controlled was reduced from .33 to .17, This 
indicates that the factor labor was probably a cause in part of 
the relationship between size and net profit. The correlation 
between net profit and hours of labor with the influence of size 
eliminated was reduced from .40 to .31. While this indicates 
that size influenced the correlation between net profit and labor, 
the correlation is still significant. The regression of labor on 
net profit indicates that an increase of 1 hour of labor would 
have been accompanied by an increase of 48 cents in net profit. 
At this rate, if 180 hours of labor had been devoted to garden 
projects the average net profit would have been increased from 
$69.88 to $118.65. More than 75 per cent of the garden projects 
brought less than one-half this amount in net profit.

Scope or Size.—Truck projects for 1920-21 ranged from 0.05 
of an acre to 1.30 acres in size. The median truck project in 
“State Number One” was less than one-third the minimum 
standard in size (1.00 acre). The median in “State Number 
Three” was a little more than one-half the standard (1.00 acre) 
in size. The upper quartiles in Tables 42 and 43 show that 75 
per cent of the truck projects were considerably below the mini- 
mum standard in size. The average truck project in each state 
was less than one-half the standard size. 
Net Profit.—The net profit per project for truck projects in 
1920-21 ranged from zero or a loss to $235.55. The median net
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
profit ranged from $14.21 in “State Number One” to $26.25 in 
“State Number Three.” (Graph 8). 
The middle 50 per cent ranged from $7.11 to $28.33 in “State 
Number One,” and from $9.58 to $72.50 in “State Number 
Three.” (Tables 42 and 43). 
The average net profit was $27.91 in “State Number One” 
and $47.71 in “State Number Three.” 
Hours of Labor.—Truck projects ranged from 7 to 303 hours 
in labor in “State Number One,” and from 15 to 160 hours in 
“State Number Three.” (Tables 42 and 43). 
The median number of hours of labor was 52.31 in “State 
Number One” and 89.00 in “State Number Three.” The median 
was less than one-third the minimum standard in hours of 
labor in. “State Number One” and less than one-half the stand- 
ard in “State Number Three.” The upper quartiles in each 
state were less than the minimum standard in hours of labor. 
This means that 75 per cent of these projects were considerably 
below the standard in labor requirement. In “State Number 
One” 91 per cent of the truck projects were below the standard 
in size, and in “State Number Three” 100 per cent were below 
the standard in size. (Tables 42, 43). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median truck projects 
was 27 cents in “State Number One” and 29 cents in “State 
Number Three.” (Graph 8). 
Summary of Truck Projects——Data in Table 44 show that 
truck projects ranged from .05 of an acre to 1.30 acres in size; 
from zero or a loss to $235.55 in net profit; and from 7 to 303 
hours of labor. The median truck project was 0.29 of an acre 
in size, brought a net profit of $16.39, and received 66.00 hours 
of labor. The median was less than one-third the minimum 
standard in size, and a little more than one-third the standard 
in hours of labor. Although the median truck project was be- 
low the absolute standard (180 hours) in hours of labor, it was 
above the standard in labor requirements for a project of this 
size. According to the standard, a truck project of 1 acre in 
size should receive a minimum of 180 hours of labor. At this 
rate, the median truck project, which was 0.29 of an acre in 
size, should receive .29 of 180, or 52.00 hours of labor. The 
median truck project received 66.00 hours of labor, which is 
above the requirement for 0.29 of an acre in size. The same is 
true for the average and the upper quartile, which shows that 
the greatest fault with the median truck project was a defi- 
ciency in size, so far as the standards are concerned. Data in 
Table 44 show that 10 per cent of the truck projects for 1920-21 
consisted of 1 acre (standard) or more in size. This means 
that 90 per cent of these projects were below the minimum
-P-A-G-E-87
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 87 
standard (1 acre) in size. Data in Table 44 show, that only 
4 per cent of the truck projects received 180 (standard) or more 
hours of labor. This means that 96 per cent of these projects 
were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. With 90 
per cent below the standard in size, and with 96 per cent below 
the standard in labor, truck projects do not rate very high, as 
measured by minimum standards. 
Correlations.—The correlation coefficients show a positive 
correlation between size and net profit, between size and hours 
of labor, and between net profit and hours of labor. (Table 
44). 
The correlation between size and net profit with the in- 
fluence of labor removed or controlled was reduced from .29 to 
.04. This indicates that the number of hours of labor the truck 
projects received was an important factor in the relationship 
between size and net profit. The correlation between net profit 
and hours of labor with the influence of size removed or con- 
trolled was reduced from .44 to .85. While this indicates that 
the correlation between net profit and hours of labor was in- 
fluenced to some extent by size, the correlation of .35 is signifi- 
cant of relationship. The regression of size on net profit in- 
dicates that an increase of 1 acre in size would be accompanied 
by an increase of 22 cents in net profit. The regression of labor 
on net profit indicates that an increase of 1 hour of labor would 
be accompanied by 31 cts. in net profit. If 180 hours (standard) 
of labor had been devoted to truck projects the average net profit 
might have been increased from $33.82 to $64.82. Of course, 
the size should increase with an increase in labor, for the stand- 
ards require that 180 hours of labor should be devoted to a 
truck project 1 acre in size. (Table 1). 
SumMMary or GARDENING AND TRUCKING ProsscTs, 
A total of 189 garden projects and a total of 77 truck proj- 
ects were reported for 1920-21. The median garden project 
was above the minimum standard in size, but the median truck 
project was less than one-third the minimum standard in size. 
(Tables 41, 44). 
Ninety-one per cent of the garden projects and 96 per cent 
of the truck projects were below the minimum standard in 
hours of labor. (Table 1). 
In net profit and in net profit per hour of labor, the median 
garden project outranked the median truck project. The aver- 
age net profit for garden projects was higher than the average 
for truck projects. For the 189 garden projects, the average
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
net profit was $69.88, and for the 77 truck projects, the average 
net profit was $33.82. (Tables 41, 44). 
For the 354 garden projects for the entire South, the aver- 
age net profit was $63.26, and for the 153 truck projects for the 
entire South, the average net profit was $31.73. (Appendix A, 
Table 75). 
These data show that the average net profit for the 189 
garden projects and for the 77 truck projects for 1920-21 com- 
pared favorably with the average net profit for these projects 
for the entire South. 
For the 266 projects here included, the median net profit 
was $23.75, and the median number of hours of labor was 76. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median project was 31 
cents. More than 90 per cent of these projects were below the 
minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. 
There were positive correlations between size and net profit, 
between size and labor, and between net profit and hours of 
labor for garden projects and truck projects. The correlation 
coefficient between net profit and labor was greater than the 
correlation coefficient between size and labor for both garden- 
ing and trucking projects.

Scope or Size.—Hog feeding projects for 1920-21 ranged in 
size from 1 to 56 hogs in “State Number Two.” This state rep- 
resented the lower and the upper limit in number of hogs. The 
range was from 1 to 6 in “States Number Four, Five, and 
Seven.” The upper quartiles in Tables 45-50 show that 75 per 
cent or more of the hog feeding projects in each state were 
below the minimum standard (10 hogs) in size. (Table 1). 
Data in Tables 47, 48, and 50 show that none of the projects 
were up to minimum standard in size for “States Number Four, 
Five, and Seven.” In “State Number One” only 38 projects 
(1 per cent) included 8 or more hogs. (Table 45).
-P-A-G-E-97
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 97 
Of the 213 hog feeding projects for this state, 99 per cent 
were below the minimum standard (10 hogs) in size. The co- 
efficient of variation shows that the hog feeding projects were 
most variable in size in “State Number Five,” and least vari- 
able in “State Number Seven.” (Tables 48, 50). 
Net Profit—The net profit for hog feeding projects for 
1920-21 ranged from zero or a loss to $242.08. “State Number 
Five” represented both of these limits in net profit. (Table 
48). 
The median net profit ranged from $4.76 in “State Number 
One” to $44.00 in “State Number Seven.” (Graph 9). 
The median net profit by states in order of rank is illus- 
trated in Graph 9. Data in Table 45 show that for the 213 hog 
feeding projects in “State Number One,” 75 per cent brought 
a net profit less than $17.00. The medians of all of the other 
states surpassed the upper quartile in “State Number One” in 
net profit. (Tables 45-50). 
The coefficient of variation indicates that net profit was 
more variable in “State Number One” and least variable in 
“State Number Seven.” (Tables 45-50). 
Hours of Labor.—The number of hours of labor devoted to 
hog feeding projects ranged from 5 in “States Number One” 
and Two to 330 in “State Number Four.” (Tables 45, 46, 47). 
In “State Number One” only 4 projects (2 per cent) re- 
ceived 90 or more hours of labor. (Table 45). 
This means that 98 per cent of the 213 hog feeding projects 
in this “State were less than one-half the minimum standard 
(180 hours) in hours of labor. The upper quartile in each 
state was considerably below the minimum standard in hours 
of labor. (Tables 45-50). 
The upper quartiles ranged from 40.37 in “State Number 
One” to 143.75 in “State Number Four.” (Tables 45, 47). 
The states differed only slightly in variability in hours of 
labor. (Tables 45-50). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median hog feeding proj- 
ects ranged from 16 cents in “State Number One” to 79 cents 
in “State Number Six.” (Graph 9). 
Graph 9 shows the net profit per hour of labor for median 
hog feeding projects by states in order of rank. It should be 
noted that “State Number One” ranked lowest in median net 
profit, in hours of labor, and in net profit per hour of labor, 
but third from the bottom in size. (Graph 9). 
The median project in “State Number Six” ranked highest 
in size, second in net profit, second from the bottom in hours 
of labor; and highest in net profit per hour of labor. (Graph 9).

Summary of Hog Feeding Projects.—Data in Table 51 show 
that hog feeding projects ranged from 1 to 56 hogs in size; 
from zero or a loss to $242.08,in net profit; and from 5 to 330 
hours of labor. The distribution on size in Table 51 shows that 
42'(8 per cent) of the 503 hog feeding projects consisted of 10 
or more hogs. This means that 92 per cent of the hog feeding 
projects were below the minimum standard! (10 hogs) in size. 
The distribution on hours of labor show that 19 (4 per cent) of 
the 503 hog feeding projects were below the minimum standard 
(180 hours) in hours of labor. (Table 51). 
This means that 96 per cent of these projects were below 
the minimum standard in hours of labor. The median hog feed- 
ing project was only one-fifth the minimum standard in size, 
and less than one-fourth the minimum standard in hours of 
labor. The average was a little higher than.the median in size 
and in hours of labor. A comparison of data in Tabla 51 and 
in Table 1 of Appendix A shows that the average hog feeding 
project for the 503 here included differed only slightly in size, 
net profit, and in hours of labor from the hog feeding project 
for the entire South. The average hog feeding project for en- 
tire South (based upon 875 projects) was less than one-third 
the minimum standards in size and in hours of labor. (Appen- ° 
dix A, Table 75). ‘ 
The median net profit for the 503 hog feeding projects was 
$19.19. The average net profit for these projects was $31.44, 
which was a little more than the average for the entire South 
(based upon 875 projects). The average net profit for all of 
the projects in the South (based upon 5,389 projects) for 
1920-21 was $48.20. The median net profit for the 503 hog 
feeding projects was less than one-half the average net profit 
for the entire South. ' 
The net profit per hour of labor was 44 cents for the median 
hog feeding project and 55 cents for the average. The net profit 
per hour of labor for the entire South (based upon 875 'proj- 
ects) was 49 cents. (Appendix A, Graph 20). i 
Correlations—The correlation between size and net profit, 
between size and labor, and, between net profit and labor was 
positive and marked in each case. (Table 51). 
The regression of ‘size on net profit indicates that an in- 
crease of 1 hog would have been accompanied by an increase 
of 31 cents in net profit. The regression of labor on net 
profit indicates that for /each additional hour of labor there 
would have been an additional net profit of 31 cents. This in- 
dicates that if the.average number of hours of labor had been 
180 (standard) instead 56.94 hours, the average net profit 
would have been increased from $31.44 tov$69.59. These corre-
-P-A-G-E-99
Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 99 
lations and regressions indicate that if these projects had been 
larger and had ireceived proportionally more labor the net 
profit would have been larger. The correlation between size 
and net profit with the influence of labor eliminated or con- 
trolled was reduced from .58 to .50. This indicates that labor 
did not influence the correlation between size and net profit to 
any marked degree, since the correlation was positive and 
marked with labor eliminated. The correlation between net 
profit and labor with size controlled was reduced from .40 to 
.24, This indicates that size was to some extent a cause of the 
correlation between net profit and hours of labor. The corre- 
lation of .384, however, is significant of relationship with a 
P. E.+.029.

Scope or Size.—Hog breeding projects for 1920-21 ranged in 
size from 1 sow and litter in “States Number One and. Two” to 
7 sows and litters in “State Number Two.”, (Tables 52, 53). 
Data in Table 52 show none of the projects in “State, Num- 
ber One” were up to the minimum standard \(6 sows and lit- 
ters) in size. Of the 138 projects in this state, 130 ,(94 per 
cent) consisted of 1 sow and litter, while,the standard calls for 
6 sows and litters. (Table 1). 
This means that 94 per cent of the hog, breeding projects in 
“State Number One” were only one-sixth the minimum stand- 
ard in,size. In “State Number Two” only 1 project (2 per 
cent) was up to the standard or above in size. (Table 53). 
To put it another way, 98 per cent of the hog breeding proj- 
ects in “State Number Two” were below the minimum standard 
in size. Of the,44 projects in this state, 41 (93.18 per cent) 
were only one-sixth the standard in size. 
Net Profit—tThe net profit in hog breeding projects ranged 
from zero or a loss in “States Number One and Two” to $255.20 
in “State Number One.” (Tables 52, 53).
-P-A-G-E-104
104 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South - 
The median net profit was $18.57 in “State Number Two” 
and $27.50 in “State Number One.” (Tables 52, 53). 
The average net profit was $39.44 in “State Number One” 
and $39.52 in “State Number Two.” 
Hours of Labor—The lower limit in labor was 5 hours in 
each state. (Tables 52, 53). 
The higher limit in hours of labor was reached by “State 
Number Two,” the upper limit being 260 hours. Of the 138 hog 
breeding projects in “State Number One,” the highest limit 
reached in hours of labor was 145. This means that 100 per 
cent of these projects in this state were below the minimum 
standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. (Table 52). 
In “State Number Two,” 4 projects (9 per cent) received 
180 (standard) or more hours of labor. (Table 53). 
This means that 91 per cent of the hog breeding projects in 
this state were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median hog breeding 
project was 27 cents in “State Number Two” and 67 cents in 
“State Number One.” (Graph 10). 
Summary of Hog Breeding Projects.—Of the 182 hog breed- 
ing projects reported for 1920-21, 2 (1 per cent) consisted of 
6 or more sows and litters. (Table 54). 
Of the 182 projects, 180 (99 per cent) consisted of 3 or less 
sows and litters. This means that 99 per cent of these projects 
were less than one-half the minimum standard in size. The 
distribution of hours of labor in Table 54 shows that 4 (2 per 
cent) of the 182 hog breeding projects received 180 or more 
hours of labor. This means that 98 per cent of these projects 
were below the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of 
labor. The median hog breeding project was only one-sixth 
the standard in size, and less than one-third the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. The average project was almost 
identical with the median in size and in hours of labor. The 
median net profit for these projects was $25.64, and the aver- 
age was $38.91. (Table 54). 
The average net profit for hog breeding projects for the en- 
tive South (based upon 299 projects) was $36.60. (Appendix 
A, Table 75). 
The average net profit and the average number of hours of 
labor for the 182 individual hog breeding projects compared 
favorably with the hog breeding projects for the entire South. 
(Table 54, and Appendix A, Table 75). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median hog breeding 
project was 56 cents. (Chapter VI, Graph 16). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the average hog feeding 
project (182 projects) was 76 cents. This seems high, but the

  Status of Agricultural Projects ,in the South 105 
net profit per hour of labor for the average hog breeding project 
for the entire South (based upon 299 projects) was 72 cents. 
(Appendix A, Table 76). 
These projects ranked relatively high in net profit per hour 
of labor. 
Correlations.—Correlations have been omitted for hog 
breeding projects because of the nature of the distribution of 
size. Of the 182 projects, 169 (93 per cent) consisted of only 1 
sow and litter. This distribution does not lend itself to group- 
ing into intervals.

Dairy Prosucts. 
Four states reported individual dairy projects for 1920-21, 
which made a total of 140. The dairy projects reported by 
states were as follows: “State Number One” reported 47; 
“State Number Two,” 32; “State Number Five,” 9; and “State 
Number Six,” 52. These projects are grouped in Tables 55, 56, 
57, and 58, All of the dairy projects are summarized in Table

Scope or Size-—The range in size for dairy projects was 
from 1 to 50 cows. “State Number Two” represented the upper 
limit, and each state represented the lower limit in size. All of 
the states were up to the minimum standard in size, because 
the standard calls for only 1 dairy cow. The lower quartiles 
show that 75 per cent of the dairy projects were above the mini- 
mum standard (1 cow) in size in all of the states, except “State 
Number Five.” (Tables 55, 56, 57, 58).  
-P-A-G-E-112

The median in “State Number Two” was three times the 
minimum standard in size, and in “State Number Six” the 
median was twice the standard. The average size was above 
the minimum standard in each state. 
Net Profit—The net profit wag as low as zero or a loss in 
each state, except “State Number One” in which the lowest net 
profit was $3.40. (Tables 55-58) 
The highest net profit, which was $461.08, was made by 
“State Number Six.” The lower quartile in Table 58 shows 
that 75 per cent of the dairy projects in “State Number Six” 
brought a net profit, of more than $100.00. The average net 
profit for this state was $110.39, while the average for the en- 
tire South (5,389 projects) was only $48.20. (Appendix A, 
Table 75). 
The median net profit ranged from $56.90 in “State Number 
Five” to $141.00 in “State Number Six.” (Tables 55-58). _ 
Hours of Labor—The number of hours of labor devoted to 
dairy projects for 1920-21 ranged from 7.3 in “State Number 
Five” to 882 in “State Number Two.” (Tables 56-57). 
The median dairy project was below the minimum standard 
(180 hours) in hours of labor in each state, except “State Num- 
ber Six” in which case the median was considerably above the 
standard. The average number of hours of labor was above the 
standard in “States Number Two and Six.” (Tables 56, 58). 
The median number of hours of labor for each state in order 
of rank is illustrated in Graph 11. 
The net profit per hour of labor for median dairy projects 
ranged from 44 cents in “State Number Two” to 76 cents in 
“State Number One.” (Graph 11). 
“State Number One” ranked highest in net profit per hour 
of labor, lowest in hours of labor, second from the bottom in 
size, and second from the top in net profit, as measured by 
medians. 
Summary of Dairy Projects—Data in Table 59 show that 
dairy projects ranged from 1 to 50,cows in size; from zero 
or a loss to $461.08; and from 7.3 to 882 hours of ‘labor. The 
median dairy project was double the minimum standard (1 
cow) in size, but below the minimum standard in hours of 
labor. The average project was three times the minimum 
standard in size, and considerably above the standard in hours 
of labor. The average dairy project for the,140 here considered, 
was considerably above the average for the entire South (based 
upon 231 .projects) in size, net profit, and in hours of labor. 
(Table 59, and Appendix A, Table 75). 
The standard deviation indicates that two-thirds of these 
projects were below the average. The net profit per hour of
-P-A-G-E-113
Status of Agricultural Projects jin the South 113 
labor for the median dairy project was 68 cents. (Chapter 
VI, Graph 16). 
The net profit per hour of labor for the average dairy project 
was 50 cents for the 140 individual projects, and 46 cents for 
the entire South (231 projects). The median dairy project 
ranked third from the top of all projects in net profit, and first 
in net profit per hour of labor. (Chapter VI, Graphs 14, 16). 
Correlations.—The correlation between size and net profit 
was low and the probable error was sufficiently large to render 
it unreliable. The correlation between size and labor was low, 
but the P. E. was sufficiently low to render it reliable. The 
correlation between net profit and hours of labor was marked. 
(Table 59). 
The regression of labor on, net profit indicates that 1 addi- 
tional hour of labor would have been accompanied by an addi- 
tional net profit of 55 cents.

Scope or Size-—Data in Table 60 show that beef production 
projects ranged from 1 to 53 cows in size. Only 1 project was 
up to the minimum standard in size (10 cows). This means 
that 97 per cent of these projects were below the minimum 
standard in size. Of the 36 beef production projects, 34 (94 
per cent) consisted of only 1 cow, while the minimum standard 
calls for 10 cows. (Table 1). 
This means that 94 per cent of these projects were one-tenth 
the standard in size. The average project was one-fifth the 
standard in size. (Table 60). 
Net Profit—Data in Table 60 show that the net profit for 
beef production projects in 1920-21 ranged from zero or a loss 
to $678.70. The average net profit was $35.39, which was more 
than double the upper quartile. This means that 75 per cent 
of these projects were less than one-half the average in net 
profit. Of the 36 projects, 86 per cent were below the average 
in net profit. The median net profit was $8.18. 
Hours of Labor.—Beef production projects ranged in hours 
of labor from 7 to 789. The average number of hours of labor 
devoted to these projects was 68.77. The upper quartile was 
less than the average, which means that 75 per cent of these 
projects were below the average in hours of labor. The aver- 
age was less than one-half the minimum standard in hours of 
labor, which means that 75 per cent of these projects were less 
than one-half the standard. Of the 36 beef production projects, 
only 1 project (3 per cent) was up to the minimum standard 
in hours of labor. This means that 97 per cent of these projects 
were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. 
The net profit per hour of labor was 17 cents for the median 
beef production project, and 51 cents for the average project. 
The average is not very significant as a central tendency in 
this case, since 75 per cent of the projects were below the aver- 
ages in net profit and in hours of labor. 
_ Summary of Beef Production Projects—As has already 
been pointed out, 97 per cent of the beef production projects 
were below the minimum standards in size and in labor re 
quirement. (Table 60). 
In size, 94 per cent of these projects were only one-tenth the 
minimum standard, and in hours of labor 75 per cent were less 
than one-half the standard. The net profit per hour of labor 
for the median beef production project was 17 cents. (Chapter 
VI, Graph 16). 
The median beef production project ranked lower than any 
other type of project in net profit per project and also in net 
profit per hour of labor. The coefficient of variation indicates
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
that net profit was most variable and labor was the least vari- 
able.

Net Profit.—Data in Tables 61, 62, 63, and 64 show a wide 
range in net profit per, project for miscellaneous animal proj- 
ects. Each of the four states fell as.low as zero or a loss in 
profits. In “State Number Six,” the range was from zero or 
a loss to $1559.25 in net profit. The median net profit for the 
projects ranged from $17.50 in “State Number Two” to $35.00 
in “State Number One.” (Graph 12).
-P-A-G-E-122
122 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The average net profit ranged from $96.98 in “State Number 
One” to $129.29 in “State Number Six.” (Tables 61, 64). 
The upper quartile in each of these distributions is less 
than the average in net profit. This means that 75 per cent of 
these projects were below the average. 
Hours of Labor—tThe range in hours of labor devoted to 
miscellaneous animal projects was from 1 to 882 in “State 
Number Two.” (Table 62). 
The median was less than one-half the minimum standard 
in hours of labor in each state. (Tables 61-64). 
The median number of hours of labor ranged from 37.00 in 
“State Number Six” to 66.67 in “State Number Three.” (Graph 
12). 
The upper quartile in each state was below the minimum 
standard (180 hours) in hours of labor, which means that 75 
per cent or more were below the standard in hours of labor. 
The net profit per hour of labor for the median miscellan- 
eous animal project ranged from 28 cents to 91 cents. (Graph 
12). 
Summary of Miscellaneous Animal Projects—The range in 
miscellaneous animal projects was from zero or a loss in net 
profit to $1559.25 ; and from 1 to 882 hours of labor. As shown 
by the upper quartile in Table 65, more than 75 per cent of 
these projects were below the minimum standard in hours of 
labor. The median was less than one-third the standard in 
hours of labor. The middle 50 per cent ranged from 24.18 to 
99.40 hours of labor. The net profit per hour of labor was 65 
cents for the median project of this type, and 93 cents for the 
average. The net profit per hour of labor for the average mis- 
cellaneous animal project for the entire South (based upon 131 
projects) was 71 cents. (Appendix A, Table 76). 
Although more than 75 per cent of these projects were be- 
low the minimum standard in hours of labor, the net profit per 
hour of labor compared favorably with other projects.

Scope or Size.—Poultry projects ranged in size from 3 birds 
in “State Number One” to 500 birds in “State Number Six.” 
(Tables 66, 71). 
“States Number Three and Four” had as few as four birds 
for projects. The median poultry project ranged from 17 
birds in “State Number One” to 51 birds in “State Number 
Six.” (Graph 18). - 
It should be noted that the medians for “States Number Six 
and Seven” were 51 and 50 birds respectively. (Graph 13).
-P-A-G-E-132
    182 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The minimum standard in size calls for 100 birds. (Table 
1). 
Graph 13 shows that the medians for only two states were 
one-half the minimum standard (100 birds) in size. The upper 
quartile was up to the minimum standard in size in “State 
Number Six,” but considerably below the standard in all of the 
other states. (Tables 66-72). 
This means that the upper 25 per cent were up to or above 
the standard in only one state. Of the 93 projects in “State 
Number One,” only 7 projects (7 per cent) consisted of 100 or 
more birds. The standard calls for a minimum of 100 birds, 
therefore, 93 per cent of the projects in this state were below 
the minimum standard in size. In “State Number Two,” 96 
per cent of the poultry projects were below the standard in 
size. In “State Number Four,” none of the projects were one- 
half the standard in size. 
Net Profit—tThe net profit for poultry projects for 1920-21 
ranged from zero or a loss in each of the states to $932.35 in 
“State Number Six.” (Tables 66-72). 
The median net profit for poultry projects ranged from 
$17.22 in “State Number Two” to $27.86 in “State Number 
Seven.” Graph 13 shows the median net profit for poultry 
projects by states in order of rank. The average net profit 
ranged from $27.86 in “State Number Three” to $61.52 in 
“State Number Six.” (Tables 68, 71). 
The coefficient of variation shows that net profit was more 
variable in “State Number Six,” and least variable in “State 
Number Seven.” (Tables 66-72). 
Hours of Labor.—Poultry projects for 1920-21 ranged in 
hours of labor from 3 in “State Number One” to 1,165 in “State 
Number Six.” (Tables 66-72). 
The median poultry project ranged from 30.84 hours of 
labor in “State Number One” to 97.50 hours in “State Number 
Three.” (Tables 66, 68). 
Graph 13 shows the median hours of labor devoted to poul- 
try projects by states in. order of rank. The median of each 
state was below the minimum standard in hours of labor, and 
the medians of only two states were one-half the standard (180 
hours) in hours of labor. The upper quartile in each state was 
below the minimum standard in hours of labor, which shows 
that 75 per cent of these projects or more in each state were 
below the standard in hours of labor. (Tables 66-72). 
In “State Number One” only 2 projects (2 per cent) were 
up to the standard or above in hours of labor, which means 
that 98 per cent of the projects in this state were below the 
minimum standard in hours of labor. In “State Number Four” 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
Status of Agricultural Projects jin the South 1383 
only 2 per cent were up to the standard or above in hours of 
labor. (Table 69). 
The average number of hours of labor devoted to poultry 
projects ranged from 57.14 in “State Number One” to 106 in 
“State Number Three.” (Tables 66-72). 
The coefficient of variation indicates that poultry projects 
were more variable in hours of labor in “State Number Six” 
and least variable in “State Number Two.” (Tables 66-72). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median poultry projects 
ranged from 18 cents in “State Number Three” to 62 cents in 
“State Number One.” (Graph 13). 
The net profit per hour of labor for median poultry projects 
is illustrated in Graph 13. It should be noted that “State 
Number One” which ranked highest in net profit per hour of 
labor (median projects) ranked lowest of the seven states in 
size and also in hours of labor. This state ranked third from 
the bottom in net profit. “State Number Three” which ranked 
lowest in net profit per hour of labor, ranked highest in hours 
of labor and second from the bottom in net profit. A small net 
profit divided by a large number of hours of labor gave this 
state a low rank in net profit per hour of labor. 
Summary of Poultry Projects.—Data in Table 73 show that 
poultry projects for 1920-21 ranged from 3 to 500 birds in size; 
from zero or a loss to $932.35 in net profit; and from 3 to 1,165 
hours of labor. The median poultry project was less than one- 
third the minimum standards in size and in hours of labor. 
The upper quartiles in Table 73 show that 75 per cent of these 
projects were less than one-third the minimum standard in 
size, and that 75 per cent were a little more than one-half the 
minimum standard in hours of labor. This is true when meas- 
ured from the upper limits. The distribution on size shows 
that only 28 (9 per cent) of the 305 poultry projects consisted 
of 100 or more birds. This means that at least 91 per cent of 
these projects were below the minimum standard (100 birds) 
in size. The distribution on hours of labor shows that 18 
(6 per cent) of the poultry projects received 180 or more hours 
of labor. This means that 94 per cent of the poultry projects 
were below the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of 
labor. The average poultry project (based upon 305 projects) 
was less than one-half the minimum standards in size and in 
labor requirement. The averages in size and in hours of labor 
for the 305 projects here considered differed only slightly from 
the averages in size and in hours of labor for the entire South 
(based upon 483 projects). (Table 73, and Appendix A, Table 
15).

The median net profit for poultry projects, which was only 
$22.29, ranked third from the bottom with respect to live stock 
projects, and fourth from the bottom in respect to all projects 
included in this study. (Chapter VI, Graph 14). 
The net profit per hour of labor was 39 cents for the median 
poultry project, and 52 cents for the average (305 projects) 
project. (Chapter VI, Graph 16). 
The net profit per ‘hour of labor for the average poultry 
project for the entire South ‘(based upon 483 projects) was 52 
cents, which was identical with the average for the 305 proj- 
ects. (Appendix A, Table 76). 
Correlations—The correlation coefficients show a positive 
relationship between size and net profit, between size and hours 
of labor, and between net profit and hours of labor. The corre- 
lation between size and net profit was larger than between size 
and hours of labor or between net profit and hours of labor. 
(Table 73). 
The regression of size on net profit indicates that an in- 
crease of 1 bird in size would have been accompanied by an 
increase of 60 cents in net profit. If the average size had been 
100 birds (standard), the regression indicates that the average 
net profit would have been $75.77. The upper quartile in Table 
73 shows that 75 per cent of the poultry projects brought a net 
profit considerably below this average. The regression of hours 
of labor on net profit indicates that an additional hour of 
labor would have been acompanied by an increase of 21 cents 
in net profit. This regression indicates that 180 (standard) 
hours of labor would have increased the average net profit from 
$38.53 to $60.79. 
The correlation between size and net profit with hours of 
labor eliminated or controlled was reduced from .51 to .47. 
This indicates that the relationship between size and net profit 
was influenced very little if any by hours of labor. The corre- 
lation between net profit and hours of labor with the influence 
of size eliminated or controlled was reduced from .26 to .10. 
This indicates that size was a factor or a cause in the correla- 
tion between net profit and hours of labor. 
Summary or Live Stock Proszcrs. 
Of the 1,255 live stock projects included in this chapter, 89 
were miscellaneous animal projects which are not measured in 
scope or size. If the 89 miscellaneous animal projects are elim- 
inated, there will be left a total of 1,166 live stock projects 
which are measured in size. Of the 1,166 live stock projects 
which were measured in size, none of the medians were up to 
the minimum standards in size, except dairy projects. Dairy
-P-A-G-E-135
Status of Agricultural Projects.in the South 185 
projects constitute 12 per cent of the 1,166 live stock projects. 
Of the 503 hog feeding projects 92 per cent were below the 
minimum standard in size for these projects. Of the 182 hog 
breeding projects 99 per cent were less than one-half the mini- 
mum standard in size for these projects. Of the 36 beef pro- 
duction projects, 97 per cent were below the minimum standard 
in size for poultry projects. If the 140 dairy projects are elimi- 
nated, a total of 1,026 live stock projects will be left which were 
measured in size. Of the 1,026 live stock projects, more than 
90 per cent were below the minimum standards in size. Of the 
1,166 live stock projects which were measured in size, more 
than 75 per cent were below the minimum standards in size. 
The median of each type of the live stock projects was be- 
low the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. The 
upper quartile for each type of project, except dairy projects, 
was below the minimum standard in hours of labor. Since the 
median dairy project was below the minimum standard in 
hours of labor, the upper 50 per cent of these projects will not 
lower the upper quartile point for the entire distribution of 
hours of labor for live stock projects. The upper quartile for 
the total distribution of hours was below the standard (180 
hours) in hours of labor. This means that 75 per cent or more 
of these projects were below the minimum standard in hours 
of labor. Of the 503 hog feeding projects, 75 per cent were less 
than one-half the minimum standard in hours of labor. The 
same is true for hog breeding and beef production projects. 
The upper quartile for the 305 poultry projects was just a little 
more than one-half the minimum standard in hours of labor. 
Thus eliminating dairy projects, practically 75 per cent of the 
live stock projects were less than one-half the minimum stand- 
ard in hours of labor. 
The median number of hours of labor for the 1,255 live 
stock projects was 54.26. This is less than one-third the stand- 
ard. The upper quartile for the 1,255 live stock projects was 
96.66 hours of labor. This is a little more than one-half the 
standard (180 hours). The average number of hours of labor 
for these projects was 80.76. The average number of hours of 
labor for the live stock projects for the entire South (based 
upon 2,072 projects) was 71.65. 
The median net profit for live stock projects in order of 
rank was as follows: Dairy projects, $99.23; miscellaneous 
animal projects, $31.79; hog breeding projects, $25.64; poultry 
projects, $22.29; hog feeding projects, $19.19; and beef produc- 
tion projects, $8.18. (Chapter VI, Graph 14). 
The median net profit for the 1,255 live stock projects was 
$30.99. The average net profit for these projects was $51.59. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
136 Status of Agricultural Projects in the South 
The average net profit for the live stock projects for the entire 
South (based upon 2,072 projects) was $38.43. 
The net profit per hour of labor for median live stock proj- 
ects were as follows: Dairy projects, 68 cents; miscellaneous 
animal projects, 65 cents; hog breeding projects, 56 cents; hog 
feeding projects, 44 cents; poultry projects, 39 cents; and beef 
production projects, 17 cents. (Chapter VI, Graph 16). 
A comparison of Graphs 14 and 16 in Chapter VI shows 
that with the exception of hog feeding and poultry projects, 
the same rank is maintained for net profit for median live 
stock projects, and the net profit per hour of labor for median 
projects. In net profit for the median project, poultry was 
one rank above hog feeding projects. This order is reversed 
in rank of net profit per hour of labor for median projects. 
he net profit per hour of labor for the median live stock 
project was 57 cents. The net profit per hour of labor for the 
average live stock project (based upon 1,255 projects) was 64 
cents. The net profit per hour of labor for the average live 
stock project for the entire South (based upon 2,072 projects) 
was 54 cents.

CHAPTER VI. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS. 
Summary. 
Chapter I gives the purpose of the study, which is to learn 
the true status of agricultural projects in the South. As in- 
dicated in Chapter I, this study has attempted to answer the 
following questions: 1. How do the agricultural projects in 
the South compare with the standards for measuring projects? 
2. How do projects vary in size, net profit, and in hours of 
labor? 3. How do the various projects rank in net profit per 
(hour) unit of labor? 4. As measured by net profit per project 
and net profit per (hour) unit of labor, what types of projects 
are most desirable? 5. What is the relationship of size to net 
profit? 6. What progress has been made by the southern states 
in vocational agriculture, as measured by the addition of new 
schools and the increased number of pupils enrolled since 
1917-18? 
Chapter II shows the development of vocational agriculture 
since 1917-18 to 1920-21, as measured by the number of schools 
established and the number of pupils enrolled from year to 
year. The data presented in this chapter show that vocational 
agriculture has made progress from year to year since the 
passage of the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917. 
Chapters III, IV, and V present project data relating to 
field crops, gardening and trucking, and live stock respectively. 
Data in Table 74 show the per cent of projects up to or 
above their respective standards. The average net profit per 
pupil for the United States for agricultural projects in 1920-21 
was .09. (Appendix A, Table 75). It was found that $80.00 
was a more convenient point in the distributions on net profit 
than $83.09, therefore, this point was used in Table 74. The 
standard in hours of labor for all projects is 180. (Table 1).

*(Per cent of size is based upon 2,595 projects, which excludes miscellaneous 
crop, farm management, and miscellaneous animal projects, which are not 
measured in size.) 
**For the 2,790 projects the average (arithmetic mean) net profit was 
$54.24, and the average number of hours of labor was 101.89. 
Field Crop Projects——Of the 1,269 field crop projects in- 
cluded in this study, 48 farm management and 58 miscellan- 
eous crop projects, which were not measured in size, were in- 
cluded. Eliminating these projects which were not measured 
in size, leaves 1,163 field crop projects which were measured in 
size. i 
Of the 1,163 field crop projects which were measured in size, 
30.18 per cent were up to or above their respective standards 
in size. (Based upon data in Table 74). This means that ap- 
proximately 70 per cent of these projects were below the stand- 
ards in, size. Data in Table 74 show that practically 87 per 
cent of the potato projects and practically 80 per cent of the 
corn projects were below the standards in size for these proj- 
ects. Tobacco and cotton projects ranked highest, as measured 
by their standards in size. 
Of the 1,269 field crop projects, 20.41 per cent were up to 
or above $80.00 in net profit. Practically 80 per cent of these 
projects were below the average net profit for the United States 
in 1920-21. Data'in Table 74 show how these projects ranked
-P-A-G-E-139
Status of Agricultural Projects,in the South 139 
in net profit. Practically 87 per cent of the 574 corn projects 
were below the average net profit for the United States. Soy- 
bean projects ranked lowest, while farm management projects 
ranked highest in net profit. 
Of the 1,269 field crop projects, 19.54 per cent were up to 
or above the minimum standard (180 hours) in hours of labor. 
More than 80 per cent of the field crop projects were below the 
minimum standard in labor requirement. Soybean, water- 
melon, and potato projects ranked lowest of the field crop proj- 
ects in hours of labor, while farm management ranked highest. 
The per cent of these projects below the standard in hours of 
labor ranged from 37.50 for farm management to 93 for soy- 
bean, watermelon, and potato projects. (Table 74). 
In Size, practically 70 per cent of the field crop projects 
were below the minimum standards by which these projects 
have been measured. In net profit, practically 80 per cent of 
these projects were below the average for the United States. 
In hours of labor devoted to projects, more than 80 per cent of 
the field crop projects were below the minimum standard (180 
hours). : 
Gardening and Trucking Projects—A total of 189 garden 
projects and a total of 77 truck projects are included in this 
study. Data in Table 74 show that 51.32 per cent of the garden 
projects, and that 10.00 per cent of the truck projects were up 
to or above their standards in size. Only 48.68 per cent of the 
. garden projects were below the standard in size for this type 
of project, but 90 per cent of the truck projects were below the 
standard in size for these projects. With the gardening and 
trucking projects combined, 39.47 per cent were up to or above 
their respective standards in size. To put it another way, 
60.53 per cent of these projects were below their standards in 
size. 
In net profit, 18.52 per cent of the garden projects and 12.99 
per cent of the truck projects were up to or above $80.00. This 
means that 81.48 per cent of the garden projects and 87.01 per 
cent of the truck projects were below $80.00 in net profit. With 
the 189 garden projects and the 77 truck projects combined, 
16.91 per cent of these projects were up to or above $80.00 in 
net profit. More than 83 per cent of these projects were below 
the average net profit for the United States, which was $83.09 
in 1920-21. 
In hours of labor, 91 per cent of the garden projects and 96 
per cent of the truck projects were below the minimum stand- 
ard (180). With the garden and the truck projects combined, 
92 per cent were below the standard in hours of labor.

In size, 60.53 per cent of the gardening and trucking proj- 
ects were below their respective standards. In net profit, more 
than 83 per cent of the gardening and trucking projects were 
below the average for the United States ($83.09). In hours of 
labor, 92 per cent of these projects were below the minimum 
standard (180 hours). ; 
Live Stock Projects.—Of the 1,255 live stock projects includ- 
ed in this study, 89 were miscellaneous animal projects which 
were not measured in size. Eliminating these, a total of 1,166 
live stock projects which are measured in size is left. Of the 
1,166 live stock projects, the per cent up to or above their re- 
spective standards in size ranged from 1 for hog breeding proj- 
ects to 100 for dairy projects. Of the 1,166 live stock projects, 
19.12 per cent were up to or above their respective standards 
in size. More than 80 per cent of these projects were below the 
standards in size. 
Of the 1,255 live stock projects, the per cent up to or above 
$80.00 in net profit ranged from 8.00 for beef production proj- 
ects to 52.86 for dairy projects. With the 1,255 live stock proj- 
ects combined, 16.97 per cent were up to or above $80.00 in net 
profit. This means that more than 83 per cent of these projects 
were below $80.00 in net profit. The average net profit per 
pupil for the United States in 1920-21 was $83.09. 
The per cent of the live stock projects up to or above the 
minimum standard in hours of labor ranged from 2 for hog 
breeding projects to 46.43 for dairy projects. With these proj- 
ects combined, 8 per cent'were up to or above the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. This means that 92 per cent of the 
live stock projects'were below the minimum standard in hours 
of labor. 
In size, more than 80.00 per cent of the live stock projects 
were below their respective standards; in net profit, more than 
83.00 per cent were ‘below the average for the United States 
in 1920-21; and in hours of labor, 92 per cent were below the 
minimum standard. 
Live stock projects represent the widest range in size and in 
hours of labor, especially is this'true for hog breeding projects. 
Of the 182 hog breeding projects, 99 per cent were below the 
minimum standard in size, and 98 per cent were below the 
minimum standard in hours of labor. Dairy projects ranked 
highest in size, but the standard calls for only 1 dairy cow, 
which makes it impossible to have a dairy project and rank 
other than perfect so far as size is concerned. Hog feeding 
ranked relatively low in size and in hours of labor. Of the 
5083 hog feeding projects, 92 per cent were below the standard 
in size, and 96 per cent were below the standard in hours of

Status of Agricultural Projects,in the South 141 
labor. Of the field crop projects, potato projects ranked lowest 
in size and one of the lowest in hours of labor. Of the 269 
potato projects, practically 87 per cent were below 'the mini- 
mum standard in size, and 93 per cent were below the minimum 
standard in hours of labor. Tobacco projects ranked highest 
of the field crop projects in size, and relatively high in net 
profit and in hours of labor. Of the 43 tobacco projects, 91.00 
per cent were up to or above the standard in size. 
Of the 2,595 projects which were measured in size, the 
medians of cotton, tobacco, garden, and dairy projects only 
were up to or above their respective standards in size. These 
projects constitute 20.69 per cent of the projects which were 
measured in size. This means that the medians of practically 
80 per cent of these projects were below their respective stand- 
ards in size. Data in Table 74 show that 74.22 per cent of 
these projects were below the minimum standards in size. 
Of the 2,790 projects included in this study, the medians of 
97 per cent were below the minimum standard (180 hours) in 
hours of labor. The medians of 81 per cent of these projects 
were less than one-half the minimum standard in hours of 
labor. (Graph 15). 
Of the 2,790 individual projects here considered, 74.22 per 
cent were below their respective standards in size; 81.47 per 
cent were below $80.00 (the average net profit for the United 
States in 1920-21 was $83.09) in net profit; and 86.71 per cent 
were below the minimum standard in hours of labor. (Table 
74). 
Projects Ranked in Order of Net Profit—Data in Graph 14 
illustrate net profit for median projects in order of rank. The 
median net profit for these projects in order of rank was as

CoNcLUSIONS. 
The data presented in this study seem to justify the follow- 
ing conclusions, which are numbered in order of the problems 
heretofore stated. 
1. There seems to be a strong tendency among officials and 
teachers in charge of agricultural projects to ignore standards. 
As measured by the standards a large percentage of these proj- 
ects were too small. It has been shown that practically 75 per 
cent of the projects included in this study were below their re- 
spective standards in size, and practically 87 per cent were be- 
low the minimum standards in hours of labor. Whatever merit 
may be claimed for the standards by which these projects have 
been measured, there seems to be no justification for such a 
variation in projects as exists in the South. If agricultural 
projects are to constitute a vital part of the high school course 
of study, there is a great need of giving attention to standards. 
If one high school pupil of median ability should devote 1 hour 
of actual work to his laboratory in chemistry, physics, or biol- 
ogy and some other pupil of equal ability attending the same 
school and in the same class should put/in 1,165 hours of work 
on his laboratory in these subjects one would be justified in 
questioning the efficiency of the school system. This wide range 
was reported in projects. 
2. Projects ranged in size from 0.25 of an acre to 20 acres 
in corn; from 0.50 of an acre to 40 acres in cotton; and from 
3°to 500 birds in poultry. In net profit projects ranged from 
zero or a loss to $1559.25. Projects ranged from 1 to 1,165 
hours of labor. 
The coefficient of variation indicates'that beef production 
projects were most variable in size, and that truck projects 
were the least variable in this:respect. Potato, corn, and cot- 
ton projects were more variable in size than tobacco projects. 
Dairy projects were more variable in size than poultry projects. 
Beef production projects were the most variable in net profit, 
while hog breeding projects were the least variable. Miscel- 
laneous animal projects were the most variable in hours of labor, 
while hog breeding projects were the least variable Of the 
field crop projects, peanut projects were the most variable, 
while watermelon projects were the least variable'in hours of 
labor. 
8. Dairy projects ranked highest in net'profit per hour of 
labor for median projects, while beef production projects 
ranked lowest in this respect. Of the’ field crop projects, pota- 
to projects ranked highest, while miscellaneous crop projects 
ranked lowest in net profit per'hour of labor. The upper 50 
per cent of these projects in net profit, per hour of labor for
-P-A-G-E-143
Status of Agricultural Projects.in the South 143 
median projects in order were as follows: Dairy, miscellan- 
eous animal, potato, hog breeding, tobacco, soybean, sugar cane, 
and hog feeding projects. (Graph 16). 
4. As measured by net profit for median projects, farm 
management projects! were the most desirable, while beef pro- 
duction projects were the least desirable. Projects which ranked 
high in net profit and in net profit per hour’ of labor (medians) 
were dairy, tobacco, potato, sugar cane, and miscellaneous ani- 
mal projects. (Graphs 14, 16). 
5. Positive correlations were found to exist between size 
and net profit for the following projects: Cotton, corn, potato, 
peanut, soybean, garden, truck, hog feeding, and poultry. These 
positive correlations and the regressions of size on net profit 
indicate that as projects increased in size the net profit likewise 
increased, and that as projects decreased in size the net profit 
likewise decreased. The relationship of size to net profit sug- 
gests the need of more attention being given to size of projects.

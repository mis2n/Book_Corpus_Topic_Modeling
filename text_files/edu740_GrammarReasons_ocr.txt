  FOREWORD 
A wise abstinence as well as a wise selection is essential 
to success.—W. D. Wuirney. 
This is not a text-book of English grammar in the 
ordinary sense. It has no set lessons or exercises to 
be given to a class of learners, nor does it attempt 
fully to cover the ground of grammatical science. 
Such omissions as those of the rules for irregular 
plurals, the principal parts of strong verbs, the declen- 
sions of the personal pronouns, and similar grammatical 
details have been freely made. All of these are easily 
accessible in the common school text-books of grammar 
and their introduction would add nothing to a student’s 
resources. 
This is a series of essays, dealing with the more 
important parts of English grammar, and also to some 
extent with the development of grammar itself as a 
science, and with the grammatical changes that have 
taken place in English since the invention of printing 
and the growth of modern literature gave a degree 
of fixity to language forms. It is a free discussion of 
the present day status of English grammar and of the 
relations of this science to other forms of language study. 
The “ins and outs’’ of grammar, those related ideas 
that in most modern text-books are made the subject 
of fine-print footnotes, are here a fundamental part of 
xl 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii Foreword 
the text itself. The aim has been in a condensed and 
readable form to throw light from various sources 
upon the difficult parts of this very technical and 
somewhat unpopular subject, and also to show some 
of the reasons why English grammar has been cast 
in the mould in which we find it. Some comparisons 
of the grammar of English with that of other languages 
are also included, with the emphasis, however, laid 
always upon the English side. 
There has been no effort to adapt the book to the 
needs of very elementary students. For this reason 
illustrations have been somewhat sparingly used, but 
it is thought that enough are included to make these 
discussions easily intelligible to those for whom they 
are chiefly intended. 
While this cannot take the place of a text-book of 
grammar for lower grade schools, it is believed that 
it will fill an important place as a book to be read and 
studied, not only by teachers of grammar, but also by 
students in colleges, normal schools, high schools, and 
academies, who are looking forward to the teaching 
of English, or who are specially interested in the 
study of the English tongue. 
Yet the English language belongs to all who speak, 
and read and write it. Journalists and other writers 
have their own special relations to the matters here 
discussed. And there are many general readers whose 
training and trend of thinking have given them an 
interest in these subjects. To all of these classes and 
to the many foreign students of English who have
-P-A-G-E-13
Foreword xiii 
felt the need of some compendium of English grammar 
prepared on a more general plan than that of the 
ordinary text-books, this book is offered in the belief 
that it will fill a place hitherto unoccupied as an aid 
to the comprehensive study of the English language. 
The book had its immediate beginning in a series 
of “ Talks on Grammar,” written for the New England 
Journal of Education. Similar articles, contributed 
to The School Journal and other educational papers, 
were added, and thanks are due to all these periodicals 
for permission to republish these in book form. Yet 
none of these chapters are in their original shape. 
The whole was afterwards re-written, and much new 
material was added in order to make a complete and 
consistent whole. A few chapters addressed to spec- 
ialists—as teachers of grammar and writers—and a 
bibliography of the subject, have been added, and 
constitute “Part Second.” 
In the preparation of these chapters many text- 
books, both ancient and modern, have been consulted, 
and quotations from some of these grammars have 
been freely used, as chapter headings or in the text 
itself. The quotation headings do not always agree 
fully with each other or with the chapter below. They 
are intended not always to present the author’s own 
view of the subject, but to serve as side lights, showing 
how the phases of grammar have been variously 
treated by different writers and in different ages. The 
selection of these significant extracts from other writings 
on grammar has occupied many pleasant hours, and
-P-A-G-E-14
xiv Foreword 
it is believed that the introduction of this feature will 
add greatly to the value of the book. Many other 
quotations of nearly equalinterest might have been chosen, 
and there has been a temptation to extend this element 
of the book to larger limits. But some restraint seemed 
to be needful here, as this is not intended as a “gram- 
mar of grammars”’ after the Goold Brown pattern, 
but as a presentation of the best modern thought on 
the subject of English grammar. 
Some of the quotations used are the gatherings of 
a teacher’s notebook through many years of teaching, 
and it has not seemed possible in every instance to 
trace the quotation to its original source. Most of 
them, however, have been freshly selected as the direct 
result of the extensive reading required by the prepa- 
ration of this book. 
The author wishes to acknowledge many kind and 
helpful suggestions from personal friends engaged 
in normal school, college, and editorial work, who have 
taken an interest in the preparation of this book. 
Special thanks are given to Professor E. 8. Joynes, of 
South Carolina College, who read the book in manu- 
script, giving much valuable and critical help. 
Acknowledgments are also due to Professors F. A. 
Blackburn and A. H. Tolman, of Chicago University, 
for material included in certain chapters. Secretary

GRAMMAR AND ITS REASONS 
  
I 
PRESENT-DAY ENGLISH GRAMMAR 
There is an ever increasing class of persons, so heterodox 
as to advocate that English which hitherto has sat with ex- 
ceeding humility in the lower seats of the synagogue shall 
be bidden universally to come up higher.—Wetsx. 
Some. superfluities have been expunged, some mistakes 
have been rectified, and some obstacles have been removed. 
—Gootp Brown. 
We are freeing ourselves from the tyranny of Latin models 
and are substituting a grammar which deals simply with 
the vital facts of the English tongue.—Cuvss. 
In offering to the public a new presentation of an 
old subject, one faces two practical questions: Is the 
subject itself of vital interest to the present age? And 
does the new treatment really add anything of value 
to the older writings on the subject ? 
The first question, as applied to English grammar, 
would be answered by many persons in the negative. 
The revelations of natural science are giving a new 
interpretation to the universe. Philosophy, theology, 
and psychology are changing their points of view and 
making conquests in hitherto unexplored fields. The 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    
   2 Grammar and Its Reasons 
development of art in America is opening new vistas 
to the esthetic imagination. History is re-writing 
itself upon new basic principles, and social science is 
grappling complex problems of vital importance to the 
practical welfare of mankind. How then can such an 
abstract or unpractical subject as the theories of 
grammatical relationships gain a hearing from this 
busy age? 
Furthermore, is there anything new to be said on 
the old and hackneyed subject? When Goold Brown’s 
Grammar of Grammars was published at the middle of 
the nineteenth century it seemed as if all that had 
ever been thought or that could be thought regarding 
English grammar had been gathered into that volumi- 
nous compilation. But of making many grammar 
books there has been no end in the years that have 
passed since then. 
Yet in spite of allthis, we venture to think that 
English grammar has not been worn threadbare; 
that it has a sort of perennial value to an important, 
even if limited, class of the world’s thinkers, and that 
with all the other sciences, it has its new message 
for the new age. 
In the famous “Report of the Committee of Fifteen 
on the Correlation of Studies in Elementary Schools,” 
published in 1895 by the National Educational Asso- 
ciation, Dr. W. T. Harris, the author of the report, 
uses these words: “ Gappmanasis th science. of | lan- 
guage, and as the first of the seven liberal arts, it*has 
long held. sway- in. school.as.the disciplinary study par

a fara and the logical forms of subject, predicate, 
and modifier, thus revealing the essential nature of 
"ippajgiaplintimenectinenaianicalal hiec's because 
i self-object.” 
Yet with this high estimate of the value of grammar 
comes the word of limitation and of caution. The 
same report well says: “No formal labor on a great 
objective field is ever wholly lost, . . . but it is 
easy for any special formal discipline when continued 
too long, to paralyze or arrest growth at that stage. 
: Grammar, rich as it isin its contents, is only 
a formal discipline as respects the scientific, historic, 
or literary contents of language, and is indifferent to 
them. A training for four or five years in parsing 
and grammatical analysis, practised on literary works 
of art (Milton, Shakespeare, Tennyson, Scott), is a 
training of the pupil into habits of indifference toward, 
and neglect of, the genius employed in the literary 
work of art. . . . Your Committee is unanimous 
in the conviction that formal grammar should not be 
allowed to usurp the place of a study of the literary 
work of art in accordance with literary method.” 
Grammar has other deficiencies as a language study 
which literature alone cannot supply. The habit of 
mind which grammar induces is critical and_ this 
always impedes fluency of expression. Although gram-

4 Grammar and Its Reasons 
mar is one of = epee aids to composition, yet 
    g elf up € spontaneous expression of its 
eee. Grammar is able to achieve its own 
ends perfectly only when it is pursued side by side 
with literary study and practical composition, each of 
the three aiding and supplementing the other. two 
in the united effort to produce genuine language power. 
But after all its limitations have been conceded, 
and the claims of other branches of knowledge pro- 
vided for, there still remains a clear field of perpetual 
human interest in the subjects that grammar deals with. 
In this territory new mines of great depth and 
richness have been opened during recent years. Com- 
parative and historical grammar has added much to 
the older material. The English language has been , 
gaining in powers of expression, and in prestige among 
the languages of the world, In this process it has 
cast off some old restraints and has added new logical 
relationships, which require grammatical interpretation. 
Much interesting material has been brought forward 
by writers on grammar within a generation, and this 
needs to be sifted and classified, and to find clear and 
permanent expression for the general public. 
And so it does not seem an ignoble or valueless task 
to bring together these newer thoughts that have 
presented themselves to thinkers, and to set forth in 
a new book in these early years of the twentieth 
century, the status of Present-Day English Grammar.

HISTORIC GROWTH OF GRAMMAR 
In science, a phenomenon is explained by its antecedent 
phenomena. A tree is explained, not by its full-leaved 
glory, but by the states and forms through which it has suc- 
cessively advanced.—WELsH. 
Under the light that has come from the advance in Eng- 
lish philology the old notion that the best approach to Eng- 
lish grammar is through the Latin grammar, has vanished 
forever.—ALLEN. 
The real history of grammar is little known, because the 
story of the systems most generally received has never been 
fully told.—Gootp Brown. 
Grammarians are» the» guardians, “not ‘the authors, 
_language.—TraNnsLaTED FROM SENECA. 
The history of a science often shows peculiar phases, 
but perhaps none has had more marked mutations 
than have been felt by English grammar. The form 
which the science has taken bears curious marks of 
the history through which it, has passed, and the 
present grammar ideals are to be interpreted in part 
by the early history. 
In tracing these changes one needs to bear in mind 
the important distinction between Universal or General 
grammar, and the particular grammar of an individual 
* tongue. Long before the specific grammar of English 
was thought of, the principles of general grammar 
5

6 Grammar and Its Reasons 
were wrought out through the»Greek and Latin lan- 
fii eatialincaaienlodeenieginieteyesiensiazsica| 
olars of England. The history of English grammar 
‘ammar. 
The earliest traces of grammatical study that we have 
anv record of, come from . The-scholars of 
that ancient kingdom compiled dictionaries,to aid 
themselves in learning the language of a still earlier 
people who occupied the same territory. Fragments 
of thesenamelenensnmenienaeemses spas the ruins 
of the royal libraries of Sargon ne Assurbanipal. 
This purpose of acquiring foreign languages, rather 
than of understanding or perfecting the use of one’s 
own tongue;was:the dominant. one inearly grammatical 
studies, and it still holds as an important reason for 
the. study. of grammar to-day. 
It was among the Greeks that the doctrine of the 
Parts of Speech first appeared. “Plato began it by 
dividing words into nouns: and syerbs, but without 
defining either. Aristotle, for rhetorical purposes, 
added conjunctions and articles; but by the latter he 
meant chiefly pronouns or relatives. Protagoras, 
Azistophanes, and other Grecian writers advanced 
certain grammatical ideas; but the science of grammar 
did not advance very far within the borders of ancient 
Greece itself. 
The critical study of language was really bogus by 
Greek scholars at In 
this city about 10,000 students were gathered thes

all parts of the world to make use of the famous libraries 
) where all languages having any claim to literature 
were représe 2 im 
pointed out ‘personal pronouns as a lee of words, 
stantives. ‘About a hundred years B. C., Aristarchus 
founded. in Alexandria a.celebrated grammatical and 
critical school. It was. he who. discussed»prepositions 
for the first time, and the Alexandrian students made 
other contributions to the growing language study. 
Later it became fashionable for young Roman gentry 
to learn Greek. About29°B. C.,-Dionysius; who had 
been a pupil in the Alexandrian School, went from 
nd the 
lectures which he gave there were finally reduced to 
book form. This. was the earliest European treatise 
- During the Gallic War cs wrote in his tent a 
treatise on grammatical matters, and invented the 
term “ablative case.” In the first century A. D., 
Quintilian wrote..a. complete. system of. rhetoric in 
twelve books, in which verbs, nouns, and adjectives 
are» recognized, but not the other parts of speech.’ 
By the writings of Dionysius, Quintilian, and their 
successors, the Latin language was finally pressed 
into the mould of Greek grammar, much as in later 
ages the» languages» of “modern Europe have been 
interpreted»through the forms of Latin. The form of 
grammar as taught during the middle ages was finally 
fixed by ‘Priscian, who was master of a famous school
-P-A-G-E-24
8 Grammar and Its Reasons 
in Constantinople, and who, about 525 A. D., wrote 
a very famous book on grammar. His rigid attention 
to grammatical correctness gave rise to. the phrase 
“breaking Priscian’s head,” which was applied to the 
violators of grammatical rules. By thus fixing the 
form of grammar for the Middle Ages, he laid the 
foundations for modern grammar. 
The first manuals of grammar used in England were - 
not English grammars in any sense. Most of them 
Others were simply translations - 
of the Latin “ Accidence,” written to aid British youth 
in gaining a knowledge of the Latin tongue without 
any thought of accuracy in their own. 
Of the early Latin grammars that were in use in 
England before English grammar originated, much 
might be said. One of these, called the»Minerva of 
_ Sanctius, is thus described by Dr. W. T. Harris: 
“This Minerva of Sanctius is a wonderful collection 
of deen, atusdieaan dvatin seelsesions gg sor iventions, the logical basis for the distinction of the parts of 
spee i syntax. When one 
first. studies Fiat he is amazed to find how much 
philosophy of ngotten or 
has never foun cy way into English grammar.” 
The idea of applying grammar to English does not 
seem to have dawned until the time of the Tudor 
kings. Even then it was not English grammar that 
was directly taught. It was still the grammar of 
Latin, written however with the added idea that all 
grammar could be taught through the medium of Latin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
Historic Growth of Grammar 9 
But the grammar of the highly inflected Latin, with 
its large syntax dependent on inflection, proved to be 
a gigantic mould for the vigorous Englis i 
tal at nt of Rg et 
an reements, thus making its word relations mostly 
logical, rather than dependent’ on: grammatical forms. 
It is little wonder that the later history of English 
grammar has presented many phases and has had 
curious reactions, both in its aim and in the methods by 
which it has been pursued. 
- Most famous among the grammars of England 
during this Latin-English period, was that i 
me first high master of St. Paul’ Schoe: 
grammar were written expressly for use in this 
school and so gained’the name of “ Paul’s Accidence.”” 
Lily died of the plague in 1522, and his grammatical 
writings were not published in collected form until 
twenty years later. “About 1543, by order of King 
Henry the Eighth, Lily’s bock was put into final 
shape and ordered to be the standard book on gram- 
mar in the English kingdom. it soon became 
known as the grammar of King Henry. the Eighth, 
though Erasmus and other. scholars _ took part 
for: 
it an introduction which was the first attempt 
to wri ‘mal tr nglish grammar. The 
author treated English as in all respects like Latin or 
Greek, with no laws of its own. This famous grammar 
of William Lily or King Henry the Eighth, was written 
in English, but applied directly to the Latin tongue,
-P-A-G-E-26
ee Le ae 
  10 Grammar and Its Reasons 
and was intended as a general work on the science of 
grammar. It mamed "eight parts)/of “speech, though 
not precisely the same ones that are recognized to-day. 
d years Lily’s grammar was a standard 
text-book in England. 
Another “interesting ancient grammar was. Pals- 
seve reaarale Prench, gratia, composed for 
the use of the Princess Mary, and printed in 1530. 
It contained a French Accidence and Syntax, with 
idioms and vocabulary. The book was written in 
‘English-and it illustrated. the French..by comparison ' wal Cagis so it has been of high value in showing 
the authorized forms of English of that date. 
‘! ‘ammar is 
now recognized by scholars as the first genuinely 
English grammar. Yet this honor was claimed for 
that of »William..Bullokar, who published in 1586 A 
Bref Grammar for English, which he declared was 
“The first grammar for English that ever waz except 
my grammar at large.”” Of the “Grammar at large,” 
no trace can now be found. After this, various gram- 
mars of English were prepared, though some of these 
were still written in Latin, like that of John Wallis, in 
the time of William and Mary. 
Among the eighteenth - century grammar makers 
muel 
Johnson. In § mmar, which was published 
in 1712, the distinguished author tried to make his 
ject more interesting to pupils by putting many of 
his rules an ciples in 7 ich has
-P-A-G-E-27
  Historic Growth of Grammar ll 
been adopted by re later writers on the dry subject 
of grammar. 
Thus Steele wrote: 
Grammar do’s all the arts and knowledge teach 
According to the Use of every speech, 
How we our Thoughts most justly may express 
In Words together joined in Sentences. 
One of the most important text-books of the eight- 
eenth century was Dr. Robert Lowth’s Short Intro- 
duction to English Grammar, published in 1763. It 
had a wide use and is recognized as having been the 
chief model for the still more famous Lindley Murray’s 
grammar a generation later. In issuing his grammar 
near the close of the eighteenth century, Murray 
acknowledges for his materials books by Harris, 
Johnson, Lowth, Priestley, Beattie, Sheridan, Walker, 
and Coote. Several other English grammars that were 
issued previous to Murray’s are not included in this list. 
The» most interesting and» curious of eighteenth 
century books on English grammar is that of John 
Horne Tooke, ‘who ’publishedin” 1786 his famous 
Epea Pteroenta, or Diversions of Purley, in which, 
under the form of dialogue, he advances various 
ingenious. grammatical.theories; such as, that all the 
little connecting words (or particles) of language are 
verbs. Horne Tooke . 
made many mistakes and was a most imperfect guide, 
yet his astute discussions are still read with some 
interest by students, and throw considerable light,
-P-A-G-E-28
12 Grammar and Its Reasons 
not so much on the facts of grammar, as on the varied 
history through which the science has passed. 
But among the names of English grammarians 
before the nineteenth century, there is none that can 
rank in point of popular favor and influence with that 
of Lindley Murray. He was a Pennsylvanian Quaker, 
who, removing to England, published about 1790 the 
first of the many school-books which have borne his 
name. The multiplied copies of these books are said 
to have reached a sale of five millions or more in 
England and America. 
Murray’s grammar was professedly a compilation 
and has been criticised by Goold Brown and others 
as not being a work of original scholarly research. But 
while other grammatical treatises may have been 
more profound and original, the work of putting into 
popular form the approved thought of the age on a 
subject of universal interest is not one to be treated 
with light appreciation. It» was) Lindley Murray’s 
grammar more than any other/influence, perhaps, that

thorough and systematic,” and ‘‘No teaching of grammar in 
the schools.”—F,. H. Date. 
It is only too easy to overdo the teaching of formal gram- 
mar.—Lewis. 
The uselessness of “make-believe grammar” was respon- 
sible for a marked reaction against all formal teaching of 
English grammar, which was very noticeable for a time.— 
A. H. Totman. 
Sir, the English language has no grammar at all.— 
Dr. JoHNson. 
The well-known facts brought out by R. G. White and 
others do not show that English is a grammarless tongue; 
but only, so to speak, a concordless tongue. The objection 
holds good against the old conception of grammar, but has 
no weight against the modern conception of grammar.—

to grammatical activity began to show itself in America 
as well as in England. In some old libraries may be

found an interesting little book in board covers called 
A Grammatical. Institute of the English Language, 
by nencallilitiesdliiieesntinissathalianianein 1790. This was one of a series of three school-books by 
Webster, of which the famous blue-backed speller 
was one. In his Grammatical Institute, the author 
modestly saysy**Ivhave*attempted to simplify a very 
pnb ciiceiaAndashallaahempententetetehtcd to, the o shall suggest any improvement.” 
Noah Webster had a unique place as a grammarian. 
He was very learned, but an iéonoclast, and somewhat 
changeable in his views. In one of his books he 
names eight parts of speech, but in another he follows 
the lead of Lowth and others, and recognizes only six. 
His grammatical writings would perhaps have had a 
larger influence but for the overpowering circulation 
of Murray’s grammar that appeared very soon after- 
wards in England and was for half a century a standard 
text-book in Great Britain and America. 
In 1799 Caleb Bingham (the author of two other 
ancient school-books, The American Preceptor, 
and The Columbian Orator,) issued the first edition 
of The Young Lady’s Accidence, which was “De- 
signed principally for the use of young learners, more 
especially of the Fair Sew, though proper for the other.” 
It had upon its title page the familiar couplet: 
Delightful task! to rear the tender thought, 
To teach the young idea how to shoot. 
This was the first English grammar used in the Boston

public schools, though this, as well as Webster’s 
Grammatical Institute, was soon superseded by Mur- 
ray’s grammar. 
But as interest in the subject increased, other gram- 
mars were published in America, following more or 
less closely Murray’s plan, until the work of elaboration 
culminated, about the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, in that great thesaurus of rules and exceptions, 
rs, a closely 
printed volume of more than a thousand pages. This 
phenomenal book for a long time went begging for a 
publisher who would dare to undertake such a pub- 
lication. But at last the Legislature of Massachusetts 
became its patron. The book was printed and a copy 
given to each of the members of the Legislature. 
Busy people of to-day have little use for this great 
grammar of grammars, but the book remains in libraries 
ard 
encyclopedia of grammatical information up to the 
time when it was written. 
Meanwhile the methods of grammar used in the 
schools were also becoming much elaborated. An 
important step in the history of grammar method 
was made about 1823, when Kirkham’s grammar was 
published, containing a carefully developed “System- 
atic Order of Parsing.” Elaborate parsing models 
were given and the parsing of standard literature 
became an important school exercise. 
In 1847 another important innovation in grammar 
method was caused by the publication of Samuel S. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
16 Grammar and Iis Reasons 
Greene’s English Analysis. A few years later this 
book was extensively used in grammar classes all over 
the country and had added to the older parsing practices 
some elements of real value. 
But in the midst of all this development of the science 
and method of grammar, for many years during the 
nineteenth century a counter movement was taking 
place. A strong opposition was developed to English 
grammar itself, as well as to the ideas that it had 
become burdened with. 
The fact that English grammar had been founded 
upon the forms of Latin had brought into the text- 
books distinctions which did not really exist in the 
language. It was not that scholarly men really be- 
lieved that English had all these grammatical dis- 
tinctions, but it was still felt that English must be 
interpreted by the principles that had been wrought 
out through the study of Latin. 
But during the first half of the nineteenth century, 
thoughtful men began to sift the Essentials of Eng- 
lish Grammar from the heterogeneous mass which 
had been gathered. In 1833 William B. Fowle, a 
Boston teacher, put forth ar, 
declaring that verbs have no voice, od, and 
only two tenses,—with many other radical changes. 
Especially after so large a showing as was made by 
Goold Brown’s Grammar of Grammars, it was not to 
be wondered at that the pendulum should swing 
rapidly toward the other extreme. 
It began to be whispered in various quarters that   
-P-A-G-E-33
  Grammar in America 7 
the ends for which grammar had been pursued were 
not realized by this means. Grammar had not suc- 
ceeded in making people “speak and write correctly.” 
Another idea that dawned upon educators was that 
the scope of grammar was narrower than had hitherto 
been accorded to it. Students decided that Orthoepy, 
eee: a part of Etymology itself were not really a part of grammar,—that only the 
inflections of words, and the word order and relations 
of the sentence were legitimately to be included. 
Between 1860 and 1880 there was a great descent in 
the size of grammar treatises and various thin booklets 
came into being, each claiming to contain “all that 
there is of English grammar.” 
Yet, when that bold iconoclast and keen verbal 
critic, Richard Grant White, published Words and 
Their Uses, with its chapter on ‘The Grammarless 
Tongue,” and a few years later, Every Day Eng- 
lish, in which he declared that “there really is no 
such thing as grammar in the English language,” no 
little buzzing was heard in the hive of busy grammarians. 
When the natural opposition to such ultra sentiments 
had somewhat subsided, the effect of the whole mixed 
discussion became manifest in an epidemic of books 
of “Language Lessons,” books large and small, good, 
bad, and indifferent, all specially recommended for 
schools as ignoring the distinctions of technical gram- 
mar. Towns and cities began to question the advisa- 
bility of having any formal grammar taught in their 
schools, and even the Connecticut State Board of
-P-A-G-E-34
  18 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Education discontinued the State examinations in 
English grammar, giving the following reasons :* 
“(1) The study of grammar or analysis does not 
help us either to speak or write our language. (2) As 
a. study, technical grammar is hateful to any child and 
belongs to an advanced course, if anywhere. Its use 
in an elementary school is contrary to all approved 
pedagogical theories. (3) There is not time for such 
work, and for other subjects that belong to our civi- 
lization. (4) We are convinced that the discipline 
said to be derived from the study of grammar can be 
secured by the study of other subjects, for instance, 
natural science, which of itself furnishes practical 
knowledge.” 
But even at this stage of the history there were not 
wanting those who declared that “the new departure 
in language study was an unfortunate one,” that the 
text-book makers had “gone to the opposite extreme, 
ruling out those parts of English grammar which are 
absolutely indispensable to a knowledge of our lan- 
guage,” and that “sentence-building can never be a 
substitute for solid grammar.” The writings of the 
late Professor Whitney, a few years ago, marked an 
important adyance in the right understanding of the 
place and value of scientific grammar. 
The tendency of recent educational thinking has 
been toward the strengthening of grammar as a school 
study as well as toward important modifications in 
the way the subject is to be treated. Within a few 
years an unparalleled number of grammar text-books

a course of scientific grammar), have been published,— 
of differing degrees of excellence, yet all of them 
showing improvements upon the grammars of the 
older type. Historical grammar and comparative 
grammar are throwing light on idiomatic English con- 
structions, and students and teachers are recognizing

a qu whether grammar shall be studied. The 
questions now are those of detail; when shall it be 
studied, and how, and what ends are to be held in view 
in the study of grammar? A truer recognition of the 
educational value and also of the limitations of gram- 
mar has been gained. “Language lessons” have 
come into the schools to stay, and their value is unchal- 
lenged. Yet grammar will not again be displaced in 
the school curriculum. It holds a central position 
in formal language study, and with all its limitations 
it is able in its own way to give elements of linguistic 
training that can be arrived at by no other means.

  Grammar and Logic 21 
In the reactions against grammar during the last 
century it was sometimes said that the analytical 
study of sentences, except to a very limited degree, 
is not really grammar at all. Grammar relates to the 
inflectional forms of words and the agreement of these 
forms. But these 
inflectional forms, thus becoming “a logical rather 
es ata Hence the analysis 
of sentences and most of what is known as 
parsing, was said to be an exercise in logic rather than 
in true grammar. 
This is a question of terms and their definition. 
Modern linguists and logicians would by no means 
restrict the term grammar so as to exclude the study 
of word relations, even when these are not definitely 
pointed out by inflections and agreements. Much of 
English grammar is really included in the domain of 
logic: From the modern point of view grammar 
includes all the analytical study that is needed to make 
plai , including 
its logical relationships as well as the grammatical 
forms of words and the government and agreements 
of these forms. 
Thought controls the forms of language, and neither 
the thought nor the sentence can be really studied 
except in connection with each other. The grammati- 
cal forms that are still retained in English cannot be 
understood except through a knowledge of the logical 
relationships of the sentence. And on the other hand 
these grammatical forms, even though few in number, 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
22 Grammar and Its Reasons 
  are material aids in gaining a knowledge of the logical 
relationships. Yet the logical relations cannot be 
fully understood if studied simply in connection with 
these small remainders of grammatical forms. It 
needs a far larger analytic study of sentences to enable 
the student to deal intelligently with the abbreviated 
grammatical facts that still belong to the English 
tongue. f system 
of logic mi grammar.” 
It is also true that a system of grammar finds its neces- 
sary foundation in logic and cannot be studied without 
entering somewhat freely into that domain. 
But while the field of thought is in a measure com- 
mon, the manner of approach to the given facts is 
different. In the study of logic, as well as in the act 
of expression itself, the form is approached from the 
thought side. But in the analysis of sentences the 
order is reversed and the thought is approached from 
the form side. Grammar looks first at the sentencé 
and passes from that to the elements of the thought 
expressed by it. Logic takes first the thought and 
then decides how the sentence structure is made to fit 
this thought. 
A conspicuous illustration of the difference between 
grammar and logic in dealing with the same set of 
objective facts, comes at the very beginning of the study 
of grammar, in the two natural views that may be 
taken of the sentence,—that is, the two-part and 
three-part theories of sentence construction. Both 
ways of looking at the sentence heed to come before
-P-A-G-E-39
  Grammar and Logic 23 
the mind, and to be reconciled if the student of either 
grammar or logic is not to be thrown into mental 
confusion. 
But while the study of logical relationship and 
grammatical form must proceed side by side, each 
illustrating and aiding the other, great care should be 
taken never to confound the two points of view. In 
the treatment of Case, for instance, a grammatical 
writer must never permit a confusion to arise in his 
own thought or in that of his readers, as to whether 
the inflectional form or the logical relationship of the 
substantive is the point on which the mind is to be 
centered. So closely are the relations of thought 
and of its expression intermingled that it is a matter 
of no small difficulty, sometimes, to avoid confounding 
the one with the other. That they have often been 
confounded is the cause of many of the disputes that 
have arisen among grammarians. But although the 
logician and the grammarian have different ends in 
view, there are many facts which they must deal with 
in common, and so far as the structure of language is 
concerned they must not antagonize each other. 
More than a hundred years ago the celebrated Horne 
Tooke made the first serious and avowed effort “to 
introduce logic into grammar.” He was an able and 
ingenious writer, but linguistic thought has made 
large advance since his period, and there is little of 
value for the present age in the curious Diversions 
of Purley, which he wrote. Other writers have 
attempted (though in different literary form) to
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 Grammar and Its Reasons 
straighten out the relations of logic and grammar, 
which still remain somewhat perplexing and difficult 
to handle consistently. 
The best result of the study of grammar, however, 
is a logical habit of mind. The effort to analyze a 
a difficult passage leads to a fuller appreciation of its 
meaning, and this in turn cultivates accuracy both in 
one’s own thought and in its final expression. Nor 
does the advantage end here. Through the keen 
perception of clearness of construction thus gained, 
the student not only gains a mastery over his native 
language, but he finds in it also a firm basis for the 
right understanding and rapid acquirement of foreign 
tongues. ?

UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR GRAMMAR 
English grammar is but a branch of the general science 
of philology, a new variety or species sprung up from the 
old stock long ago transplanted from the soil of Greece and 
Rome.—Goo.tp Brown. 
Philology in its larger sense includes all that is or can be 
meant by Grammar.—E are. 
Whatever harmony is possible between English grammar 
and the grammar of other languages should be sought if 
the value of grammatical study is believed to lie in any 
degree in making easier for the student the approach to 
other languages.—DavenporT AND EMERSON. 
The grammar of a given language may in theory be 
divided into two parts, one treating of general gram- 
mar, or the universal principles that belong to the 
grammars of all languages, the other dealing only with 
the particular grammar of the individual language. 
But while the idea is a suggestive one, the plan has 
never yet been carried out in a manner that seems 
entirely satisfactory for class use. 
The original idea of grammar was that of a universal 
science in which different languages shared in varying 
degrees. We have seen that the earliest grammars 
issued in England were books of general grammar, 
written however in Latin and applied directly to that 
language as being the one that best exemplified the 
25
-P-A-G-E-42
26 Grammar and Its Reasons 
principles of grammar. It was felt that English had 
little of real grammar and that all that it contains 
could easily be learned by the study of general grammar 
through the medium of Latin. Something of the same 
idea is still prevalent in schools and colleges to-day. 
And there is some justification for this thought. 
Every one must agree that a knowledge of Latin gram- 
mar throws great illumination upon the structural 
study of English. Yet there are not many modern 
educators who would admit, either that a knowledge 
of general grammar is sufficient for one’s understand- 
ing of English, or that an adequate knowledge of 
English grammar can be gained through the medium 
of Latin. It is only by the study of English itself that 
a true knowledge of English can be acquired. 
A certain amount of distinction between the universal 
and the particular, however, is advisable in a course 
in grammar. The idea of case, for instance, belongs 
to general grammar. A student gains this idea most 
fully if it can be illustrated by examples taken from 
several different languages. But to know the specific 
cases belonging to a given language, to be familiar 
with all the words ,having case properties, to under- 
stand all the sentence relations which these cases can 
~ hold, and to form the habit of using them correctly in 
all these relations, constitutes a much larger bulk of 
grammatical acquirement than the mere knowledge 
of the primary case idea. So many are the details 
of specific grammar that cluster around each universal 
idea, that even in English, which of all modern lan-
-P-A-G-E-43
Universal and Particular Grammar Q7 
guages is most free from grammatical fetters, it is still 
true that “universal grammar constitutes but a very 
small part of the particular grammar of a language.” 
A knowledge of English grammar, then, implies 
some knowledge of the principles of universal gram- 
mar, the recognition of the ways in which these prin- 
ciples are applied in making the forms of English, 
and also a recognition of all the departures from 
general grammar that have gained an authorized place 
in either spoken or written English. This knowledge 
is to be acquired chiefly by the student’s own examina- 
tion of the current language and literature of the period 
in which he lives. Yet historical and comparative 
methods of grammar study are also needed to secure 
that knowledge of general grammar which is implied 
in a true knowledge of English grammar.

OBJECT AND METHOD OF GRAMMAR 
The duty of the grammarian is not to invent or create 
but to state and classify the facts as he finds them.— 
Ramsey. 
The laws and principles which underlie. the construction 
of sentences are all embodied-in sentences, and the student 
may study them directly, first-hand, just as he studies the 
flower in botany, or the rock in geology; and if he forgets 
the rule he has only to examine a few sentences and restate 
it for himself.—Wisrty’s Sruprzs IN THE ScrENCE oF ENG- 
LisH GRAMMAR.” 
Whereas we learn a foreign language through and by 
means of its grammar we must learn and discover English 
grammar through and by means of the language.—Fircu. . 
Elementary oral correctness and an elementary sentence 
sense should be the first objects of grammar study.—Lerwis. 
The aim has been to present in compact and orderly sys- 
tem the cardinal facts of the English language—to feed the 
mind as well as to train it, and thus give to the study of 
English no inconsiderable place in geheral culture.—Wetsux. 
Grammar is a reflective study of language, for a variety 
of purposes, of which correctness in writing is only one and 
a secondary or subordinate one, by no means unimportant, 
but best attained when sought indirectly —Wurtney. 
In teaching grammar it ought not to be the teacher’s 
object to enable the pupil to speak English but to under- 
stand it.—AsBoTr 
28
-P-A-G-E-45
Object and Method of Grammar 29 
Two widely different views of the object of grammar 
study have prevailed among educators. Some text- 
books affirm definitely, or in substance, that “the 
design of English grammar now is, and always has 
been, to teach the art of speaking and writing the 
English language with propriety,” and that “Gram- 
mars should be guides plain and direct to correct 
writing and speaking.” 
That grammar will give, and ought to. give, prin- 
ciples of criticism whose application will conduce to 
correct writing and speaking, no one will deny. Yet, 
as an offset to this class of grammarians who pride 
themselves on making grammar “an entirely practical 
subject,” there are others who maintain that a still 
higher purpose in grammar is the gaining of reflective 
power, and that mere correctness is a secondary object. 
‘W. D. Whitney once wrote: “Grammar will be 
ready, by-and-by, to do its part in correcting and 
polishing our usages, but only in its own time 
and way. _We may turn it at once into an apparatus 
for discovering and eliminating errors of speech— 
but only at. the risk of sacrificing more legitimate 
objects. {The real aim of grammar is to turn the 
lights of intelligent reflection upon the instrumentality 
of thought, to see what is its structure in word and 
phrase, to look at the familiar facts in their resemblances 
and differences, their connections and relations;—and 
this partly for its own sake, partly for what it leads to.”” 
These opposing views of the aim to be sought in 
the study of grammar, are the cause of the chief differ-
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 Grammar and Its Reasons 
ences in the methods used. Grammar pursued for 
the second and higher end is necessarily an analytical 
subject. The analytic method . will develop some 
principles that will conduce indirectly to the “art of 
' speaking and writing cornectly”’; yet it is now univer- 
sally conceded that power in the use of language is 
gained more directly by constructive methods than by 
the analysis of language forms. Through practice 
in using language under wise direction the child 
comes to an understanding of what correct English 
is, and gains the habit of using it. The later analytical 
study will indeed give him more sure and final tests 
which he can apply to his language and so confirm 
the good habits which he has acquired. Yet most of 
his knowledge of the requirements of English comes 
to the child at an earlier age, and in other ways than 
through the study of formal grammar. 
Nor are the final tests of correctness best gained by 
making them the direct end and aim of the grammatical 
study. The power of discriminating criticism is 
subtle and far-reaching, and demands an intimate 
knowledge of all the language facts. In other words, 
the so-called “practical aim of grammar,” that is, the 
discovering and eliminating of errors in speech, can 
never be fully attained except through the pursuit of 
its higher end,—namely, the gaining of reflective power. 
The facts of language with which grammar deals 
should. be acquired by the same inductive methods 
that are used in all modern scientific study. The 
‘student of English is an explorer in language fields,
-P-A-G-E-47
  Object and Method of Grammar 31 
searching out language facts by his own investigations, 
and forming his own conclusions. 
Dogmatism is one of the most serious as well as 
most frequent faults in grammatical treatises. As 
has been well said, “The grammarian is not to take 
the position of one who lays down the law of the lan- 
guage, saying, ‘ You should say this or that, or you vio- 
late a rule of grammar,’ but rather “You see that we (you 
and I and “all who speak good English) say thus and so.” 
Therefore we hold this as a principle of our language.”’** 
There is a peculiarity in grammar as a study that 
needs to be taken full account of in the method pur- 
sued. The native student comes to the study having 
already a good command of the facts with which he 
is to deal. He knows the forms of words and phrases 
and can in general tell bad English from good. If his 
environment has been so unfortunate that he has not 
the power of doing this, the analytical parts of his 
language work should not be omitted. They should 
be fully supplemented, however, by a large amount of 
constructive work as well. Yet it is the student that 
can already “speak and write correctly’’ who is in the 
best position to get the highest benefits of a course in 
grammar. For such a student the chief object to be 
gained is a clearer and more exact sense of the relations 
of thought. Out of a good grammatical drill one who 
is seldom or never guilty of a grammatical solecism 
may gain a fine culture which it is idle to depreciate, 
and which will yield rich results in increasing the 
perfections of thought and its expression.

THE SENTENCE UNIT 
“First the whole, afterward the parts.” 
A sentence must be looked upon as the first creation of 
language.—History or Language, sy Srrone, Locz- 
MAN, AND WHEELER. 
The thought is the unit in thinking, hence the sentence 
is the unit in speech.—BoypmEn. 
The sentence is the structural unit in the use of language. 
A knowledge of its elements and their relation one to another 
must logically precede any detailed study of words and their 
forms.—SouTHworts. 
The larger elements of sentence-structure are the founda- 
tions of grammar, and these must be familiar before the pupil 
is ready for the study of separate words.—BuEHLER, 
Psychologists and logicians in all times and almost with- 
out exception, have insisted that the sentence must have 
three parts corresponding to the three elements of the judg- 
ment.— WISELY. 
One would naturally expect the sentence to correspond 
as to number of parts with the judgment which it expresses; 
but since we commonly find the copula and attribute com- 
bined in one symbol, it is convenient to include these two 
offices under the term predicate, and so to divide the sen- 
tence into two parts only.—Irenn M. Muap, In Ton Enc- 
LisH LANGUAGE AND ITs GRAMMAR. 
The distinction of the noun and the verb as the two essen- 
tial constituents of the true sentence, the one naming some- 
32
-P-A-G-E-49
  The Sentence Unit 33 
thing, the other asserting something about it—this was the 
first distinction successfully made in the historical develop- 
ment of our speech.— WHITNEY. 
The study of the grammar of a foreign language 
begins naturally with the study of words and their 
inflections. So also the older treatises on English 
grammar usually begin with the parts of speech. 
But the newer views of the purpose of the study of 
grammar have changed the point of beginning. The 
very name ‘‘parts of speech” emphasizes the fact 
that there is a whole of speech that is larger than the 
classes of words to be studied. 
Speech is made up of sentences, and words con- 
sidered in their relation to sentences, are “parts of 
speech.”’ The essential facts of the sentence as a 
whole and of the parts of speech which compose the 
sentence, these are the fundamental elements of 
grammar. The best modern grammarians are united 
in the view that some knowledge of the general plan 
of the sentence must precede any attempt to deal with 
words on a grammatical basis. 
The sentence is the expression of a thought and is 
therefore the unit of connected speech. It has two 
parts, a subject and a predicate. The subject is the 
part of a sentence which represents the person or + 
thing of which something is said. The predicate is 
the part which expresses what is said of this person or 
thing. The subject therefore is naturally the name 
of a person or thing, or will contain a name with 
other modifying words. The predicate must contain
-P-A-G-E-50
34 Grammar and Its Reasons 
a word which has the power of asserting or stating 
something. The verb, therefore, is an_ essential 
element of every sentence. The introduction of the 
ideas Sentence, Subject and Predicate, Noun and 
Verb at the beginning of grammatical study is now 
considered needful by the best grammarians. 
In logic a sentence is also called a proposition, and 
the thought expressed by a sentence or proposition 
is shown to be the comparison of two ideas, whose 
agreement or non-agreement is expressed by a connect- 
ing term called the copula, as 
The apple——is——red. 
The apple——is not——red. 
A sentence, therefore, has logically three inherent 
elements, the subject, copula, and predicate term or 
attribute. There is much difference of opinion among 
scholars whether the recognition of two parts in the 
predicate—i. e., the copula and attribute,—is needful 
in grammar. These ideas are much harder to grasp 
than those of subject and predicate. Students of 
logic have usually contended that the copula and 
predicate term must be recognized in every sentence. 
Other students, looking wholly from the grammatical 
side, and seeing how few are the cases in which the 
copula is really distinct from the idea to be predi- 
cated, have declared the distinction to be not only 
needless but false, and have spoken slightingly of the 
“pretended copula of the sentence.” Thus John 
Stuart Mill tells us that “It is of the utmost importance
-P-A-G-E-51
  The Sentence Unit 35 
that there should be no under-estimation in our con- 
ception of the nature and office of the copula”; while 
other writers have declared with equal vehemence 
that the theory of two parts in every predicate is irra- 
tional and untenable. 
Logic and grammar cannot really be antagonistic 
in their views of the nature of the sentence. Yet for 
the grammatical understanding of most sentences the 
attempt to separate copula from attribute is not essen- 
tial, and for young students it may even be objection- 
able. There are some sentences, however, such as 
“God is good,” “Washington was made President,” 
which cannot be grammatically studied without recog- 
nizing the distinct offices of the two parts of the predi- 
cate. Unless the true view of this class of sentences 
is gained early in the course in grammar, many predi- 
cate constructions will fail to be understood. It is 
perhaps only the predicates containing copulative 
verbs which the ordinary grammar student needs to 
consider as composed of copula and attribute. Yet 
with advanced students the thought should be carried 
farther. : 
The logical idea that in every predicate, whatever 
the form, there is always an idea to be predicated, and 
an assertive element which may or may not be distinct 
from the former, is certainly an illuminative one and 
will aid in the interpretation of many otherwise diffi- 
cult predicate constructions. 
Although the general plan of the sentence requires 
early attention in grammar, the complete study of

sentences, including the clauses and phrases which 
compose them, cannot be fully undertaken until a 
knowledge of the parts of speech throws light upon 
the sentence relations of these larger component 
elements.

PARTS OF SPEECH 
“The chief result of grammar ....- is the doctrine of, 
the parts of speech.” 
: The mind proceeds from the whole to its parts and their 
relations. This is the logical order; that is, the order ac- 
cording to the laws of thought. This gives scientific knowl- 
edge.—BoyprEn. 
We need not inquire what a word is, but we must ask 
what it does.—MEIKLEJOHN. 
The defining of parts of speech is a serious office.. The 
whole future of grammar rests upon the classifying of words 
according to their function in the sentence.—Bain. 
To be a noun or verb or adjective is a function which a 
word discharges in such and such a context, and not a char- 
acter innate in the word and inseparable from it.—Ear.z. 
A firm and consistent application of the principle that 
the part of speech is determined by use and not by form, 
will do more than any other one thing to simplify English 
grammar.—Harper AND BurGEss. 
The classifying of words as parts of speech is largely arti- 
ficial. —CaRPENTER. 
The fundamental parts of speech are four in number 
—substantives, predicatives, modifiers, and connectives.— 
DavENPORT AND EMERSON. 
Parts of speech sometimes shade off into one another so 
subtly that we can no more distinguish them than we can 
distinguish the colors of the rainbow.—Snoppy. 
37
-P-A-G-E-54
    38 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Not to this day has it been settled what sort of a difference 
in words shall entitle them to a separate rank as parts of 
speech.—Hornre Tooxe, 
The number and character of these recognized 
classes of words have varied at different eras. The 
earliest Greek grammarians named a few parts of 
speech which attracted emphatic attention, and others 
were added later. At last Dionysius carried “eight 
parts of speech”’ from Alexandria to Rome, and from 
that day to this the mystic number eight has been 
perpetuated. 
Yet the claimants to a place in the list have varied. 
The participle, included by Dionysius, was afterwards 
added to the verb. The Greeks, wiser than we, 
omitted the interjection, which indeed is not a part 
of speech, but a “whole speech,” though vague and 
undeveloped. The infinitive has sometimes been 
called a part of speech. Pronouns have sometimes been 
classed with nouns; and again the personal pronouns 
have been treated as a part of speech distinct from 
adjective pronouns, which were classed with adjectives 
or articles. Lily’s grammar (known as the grammar 
of King Henry the Eighth) included the adjectives 
with ‘the noun, declaring “In speech be there eight 
parts following: noun, pronoun, verb, participle, 
declined; adverb, conjunction, preposition, inter- 
jection, undeclined.” This was also the platform of 
some of the old Latin grammarians, though others 
maintained that the adjective ought not to be called 
a noun. Numerals have sometimes been considered
-P-A-G-E-55
  Parts of Speech 39 
one part of speech. The articles have often been so 
treated. Murray’s old grammar does this, thus 
giving to English nine parts of speech, or one more 
than belong to Latin, which has no article. 
Not a few of the ancient grammarians divided words 
into three classes, which, according to Vossius, were 
nouns, verbs, and particles. This view also found 
advocates among the early English grammarians, 
who seem to have supposed that grammar would be 
rendered easier by reducing the number of the parts 
of speech. Murray’s reply to this view, however, was 
as follows: “Every word in the language must be 
included in some class and nothing is gained by making 
the classes larger and less numerous. In all the 
artificial arrangements of science, distinctions are to 
be made according to the differences in things, and the 
simple question here is what differences among words 
shall be at first regarded. To overlook in our primary 
division the difference between a verb and a participle 
is merely to reserve for a sub-division or subsequent 
explanation a species of words which most gram- 
marians have recognized as a distinct sort.” Recent 
grammarians have pointed out that whatever be the 
number of classes recognized, they are reducible to 
four main types, substantives, verbs, modifiers, and 
connectives. 
The diversity which has prevailed is shown by a 
curious dialogue in the Diversions of Purley, by 
John Horne Tooke. One of the characters is made 
to say, “You have not informed me how many parts 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    40 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of speech you intend to lay down.” The reply is, 
“That shall be as you please, either two to twenty 
or more.” In Noah Webster’s grammar of 1790, he 
says that eight is the best number of parts of speech 
that can be found. Yet in another of his grammars, 
he reduces the number to six, following the example of 
Lowth and others, who class adverbs, prepositions, 
and conjunctions together under the common name 
of abbreviations or particles. Horne Tooke tells us, 
however, that “Particles is a convenient name for all 
the little words that we do not exactly understand.” 
The number and names of the parts of speech have 
at last crystallized into the eight that our grammars 
generally recognize, and perhaps this list is as con- 
venient as can be made; though-several of the most 
distinctive sub-classes, such as participles, infinitives, 
articles, and the different classes of pronouns, need to 
be taught early in the grammar course and with nearly 
as much distinctness as the fundamental eight classes. 
When all these are clearly known, and the student 
is able to assign each word of a sentence to its proper 
part of speech, the stronghold of grammar as a science 
may be said to have been conquered. In thus assign- 
ing words to their parts of speech it will be noticed 
that the nouns and verbs of a language are practically 
numberless; adjectives and adverbs of quality are 
also numerous, and their number is often increased 
by new word formations; but articles, pronouns of 
various classes, auxiliary verbs, modal adverbs, prepo- 
sitions, and conjunctions are limited classes, seldom
-P-A-G-E-57
  Parts of Speech 41 
added to but constantly repeated as the connective 
. and filling-in material of all sentences. 
The basis of the classification of parts of speech is 
the function which the word performs in the structure 
of the sentence. For this reason there can be no 
logical definition of any part of speech, except by 
giving its function. The old definition of a verb 
as “a word which means to be, to do, or to suffer,” 
ignored wholly this functional element. In teaching 
that “a noun is a name,” the student should not omit 
to notice the fact that this gives to the noun the gram- 
matical quality which admits of its being the subject 
term of a sentence. 
But the quality of belonging to a part of speech in 
English is a very variable one. It is more a habit of 
the word than a fixed and innate quality. In a highly 
inflected language like Latin, the word is ticketed, as 
it were, by its form as belonging to a given part of 
speech. In the newly invented language Esperanto, 
the part of speech is shown by the termination of the 
word. But in English it is the sense of the sentence 
that must decide, and there are only a comparatively 
small number of words that belong always to the same 
part of speech. The pronouns are the most habit- 
bound among our words, but with some of these 
there is variation. 
For these reasons it is even more true in English 
than in some other languages that the sentence and not 
the word must be regarded as the primary unit of 
form as well as of thought. This fact receives added

emphasis from the name which has been given to these 
gtammatical groups of words. Standing alone a 
word is incomplete and its meaning is uncertain. It 
is only by the right connection of the “parts”? that 
we can get the whole, which we call “speech.”

  Ix 
THE VERBAL ELEMENT OF THE 
SENTENCE 
The apparently simple question ‘‘What is a verb?” has 
been from of old the subject of the most ferocious contro- 
versies—Horne Tooxe. 
The verbal notion as such is nothing but a €opula— 
TRANSLATED FROM GRAMMATIK VON ConraD HurMann. 
Every verb admits of being taken apart or analyzed into 
some form of the copula be, which expresses the act of asser- 
tion, and a predicate noun or adjective (especially the verbal 
adjective, the present participle) expressing the condition 
or quality or action predicated.— WHITNEY. 
The definition of the verb (as the word which asserts) does 
not provide for interrogative or imperative sentences. In- 
deed it is probably impossible to define the verb briefly 
and clearly, so as to include such sentences. The interro- 
gative and imperative forms, however, may be so easily 
changed into declarative that this definition will not be 
found seriously inadequate.-—Harrrr AND BurcEss. 
The verb makes the speaker responsible. If we say ‘‘The 
boy” we utter merely a name. But the minute we add a 
verb to the name, as, “The boy lies,” we are held responsible 
for a statement.—Lewis. 
We cannot assert or deny without a finite verb.—Barn, 
It is a quaint saying of that quaint, and yet wise, people, 
the Chinese, that verbs alone are living words.—M. ScHEeLe 
px VERE. 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  44 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The distinction shown to the verb in giving it a 
name that means the word of the sentence, seems to 
require that its definition should make plain its super- 
iority as a sentence element. Yet the statement of 
many grammars that the verb is “a word which ex- 
presses being, action, or state,” misses the essential 
fact. In some of the older grammars we read that 
“the verb is a word that signifies to do, to be, or to 
suffer,” and that “it may be distinguished by its 
making sense with one of the personal pronouns or 
the word fo before it.” Such statements are inade- 
quate as definitions of the verb. 
Among ancient grammarians the tense variations 
attracted attention as one of the most distinguishing 
features. So Aristotle defined a verb as a word that 
can express time. For a similar reason the common 
German word for verb is Zett-wort, or “time-word.” 
Some grammarians have thought the power to denote 
action the most conspicuous feature and have given 
names expressive of the idea of “deed-word.” A 
truer thought than any of these, however, is expressed 
by Madvig, the German author of a celebrated Latin 
grammar, who designates the verb by a word meaning 
“outsayings-word,” because it “outsays, asserts, or 
delivers the judgment of the mind.” 
The force of this definition is best shown by the 
logical rather than the grammatical view of the sentence. 
This is, that the.ideas expressed by the subject and 
predicate terms in every sentence are brought into 
comparison and the mind asserts or denies the agree- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61

   ment of these ideas. The word which expresses this 
mental decision is the copula, or true verb. It is the 
assertive element in every sentence and the presence 
of this assertive power in any word is the only thing 
that gives it a true verbal character. In any simple 
sentence there is only one word in which this assertive 
power is lodged. A verb may be logically defined, 
therefore, as the word which is the copula, or which 
contains the copula of the judgment. 
When the verb be is used to express an unchangeable 
ora general truth, it is a pure copula. In the sentences, 
“God is good,” “A triangle is a plane figure,” we 
find the copula stripped of all extraneous ideas and 
standing alone as the verb of the sentence. 
Yet the verbal element is seldom found thus in its 
naked simplicity. The idea to be predicated has many 
ways in which it can unite itself with the copulative 
element. There are also many accessory ideas of 
mood, tense, etc., to be conveyed, so that the verbal 
element is frequently almost lost sight of in the host of 
related ideas with which it is attended. In the sen- 
tence, “He sings,” the verb contains not only the 
ssertive element, but it expresses the action to be 
redicated as well, with the accessory ideas of time, 
nd the person and number of the subject. 
But although the student of advanced grammar 
should recognize the essentially copulative character 
f the verbal office, the idea that the verb is an “assert- 
ing”’ or “stating’’ word will be sufficient for elementary 
lasses. Even the youngest students can recognize the

46 Grammar and Its Reasons 
| word in the. predicate whose omission would remove 
all power of assertion from the sentence. 
The objection has been raised that to define a verb 
as “a word which asserts or states something about 
a person or thing,” is not logical, since in the inter- 
rogatory or imperative sentence no assertion is made. 
As a substitute for the assertive idea, some grammarians 
have proposed the definition, “A verb is a word which 
when placed with a subject can form a sentence.” 
But this transfers the difficulty of definition to the word 
sentence. It also excludes the copula is and all cop- 
ulative and transitive verbs, which cannot form a 
sentence without the aid of an attribute or object fol- 
lowing.” The seeming impossibility of defining the 
“verb,” without falling back on the logical rather 
than the grammatical view of the sentence, is an illus- 
tration of the difficulties that are often encountered in 
forming accurate, and at the same time simple, defini- 
tions of grammatical terms. 
In the verb-phrases which constitute the great major- 
ity of our English verbal forms, it is the first word alone 
which has a true verbal character. All the other 
words are participles and infinitives, which although 
derived from verbs are grammatically of a different 
nature. In the sentence “The house might have been 
burned,” the assertive element is wholly within the 
word might. The predicate idea, however, is distrib- 
uted throughout the verb-phrase, though | centered 
principally in the participle burned. 
The logical relations of the words of the predicate

are often difficult to deal with. Yet these difficulties 
are greatly reduced if the true character of the verb 
is clearly understood.

VERB COMPLEMENTS 
The thought imposes its form upon the sentence.—W1sELY 
Complements which must be added to make the predicate 
complete are to be carefully distinguished from words that 
may be added to make the meaning more precise.—BUEHLER. 
Now, my dear James, if I have succeeded in making clear 
to you the principle out of which the use of these words . . 
. . has arisen, Ihave accomplished a good deal.—Cosserr’s 
GraMMAR (1818). 
The three fundamental types of predicate construc- 
tion may be illustrated as follows: 
1. Dogs bark. 
2. The child seems happy. 
3. John has cut his finger. 
In the first all the essential elements of the predicate 
are in the verb itself. Other words may be added but 
they are simply modifiers and not necessary to the sen- 
tence construction. 
In the second and third sentences the verbs cannot 
be used as predicates without the completing word or| 
“complement”’; such verbs are sometimes loosely 
classed together as “verbs of incomplete predication.”| 
But the two types differ essentially both in the characte 
of the verb itself and in the nature and relations of th 
complement. 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
Verb Complements 49 
In the second sentence the verb “seems,’’ though 
not without some attributive idea, is chiefly a connec- 
tive or copula for the outside attribute “happy.”? Such 
a verb is called a “copulative verb,” and the verbs which 
are most frequently used in copulative relations are be, 
become, seem, appear, taste, smell, look, feel, and a 
few others. There are also a large number of passive 
verb phrases which (although they contain in them- 
selves a kind of copula and attribute) are yet used as 
copulas for an outside term which is the real attribute 
of the sentence. Such are “is made,’’ “is chosen,” 
is thought,” etc., as, “ Washington was elected Presi- 
dent of the United States.” 
Attribute complements are of many kinds. Nouns, 
pronouns, adjectives, participles, infinitive phrases, 
and clauses, may all be used in this relation, as follows: 
He is a man. 
This is he. 
She seems happy. 
He was greatly admired. 
This is to be deplored. 
The fact is that it is impossible. 
The attribute complement is always subjective in 
character. If it is a noun or pronoun it means the 
same thing as the subject. If it is an adjective, it ex- 
presses a quality or attribute. of this thing. 
In the first and third types of predicate, the verbs 
bark and has cut alike contain the copula and the chief 
part of the idea to be predicated. But bark is a com- 
plete verb. Has cut differs from bark in being also  
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 Grammar and Its Reasons 
transitive; that is, it expresses an action which is car- 
tied over from the doer to a passive recipient that must 
also be named in order that the meaning shall be com- 
plete. 
Some grammarians distinguish between a “trve 
intransitive verb,’’ by which they mean one that never 
takes an object, and a “transitive verb used absolutely ;” 
that is, one usually transitive but used in a given case 
without an object. But grammatical classification is 
according to the function of a word in the sentenec 
where it occurs. The omission of the object changes 
slightly the character of the verb itself, making it more 
general in meaning. It seems most logical to follow 
the classification made by those grammarians who 
would call all the verbs intransitive in such a sentence 
as “ The man eats, laughs, and sleeps.” A verb usually 
intransitive may also be made transitive with an object 
of kindred signification called the “cognate object,” 
as “He laughed a loud laugh.” 
The complement of a transitive verb is always ob- 
jective in character. After a reflexive verb, as “I hurt 
myself,”’ it means the same thing as the subject, but this 
is still thought of as outside and objective. The object 
complement ranks higher than the adverbial modifier 
since it is necessary to the predicate construction. 
All verb complements belong to the basic part of the 
sentence. The subject, verb, and complement are all 
needed to make the sentence structure complete. 
Object complements as well as attributes, vary greatly, 
and the different types of objects will be considered later.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
Verb Complements 51 
Both object and attribute complements offer many 
stumbling blocks to beginners in grammar. But if the 
three essential types of predicate construction are thor- 
oughly mastered early in the course, many of the diffi- 
culties of grammatical analysis will already have been 
conquered.

XI 
THE OBJECTIVE CONSTRUCTIONS 
Many verbs take two substantives; the proper object, or 
the accusative, and an object of reference to which the action 
is directed, or the dative-—TransLaTED FROM Mapvie’s 
Latin Grammar. 
The dative denotes in general the person or thing more 
remotely connected with an action.—TRANSLATED FROM 
Curtius’s Greek GRAMMAR. 
There is hardly anything more interesting than to see how 
the laws of grammar, which seem at first sight so hard and 
arbitrary, are simply the laws of the expression of logical 
relations in concrete form.—EvzEreErt. 
The word object in grammar has many varieties of 
technical meaning. 
The noun or pronoun that completes the meaning of 
a transitive verb by naming the receiver of the action 
is the object of the verb. Participles and infinitives 
share with verbs the power to take objects. Objects 
are the most important verb modifiers. They belong 
to the basic part of the predicate. 
The term object also is applied to a noun or pronoun 
connected by a preposition as a subordinate to some 
other word. Objects of verbs and objects of prepositions 
are alike in one respect—they must be in the objective 
(i. e. the accusative) case if the word used has such a 
case. Both of these kinds of objects are easy to recog- 
52
-P-A-G-E-69
       The Objective Constructions 53 
nize. But there are related constructions that are 
more difficult. 
There is the indirect or “dative’’ object, as “I give 
you my hand.” It has many subtle marks which may 
or may not all be present in a given case. 
If the indirect object follows the direct, it requires the 
preposition éo, or for, as “I give my hand to you.” Ina 
few cases the preposition is required even when the in- 
direct object precedes the direct, as “I accepted for 
you the invitation.” ; 
The direct and indirect objects are sometimes spoken 
of as the primary and secondary objects of the verb. 
In, “They sent him a book,” book is directly related 
to the verb, but the relation of him is rather to the 
whole predicate; that is, the sending of the book was to 
him. ; 
The indirect object usually denotes a person, while 
the direct object usually means a thing. The indirect 
object is not always a personal word however, as, 
Give thy thoughts no tongue.—SHAKESPEARE, 
There are also cases inwhich the object denoting the 
person is nearly direct, and the one meaning the thing 
becomes indirect (or nearly adverbial) with the pre- 
position of. ‘Thus, “They told me the circumstances,” 
by a slight change becomes “They told me of the cir- 
cumstances.” If either of the two objects is used 
without the other it is direct, as, “I paid John wages.” 
“T paid John.” “I paid wages.” But in most instances 
the indirect object could not be used without the other. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  54 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The indirect object in Latin and some other languages 
takes the dative case, and this was formerly true in 
English, but in modern English the objective case covers 
both the accusative and dative uses. ‘The verbs ask, 
teach and a few others in Latin give the accusative form 
to the object denoting the person as well as to that de- 
noting the thing. For this reason, Kimball’s grammar 
and a few others call both objects after teach direct in 
English as well as in Latin, saying also that teach has a 
different meaning with the two objects. Yet there is 
little in English to distinguish the two objects after 
teach from the usual construction of direct and indirect 
objects. It is true that in comparing the two sentences, 
“He taught John the lesson,” and “He gave John a 
book”’ we feel that the thought relation of John to the 
verb is closer in the first sentence than in the second. 
Yet in the first sentence John and lesson are not co- 
ordinate objects, nor equal in their relations to taught. 
The object denoting the person after teach has a measure 
of indirectness in English, even though in Latin such a 
word would take the accusative case. 
The truth seems to be that there are many degrees 
of indirectness in the objective relation of anoun. The 
indirect object may be thought of as an intermediate 
construction shading all the way from an object that is 
nearly direct to one which is scarcely different from an 
adverbial phrase, so that it is sometimes difficult to see 
precisely where the line should be drawn on either side. 
An indirect object can follow a passive verb, the noun 
that would be the direct object of the active voice being
-P-A-G-E-71
       
   
                          The Objective Constructions 55 
made the subject, as, “An apple was given me.” In 
the case of a few verbs the indirect object can also be 
made the subject of the passive voice, while the direct 
object remains as a “retained object,” after the verb, 
as “I was given an apple.” This construction is pecu- 
liar to English, and even in English it is not usually 
so good as the regular form of the passive sentence. 
The use of the indirect object as the subject of the 
passive seems to have come into English through the 
medium of such verbs as ask, teach, ete., which in Latin 
and other languages take two accusatives. But the 
usage has extended itself to a few other verbs as well. 
A pronoun is sometimes added to a verb as an in- 
direct expletive object, referring to some person that 
may be supposed to be interested in the action, as, 
     
          
    
    
    
        
        
    
      He kills me six or seven dozen Scots at a breakfast. 
He claps you an iron cap on head.—Carty.z. 
This construction was common in early English. 
There is another important kind of objective con- 
struction that is unfortunately known by many names, 
among which are factitive object, and objective comple- 
ment, predicate or attribute. ‘The factitive object follows 
a direct object and sustains to it an attributive or predi- 
cate relation, so that both parts are necessary to com- 
plete the meaning of the verb. The name double object 
has sometimes been given to the direct object with this 
complementary (or attributive) objective term.7 This 
jactitive object (or objective attribute, predicate, etc.) 
may be a noun or pronoun, an adjective, a participle,
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 Grammar and Its Reasons 
an infinitive, or an infinitive copula followed by an 
adjective or noun. 
Examples: 
They made him captain. 
They thought him wise. 
They saw him running. 
They asked him fo stay. 
They begged him to be merciful. 
In changing a sentence containing an objective ‘at- 
tribute to the passive voice the verb becomes a copula- 
tive phrase, the direct object is made the subject and the 
objective attribute becomes the attribute of the sen- 
tence, as 
He was made captain. 
In such sentences as “They begged him to be merci- 
ful,” him is in a sense (and is often called) the subject 
of the following infinitive, but it is its relation to begged 
rather than to the infinitive that determines its case 
form. 
The sentence “They asked him to stay’ is not very 
different from “They asked him a favor.” The line 
between the construction of direct and indirect object, 
and that of objective attribute is not always very dis- 
tinct. 
The objective attribute may be thought of as filling 
out the meaning of a transitive verb which is not of 
itself able to express fully the action performed on its 
object. Thus, “Ice keeps the water cool”—. e. “Ice 
keeps cool the water.”

SUBJECT AND PREDICATE NOUNS 
Position does by no means necessarily conform to the 
order of thought.—WeE su. 
Welcome from the student the widest range of interpreta- 
tion of the sentence under examination. The syntax may 
often assume several different aspects as the thought is 
capable of being conceived in different shades of meaning. 
—Davenrort AND EMERSON. 
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the 
subject and predicate nouns of a sentence. Such a case 
seldom occurs, however, except in interrogative and 
inverted sentences, or where a rhetorical element pre- 
vails. 
In a purely definitive sentence the predicate noun has 
the relation of a genus to the species named by the 
subject, as “Dogs are intelligent animals.” In many 
other cases the subject represents an individual and the 
predicate term shows the species to which it belongs, 
as “Caesar is a dog.” In all such sentences the predi- 
cate noun has a meaning which is wider in its extent 
than that of the subject, and the two are clearly differ- 
entiated. 
But there are cases where the two terms are equally 
specific or equally generic, and therefore of equal extent 
in their meaning, as “A mirror is a looking-glass.” 
58
-P-A-G-E-75
  Subject and Predicate Nouns 59 
In such cases the presumption would naturally be in 
favor of making the first term the subject. Yet in 
poetical or highly rhetorical sentences there is some- 
times a chance for difference of opinion. 
The general principle to be applied seems to be that 
the subject represents an idea in the speaker’s mind 
that is supposed to be unknown to the hearer or regard- 
ing which some unknown fact is to be communicated. 
In “The wages of sin is death,” is the speaker trying 
to show what constitutes death, or is it the wages of sin 
whose character is to be revealed? If the latter, then 
wages of sin, being the unknown term, is the subject of 
the sentence. 
An interrogative pronoun which introduces a ques- 
tion may stand either as the subject or the predicate 
term. 
Who will be our messenger? 
James will be our messenger. 
Who was Plato? 
Plato was a Greek philosopher. 
The answers to these questions show that who is the 
subject in the first interrogative sentence, but the predi- 
cate term in the second. 
But there are sentences in literature in which either 
term might be construed as subject, though the thought 
would differ slightly in the two cases. In “Alfred 
Austin is the Poet Laureate,” a change in emphasis 
would change the relation of the subject and predicate 
terms.
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 Grammar and Its Reasons 
A similar ambiguity between the subject and the 
object of a verb sometimes occurs. An inversion which 
places the object in advance is sometimes admissible. 
Yet (especially if both words are nouns) it may create 
an uncertainty as to the true relations. In the words 
of Professor Bain, “It is by this construction that we 
can practice oracular ambiguity, as ‘The duke yet 
lives that Henry shall depose.’ ” 
Several years ago the New England Journal of Edu- 
cation published an article by Paul Standish, giving the 
opinions of noted persons as to the subject and object 
in a well-known line of Gray’s Elegy: 
And all the air a solemn stillness holds. 
In presenting the question to his readers, the writer 
says, “Don’t be too positive in your reply. Wiser 
heads than ours differ in their opinion, and always will. 
If you are sure now that it is air that holds the stillness, 
the probability is that in five minutes you will be in- 
clined to believe that it is stillness that holds the air and 
you are liable to get into a frame of mind where you 
have no opinion whatever on the subject.” 
Of seventy-six replies to this question from high 
authorities in the educational and literary world, 
thirty-nine favored stillness, twenty-six favored air, 
and eleven were in doubt. One noted Massachusetts 
judge after expressing a positive opinion, added: 
“P. S.—On further reflection I am on the fence.” 
Such instances as these may well remind the gram- 
marian not to be over positive in his opinion. Both)

interpretations may sometimes be correct. Many a 
writer has written sentences of larger import than he 
himself knew in penning them. In the discussion of the 
subtler questions of syntax, it is not the decision reached 
that is of chief importance. It is the power of thinking 
gained by the effort to compare and discriminate the 
relations of a thought that is of truest educational value.

INFLECTIONS 
The old wealth of forms is now thrown aside as a dis- 
pensable burden.—ScuLEIcHER. 
“The exhibition of the system of English inflection must 
constitute the main part of an English grammar. But we 
are not to import unreal distinctions out of a foreign tongue 
or theoretical distinctions out of a system of logic.” 
How bare—whether too bare is another question—we 
have stripped ourselves.—TRENCH. 
The English, which from the mode of its formation by 
a mixture of different tongues, has been stripped of its 
grammatical inflections more completely than any other 
European language, seems nevertheless, even to a foreigner, 
to be distinguished by energetic eloquence. . . . . . 
Yet it cannot be overlooked that this copiousness of gram- 
matical forms [in Greek] and the fine shades of meaning 
which they express, evince a nicety of observation and a 
faculty of distinguishing which unquestionably prove that 
the race of mankind among whom these arose was character- 
ized by a remarkable correctness and subtlety of thought. 
. ... In the ancient languages the words with their inflec- 
tions, clothed as it were with muscles and sinews, come 
forward like living bodies full of expression and character, 
while in the modern tongues the words seem shrunk up 
into mere skeletons.—Orrrizp Mi.irr’s Literature oF 
GREECE. 
The chief ideas now expressed by English inflection are 
seven: number, person, time, comparison, ownership, the 
62
-P-A-G-E-79
Inflections 63 
subject relation and the object relation. No one word con- 
tains all these ideas.—Lewis. 
The most elaborate system of inflection still leaves some- 
thing unexpressed.—Bain. 
The Anglo-Saxon, which is the basis of the English 
tongue, was a highly inflected language. But the Nor- 
man Conquest, besides bringing into English a large 
vocabulary of new words, inaugurated the long process 
by which the structure of the language itself was radi- 
cally changed. 
It has been said that “A French family settled in 
England and edited the English language.” Perhaps 
the truer statement would be that the Normans found 
it too much trouble to learn the Saxon inflections and 
so ignored them. At any rate most of the old Saxon 
terminations gradually disappeared, and with these 
some of the “governments and agreements” that de- 
pend upon inflection disappeared also. By the end 
of the fourteenth century the process was nearly com- 
pleted, and the invention of printing during the follow- 
ing century established the general fixity of forms that 
has prevailed since that era. 
Inflection is the general name for all grammatical 
changes in the forms of words. These changes are 
produced as a rule by adding various terminations to 
the stem or root; but changes within the words, as 
mouse plural mice, are also called inflections. 
Inflectional phenomena, are of two kinds, living and 
dead. Certain inflections have become fixed for specific 
words, but are no longer used in making new forms  
-P-A-G-E-80
    64 Grammar and its Reasons 
as, who, whose, whom. Others are freely used to 
make forms of new words after a prescribed pattern 
as the plural in s, or past tenses in ed. 
The name Declension has been given to a tabulated 
statement of the inflectional forms of a substantive. 
The word comes from a fanciful device, that seems 
almost childish to modern minds, in which an upright 
line represented the nominative case, and declining lines 
the other cases, as 
NOMINATIVE 
  A summary of the inflectional forms of a verb is called 
its “ conjugation.” There is very little of conjugation 
belonging to modern English verbs. 
The name cf each specific inflection, as person, case, 
mood, etc., has had a somewhat indeterminate value in 
grammatical usage, and has been variously defined as a 
jorm, property, distinction, condition, etc. That there 
is some inherent reason for this lack of unity in defini- 
tion must be acknowledged. Some of the so-called 
inflections seem to extend themselves to cover subtle 
relations where the true inflection is wanting. It need 
not be thought strange that there has been wide divers-
-P-A-G-E-81
    Inflections 65. 
ity among grammarians regarding the treatment of the 
inflections. 
But the sensible way of dealing with the subject is 
that which is adopted by most modern text-books. 
Case, number, mood, etc., are regarded as genuine in- 
flections, that is, as true grammatical changes in the 
forms of words themselves. Only such are named as 
are really to be found in English words. The student 
should be an investigator in this field, searching for all 
the traces of these inflectional forms which he can find. 
Yet, as he discovers certain “agreements”? where the 
form of the governing word is non-committal, the idea 
of a subtle property that goes beyond the formal inflec- 
tion is awakened in his mind. 
A knowledge of Latin, or some other inflected lan- 
guage, though not a substitute for the English study, 
is of great help here. As the student grasps the larger 
knowledge which historical and comparative grammar 
can throw upon these questions, the remnants of the 
English inflections gain a wider interest and are appre-. 
hended with truer value.

  XIV 
GOVERNMENT AND AGREEMENT 
The repetition of the inflection of a head-word in its ad- 
junct-word is called concord, and the words are said to agree 
in whatever grammatical form they have in common.— 
Sweet. 
Rules are the elastic expression of the custom of a language. 
—Independent. 
Rules have been laid down which never had any existence 
outside of the minds of the grammarians and verbal critics. 
—LovunsBury. 
Concord is not a necessity of language; while in the de- 
gree that it prevails in Latin and in Greek, it is a serious in- 
cumbrance.—Bain. 
The verb needs not, and generally does not, agree with 
its nominative case in number and person,—active verbs do 
not govern the objective case or any other,—prepositions do 
not govern the objective case or any other.—RicHarp GRANT 
Wuitr. 
To parse agreement whenever a distinct form of the verb 
marks a particular number (as in are and were) or when- 
ever a distinct form marks a particular person and number 
(as in am, is, and loves) and to say nothing about agreement 
when there is no such distinct form,—is the simple rule that 
we would urge upon teachers.—Touman. 
A verb must not disagree with its subject in number and 
person.—Lerwis. 
In an abridgment of Murray’s grammar that was 
66
-P-A-G-E-83
  Government and Agreement 67 
extensively used in the earlier half of the nineteenth 
century, after the twenty-one rules of syntax, with their 
numerous notes and exceptions, we find a “Synopsis of 
Syntax”’ divided into the two sections of “Concord” 
and “Government.” 
Under “Concord” are given rules showing that 
articles, substantives, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs 
have “agreement”? with other words to which they 
relate. 
Under “Government”’ it is shown that substantives, 
adjectives, pronouns, verbs, participles, prepositions, 
conjunctions, and interjections—all of the parts of 
speech, in fact, except adverbs—may govern other words. 
Doubtless all of these rules have an element of truth 
in them. The first rule under “Concord”’ states that 
“Articles agree with nouns in number,’’ which seems to 
be a large generalization from the fact that a or an 
because of its meaning, belongs always to a singular 
noun. 
Another rule states that “Adjectives and adjective 
pronouns generally agree in number with the substan- 
tives to which they belong”’; which is also a very com- 
prehensive statement, for the fact that this and that 
have plural forms; and that few, several, many, and 
some other adjectives because of their meaning belong 
to plural nouns, while each and every belong to singular 
nouns. But the modern grammarian feels that it 
would be better to state the specific fact in relation to 
these words, than to try to cover these individual points 
by a universal statement.
-P-A-G-E-84
68 Grammar and Its Reasons 
That the English language has something of govern- 
ment and agreement should be made clear. In the 
sentences, “The man laughs,” “’The men laugh,” the 
noun “governs”? the number and person of the verb, 
and conversely the verb “agrees”? with its subject. 
Full recognition of all such facts should be given in 
grammar. 
The facts of government that can be stated as princi- 
ples are these: 
A copula takes the same case after it as before it. 
In the case of a finite verb this will be the nominative; 
in infinitive phrases it is objective. 
Transitive verbs and prepositions “govern’’ the 
objective case. 
An antecedent governs the number, person, and 
gender of the following pronoun, and a subject governs 
its verb in number and person. 
Conversely, the facts of concord are these: 
Verbs agree with subjects in person and number, and 
pronouns agree with their antecedents in number and 
gender. An attribute complement (except in im- 
personal sentences such as “It is they’’) agrees with 
its subject in number, gender, and case. 
But while each of the foregoing statements is some- 
times true, it is only applicable when the word to be 
governed has the requisite properties that make it gov- 
erable, and in modern English these occasions are so 
rare that they are the exception rather than the rule 
of the language. 
The older English had far more of government and
-P-A-G-E-85
  
Government and Agreement 69 
agreement than modern English has. Latin and 
Greek and the modern European languages also have 
more. The relations of words in Latin are shown 
by these agreements, but in English the logical relations 
are discovered by other means than word forms. Ar- 
rangement and emphasis have large, though subtle, 
effects in fixing these word relations. 
We must still recognize “concord” and “govern- 
ment’’ as facts of the English language. But we may 
wisely forbear to use so large a mould for holding our 
grammatical truths as the rules of agreement in the 
older grammars, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
XV 
PERSON 
Person is the foundation of the conception of the pro- 
noun. It can only be attributed to nouns, of which it is no 
proper function. It belongs to verbs only by transfer from 
pronouns, the personal endings of the verbs being all orig- 
inally affixed pronouns.—Joyrnes. 
The want of the so-called verbal inflections for number 
and person can hardly be considered an imperfection in the 
English language; for inflection, though it may reduce the 
number of words, gives us no greater precision, but, on the 
contrary, less force in these respects than may be obtained 
by the use of auxiliary pronouns and other determinatives. 
—Marszi. 
It is no real wealth to a language to have needless and 
superfluous forms.—TRENCcH. 
In an abridgment of Murray’s Grammar in com- 
mon use in the earlier half of the century, the subject 
of grammatical person is briefly treated as follows: “I 
is the first person. Thou is the second person. He, 
she, or it is the third person.” 
This little text-book of a past generation has some 
elaborations which seem to darken counsel by an ex- 
cess of grammatical illumination. But in the sim- 
plicity of its treatment of person, we believe that it 
might point a morai for some modern grammarians 
who wrestle with the disputed question whether per- 
70
-P-A-G-E-87
  Person 71 
son is an “accident,” a “distinction,” a “property,” 
an “inflection,” or a what-not of certain parts of 
speech. 
After all, what is there of person in English besides 
the name of a small class of pronouns, and a few verbal 
forms which agree with these pronouns ? 
We might add that since the third person of the 
verb is also used with noun subjects and with the in- 
declinable pronouns, there is a remote sense in which 
these words also may be accredited with something 
of grammatical person. 
The three persons of the pronoun are not really an 
inflection of a part of speech. They are distinct 
words with which this personal idea is associated. The 
only inflection of person that exists in English is the 
small remnant that is found in verbs. There are two 
forms for the third person singular in the present tense, 
—a modern form ending in s, and an ancient one in th 
or eth. ‘There is also a second person singular used 
with the subject thou in all tenses. Though too archaic 
for common use, this is still the approved form for 
prayer and for poetry, and should be thoroughly 
familiar. 
The verb be has more of person than other verbs; 
yet the number of its personal forms is not large. They 
are very important, however, as they are in constant 
use both as principal verbs and as auxiliaries. 
The syntax of the subject of person is chiefly con- 
tained in the following rule: “A verb and its subject 
must agree in person and in number, when both have 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  12 Grammar and Its Reasons 
the requisite person and number.” The rule is an im- 
portant and rigid one, but its applications are com- 
paratively few, as verbs seldom have “the requisite 
person and number.” 
There is another rule of syntax (or perhaps of polite- 
ness) less important than the other, which assigns the 
following order of precedence to the grammatical per- 
sons in compound phrases :— 
You, and he, and I. 
There is also a principle of agreement in case of a 
compound antecedent, which is illustrated by the 
following sentences :— 
‘You and I will take our books. 
You and he will take your books. 
But the inflection and syntax of grammatical per- 
son is a short subject if we do not weigh it down by 
unnecessary rules and definitions.
-P-A-G-E-89

NUMBER 
To Singular Nouns we always add an (s) 
‘When we the Plural Number wou’d express; 
Or (es) for more delightful easie sound 
Whene’er the Singular to end is found 
In (x) or (z) (ch) (sh) or (s) 
(Ce) (ge) when they their softer sound express. 
—Sir Ricuarp STeeie’s Grammar, 1712, DeprcaTep To 
THE QUEEN. 
As there is a common gender so there ought to have been 
a common or neutral number.—Bain. 
“‘Grammatical phenomena are of two kinds, living and 
dead. The living are still freely used to form new inflected 
and derived words on the pattern of those already existing, 
—as the plural s.” 
English like most other languages has two numbers, 
the singular which expresses one-ness (or else leaves 
the number indefinite, as “The lion is the King of 
beasts’’) and the plural which expresses more-than- 
one-ness. A few languages have also a dual number 
expressing two-ness, and this was true of Old English. 
In languages having a dual number the plural expresses 
more-than-two-ness. Thus in Old English the plural 
we implied at least three persons, “we-two’’ being 
expressed by an ancient dual form “wit.’? A remnant 
of the old English dual number is found in the word 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
    4 Grammar and Its Reasons 
twain and its contracted form éwin, the latter having a 
newly formed plural twins. Another trace of the 
distinction between dual and plural is found in the 
reciprocal pronoun phrases “each other’’ and “one 
another.” 
Number is the most widely extended of all the in- 
flections. It belongs to most nouns, to the personal 
pronouns, to some verbal forms, and to the adjectives 
this and that. This range does not seem very large, 
however, and beyond this we look in vain for the gram- 
matical inflection of number. 
The regular plurals in English now end in s. To 
conform to certain laws of spelling or of euphony the 
termination is often es, as, ladies, taxes. After x, 
sh, ch, s, and other sibilant sounds this must be pro- 
nounced as a separate syllable. 
The so-called irregular plurals are mostly survivals 
of old Saxon regular forms. They are not to be thought 
of as defects but should be explained and classified. 
There are the strong plurals formed by an internal 
change, as teeth, mice. These were formerly more 
numerous than at present. Another form of Saxon 
plural is found in oxen. Some plurals in n that were 
formerly in use may still be heard in some parts of 
England and Scotland, as hosen, shoon. 
A few forms show the results of mixed processes, 
as children, brethren. Thus child had an old plural 
childer, and the present form combines this with the 
plural inflection in n. 
Notwithstanding its larger extent, number seems,
-P-A-G-E-91
     
Number 15 
at first thought, to be the simplest of the inflections. 
Certainly, the main rule for plurals of nouns is easy to 
be understood and can be learned by children at an 
early age. Yet when the specific and exceptional rules 
have also been mastered, the teacher may well feel that 
a large territory has been covered. There are nouns 
ending in y, 0, f, and fe to be considered. There are 
old English plurals, and foreign plurals, nouns with 
two plurals and with no plurals, nouns which are com- 
pound words, and those consisting of a title and a 
name together, all of these requiring special treatment. 
Among the nouns ending in }, it will be noticed that 
those that retain the 7 in the plural are mostly Norman 
French, as chiefs, while those that have ves are Saxon 
in origin, as wives. Beef, however, is an exception. 
Its plural beeves suggests an analogy with the Latin boves. 
News and tidings, now singular, were originally 
treated as plurals. Thus Roger Ascham wrote (1550) 
“There are many news.” Wages, dregs, pains, ashes 
and other words have all been treated in both ways. 
A large class of plurals is made up of the names of pairs, 
as tongs, reins, snuffers, etc. These are sometimes 
called false plurals. It is often well to use the word 
pair with these and give the phrase its true singular 
construction as, “A pair of scissors.” 
Many foreign words introduced into English have 
brought their plurals with them, as phenomena, foci. 
The grammar student should classify these foreign 
plurals according to the principles of the languages from 
which they come.
-P-A-G-E-92
  76 Grammar and Its Reasons 
But it is no part of the purpose of this book to set 
forth specifically the irregularities of English number. 
‘These are included in every text-book in grammar and 
are discussed minutely in the orthographic chapters of 
the dictionaries. The subject is an important one, but 
the forms are to be learned chiefly in the constructive 
lessons of elementary language teaching rather than 
as a part of the science of grammar. 
After the study of number forms, comes the syntax 
of number. Verbs must be kept in proper agreement, 
with special attention given to cases where the subject 
is a collective noun, or is accompanied by a modifier. 
The agreement of the pronoun with its antecedent 
requires careful consideration, especially when the 
possessive forms are used, as “Each of them took his 
books.” 
In some instances the number form of the verb is 
determined by the general sense to be conveyed, rather 
than by the number form of the subject, as “ Bread and 
milk is good food for children.” This is especially true 
when a collective noun is limited by a following phrase, 
as “A large number of the men were disappointed.” 
There are many words and phrases that contain a 
hovering sense of either singular or plural, so that per- 
sonal judgment is sometimes a factor in determining 
the form to be used, as “ Already a train or two (has? 
have?) come in.” But such questions should usually 
be avoided by a change in construction. 
Many passages in literature might be quoted in 
which the number agreement is different from that
-P-A-G-E-93
  Number 77 
which modern English requires, as “How many num- 
bers isin nouns? Two.’’—Shakespeare. 
Shall we say “Twice two are four,” or “is four?” 
Is “Measles are prevalent,” or “is prevalent,” the 
correct form of speech? These and kindred ques- 
tions are often presented to the grammarian, who 
sometimes has to fling himself free from the tendency 
to hair-splitting and belittling discussions, and enter 
larger fields of linguistic thought. 
What is the plural of tatlor’s goose? Is it geese or 
gooses? ‘This is an example of a class of grammatical 
questions that are often asked. The story is told of a 
tailor who avoided the question by writing his order 
for two of these useful implements as follows: 
Wanted—one goose. 
Also—another goose. 
And was he not right? “Good style’’ avoids even the 
appearance of grammatical incongruity. Yet another 
has rightly said, “The plural of tazlor’s goose is goose- 
trons.” 
Number is a grammatical property that must be 
dealt with, and many specific points must be noted. 
Yet the wise student will not linger too long over its 
minute details but pass on to larger investigations of 
more broadening grammatical truths.

GENDER 
English surpasses in the simplicity of gender all other 
languages, and has established its claim to be the most philo- 
sophic among idioms.—M. ScueLz pz VERE. 
Latin has the English gender distinction by sex, and in 
addition to it (but not in conflict with it) the system of gen- 
der by endings. Only those nouns which have no gender 
according to the English Syntax, are divided into masculine, 
feminine, and neuter endings.—Harper anp Burcsss. 
“Young nations, and those having a lively imagination 
impute sex to many lifeless objects. Thus the Algonquin 
tribes, as well as the German nation have many facts of gen- 
der that come from the imaginary world in which the people 
are inclined to dwell. * * * But English is a practical 
business-like language.” 
/ Sex, whether fanciful or real, has no proper connection 
“with gender.—Strone, LogemMan AND WHEELER. 
Gender is no natural distinction in language.—Pxriun’s 
PuILoLoey. 
Nothing hinders us from supposing that grammatical 
gender originally meant something quite different from sex. 
JESPERSEN. 
“In Germany, a gentleman writes a masculine letter of 
feminine love to a neuter young lady, with a feminine pen 
and feminine ink on masculine sheets of neuter paper, and 
encloses it in a masculine envelope with a feminine address 
to his darling, though neuter, Gretchen. He has a masculine 
head, a feminine hand and a neuter heart. A masculine 
78
-P-A-G-E-95
  Gender 79 
father and a feminine mother have neuter children. They 
eat neuter bread, feminine butter and masculine cheese.” 
Those who are born to the English idiom and are blessed 
in the absence of nominal gender in their mother tongue 
cannot help looking at its existence in other languages as 
a useless complication of linguistic machinery.—Srarcx. 
The lack of grammatical gender in English has enriched 
the language with poetical gender. The figure of personifi- 
cation is denied to languages having nominal gender.— 
JoyNes. 
Gender in modern English is a very different gram- 
matical property from that which belongs to most 
inflected languages. The office of gender forms in 
English is to show sex. Yet in general grammar, gender 
is usually a matter of the form of a word and of its 
agreements with other words, and seems only remotely 
connected with the idea of sex. Many scholars believe 
that the gender forms of general grammar were originally 
sex forms, and that they came into use by poetically 
attributing sex-qualities to inanimate objects. This 
is a matter of conjecture, however, rather than of proof. 
Jesperson and some other recent writers on language 
have expressed doubts as to whether this is the true 
origin of grammatical gender. 
If gender in English be considered strictly as an in- 
flection it belongs exclusively to a very small number 
of nouns, such as actor, actress. Even these might per- 
haps be ruled out as being two words having the same 
root, rather than grammatical forms of the same word. 
Somewhere in the English language course, whether 
under the head of grammar or of word formation, the

  80 Grammar and Its Reasons 
student needs to become acquainted with the feminine 
suffixes. The most important of these is ess, used in 
certain titles of nobility for a wife who shares the honors 
of her husband, as baron, baroness; also in a few cases 
it indicates a woman who holds in her own right an 
occupation or character that may belong to either sex, 
as prophetess; heiress. Ine in heroine, a in sultana, 
tria in ewecutria, are also feminine suffixes that have 
come into English from various sources, but are not 
used in new formations. Ess is the only living feminine 
suffix, that is, the only one that can be used to make 
new word forms, and this is very rarely done. 
Most of the sex ideas in nouns are expressed by 
“gender-equivalents’”—a name sometimes given to 
the large class of words that denote sex by the use of 
different words, instead of by a change in termination. 
Such are boy, girl; youth, maiden; cock, hen; uncle, 
aunt; father, mother; and most important of all, the 
singular pronouns of the third person, he, she, and i. 
To these must be added various titles that have sex 
signification, and also the various compound words 
which are made to serve the same end, as he-goat, she- 
goat. The use of the personal pronoun with a noun to 
show gender is peculiar to English; but the awkward- 
ness of the construction has led to its gradual abandon- 
ment. The older writers used it frequently. Such 
combinations as he-friend, she-condition, may be met 
with in the older English writings. Thus Fuller speaks 
of _a she-saint, and she-devils, and Shakspeare writes 
“Be brief, my good she-Mercury.”
-P-A-G-E-97
  Gender 81 
Early English uses many gender-forms. But his- 
torical changes have so modified the language as almost 
to justify the sweeping declaration of Richard Grant 
White: “There is no vestige of gender in English. 
We simply do not call a woman a man, or a bull a cow.” 
Historical grammar shows many interesting facts of 
changes in English gender. In old English masculine, 
feminine, and neuter nouns were marked by different 
endings, and articles and adjectives had agreeing gen- 
der forms. Some of these old gender nouns have come 
down to us, but bearing no longer any gender distinc- 
tions. Nouns in dom as freedom, were originally mas- 
culine. Ung, nes, (now ing and ness) were feminine 
endings, as in greeting, goodness. 
Some diminutives in en as maiden, chicken were 
neuter. But en was also a feminine ending, as found 
to-day in vixen. Ster was another old feminine ending 
that has come down to us in spinster. Many words 
were formed with this suffix, as: 
Mas. Fem. 
seamer seamster 
baker bakester 
brewer brewster. 
In the fourteenth century ess began to replace ster as 
a feminine suffix and ster began to acquire a masculine 
signification, as in huckster, songster, teamster, and 
youngster. New feminines were then formed from 
some of these words, producing such hybrids as _song- 
stress, seamstress. 
By the Elizabethan period ess had become the com-
-P-A-G-E-98
82 Grammar and Its Reasons 
mon feminine suffix. Most of the feminines com- 
pounded with ess have now gone by, one form being 
used for both genders. The grammars of the early 
part of the nineteenth century give many such feminine 
forms—as, teacheress, doctoress, sculptress—that are 
now wholly obsolete. Even during the last generation 
the words authoress, poetess and negress have fallen into 
disuse. Most of the names of classes that are formed 
on mental or moral qualities have no gender distinc- 
tions, as saint, sinner, thief, friend, genius, schemer. In 
very ancient English writings, however, such words as 
saintess, synneress, occur. The modern practice is to 
ignore the feminine form whenever sex is immaterial 
to the character or office itself. On this principle such 
words as authoress, postmistress, executrix seem to be 
unnecessary. A¢ctress is justified, however, by the 
habit of engaging women for women’s parts. One 
important part of the teacher’s work in dealing with 
gender is to show the present usage with regard to such 
words, so that those forms and those only, may be em- 
ployed, which belong to the reputable usage of the mod- 
erm age. 
Although the etymology of gender includes many 
facts about nouns, the syntax of gender belongs almost 
exclusively to the three little pronouns he, she, and tt, 
and their relations to other words. In regard to these 
pronouns, gender, though not an inflection, is an import- 
’ ant “grammatical distinction,” denoting the natural 
distinction of sex which belongs to living objects. Yet 
_ the neuter pronoun is as much “a gender” as the
-P-A-G-E-99
Gender 83 
others, since it also shows a grammatical distinction 
regarding sex. The word “common’’ as applied to 
gender—since there is no common sex—is omitted from 
many modern grammars. Yet it is a convenient term 
to apply occasionally to such words as cousin, friend, 
culprit, etc., which can stand as antecedent to pronouns 
of either gender according to the application of the 
word. An obsolete term, epicene, found in ancient 
grammars, was applied to animal names, which, while 
strictly of one gender, were made to cover both sexes. 
The English language claims the right to apply the 
terms he and she to inanimate objects, and personifica- 
tion is a frequent and forceful rhetorical figure both in 
speech and writing. 
Nouns have a small share in the syntax of gender since 
they require the pronouns to “hark back” to them- 
selves as antecedents for the justification of their 
gender-forms. ‘This is as true of the nouns which are 
not “gender-words”’ as of the others; so in a sense, 
most nouns may be said to be of the neuter gender. 
The syntax of gender, though not large, requires 
careful attention. The rule for the agreement of the 
pronoun with its antecedent is the only important gram- 
matical rule that belongs to gender. But the applica- 
tions of this rule involve some knotty points. One of 
the chief of these is the choice of pronoun when its 
singular antecedent applies equally to the two sexes. 
Usage in this case generally takes the masculine as the 
representative of both. There are cases, however, 
when the feminine is used, as being most representative
-P-A-G-E-100
ee oe hoe ee 
84 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of the class; as “The teacher instructs her children.” 
But there are other cases in which each pronoun seems 
objectionable. For these, common (or vulgar) usage 
often employs the plural pronoun, which is ungram- 
matical, although some writers have contended for it 
as the best that can be done. Others have seriously 
proposed the introduction of a new pronoun to fill this 
“felt want.” But new grammatical words must be a 
“language growth’? and not a cunning invention. 
Some writers try to avoid the difficulty by the use of 
one as a pronoun that may have either gender, but this, 
if often repeated, will easily become tedious. In the 
sentence “John or Ellen has lost his or her pencil,” 
both ambiguity and grammatical inaccuracy have been 
avoided. Yet the awkwardness of the construction is 
certainly a rhetorical if not a grammatical fault. 
The fact remains that English, with all its virtues, 
is not a perfect language. It has its own limitations, 
and when we are brought face to face with them, we 
are constrained to make a circumlocution, thus avoiding 
the point at issue; or else “ among several evils to choose 
the least.”

CASE 
Case is the subject, perhaps not of the greatest difficulty 
in grammar, but of the greatest confusio! /AVENPORT 
AND EMERSON. 
  The Finnish language has fourteen cases, but I do not 
suppose that it can do more or indeed as much with its 
fourteen as the Greek is able to do with its five-—Trmncu. 
Case classification is of necessity in some measure arbi- 
trary, and should be made as the best practicable compromise 
of thought analysis on the one hand and of form analysis on 
the other. In this view it seems best to limit the English 
cases to four.—DavENPorT AND EMERSON. 
The objective case in English does duty both for the ac- 
cusative and the dative of other languages.—Mason.      
  There is no noun in our language which really has an ob- - 
jective case. Still, partly by analogy with the pronouns, 
and partly because many other languages related with Eng- 
lish and even the English itself in earlier times, do distin- 
gutish the object from the subject in nouns as well as in pro- 
nouns, we usually speak of nouns as having an objective 
case.— WHITNEY. 
The objective of nouns is not merely a figment as regards 
the speech of to-day; it is something which the language 
has rejected. It represents the Egypt from which we have 
come out. It is, therefore, not a harmless fiction; it is a 
harmful falsehood.—Totman. 
We should treat English as precisely what it is, not as it 
would be if it were Latin or any other language.—WuitNEY.     
    
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 Grammar and Its Reasons 
There are only seven words in the English language 
which sbow any difference between the nominative 
and the objective case. These are I, we, thou, he, she, 
they, and who. When we remember that two of these 
are plurals of another two; that thou has only a limited 
or archaic use; that he and she may be regarded as 
gender forms of the same pronoun; and still further, 
that the change from I to me, we to us, etc., is not a true 
inflection since it is not made by adding a new suffix 
to a common root—we are forced to acknowledge that 
the inflection of case in English has a very limited 
extension indeed. 
The languages of the world differ greatly in the 
number of their cases. Professor Whitney notes that 
the Scythian tongue had from fifteen to twenty cases. 
The French language, on the other hand, has advanced 
even further than English in the rejection of case forms, 
Even the possessive case of nouns is lacking and the 
preposition de is used instead. 
Old English had six cases: nominative, genitive, 
dative, vocative, accusative, and instrumental (similar 
to the ablative, using by or with.) These were distin- 
guished by case-endings, and the definite article and 
adjective had also a declension of agreeing case forms. 
Case in those days was no trivial matter in English. 
All the relations that belonged to these cases are still 
found in English syntax. But the dative and instru- 
mental cases have lost their case-endings and become 
for the most part prepositional phrases. The vocative 
case is now merely the name of the person addressed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
Case 87 
with perhaps the interjection O prefixed. Even the 
accusative case is not distinct from the nominative, 
except in the seven little pronouns aforesaid. 
Ancient grammarians, however, following the analogy 
of the old English, or perhaps that of the Latin gram- 
mars, contrived to recognize more cases than the in- 
flectional forms gave evidence of. Thus the “greatly 
improved grammar’ of Thomas Coar, published in 
London in 1796, had diagrams like the following. 
Declension of house: 
Sing. Plu. 
Nom. a house. houses. 
Gen. of a house. of houses. 
—Dat. to a house. to houses. 
~Acc. a house. houses, 
-Voe. O house. O houses. 
~ Abl. with a house. with houses. 
Modern grammars have shown great differences in 
their treatment of case. Some avoid a strict definition 
of the term. ‘Thus one grammar says: “Case denotes 
the relation which a noun sustains to other words in the 
sentence, expressed sometimes by its termination, 
and sometimes by its position.” 
The number of cases given in different English text- 
books varies all the way from zero to the original six. 
Even the recognition of the possessive as a case of 
nouns has been thought by some to be unnecessary. 
That nouns-have a “possessive form’? no one would 
deny, but the appropriateness of the word “case” 
for this adjective form of the noun is not universally 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 Grammar and Its Reasons 
conceded. Wallis and some other grammarians dis- 
tinctly call the possessive form of a noun or pronoun an 
adjective. It is certainly easier to teach children the 
meaning and use of the termination ’s, than to teach the 
idea of case, and to justify the term by its application 
to the possessive. 
Many grammarians, following the analogy of English 
pronouns, have fixed upon three cases for nouns, not as 
the necessary fact, but as the most convenient number. 
Thus Goold Brown writes, “It was a subject of dispute 
how many cases a noun shall be supposed to have. 
Public opinion is now clear that it is expedient to assign 
to English nouns three cases and no more.” 
The relations which a noun can hold must be fully 
studied. But this is another subject. These relations 
are many, but since they are not distinguished by dif- 
ferences in form the attempt to define the case idea in 
connection with these noun relations can only lead to 
confusion. The illustrations of case in English must 
be drawn mostly from the pronouns. 
Personal pronouns have, as a rule, three grammatical 
case-forms. These should be fully known, as well as 
the relations which each may hold. This gives a cer- 
tain amount of “syntax of case’’ which, however, 
belongs to the pronouns rather than to English nouns. 
The question whether there can be any “property’” 
of case which does not show itself in the form of the 
word is too subtle to be discussed abstractly with young 
students. In the sentence “ He gave it to the minister,— 
him with the long white hair,” it will be seen that the
-P-A-G-E-105
  Case 89 
case of the appositive pronoun is determined by the 
objective relation of the preceding noun. But such 
usage is rare in English and it can be treated simply as 
a matter of relationship without ascribing an “objective 
case”’ to the noun itself. 
To sum up our conclusions: If the element of visible 
form were wholly lacking we should not speak of “case’’ 
in English. The only cases that the elementary student 
needs to consider are the three case-forms of seven 
little pronouns, and the possessive form which belongs 
to nouns. When the student is sufficiently advanced 
to deal with abstract questions and is familiar with other 
languages in which case has a somewhat different 
bearing, he may perhaps profitably discuss the question 
whether case is (as it has been variously defined) an 
“inflection,” a “property,” a “relation,” or a “con- 
dition;’’ or whether, as one grammarian has laboriously 
informed us, “Case is the medium of distinction used 
to describe by the relation of a name or a substitute 
to other words, the relation of an object or idea to some 
fact or event, or of one object to another,”
-P-A-G-E-106
XIX 
THE POSSESSIVE CASE 
The Possessive Case is really another part of speech. It 
does not represent the noun in its strict use, as the subject 
or object of a sentence. It is purely a qualifying word, and 
makes the nearest approach to the Adjective, although we 
may also view it as having passed through the stage of the 
adverb.—Bain. 
The s interposition seemed likely to derive great assistance 
from the concurrence of the his construction. To the popular 
feeling the two genitives were then identical or nearly so, 
and as people could not take the fuller form as coming from 
the shorter one, they naturally supposed the s to be a short- 
ening of the his.—JESPERSEN. 
The extreme range of the possessive gives rise to ambiguity. 
For many of its remote extensions the preposition of is bet- 
ter.— Bain. 
The “signs of possession’ (not in a demoniacal 
but a grammatical sense) have received some curious 
treatment at the hands of writers on language. 
The most common genitive termination in old 
English was es, which was pronounced as an additional 
syllable and sometimes was written apart from its noun. 
It belonged at first to the singular of some masculine and 
neuter nouns, and was afterwards extended to the 
feminine. Other forms of this termination were as, 
us, ys, ts, and simply s. 
90
-P-A-G-E-107
  The Possessive Case 91 
These genitives in s were not found in the oldest 
English, but made their appearance in the Northern 
dialects first and are due to Scandinavian influence. 
These genitive forms continued down to the fifteenth 
century. As late as 1420 such phrases as “vynes 
rootes,” “strengthes qualitie,” were used. Later came 
the elision of the vowel and the introduction of the apos- 
trophe which marks our modern possessive case; but 
this sign did not come into general use much before 
the end of the seventeenth century. Indeed, Lowth’s 
grammar of 1763 speaks of the use of ’s as “a late 
Refinement, and what I really think a corrupt custom,” 
adding, “The genitive case in my opinion might be 
much more properly formed by adding s, or when the 
Pronunciation requires it es, without an apostrophe.” 
Before the ’s became established as the final form 
of the possessive, some other experiments were also 
tried. As the Anglo-Saxon endings dropped out of 
use a genitive value was sometimes given to a noun 
by simple juxtaposition without any added termination, 
as, Venus beauty. This method is still practically 
employed to avoid sibilants, though in the printed form 
we indicate the possessive character by an apostrophe, 
as “for righteousness’ sake,” “Moses’ law,” “ boys’ 
hats.” Thus the Bible of 1611 had “Mars Hill,” 
while later editions have “ Mars’ Hill.” : 
Another way of indicating possession that came into 
frequent use, was by placing the pronoun his 
after the noun. Thus Shakespeare has “ Mars his guant- 
let.” A similar idiom is found in other languages,
-P-A-G-E-108
92 Grammar and Its Reasons 
though in English the usage may have been strengthened 
by its similarity to the original genitive termination when 
written apart from its noun, as in the line: 
“And preysed Reynard is (his) wysdom.” 
The use of Ais after the noun appeared in early 
printed literature and continued for several hundred 
years. The older English literature abounds in such 
phrases as, “the egle hys nest.” In the eighteenth 
century it was a common practice for the owner of a 
book to write his name upon the fly-leaf thus, “John 
Smith, his book.” A well-known example of this use 
of the pronoun occurred in the English Book of Com- 
mon Prayer, in which the last phrase of the Prayer for 
all Conditions of Men was formerly printed “for Jesus 
Christ his sake.” 
From the time of Ben Jonson to that of Addison, 
the theory prevailed that the ’s (which was also in use) 
was a contraction of his. Ben Jonson did not himself 
favor the theory, but declared in his grammar that the 
idea that ’s was a contraction of his would be “mon- 
strous syntax.” But the idea seems to have taken deep 
root, and has even been repeated in modern text-books. 
Although the Anglo-Saxon genitive in s belonged 
only to singular nouns, modern usage has established ’s 
as the plural possessive termination also, with the 
apostrophe alone when the plural already ends in s. 
A rule at one time crept into the grammars for the 
placing of the apostrophe after the s as a means of dis- 
tinguishing the plural possessive from the singular in 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Possessive Case 93 
nouns whose singular and plural are alike, as “a sheep’s 
tail,” “four sheeps’ tails.” But this is not sustained 
either by modern usage or by historical reason. When 
there is danger of ambiguity it can be avoided by the use 
of a prepositional phrase. 
Since ’s is the modern possessive termination, it is 
well that the exceptions to the rule should be as few 
as possible. Usage is not entirely uniform on the 
question of adding ’s to a singular noun that already 
ends ins. But the general practice and tendency seems 
to be wholly in favor of the regular termination. There 
is usually no difficulty for either the ear or the eye in 
adding ’s to a noun ending in s, though it must usually 
be pronounced as a separate syllable, as James’s hat, 
Thomas’s ball. : 
The possessive sign is seldom added to names other 
than those cf persons. A few special combinations have 
become in a measure stereotyped as “a day’s work,” 
“the sun’s rays,” “life’s end,” ete. Modern journal- 
istic writers are also fond of adding the termination 
to the names of places, as “ New York’s new mayor,” 
“Boston’s grain shipments.” Such expressions are 
concise and vigorous but are generally avoided in prose 
literary writings. 
The possessive sign is sometimes added to a phrase 
instead of to a single noun, as “Longfellow the poet’s 
home.” An ambiguity that may arise from such usage 
is suggested by the old conundrum, “Since Moses was 
the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, he was the daughter of 
Pharaoh’s son, wasn’t he ?”’
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 Grammar and Its Reasons 
In certain English dialects the practice of making a 
whole phrase possessive has been carried very far, as in 
the following attributed to Somersetshire: “'That’s 
the woman-what-was-left-behind’s child.” Occasion- 
ally both a noun and its appositive have received the 
possessive sign, as “We left the card in Mr. Cary’s, 
the secretary’s, hand.” ‘There are also instances in lit- 
erature where an uninflected noun is made an apposi- 
tive to a noun with the possessive termination, as, 
“‘Othello’s pleasure, our noble and valiant general.’ 
In phrases containing the adjective else, usage has 
varied in regard to the possessive sign, as, 
They were more in Pendennis’s way than in anybody’s 
else. THACKERAY. 
I took somebody else’s hat.—Dicxxns. 
On the whole, the weight of usage seems to be in 
favor of “anybody else’s,” though the position in the 
sentence, (whether at the end or not), and euphony, 
seem to have some effect in the decision. In ques- 
tions the preferred form is “whose else?”? Yet here, 
also, usage varies, as 
Whose else’s do you think?—DickeEns. 
Yes, who else’s daughter should I be?—Gossz (TRANSLAT+ 
ING FROM IssENn). 
The distinctions of joint and separate ownership in 
the use of the possessive sign may be learned by the 
comparison of such phrases as,

Reed and Brown’s Grammar. 
Reed and Brown’s Grammars. 
Reed’s and Brown’s Grammar. 
Reed’s and Brown’s Grammars. 
An element of confusion for possessive forms is made 
by the occasional use of ’s as a plural termination for 
letters, signs, and the names of words, when the addi- 
tion of s alone would give ambiguity, as, “There are 
two l’s in skill,” “There are four Ye’s and three We’s 
on the page.” But if such exceptional plural forms 
be allowed they should be made as few as possible. In 
the last century the forms of the genitives and the 
plurals were often confounded. Thus Addison in the 
Spectator wrote of “Purcell’s Opera’s.” 
The possessives of the personal pronouns never con- 
tain an apostrophe but represent other types of the old 
Saxon inflections. (See chapter on Personal Pro- 
nouns. ) 
In addition to the possessive forms of nouns and 
personal pronouns, English has one other word in the 
possessive case. Whose is the possessive of who both 
as a relative and an interrogative, and is occasionally 
used also as a possessive for which, especially in poetry. 
The old genitive case covered some word relations 
that do not belong to the modern possessive case, and‘ 
that are usually expressed in modern English by the 
preposition of, as, “The siege of Paris.” The substi- 
tution of these phrases for the older genitive is due to 
French influence. In some similar cases where the 
possessive is allowable there may be ambiguity of mean-
-P-A-G-E-112
  96 Grammar and Its Reasons 
ing. Thus the phrase, “My brother’s picture,” may 
mean a picture belonging to my brother, or one that 
represents him. Although usage allows this phrase 
with either meaning, yet in general it seems desirable 
to limit the possessive to the idea of ownership and to 
use of in other cases. Thus “The roar of the waves,”’ 
is better in prose than “'The wave’s roar,” although in 
poetry the latter form is sometimes used. 
An idiom in English that is peculiar and sometimes 
difficult to explain is the use of the possessive case in 
an objective relation after of, thus making a double 
or cumulative genitive form. In the phrase “This 
book of John’s” the simple and natural meaning is 
“one of several which he owns.” Yet usage allows the 
same form in cases where there may be only one, as, 
“This child of ours is ill,” “He is a servant of the 
General’s.” In the expression: “A Discovery of Sir 
Isaac Newton’s,” the use of the possessive makes the 
idea subjective, that is, the discovery was by him. If 
the simple (or nominative) noun form were used it 
would be Newton himself that was discovered. 
There has been much grammatical history connected 
with the possessive case. An English writer (Mr. 
Serjeant Manning) has written an entire pamphlet on 
this subject under the elaborate title, “The Character 
and Origin of the Possessive Augment in English and its 
Cognate Dialects,”
-P-A-G-E-113

COMPARISON 
We should hold apart true comparison of adjectives and 
the mere combination of adjective and adverb.—WuitnEy 
The rule requiring the comparative where two objects 
are compared is strictly true for Latin but not for English.— 
ALLEN. 
The inflection of comparison belongs to some adjec- 
tives of quality and to a few adverbs. The forms are 
three in number and are called “degrees,” though one 
or two modern grammars object to that term and prefer 
simply the word “forms,” which indeed seems to cover 
all real needs. 
These forms or “degrees’’ are said to express degrees 
of quality, but must not be supposed to do so in any 
absolute way. The comparative simply shows that one 
of two objects compared has more of the quality than 
the other. It does not show “more of the quality than 
the positive” as many grammars have stated. Indeed, 
in more than half the cases where the comparative is 
used, the quality is not present in a very marked degree, 
while there must be a prominent and positive quality 
to justify the use of the positive form of the adjective. 
I may say “John is taller than James,” when neither of 
them could be called tall. 
In a similar way the superlative does not show “the 
97 
‘  
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 Grammar and Its Reasons 
greatest degree of the quality,” but only the greatest 
to be found in the group of objects that are compared. 
Even when we use the positive degree there is a subtle 
comparison of the object with an assumed average that 
is held in mind as the standard. If I say “These are 
large apples,” I mean that they are relatively large as 
compared with the average apple. 
The comparative form is exclusive, separating the 
objects compared, and is usually followed by than. 
The superlative is inclusive, and is usually followed by 
of. The superlative may be correctly used in the com- 
parison of two objects when these constitute an entire 
class. 
. Terms of approximate comparison are sometimes 
used in English as “rounder,” “more perfect.” The 
idiom rests on a lower conception of the quality named, 
and is equivalent to “more nearly round,” “more 
nearly perfect.” The phrase “My Dearest Mother” 
has in it an absolute superlative without any real 
comparison. 
With long adjectives the adverbs more and most take 
the place of the inflectional forms of comparison; and 
with long and short adjectives alike, less and least are 
often used to express a negative kind of comparison. 
A whole phrase may sometimes be treated to such 
modification, as “This is more to my mind than that.” 
Very, exceedingly, rather, highly, and other adverbs 
are frequently employed to denote degrees of quality, 
but in these cases there is no such specific comparison 
as is expressed by the comparative and superlative
-P-A-G-E-115
  Comparison 99 
forms. To add an adverb (even more or most) to an 
adjective is not truly an inflection of comparison, 
though more and most perform the same office as the 
terminations of comparison. 
The use of more and most as a substitute for the 
terminations er and est came into use toward the end 
of the thirteenth century and is due to Norman- 
French influence. Chaucer frequently uses such forms 
as wofuller, fittingest. In the Elizabethan period, and 
even later, writers paid little attention to the length 
of the adjective in determining the mode of comparison. 
Thus Milton has hopefullest; Goldsmith, cunninger 
and eruelest; and even Washington Irving uses know- 
ingest. Such sentences as “The delectablest lusty 
sight and movingest object methought it was,”’ arefound 
in early English literature. 
Double forms of comparison were also used by the 
older writers. Thus the Bible has “most. straitest 
sect.” 
In Shakespeare we read: 
A more longer list of. virtues. —ANTony anD CLBOPATRA. 
Thy most worst.—WinTER’s TALE. 
The more better assurance. — MipsummEer WNicut’s 
Dream. 
Ben Jonson speaks of this usage as “a certain kind of 
English Atticism imitating the manner of the most: an- 
cientest and finest Grecians.” 
In such expressions, more and most seem to have 
been first added to intensify the force of er and est, 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  100 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Later they came to take the place of er and est for long 
adjectives. 
In this connection we may notice the anomalous 
phrase “less happier land,” used by Shakespeare in 
King Richard II, and also Milton’s interesting line, 
‘And in the lowest depths a lower deep.” 
Most of the so-called irregular comparisons are 
merely isolated adjective forms which have lost their 
associated degrees of comparison. Thus, better and 
best had an ancient positive, bat; worse and worst 
had a root adjective weor, meaning bad. Hinder, 
nether, after, over, either, and other words are ancient 
comparative forms, from which the other degrees have 
been lost. Inner, upper, jarther and some others have 
in present usage only an adverb, instead of an adjective, 
for the positive degree. 
Among the irregular forms of comparison there are a 
few that show traces of vowel modification, and since 
regular forms are also in use paronyms have been de- 
veloped, as elder, older; latter, later; last, latest. Of 
these the irregular form is always the earlier. 
There is much interesting word study that can be 
undertaken in connection with the irregular forms of 
comparison, but this belongs to general etymological 
study rather than to the subject of true grammatical .

VOICE 
Grammatical terms are conventional and often unsatis- 
factory.—ToLMaAN. 
The absence of a reflexive is one reason why English has 
never developed a passive voice for any of its verbs.— 
Ramsey. 
The change of the verb for voice consists in the invention 
of a Passive variation of the verb, for stating the same action 
in a different form. To repeat all the tenses and moods of 
the verb, under a different termination, merely to exhibit a 
difference such as this, seems a great waste of power.—Bain. 
Voice is that form of a verb which shows whether the 
subject represents the actor or the one who receives the 
act. Exactly why the name voice should be given to 
this property of the verb it is hard to say. But it can be 
treated as a recognized term in grammar, in spite of its 
apparent lack of etymological meaning. 
There is, however, no real inflection of voice in 
English, since all the passive verb forms are phrases 
made by the past participle of the verb with the various 
forms of be. For this reason some grammarians omit 
the term voice entirely. But since other languages 
have voice, grammarians have usually felt that it is con- 
venient to retain the idea in English also, and to treat 
these passive phrases as a voice inflection of the verb.

  102 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The object of the active voice is made the subject of 
the passive. Where there are two objects, one direct 
and the other indirect, the direct object is the natural 
subject of the passive and the indirect object remains 
in the passive voice as an indirect objective phrase, as, 
** He gave me some oranges.” Some oranges were 
given to me. Yet occasionally we find the indirect 
object becoming the subject and the direct object re- 
maining over in the passive, and known as the “ re- 
tained object,” as “ I was given some oranges.” This 
construction is peculiar to the English tongue. 
In the case of an attributive object following the 
direct object (a construction sometimes called the 
objective predicate or factitive object) it is the habit 
of the passive to make the direct part of the object the 
subject, using the following word or phrase as an at- 
tribute after the copulative verb phrase, as 
They made her queen. 
She was made queen. 
Only transitive verbs have a passive voice. There is 
a large class of neuter or intransitive verbs that have no 
change of voice, and their forms are necessarily all 
active. 
Even in the transitive verbs the passive forms are 
used far less than the active. Simple and illiterate 
people, as well as children, seldom use passive verbs, 
because their thought seldom takes the passive form. 
An intransitive verb followed by a preposition 1s
-P-A-G-E-119
Voice 103 
sometimes thought of as a transitive verb, and then 
forms a passive, as 
He was taken no notice of. 
Such means were resorted to. 
There are some intransitive phrases that resemble 
the passive in form, as “He is come,” “The tower is 
fallen.”, The participle in these cases is sometimes 
treated like an adjective rather than as a part of a true 
verb phrase. This construction is very common in 
Shakespearian English. We read: 
“The King himself is rode to view the battle.””—Kine 
Henry VIII. 
“T am declined into the vale of years.” —OTHELLO. 
“His lordship is walked forth.”’—Kine Henry IV. 
Although these intransitive phrases resemble the 
passive voice they really conform to the grammar of 
old English in which be was the auxiliary of the perfect 
tenses for the intransitive verbs, and have for the transi- 
tive verbs. In modern English the transitive auxiliary 
have has become the perfect tense auxiliary for all 
verbs. 
There are cases in which active verb seems to have 
a passive meaning, as “Meat will not keep in hot 
weather.” 
This also was more common in earlier literature, as 
“What's to do:””—Twrtrra NicHt. 
To the student of general grammar both of these con- 
structions suggest the so-called “middle voice’’ of
-P-A-G-E-120
  104 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Greek and some other languages, used sometimes in 
sentences which in modern English would have an 
active verb with a reflexive object. ‘Thus “The book 
sells well’? seems to have come from a reflexive form 
“sells itself.” 
In the older English reflexives were commonly used 
when the actor was unknown, as “The door opens 
itself.” Later the reflexive form was changed to the 
passive. Thus: 
Collect yourself—be collected. 
Prepare yourself—be prepared. 
“T persuade myself”’ is much like “I let myself be per- 
suaded’’ (middle voice). But “I persuade myself” 
and “I am persuaded’”’ also mean nearly the same 
thing. “I am persuaded”? may sometimes be a true 
passive, though it usually has a merely intransitive 
sense in which the subject is not thought of either as 
representing an actor or one acted upon. 
From the comparison of such sentences as the fore- 
going it will be seen that intransitive, reflexive, and 
passive verbs have close relations to each other. His- 
torically passive verbs seem to have developed out of a 
kind of “middle voice’’ which was closely allied to the 
old reflexive forms. Latin has the remains of a kind of 
“middle voice”’ in the deponent verbs which unite a 
passive form with an active meaning. To the student 
of advanced grammar such comparisons of the English 
idioms with the constructions of other languages are 
most helpful.
-P-A-G-E-121
  Voice 105 
Get is occasionally used as an auxiliary in English in 
such a way as to bring the activity of others to the front, 
as “ You will get punished.” “ He got himself elected.” 
Such expressions belong to colloquial idiom but are 
seldom met with in literary English. They might be 
thought of as a kind of “middle voice” if it were worth 
while to adopt such a classification in English. It is 
better, however, to avoid needless classification and 
keep our grammatical nomenclature more simple. 
Progressive verb phrases belong mostly to the active 
voice of the verb; yet the idea of continuous action is 
not wholly foreign to the passive. ‘To express this the 
older writers used an active form with a passive mean- 
ing, as, “The house is building,” which was perhaps 
a modification of the more strictly grammatical form 
of old English, “The house is a-building.” The 
apparent incongruity in such phrases is increased by 
the fact that they cannot be used with all verbs. We 
cannot say for instance, “The boy is whipping,” with 
a passive meaning; although Bolingbroke once wrote, 
“The crime, which was committing, etc.” 
In recent times a new progressive passive phrase has 
come into use, such as “is being built,” “is being done.” 
The earliest known instance of the use of “is being 
built’”’ is found in a letter by Southey dated 1795. But 
this form of phrase is open to other objections besides 
that of its recent origin. In the sentence “The house, 
being built of stone, is cold and damp,” the phrase 
“being built” signifies that the house is “done built,” 
rather than in a continuous building state. But the 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  106 Grammar and Its Reasons 
chief objection that has been raised to “is being built’’ 
is that 7s is made an auxiliary to its own participle being. 
Outside the present and past tenses also, this con- 
struction never occurs. “The house had been being 
built for ten years’? would be intolerable. In spite 
of these objections, however, ‘‘is being done’? and 
other like phrases seem to be fairly good English and 
have evidently come to stay. They are displacing the 
older form “is building.” Yet this is not obsolete and 
when it can be used without confusion, it is preferred 
by many writers as being less clumsy and more forcible, 
and also as having the sanction of long-continued and 
classic English usage. No new phrases like “is build- 
ing,” however, seem likely to come into the language, 
while the other form is extending its use to other verbs 
as well. 
Although the passive voice is no true inflection of 
English the passive verb phrases give an important varia- 
tion to sentence forms. The conveniences of the pas- 
sive voice are these: The agent may be unknown so 
that the active voice cannot be used except with an in- 
definite subject, as “Some one has broken the window”’; 
that is, “The window has been broken.” The passive 
voice also makes the object emphatic by putting it in a 
leading place. Sometimes the interest is entirely con- 
fined to the object, the agent being unimportant, as 
“The church was burned to the ground.” Merely as 
an alternative form, also, the passive phrase sometimes 
gives a pleasing variety to sentence constructions.

MOOD 
I have met with no satisfactory definition of Mood or 
Mode in Grammar and am unable to give one.—Ramszy. 
“Mood gives one the color of thought that the speaker 
desires to create. Sentences have moods because people 
have moods.” 
There are infinite shades of doubt and contingency, of 
hope, and fear.— WuitNeEY. 
Mood is the change in the simple assertive form of the 
verb to express degree of certainty or doubt. The indica- 
tive is really no mood at all. Moods are changes from the 
unmodified form of assertion.—Brown anp DeGarmo. 
The imperative and subjunctive have no forms not found 
in the indicative-—Harprer AND Burcsss. 
The enumeration of the so-called compound tenses amongst 
the tenses proper is due to a confusion between logic and 
grammar, only slightly removed from the fiction which gave 
us the still lingering potential mood (I can write) or which 
might with equal correctness have given us an obligatory 
mood (I must write), a desiderative mood (I like to write), 
an obstinate mood (I am determined to write), etc.—Srrone, 
Logeman, AND WHEELER. 
Mood, or mode, as it is sometimes called, is the change 
of form in a verb to show different ways in which the 
assertion is made; that is, as expressing a fact, a possi- 
bility, a command, the condition of another event, etc. 
It is a property of the verb that must be recognized even 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 + Grammar and Its Reasons 
though it has so little of the inflectional character that 
in defining the term it is not easy to find clear illustra- 
tions that can show the real character of mood in 
English verbs. A comparison of the sentences “He 
was here,” and “If he were here he would do it,” gives 
an idea of difference between the indicative and sub- 
junctive moods. Again, the sentences “Thou goest,” 
and “Go thou,” illustrate a difference between the in- 
dicative and imperative moods. 
The subjunctive and imperative are not really dis- 
tinct inflectional forms. They are, howver, modifica- 
tions of the assertive form that require explanation. 
The verb be has more of mood than any other verb: 
yet even in this, the most important and irregular of all 
verbs, the modal inflection is slight. 
The right classification of moods is by no means 
universally agreed upon. Some ancient grammarians 
reckoned as many as ten different moods. A few 
years ago five moods were usually named in English 
grammars,—the indicative, potential, subjunctive, im- 
perative, and infinitive moods. Some grammarians 
added a sixth mood, would and should being separated 
from other potential auxiliaries as the distinguishing 
marks of a “conditional mood.” The optative mood, 
or “mood of wishing’’ has sometimes been recognized, 
“May you be happy.” A few grammarians have car- 
ried the classification of moods further still; and 
elective, determinative, compulsive, obligatory,  re- 
guisitive and vocative are all names which have been 
applied to moods of verbs.
-P-A-G-E-125
  Mood 109 
The infinitive no longer has any standing as a modal 
form of the verb. Instead of showing the “manner of 
the assertion’’ it makes no assertion and is a verbal 
noun. 
_The potential mood is also omitted from most modern 
grammars. The forms are not made by inflection and 
‘they have varied uses. The potential auxiliaries, 
however, need careful study in regard to their peculiari- 
ties of meaning and use. This is a difficult task for 
foreign students of English and it affords a large field 
for study even with the native-born among English- 
speaking peoples. The potential forms may be dealt 
with simply as a class of phrases similarly formed rather 
than as a true mood of the English verb. 
The subjunctive mood fills less space in the grammars 
than formerly, since subjunctive forms are less used 
and thefindicative form with a conjunction of doubt 
prefixed is no longer called subjunctive. Modern 
grammars clearly recognize that the essence of the 
subjunctive mood lies in the verb itself rather than 
in the accompanying conjunction. The few facts of the 
subjunctive that are left in English grammar are of much 
interest and importance, however, and must be care- 
fully treated by grammarians. / 
The imperative mood is said to be the form of the 
verb used in a command. But if we compare the sen’ 
tences 
Present arms. 
Pass me the bread, please. 
Give us this day our daily bread.
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 Grammar and Its Reasons 
we see that from a superior to an inferior the impera- 
tive expresses a command; between equals it denotes a 
simple request; and when used from an inferior to a 
superior, or in man’s address to God, it becomes the 
language of supplication and prayer. We also see that 
the imperative mood is characterized rather by the 
absence of inflection than by any positive inflectional 
element. It is simply the common form of the verb 
used as a sentence word as, “Come,” “Try.” By im- 
plication the second person is its subject but the verb 
seems independent of any sentence agreements. 
The dividing line between the imperative and some 
of the other modal formsis hard to draw. Verb phrases 
with let as “Let me go,” are sometimes classed with 
imperatives, sometimes with potential forms. The 
subjunctive of desire as “Long live the king’’ has an 
affinity with the imperative. Shall as a modal aux- 
iliary has an imperative meaning. The question 
whether the Ten Commandments are in the imperative 
mood has been argued. But most grammarians limit 
the imperative mood to the formal imperative sentence, 
as “Bring me the book.” 
The classification of moods in English, as has been 
seen, is in a degree arbitrary. Some modern gram- 
marians have proposed to reduce all moods to two, 
the Objective (corresponding to the indicative) which 
deals with events as outside the speaker’s own person- 
ality; and the Subjective (including the potential, 
subjunctive and imperative) which shows the relation 
of the speaker’s own mind to the thought expressed.
-P-A-G-E-127
  Mood 111 
It seems to be true that most of the facts of modal 
inflection are covered in English when a clear distinc- 
tion is drawn between the “fact forms’? and the 
“thought forms’’ of the verb. 
The potential and subjunctive forms are of great 
interest to students of English and will be discussed 
further. (See Chapters 36 and 38.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  XXII 
TENSE 
The grammatical tenses correspond very incompletely 
with the logical distinctions—Srrone, LoGEMaNn, AND 
WHEELER. 
Some grammarians put in their conjugations what they 
call the compound tenses, as “‘I have worked,” ‘‘shall have 
worked,” and so on. But this can only serve to fill up a 
book, for all these consist merely in the introduction of the 
use of the verb to have in its various parts.—CosBBErtT’s 
Grammar, 1818, 
Certain cheap and facile novelists write habitually in the 
present tense and have won for this the name of hysterical 
present.—Arto Bares. 
Any reader acquainted with a foreign language knows 
how much care is requisite in translating the various Eng- 
lish tenses in their different applications. —Srrona, Loer- 
MAN, AND WHEELER. 
‘Tense may be loosely defined as the verbal form that 
shows time, and sometimes also the completeness or 
incompleteness of an event. Yet the only true tense 
inflection of the verb is the change from the present 
to the past tense. Future time is expressed by a phrase, 
and not by an inflection. There are other verb phrases 
which by means of the auxiliary have give the idea of 
finished action, and these are sometimes called the 
perfect or compound tenses. The six tenses commonly 
named are, 
112
-P-A-G-E-129
  Tense 113 
present, present perfect, 
past, past perfect, 
future, future perfect. 
The perfect tenses express the completion of an action ' 
or event relatively to the time of some other event and 
are therefore relative tenses. The present perfect 
represents the action as finished within the unit of time 
taken as the present, and before the actual present, as 
“JT have written three letters this morning.’’ The past 
perfect and the future perfect represent the action as 
completed in past or future time, and before some 
specified past or future event, as “I had written it be- 
fore he came,”’ “I shall have finished it before to-morrow 
noon.” The future perfect, however, is cumbrous in 
its form and not often to be used. 
The future and future perfect are sometimes called 
the first and second future, and some grammarians give 
to the past perfect the mysterious name of pluperfect 
(i. e. more than perfect) tense. 
To distinguish it from the perfect tenses the past tense 
is sometimes called the imperfect past, or simply the 
imperfect tense; although it may be said that the 
present, past, and future are all imperfect tenses. 
By some grammarians also the past tense is called 
preterit, a term which is intended to convey the 
idea of wholly past. The name preterit, how- 
ever, has sometimes been applied to the present perfect 
instead of the past. 
Some of the reasons for these varied and confusing 
names may be learned by the study of general and
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 Grammar and Its Reasons 
comparative grammar. The past tense in English 
is an indefinite tense, a mere past, and may denote 
either a continuing or a momentary action, as, “He 
lived by the river,” “He fell down.” Some languages, 
however, have differing tense forms for these two 
idioms. The Greek denotes momentary past action 
by a form called the aorist, in distinction from the 
imperfect past; but the Teutonic languages do not 
make this clear distinction between the imperfect 
past and the finished past. 
The perfect tenses in English also have somewhat of 
the same indefinite application, and can be either 
complete or incomplete perfect tenses, as, “I have lived 
my life,” “I have lived here for many years.” 
Continuous action is usually expressed in English 
by the present participle with the auxiliary be. These 
forms are found through all the six tenses and are some- 
times called the progressive tense-forms. In the present 
and past another phrase-form, called the emphatic, 
is made by the use of the auxiliary do. These verbal 
forms are used in interrogative and negative sentences 
also. 
The future tense has two forms which may be briefly 
indicated as follows: 
1. Ishall. Youwill. Hewill. 
2. Iwill. Youshall. Heshall. 
The first of these, however, is the fundamental form 
of the future tense. The second of these future forms 
is sometimes classed as a modal form rather than as 
the true future tense. (See Chapter 37.)
-P-A-G-E-131
  
Tense 115 
Old English had fewer tense forms than we recognize 
to-day. There was no distinct form for the future, its 
place being covered by the present, a practice which is 
still recognized as correct, as “ He comes (or is coming) 
to town to-morrow.” The present is also the necessary 
tense to express unchangeable truths, as, “ God is good,” 
“Man is an animal.” It is also used to make past 
events appear more vivid, and in this use, it has some- 
times been called the historical present. _ The too 
frequent use of this form may become a mannerism 
with writers. ; 
The distinction of six tenses belongs only to the in- 
dicative mood. In the subjunctive the verb be has two 
tense forms, be and were, but the difference in their use 
is not strictly one of time. Other verbs have progressive 
subjunctive forms made by using be and were as auxili- 
aries with the present participle, also.a perfect sub- 
junctive in the third person with have as the auxiliary, 
as, “If he have done it,” but this is rarely used in 
modern English. 
The so-called potential mood has imperfect and 
perfect forms with each of its auxiliaries, and since 
some of the auxiliaries are past tenses of the rest, the 
potential mood is sometimes said to have four tenses, 
present, present perfect, past, and past perfect. The 
meaning and use of these potential phrases should be 
carefully considered, but the distinctions are not chiefly 
those of time signification. Participles and infinitives 
have also imperfect and perfect forms which are some- 
times treated as tenses in a certain sense, 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
116 Grammar and Its Reasons 
There are a few questions of syntax that relate to the 
eonnection of tenses in clauses of the same sentence. 
In the expressions “I think I shall,” and “I thought I 
should,” the tense of the subordinate verb has been 
determined by that of the principal clause. But when 
a universal truth is quoted indirectly, the present tense 
is not relinguished on account of any supposed need 
of agreement, as, “Such a man would not admit that 
two and two is (not was) four.” Special care must be 
exercised in regard to the tense of an infinitive after 
certain verbs, as, “He hoped to do it” (not, to have 
done it.) There are examples in literature, however, 
where the perfect infinitive seems to be justified. In 
Milton’s line, “He trusted to have equalled the Most 
High,” the perfect infinitive seems to have been chosen . 
partly by the sense of attraction, and partly from the 
wish having extended itself to the completed fact. But 
the subject of connection of tenses, like many other 
grammatical subjects, is a matter of clear thinking 
rather than of grammatical or rhetorical rules, and is 
best treated by the examination of concrete illustrations. 
The older English allowed tense attractions that would 
now be condemned, as, “ He knew what was in man.” 
The subject of tense has been variously treated by 
grammarians and more than twenty tenses have been 
recognized. To adhere to six because there are six 
tenses in Latin is not perhaps a very good reason. Yet 
English grammar seems to have settled upon six tenses 
and this is perhaps as good a number as can be named, 
though the distinction between phrase forms and true
-P-A-G-E-133
  Tense 17 
tense inflection must not be lost sight of. The student 
need not use all the nomenclature that has been applied 
to the tenses. But he should know the different terms 
in order to deal intelligently with the text of various 
grammars, and with the facts of comparative grammar 
that throw light upon the structure of the English lan- 
guage.

NOUNS AND THE NOUN RELATIONS 
Grammarians, anxious to give some easy rule by which 
the scholar might distinguish nouns from other words, have 
devoted time to put the words the good before any word, 
and have told him that if the three words make sense the 
last word is a noun. This is frequently the case, as ‘‘the 
good horse,” ‘‘the good dog,’”’ but ‘‘the good sobriety” 
would not appear to be very good sense. You must employ 
your mind in order to arrive at the. knowledge here derived. 
—From Cosserr’s Grammar. Published in London, 1818. 
Called by Bulwer ‘‘the only amusing grammar in the world.” 
The difference between common and proper nouns is the 
logical difference between universals and particulars and has 
no place in grammar whatever.—Fircu. 
“Grammar deals with thought relations.” 
The lack of inflection is the student’s best opportunity 
in thought analysis, and in study of language tendencies 
and of the necessary relation of thought and speech.— 
Davenport aNnp EMERSON. 
Nouns are recognized by the fact that they are name 
words. But the basis of classification for parts of 
speech is the use of the word in sentences, and the fact 
that the noun (by virtue of being a name) is the natural 
subject of a sentence, should also be pointed out. 
In subdividing a part of speech, we should ask what 
grammatical purpose is to be served by the classification. 
The division of classes of nouns is less a grammatical 
118
-P-A-G-E-135
  Nouns and The Noun Relations 119 
than a logical distinction. But it has some gram-~ 
matical bearings as well. 
The common noun is the name of a class of objects. 
It is only common nouns, as a rule, that can take an 
accompanying restrictive adjective or that permit a 
plural form. In the singular, a common noun usually 
takes the indefinite article unless some more distinctive 
adjective term is used with it. 
A proper noun is the name of an individual object, 
and may be meaningless or arbitrary in signification. 
A proper noun seldom takes an article or accompanying 
adjective. The article the, however, accompanies 
many geographical proper names, as The Mississippi, 
The Sahara. This was less the case formerly than now. 
In the Bible, for instance, Jordan, Euphrates, etc., 
are used without the article. If made plural or limited 
by the indefinite article a proper noun loses a little 
of its “proper”? character and becomes in a sense a 
class name, as, “The Henrys,” “A Daniel come to 
judgment.” 
An abstract noun denotes a quality or some single 
circumstance considered in general terms, as coolness, 
life, motion. Its grammatical properties are similar 
to those of the proper noun, and like that it becomes a 
kind of class name if pluralized or preceded by an in- 
definite article, as, “The hopes of man,” “A virtue.” 
A noun denoting material (as wool, leather) is closely 
allied to abstract nouns in meaning and in seldom 
taking a plural form. 
Collective nouns are class names and therefore com-
-P-A-G-E-136
    120 | Grammar and Its Reasons 
mon nouns. But they can take either singular or plural 
agreements, according as the thought is centered on the 
group or on the individuals composing it, as, “The 
herd is large,” “The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the 
lea.” (For Verbal nouns see Chapters 40 and 41.) 
The amount of inflection belonging to nouns is far 
less in modern than in early English: Nouns to-day | 
have number, and one change of form for case. A few 
nouns also show a trace of gender inflection. 
The distinction between the cases of .a noun and 
the relations in which the noun may be used, should 
be held clearly in mind. Although the inflection of 
the noun is meagre the relations in which the simple 
or nominative form may be used are numerous. The 
more important of these may be illustrated as follows: 
The boy is here,—subject. 
He is a boy,—attribute, or predicate noun. 
Boy, come here,—independent (or vocative). 
John, the boy you wanted, is here,—appositive. 
He saw a boy,—object of a verb. 
He spoke to the boy,—object of a preposition. 
He gave the boy an apple,—indirect object. 
It will make him a good boy,—factitive object. (Also called 
objective complement, attribute, or predicate.) 
The boy being gone, we waited. Used subjectively in an 
absolute phrase. 
He being a good boy, we trusted him. Used attributively 
in an absolute phrase. 
To be a good boy is his desire. Used absolutely in an 
infinitive phrase. 
A few nouns of distance, time, etc., may be used 
adverbially after a verb, as, “He walked a mile,” “He
-P-A-G-E-137
  Nouns and the Noun Relations 121 
“waited two hours.” Such a noun is sometimes called 
an adverbial object. Certain colloquial idioms fall 
into this class, as, “It is only skin deep,” “I don’t care 
a snap.” 
Most of the noun relations are shared with pronouns 
also. At least there is no hard and fixed principle that 
forbids the use of pronouns in any substantive relation. 
Practically, however, pronouns are seldom used in 
several of the rarer or more difficult noun constructions. 
The independent (or vocative) construction cannot well 
be filled by a pronoun. Pronouns are seldom (if ever) 
found in the position of factitive object or as the absolute 
attribute after a copulative infinitive. 
In general, however, it may be said that a pronoun 
may fill any noun relation when it can be done without 
ambiguity, or violation of any other principle of good 
thetorical style,

An adjective is a noun modifier. The articles and 
many of the numerals, demonstratives, possessives, in- 
terrogatives and relatives are included among adjec- 
tives. The possessive cases of nouns and pronouns and 
the participles of verbs are also of the adjective class. 
All of these are treated explicitly in other chapters of 
this book. There remains, however, one large division 
of adjectives, which represents:the idea generally sug- 
gested by the term adjective. It includes those words 
of descriptive meaning which limit a noun by expressing 
a quality of the object named by the noun. 
Qualities vary in degree and a word expressing a 
quality has usually a relative meaning. It is only these 
qualifying adjectives with a few denoting quantity and 
the adverbs that are allied to them, that have the in- 
flection of comparison. 
In old English the adjective was declined to agree 
with its substantive. As late as the fourteenth cen- 
tury the ending e was used to mark a plural adjective. 
But, except in the case of the demonstratives this and 
that, all number forms of adjectives have disappeared 
and the amount of pure grammar that belongs to adjec- 
tives is very small. In the fields of diction and of 
rhetorical style, the adjective demands more extensive 
treatment. 
Students of etymologygive much attention to the forms  
-P-A-G-E-140
  124 Grammar and Its Reasons 
that adjectives assume. Many Latin suffixes, as ate, 
ent, ary, ive, ose, and al, also a few French and Greek 
suffixes, as esque and ic, distinguish large classes of 
adjectives. There are many prefixes and suffixes that 
are freely used to form new adjective terms from other 
English words. Among these are the prefixes un, sub, 
and super; also the suffixes ful, less, able, some, and 
others. Some of these are added to nouns to form 
adjectives, as in fruitful, troublesome, senseless, rainy. 
Others are added to verbs, as in movable, active. 
Almost any noun can take an adjective use, as in 
horse rake, coal oil, mineral soap, mosquito bite. Com- 
pounds are common among adjective terms, as four- 
footed, high-spirited, life-like, new-born. 
Adjectives are of two classes according to the posi- 
tions they occupy. Those which accompany the noun 
(usually preceding it) are often called attributive 
adjectives. When several adjectives limit the same 
noun the one expressing the most inherent quality 
stands nearest to it, as, “a feeble old man.” An ad- 
jective may also be used after a copula as a predicate 
term. The use of an adjective implies an act of judg- 
ing, so the predicate use of an adjective is a primary 
office, as, “The sky is red.” Many of the predicate 
adjective terms, however, are participles, as, “The 
book is written.” 
Since the use of an adjective implies an act of indi- 
vidual judging, a careful speaker often feels a sense of 
modesty in using a descriptive adjective, except for the 
more obvious qualities of objects. A wise writer or
-P-A-G-E-141
  Adjectives 125 
speaker will be discriminating in his use of adjectives, 
and avoid over-coloring, or exaggerated statements as 
weakening to style. Yet the restriction should not be 
so great as to make the style bald or prosaic. One 
should do justice to his own impressions of objects. 
There are many adjectives of rather vague meaning 
which express not so much objective qualities as the 
subjective impression which objects give to the ob- 
server’s mind. Such adjectives as nice, elegant, quaint, 
refined, coarse, splendid, beautiful, and horrid, belong 
to this class. These adjectives owing to their lack of 
definiteness are put to many uses. They are conven- 
tional in application, and sometimes change their 
meaning from one generation to another. They are 
also difficult to translate into the idiom of other lan- 
guages. 
For these, and other reasons, the rhetoric of adjec- 
tives is an important and difficult subject. Precision 
and propriety of style depend very much upon the 
writer’s choice of adjective terms. An abundant 
vocabulary of adjectives to choose from, is a part of a 
good writer’s stock in trade. The free command of 
such a vocabulary, with good taste and careful observa- 
tion, and a desire to tell the truth, will enable a writer to 
add much strength and beauty to style through his 
appropriate use of adjective terms,

THE ARTICLES 
Three little words you often see 
Are Articles a, an, and the. 
—Ruyme In Otp Grammar. 
“It is manifestly incongruous to give a whole part of 
speech to three such little words regardless of the dispropor- 
tion of dictionary space.” 
Two adjectives require special attention, the articles a or an 
and the, the one being historically a numeral, the other a 
demonstrative.—EmrErson. 
The rare and judicious use of the article in English is one 
of the points in which its beautiful simplicity is best shown. 
In its proper omission, especially whenever the sense of the 
noun is not limited or determined, lies an excellence of Eng- 
lish, even over Greek where it is often used without giving 
additional weight or conferring a clearer meaning to the 
noun which it accompanies.—M. ScHELe pr VERE. 
The older text-books not only made the article a 
part of speech in English, but placed it first in the 
list. There are modern grammars which in their 
effort to reduce grammar to a minimum leave out all 
reference to this class of words. But in spite of their 
diminutive size, and the paucity of their grammatical 
properties, there are interesting and important ques- 
tions that relate to the meaning and use of articles. 
The articles are to-day classed with the adjectives and 
126
-P-A-G-E-143
  The Articles 127 
properly so, but they differ from all other adjectives in 
the closeness of their relation to nouns, a relation so 
close as hardly to allow of their being uttered as dis- 
tinct words, but rather as a kind of prefix to the sub- 
stantives which they accompany. - 
The origin of these little words throws some light on 
their general adjective character. The is a weakened 
form of the demonstrative adjective that, while an or 
ais a modified form of ane or one. 
The expressions “a one,” “a union,” illustrate the 
fact that it is the initial sound of the word rather than 
the initial letter which guides the choice of form for the 
indefinite article. Before an unaccented syllable begin- 
ning with h, the form an is sometimes used, since the 
consonant character of # is not distinctly marked, 
as “an historical novel.” 
In the older English an was used before h, in some 
cases where we now use a, as, “ When they had sung 
an hymn they went unto the Mount of Olives.” 
Articles have no inflection and therefore no agree- 
ment. The old rule, “Articles must agree with their 
nouns in number,” simply means that the indefinité 
article is singular in meaning and accompanies a 
singular noun, In the oldest English the article was 
declined with five cases, as is to-day the fact in German 
and some other languages. 
There are many delicate questions of. grammar or of 
thetoric that relate ta the use or omission of the article. 
Some of these are suggested by: comparison of such 
expressions. a8, 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  128 Grammar and Its Reasons 
A cotton and a silk umbrella. 
A cotton and silk umbrella. 
or, 
The northern and eastern boundary. 
The northern and the eastern boundary. 
The northern and eastern boundaries. 
While the omission of a necessary article is a frequent 
grammatical error there are not wanting cases of its 
meaningless and erroneous insertion, as, 
: “*A rare kind of an eagle,” for ‘‘a rare kind of eagle.” 
By comparing “There are a few’’ and “There are 
few,” we see that the second admits deficiency and is 
really negative in meaning. The before an adjective 
converts it into a noun of generic meaning, as “ None 
but the brave deserves the fair.” But the omission of 
the article sometimes gives a noun a wider generic 
meaning. Man is a wider term than “a man” or “the 
man.” Most nouns, however, cannot be used ab- 
stractly in this way. Table and book, for instance, do 
not admit of this generic application. 
If a noun is limited by both an article and another 
adjective, the article usually precedes. Yet there are 
idiomatic phrases containing pronominal adjectives 
where the article follows the other, as, “ What a story,” 
Such an action,” “Half an hour,” “Both the hands,” 
“Many aman.” Although a usually follows many, the 
phrases “a great many,” “a good many,” are in com- 
mon use. When an adjective is modified by an adverb
-P-A-G-E-145
  The Articles < 129 
of degree it often precedes the article, as, “So difficult 
a task.” “ 
There are words that resemble articles, whose unlike 
character should be recognized. In “Daddy’s gone 
a-hunting,” a is an old preposition, a contracted form 
of at. In “The more the merrier,” the is an adverb, 
though the idiom is said to be derived from the in- 
strumental case of the old English inflection. 
Latin differs from modern languages in having no 
article. The recognition of articles by grammarians 
led to the enumeration in the early English grammars 
of nine parts of speech. Later opinion, however, has 
relegated the articles to their true position as a small, 
though important, sub-class under adjectives.

THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
Venerable relics of language.—M. Scuztz pr Verm 
The pronouns are among the oldest parts of speech, and 
consequently have undergone much change, so that their 
original forms are greatly altered. Yet they have preserved 
more relics of the older inflections than any other part of 
speech.—Morais. 
A pronoun is as instantly discredited by any doubt about 
what it represents as an ambassador.—Ar.o Barzs. 
‘Pronouns are the most general kind of name, and depend 
on the circumstances of the sentence for their meaning.” 
Pronouns in general are words which without being 
names and without being limited by an article are used 
in the relations of nouns. There is far less distinctive- 
ness in pronouns as an entire class than belongs to the 
great divisions of pronouns taken separately. 
The personal pronouns especially are a definitely 
marked class of words, and these are usually meant 
when one speaks of the pronouns. The other classes 
of pronouns—adjective pronouns, interrogatives and 
relatives—have a mixed character, and contain ele- 
ments that ally them to other parts of speech. 
The personal pronouns are so named because they 
have grammatical person, the only other Englisk 
words that have this property being a few verbal forms 
that take personal agreements with their subjects. 
130
-P-A-G-E-147
  The Personal Pronouns 131 
They are used not so much to “avoid repetition of the 
noun,” as to express personality. It is a marked step 
in a child’s development, when he recognizes his own 
personality and begins to say “I.” Although the 
personal pronouns are small in size and few in number, 
they seem to contain in themselves and in their agree- 
ments a most disproportionate part of the difficulties 
of grammar. There is no other group of words of 
equally diminutive size that require so full and careful 
treatment at the hands of grammarians, as the personal 
pronouns. 
Almost all that there is of case and of gender as well 
as of person belongs to the personal pronouns. It has 
been said that if five small words, she, her, hers, it and 
its, were blotted out of the language there would be no 
longer need to recognize gender in English grammar. 
He, his and him would then have a common sex sig- 
nification, as is now the case with the plural pronouns 
and we should be saved all discussion of gender forms 
and agreements. 
Each of the personal pronouns has some peculiari- 
ties of its own and requires separate treatment. 
Writers on rhetoric sometimes object to the use of the 
first person in written composition as savoring of ego- 
ism. A good writer will usually veil his own personality 
and express his thoughts in an impersonal way. Yet in 
epistolary writings or when the writer’s personal ex- 
perience is the fitting theme, there is no reason for ex- 
cluding the simple pronoun, and it is a false modesty 
that resorts to unnatural devices in order to avoid it.
-P-A-G-E-148
    132 Grammar and Its Reasons 
We is not exactly the plural of J, since there is usually 
but one I in the group referred to as we. We is some- 
times used in a representative sense; as the editorial 
We, which expresses the sentiments of a paper 
rather than of an individual editor; or the royal We, 
which refers to a king as the head of the nation rather 
than in his personal capacity. It is said that the royal 
We was first used by King John who “thus found out 
the art of multiplying himself.” We is also used for 
human beings generally, as, “ Here we have no continu- 
ing city but we seek one to come.” When a writer is 
expressing his individual sentiments J should generally 
be used. 
The second person singular is not used in modern 
English except in the formal language of prayer or of 
poetry. Yet for these two purposes it ought to be 
thoroughly familiar to the English student. The 
Dutch language has gone even farther than the Eng- 
lish in ignoring the second person singular and uses the 
plural form for both poetry and prayer. 
The substitution of the plural for the singular in 
English began about the thirteenth century and 
seems to have been made at first for the monarchs and 
the nobility. The Quakers gave religious testimony 
to the equality of all men by retaining thee and thou. 
They would not render reverence to one and withhold 
it from others. Thus Charles Fox wrote in 1648, 
“When the Lord sent me into the world, I was required 
to thee and thou all men and women without respect 
to rich and poor, great or small.”
-P-A-G-E-149
    The Personal Pronouns 133 
But it seems to have been difficult for Quakers to 
retain the inflectional form of the second person, espe- 
cially the verbal form, after it went out of common use. 
So colloquial Quaker dialect came to contain such 
anomalous expressions as “thee does,” “thee is,” 
which were afterwards retained by educated Quakers 
as a mere conventionalism or a means of giving dis- 
tinctiveness to the Quaker sect. 
From the fourteenth to the seventeenth century 
thou was used to express familiarity toward friends, 
superiority toward inferiors, and anger or contempt 
toward strangers or enemies. Thus Coke’s historical 
insult to Sir Walter Raleigh was, “'Thou viper, for I will 
thou thee, thou traitor.” In the writings of Robert de 
Brunne (1303) a conversation between husband and 
wife is given, in which she says Ye to her lord, but he 
calls her thou. 
In the German and French languages, the second 
person singular is made to express familiarity, whether 
it be that of endearment or of contempt. The English 
student of these languages needs to be mindful of the 
proprieties of a situation or he can easily give offence 
either by exceeding or withholding the familiarity that 
is felt to be due. “Ach,” said the sentimental German 
maiden who had lately acquired a lover, “ That first du! 
How sweet it is!’ 
Ye was originally the nominative plural, you being 
the objective or dative form. Afterwards ye was some- 
times used as an objective, as,
-P-A-G-E-150
  134 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The more shame for ye; holy men IJ thought ye— 
Kine Henry VIII. 
You is now the form for both cases. But in King 
James’s version of the Bible the original case distinc- 
tions of ye and you are carefully preserved, as, “I have 
piped unto you and ye have not danced.” 
He and she have been used as nouns by Shakespeare 
and other writers, as, “ The fairest she,” “The proudest 
he.” He was frequently used in old English where i 
would now be employed. ‘Thus Lily’s grammar says, 
“The Subjunctive Mood has commonly some con- 
junction joined with him.” An old dialect form of the 
third person was a, as, “ A brushes his hair a mornings.” 
The colloquial use of em, as “Give em to me,” is not 
a contraction of them, but a survival of hem the old 
plural dative of the pronoun. 
The pronoun of the third person singular is the one 
example in English of three gender-forms. The only 
genuinely neuter word that the language contains is the 
pronoun it. Its original form was hit, and it had the 
same possessive form as the masculine, his, which was . 
employed, with sexless signification, as, “If the salt 
have lost his savour.” Occasionally also her was used 
in this way as, “Let patience have her perfect work.” 
In the writings of Shakespeare his is often used with 
sexless signification, as in the Bible. Shakespeare also 
uses the nominative form it as a possessive in simple 
juxtaposition, as, “Go to it grandam, child. Give 
grandam kingdom and it grandam will give it a plum, 
a cherry, and a fig.”
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Personal Pronouns 185 
Its is comparatively a modern word. Spenser never 
uses it. The single instance in which 7s occurs in the 
King James version of the Bible (Lev. 25, 5) is a com- 
paratively recent substitution for the original form i, 
“That which groweth of it own accord,” etc. 
The introduction of its seems to have been retarded 
by the idea that if an object became the owner of 
something it was personified, so that his or her was 
the proper term to employ. 
The use of the pronoun 7 is extended to refer to young 
children and to the lower animals when the distinction 
of sex is not observed. 
The very multiplicity of gender forms in the third 
person of the pronoun gives us a sense of incompleteness. 
There is no singular pronoun that applies equally to 
the two sexes. To supply this lack the masculine form 
has sometimes been adopted. But none of the ex- 
pedients that have been tried are totally without objec- 
tion for all requirements. 
In the text-books on grammar two forms are given for 
the possessive of most of the personal pronouns. Of 
these, the first forms, my, our, thy, your, her and their 
are used only as noun modifiers, and by a few gram- 
marians they are called adjectives. The second forms 
hers, ours, yours, and theirs are often called absolute 
or independent possessive pronouns, since they are 
never used with an accompanying noun. Jts has no 
corresponding absolute pronoun. His is used inter- 
changeably in the two relations. Mine and thine are 
usually absolute or independent, but were formerly used 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 Grammar and Its Reasons 
in the true possessive or adjective relation and are still 
so used in poetry, as, “Mine eyes have seen the glory 
of the coming of the Lord.” My and thy formerly 
occurred only before consonant sounds, but gradually 
came to be used before vowels as well, mine and thine 
being reserved mostly for the absolute functions. 
Hers, ours, yours and theirs are really double genitive 
forms, the s having been added to words already gen- 
itive inform. ‘These words are not found in the oldest 
English, but made their appearance with the other 
genitives in s, first in the Northern dialects. The forms 
in the Southern dialects were hire or hir, oure, etc., and 
sometimes owren, youren, etc. The remains of these 
old possessives are sometimes met with in provincial 
dialects, as, ourn, hern, hisn, etc. 
In addition to the simple personal pronouns there are 
a few compound personal pronouns, formed by adding 
self for the singular and selves for the plural, to the pos- 
sessive case of the first and second persons, and to the 
objective case of the third person. The objective 
forms himself and themselves seem inconsistent with our 
sense of grammatical idiom. Hisself and theirselves 
were formerly in use, and children, reasoning from 
analogy, are inclined to form these compounds. Chau- 
cer uses also an old objective form, “ Full wise is he that 
can himselven know.” 
A compound personal pronoun is not used as a sub- 
ject, except rarely in poetry, as, 
“Myself will guide thee on thy way.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  : 
The Personal Pronouns 137 
It is usually either an appositive giving emphasis, as, 
“God himself will go with thee,” 
or the reflexive object of a verb or a preposition, as, “I 
hurt myself.” The last being the most frequent and 
important use of the compound personal pronouns, they 
are often referred to as the reflexive pronouns. The 
identity of form for these two uses of the compound 
pronouns is a remarkable peculiarity of English, which, 
unlike most modern languages, has no genuinely re- 
flexive pronoun, so the compound personal pronoun has 
been substituted for it. Double emphasis is sometimes 
given by the insertion of own, as “ My own self.” 
All the personal pronouns, whether simple or com- 
pound, and including the pronoun possessives, whether 
adjective or absolute in their function, may have pro- 
nominal agreements with an antecedent in gender, 
number and person, and this relation to an antecedent 
is one of the most important characteristics of personal 
pronouns,

THE ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS 
Care must be taken not to make too many classes in ele- 
mentary grammar; lest the important ideas be made to 
take rank with the unimportant, and the unity and simplicity 
of the movement in the study of the subject be destroyed.— 
Brown anv DeGarmo. 
“Although successful classification is the main thing, the 
work of classification can easily be overdone and made 
burdensome enough to frustrate its own aim by the multi- 
plication of fine drawn distinctions and of technical rules 
designating them.” 
The indeclinables confirm the English characteristics. 
They are structural or functional, largely formless and with 
free interchange of function.—Joynes. 
All things considered, it does not seem desirable to recog- 
nize the relation of agreement in English. In the case of 
this and that the agreement exists, but has a logical basis in 
the inflection of these words as pronouns.—DavENPORT AND 
Emerson. 
I leave many of these indeterminate pronouns., To 
notice every one individually in a particular manner could 
answer no purpose except that of swelling the size of a book 
—a thing which I most anxiously wish to avoid.—CossBerr’s 
Grammar, 1818. 
There is a large class of words of somewhat related 
meaning, which may be used interchangeably as adjec- 
tives or pronouns according as the nouns to which they 
relate are expressed or merely understood. To these 
138 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  The Adjective Pronouns 139 
words the names adjective pronoun and pronominal 
adjective have been given by different. grammarians, 
according as the emphasis is laid upon one or the other 
of these word functions. 
In their adjective character these words do not ex- 
press definite qualities, but they usually point out ob- 
jects previously mentioned, or else they have a some- 
what indefinite meaning referring generally to number 
or quantity. 
Among these pronominal adjective. words many 
sub-classes have been noted, but the classification is by 
no means perfect or entirely consistent. Among the 
sub-classes are the possessives and the numerals. This 
and that are known as the demonstratives, each and 
every as the distributives, the phrases each other and one 
another as reciprocals, and there is a large class of 
words which from their general lack of specific meaning 
are known as the indefinites. Other terms of classifica- 
tion have sometimes been given. Much and litile and 
their related forms (more, less, etc.) are quantitatives. 
All and some are collectives. Some interrogative and 
relative words, as, what and which, are also both ad- 
jective and pronominal in their use. 
The name adjective pronoun, first given by Murray, 
is the one most commonly applied to the general group. 
Yet for some of these words the adjective office is more 
important than the pronominal. Indeed, some of these 
related words cannot be used interchangeably in the two 
Offices. Thus the distributive adjective every cannot 
be used in a pronominal relation, On the other hand
-P-A-G-E-156
Re Sey aT ee ee Eee nr ena RS gee Pet evar eva 
140 Grammar and Its Reasons 
some of the indefinite pronouns, as none, are never 
adjective in their use. Certain nouns of similar mean- 
ing are generally thought of in a half-pronominal sense. 
The line between these and the indefinite adjective 
pronouns is not very distinctly drawn. Such are aught, 
naught, anyone, anybody, no one, nobody, everyone, 
everybody, someone, somebody, and even “a body,” 
meaning one, as, 
“‘Gin a body meet a body comin’ through the rye.” 
The earlier English contained some words of this class 
that are now little used, as in “ All and sundry,” “I have 
somewhat to say unto thee,” “ Divers came from far,” 
“There were certain that said,” etc. While the gen- 
eral similarity of all such words is to be noted, the 
grammarian must deal with each word as pronoun, 
noun, or adjective according to the function which it 
fulfils in any individual sentence. 
Most of the adjective pronouns are without inflection 
of any kind. A few of them can take plural or pos- 
sessive forms, but are then (with the exception of this 
and that) like nouns in their character, as, “Here are 
the ones I meant,” “Each can feel the other’s grief.” 
Any and none are generally used with plural mean- 
ings. Any, however, was formerly singular, as, “If 
any; speak, for him I have offended.” An old idiom, 
“this many years,’ shows a blending of numeral 
characteristics. 
In addition to the adjective and the strictly pronomi- 
nal use, some of the indefinites and numerals may be

  The Adjective Pronouns 141 
limited by adjectives or articles and are therefore allied 
to nouns in their sentence relations, as, a few, the other, 
such a one, a good many, the little one, the first. 
Some of the adjective pronouns are often used in 
pairs, as, this, that ; the one, the other; the former, the 
latter; the first, the second; the first, the last, ete. 
This and that, known especially as the demonstra- 
tives, are far more frequently used than most of the 
other adjective pronouns. They have also well- 
defined grammatical marks which are all their own. 
For this reason some grammarians have given them the 
distinction of being “a whole class” of pronouns, 
though this seems to be a rather questionable promi- 
nence to be given to two words however important. 
This and that, whether used as adjectives or pronouns, 
have singular and plural number-forms. While most 
English adjectives, including the articles, have lost all 
their old English inflections, the demonstratives have 
held securely to their ancient number-forms. 
Certain other words in English are somewhat allied to 
the demonstratives. The article the is in its origin a 
modified form of that. The adverbs here and there 
and the compounds herewith and therewith are also 
used in a demonstrative sense. 
That was originally purely a Saxon demonstrative, 
but by a widening of its grammatical functions it has 
become an important relative pronoun as well. It has 
also acquired another connective office and is the most 
important conjunction for substantive clauses. 
This and these point out the nearer objects, that and
-P-A-G-E-158
  142 Grammar and Its Reasons 
those the more remote. The application of this princi- 
ple in poetry when referring to objects previously 
mentioned seems to be that this and these refer to the 
things that were last named, that and those to the ones 
named earlier, as, 
“Farewell, my friends, farewell my foes, 
My peace with these, my love with those.” 
The idiom “that of’ borrowed from the French, is a 
very convenient one in English, as, “His dress was 
that of a shepherd.” 
While there are few general principles that can be 
formulated as applying to the adjective pronouns, there 
are many specific questions relating to the meaning and 
use of the individual words, which are of much interest 
to the student of idiomatic English.

THE NUMERALS 
“The numerals present the most compact system of sy 
optically harmonious words that comparative Philology 
discovers.” 
The numerals afford us one of the most striking evidences 
of the unity of the race divided as it now is into so. many 
nations. Men to this day use everywhere the same way of 
counting. —M. ScHELe pe VERE, 
The words that express number are grouped by one 
or two ancient grammarians as a separate part of 
speech; and there is certainly sufficient unity and 
peculiarity in them to make it desirable sometimes to 
speak of them together as constituting a special class 
of words. Yet their functions vary and they may be 
found occupying the places of nouns, pronouns, ad- 
jectives and adverbs. Their primary function, how 
ever, seems to be that of adjectives. 
Number words are very numerous. Indeed, they 
may be said to be numberless since there is no limit to 
the extent to which counting may be carried. Yet 
after the first ten, our decimal system expresses new 
number ideas, not by new words, but by ingenious 
variations and combinations, with the occasional in- 
troduction of a new term, as hundred, thousand, 
million. 
143
-P-A-G-E-160
144 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The number words used in counting, or to express 
simply how many, are called the cardinals. ‘These are 
adjective pronouns in their nature; that is, they may 
be used as adjectives, or, like pronouns, they can take 
the noun office without the use of an article. 
The number words which express the order in a series 
are called the ordinals, as, the first, the second, the 
last, etc. These may be adjectives, or they may be used 
as nouns, usually having the article prefixed. 
Some numerals express repetition, or number of 
component parts, as three-fold, double. These are 
sometimes called multiplicatives, but the name seems 
less valuable than the terms cardinal and ordinal. 
There are a few numerals which are primarily nouns, 
such as pair, couple, score, dozen, triplet, trio. Many of 
the indefinite adjective pronouns have a kind of numeral 
character, as few, several, many, some. 
Once and twice are common numeral adverbs. 
Thrice is a similar word, now little used. ‘To express 
the higher numbers adverbially such phrases as three 
times, four times, are employed. 
The place of the numeral is usually before the noun. 
In old English and in poetry it sometimes follows the 
noun, as, “soldiers three.” 
When the cardinal and ordinal numerals are used 
together there is a difference of opinion among English 
scholars as to which should stand first. Some place the 
ordinal first, as, “The first three stanzas,” and justify 
this usage on the ground that only one can be really 
first. Other grammarians have contended that it is
-P-A-G-E-161
  The Numerals 145 
illogical to speak of a first three unless there are other 
successive threes; also that a plural idea in first and 
last is recognized both by old English and by the gram- 
mar of some other languages, as, “'There are first that 
shall be last.” The point does not seem to be con- 
clusively settled, either by invincible argument or 
uniform usage, but there is a growing sentiment in favor 
of putting the cardinal numeral first. If it were in- 
correct to say “three first”’ it would be difficult to 
justify such expressions as, “ The first hours of infancy,” 
“The last days of Pompeii.” Matzner tells us that 
“Tn connection with first and other the cardinal number 
is found before or after”; and gives these illustrations: 
“The first four acts."—Suertpan. “For the first ten 
minutes.” — Cooprr. “Four other  children.”— 
Lewes. “Other seven days.” —GENEsIS. 
The number form of the verb for certain idiomatic 
numeral phrases, as, “Three times four,” has also been 
a subject of dispute among grammarians. But it is 
now generally agreed that the singular is most con- 
sistent with the idea to be conveyed. Thus, “Three 
times four (taken collectively) is twelve.” In a similar 
way, “Five dollars is a large price.”

  XXX 
THE INTERROGATIVES 
“Tt is easier to ask questions than to answer them.” 
A wise questioning is the half-way toward knowledge.— 
Bacon. ” 
Interrogation is expressed in several ways. One of 
these is by a change in the order of the parts of the 
sentence, usually placing the verbal auxiliary before the 
subject. In the present and past ‘tenses, where the 
common form of the verb has no auxiliary, the progres- 
sive or emphatic form of the verb is usually adopted, 
thus gaining an auxiliary, as, “Is he going?’’ “Does 
he think so?” The older English used the common 
form of the verb in these tenses as is still done in poetry, 
as, “ Know ye the land where the myrtle blooms ?”’ 
Another way of expressing interrogation is by the 
use. of interrogative words. Many of these are ad- 
verbs, as, how, why, where, when, whence, wherefore, 
and whither. Others belong to the pronoun or the 
adjective group. The interrogative pronouns are who, 
which and what. Which and what are also interroga- 
tive adjectives, as, “What book did you bring?” In 
old English whether, meaning which of the two, was also 
an interrogative pronoun, as, “Whether of the twain 
did the will of his father?’’ The interrogative pronoun 
who has three case forms, the others are indeclinable. 
146
-P-A-G-E-163
  The Interrogatives 147 
In the sentences, “I asked who came,” and “He has 
decided which he will take,” who and which are inter- 
rogative pronouns which have acquired also a con- 
junctive office by the incorporation of an interrogative 
clause into another sentence. Such pronouns are to 
be distinguished from the relatives, which require an 
antecedent. Yet there is a close historical connection 
between the two. : 
Interrogative adverbs may take a similar conjunctive 
office, as, “He is wondering where it may lead.” 
Compound pronouns formed from who, which and 
what are occasionally to be found with an interrogative 
use, as, 
“Whoever would have thought it?” 
In spoken English, even among well-educated per- 
sons, who sometimes introduces a question where the 
grammatical relation is objective, as, 
Who does this dreadful place belong to?—Mrs. Humpn- 
REY WARD. 
In literary English and in the conversation of persons 
who have a strong feeling for grammatical consistency 
this is generally avoided. Yet where the governing 
word is far removed, the tendency of the language 
seems to be to ignore the restrictions of case, as, “ Who 
do you think the committee will decide to give it to ?”’

THE RELATIVES 
Addison in his Humble Petition of Who and Which,* 
allows the petitioners to say, ‘‘We are descended of ancient 
families and kept up our dignity and honor for many years 
till the Jack Sprat that supplanted us.’’ But the supplanting 
was a restoration of an incapable but legitimate monarch, 
rather than a usurpation. Since the time of Addison, a 
reaction has taken place; the convenience of the three 
distinct forms has been recognized, and we have returned 
somewhat to the Elizabethan usage.—A BBort. 
The use of whose for of which when the antecedent is not 
only irrational but inanimate has had the support of high 
authority for several hundred years.—Epwarp FirzgEraup 
Han, 
Recasting is necessary whenever a pronoun like an unruly 
sheep shows a disposition to escape from its master.—ARLO 
Bates. 
When we say “the relatives’ we usually mean 
relative pronouns, but there are also relative adjectives 
and relative adverbs. The idea that belongs to a rela- 
tive is that it connects with an antecedent noun an ad- 
jective clause that limits that noun. A relative, there- 
fore, holds a conjunctive office as well as that of another 
part of speech. 
The simple relative pronouns are who, which and 
* “The Humble Petition of Who and Which” was 
written by Sir Richard Steele.—See Spectator, May 30, 1711. 
148
-P-A-G-E-165
  The Relatives 149 
that. What is also a relative simple in form, but hold- 
ing compound relations in the sentence. Who is used 
only in referring to persons, which and what in referring 
to things, and that with relation to either persons or 
things. Which was formerly used of persons, as well 
as of things, as, “Our Father which art in Heaven.” 
For the lower animals which or that is used. In refer- 
ring to animals as intelligent beings, who is sometimes 
used, as, “You, my gallant gray, who have borne me 
safely, etc.” 
The use of who, which, and what, as relatives, comes 
from the influence of Norman-French, a language in 
which the interrogatives took on the relative character. 
The Saxon language used the demonstratives for this 
purpose. That is therefore a true Saxon relative. It is 
used only in restrictive clauses, and is usually the best 
connective for such clauses, as, “ The books that I have 
read.” In co-ordinating clauses—that is, those ex- 
pressing an additional fact without restrictive foree—who 
or which is used. Yet these are sometimes used re- 
strictively as well, especially when a preposition is used, 
or for reasons of euphony. Some grammarians have 
insisted that who should not be used restrictively, but 
evidence from literature does not support this view. In 
restrictive clauses after a superlative or a negative 
word, or when the antecedent includes both men and 
things, that is always the proper relative, as “These are 
the best that there are,” “These are not the ones that 
I meant.” 
The antecedent of which is sometimes an entire sen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 Grammar and Its Reasons 
tence, as, “The teacher now came in, which was a 
relief.” An old English idiom allowed the use of an 
article with the relative which, 7.e., “in the which.” 
What as a relative is equivalent to that which and 
therefore includes its own antecedent. This gives to 
the pronoun three functions. In the sentence, “He 
took what he liked,” what is the object of took, the object 
of liked and also the connective of the clauses. This 
condensed use of what was perhaps learned at first from 
the Latin quod. It occurs often at the opening of sen® 
tences where the French would use the phrase ce que. 
Thus in Paradise Lost we read, “What in me is 
dark illumine, what is low raise and support.” In the 
older English the pronoun that sometimes took this 
combined office of antecedent and relative, as, “Do 
that is righteous.” 
In addition to the simple relative pronouns there are 
others variously formed by compounding the adverbs, 
ever, 80, and soever with who, which or what. Of these 
forms, the ones compounded with so and soever are 
older than those in which ever alone is used. These 
compound relatives, like what, may usually be analyzed 
into two words, and they therefore have three functions 
in the sentence. In “Whatever is, is right,” whatever 
is the subject of the two verbs, and also the connective 
of the clauses. Who at the beginning of a sentence 
sometimes takes the same compound relationship, as, 
“Who steals my purse steals trash.” 
Who and its compounds have case-forms; the other 
relatives are indeclinable. Murray’s old grammar
-P-A-G-E-167
  
The Relatives 151 
gives the phrase “of which” as the possessive of which, 
adding in a foot-note, “The possessive whose is some- 
times by eminent authors connected with an antecedent 
of the neuter gender, but the connection is rather a 
poetical license than grammatical propriety and should 
be avoided.” In an earlier age, however, whose and 
whom were used in relation to things as well as persons, 
and there is a tendency in modern English to restore 
this earlier usage in the case of whose, as, “The glorious 
elevations on whose tops the sun kindles harmonies of 
light.” Whose has always been freely used in poetry 
to refer to things. 
In using the compound pronouns derived from who, 
it is desirable that the functions given to one pronoun 
should allow of the same case-form. The sentence, 
“Avoid whoever is in a passion,” is open to criticism 
because the two relations of whoever, as object of avoid 
and subject of is, require unlike case-forms. 
This class of sentences has been variously treated by 
different grammatical thinkers. Some persons would 
say, “ Give the book to whomever comes in,” justifying 
this to their own minds on the ground that the objective 
relation of the pronoun comes first and belongs to the 
principal clause. Most grammarians perhaps would 
say, “Give the book to whoever comes in,” on the 
ground that the object of the preposition is the whole 
clause, “whoever comes in.” Others reasoning still 
more closely would say that the real object is not an 
entire thought that can be expressed by a clause, but a 
person who is merely described by an adjective clause 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 Grammar and Its Reasons 
that follows. The discrepancy can be entirely avoided 
by the use of two words, “Give it to anyone who comes 
in.” 
But there is still another line of reasoning that gives 
some justification to the use of whoever. Who and its 
compounds are showing a tendency to become colorless 
words as to case. The grammarian of the future will 
perhaps maintain that whoever (like whichever) has 
no case-form, and can for this reason be both object and 
subject at the same time. (See Chapter 54.) 
Which and what and their compounds are used also 
as relative adjectives, as, “Take what books you like,” 
“Take whichever books you /refer.” In the latter 
sentence whichever is a relative adjective equivalent to 
“those which,” and is used to limit the noun books, also 
as the object of prefer, and as the connective of the 
clauses. Soever is sometimes separated from what in 
this adjective use, as, ““ What man soever he may be.” 
Certain adverbs—where, when, while and a few 
others—are freely used as relatives to connect adjective 
clauses with the nouns which they limit, as, “This is 
the place where he stood.” The adverb in such a case 
is the equivalent of a prepositional phrase containing 
a relative pronoun, as, “This is the place at which he 
stood.” The adverb is to be preferred in such sen- 
tences as a rule, for a prepositional relative phrase is 
often an awkward construction. 
The conjunction as is sometimes used with the force 
of a relative pronoun after such and same, as, “Take 
such as you prefer,” z.e., “Take those which you pre-
-P-A-G-E-169
  The Relatives 153 
fer.” Than after a comparative may take a similar 
pronominal office, as subject or object, as, ‘More came 
than were asked.” But is sometimes used as a kind of 
negative relative, as, “There is nobody but knows it,” 
4. é., “who knows it not.” 
A relative pronoun, though it has no inflectional 
form, requires the following verb or pronoun to conform 
to the number, person or gender of its antecedent. 
This rule of agreement in a relative clause is most fre- 
quently violated after anyone, such, every, neither, and 
similar words. Grammatically such expressions are 
singular though the plural idea is suggested, as, “ Any- 
one who injures his book must replace it.”” The case 
of a relative is independent of the antecedent, and 
is determined by the relation of the pronoun in the 
, clause.

VERBS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL PARTS 
Having learned to distinguish verbs from the words be- 
longing to other parts of speech, you will now enter with 
a clear head on an inquiry as to the variations to which the 
words of this part of speech are liable—CossBert’s GRAM- 
MAR, 1818. 
But thou, the more he varies forms, beware 
To strain his fetters with a stricter care. 
—Drypen’s ‘ Vireit.” 
“There are a few interesting survivals which resist all 
tendency to uniformity.” 
The large number of verbs, and the almost unlimited free- 
dom with which we can obtain them from other parts of 
speech, is out of all proportion to the use made of verbs.— 
M. Scue.e pE VERE. 
In the Grammar of life the great verbs are To Be and To 
Do.—Joun A. Stewart. 
The verb is the only part of speech which is abso- 
lutely essential to sentence formation. A subject may 
be a pronoun, a phrase or a clause, as well as a noun, 
or it may be omitted, as in imperative sentences. But 
if the verb is lacking there is no sentence. 
The office of the verb is to supply the asserting ele- 
ment to the predicate. But most verbs contain also the 
idea to be predicated either wholly or in part. The 
verb be, however, in a general or definitive sentence, is 
154
-P-A-G-E-171
  
Verbs and Their Principal Parts 155 
sometimes pure verb and simply connects the predicated 
idea to the subject, as, “God is love.” 
Verbs are either complete or incomplete on two lines 
of division. A verb is copulative or attributive, 
according as it is a copula for an outside attribute, as, 
“She seems happy,” or contains within itself the chief 
idea to be predicated, as, “ He runs fast.”” 
Verbs are also either transitive or intransitive,accord- 
ing as they take an object or are used without an 
object. : 
There is one important class of verbs, known as aux- 
iliaries, that have some very distinct grammatical 
properties. (See Chapter 34.) 
There are forms derived from verbs, called verbals, 
or more definitely, participles and infinitives. While 
these retain some of the meaning and modifiers of the 
verbs from which they are derived, their grammatical 
nature is that of some other part of speech rather than 
that of the true verb. (See Chapters 39, 40 and 41.) 
Verbs have a slight amount of inflection for mood, 
tense, number and person. In the two latter points 
some verbal forms show agreement with their sub- 
jects. 
The student cf grammar needs a knowledge of the 
_ few inflectional forms that a verb can take, and for 
every verb he needs to know certain fundamental forms 
called the principal parts. 
Some of the older English verbs have distinct forms 
in the present, past, and past participle, from which all 
the other forms are regularly derived, as do, did, done-
-P-A-G-E-172
156 Grammar and Its Reasons 
From do are derived the words doing, doest, dost, 
doeth, doth and does; also certain phrases, as may do, 
will do, have been doing, etc. From the past form did, 
the form didst alone is derived. Done (called the past 
participle though never used as a participle except with 
@ passive meaning) enters into a large number of verbal 
phrases both active and passive, such as, has done, 
will be done, having done, etc. In order, therefore, to 
have a mastery of the English verb, these three forms, 
the present, past, and past participle, must be known, 
after which all other forms can be regularly made by 
the use of terminations or auxiliaries. 
The past and past participle of many verbs are reg- 
ularly formed by adding ed to the present. Such verbs 
are called regular or weak verbs, and all new verbs 
added to English are regular. If all verbs were regular 
there would be no principal parts to be studied in 
grammar. The infinitive or name form of the verb 
would be all that would need to be given to make its 
forms available for use. The principal parts that 
require the attention of grammar students, therefore, 
are those that are formed in some other way than by 
the ed termination, and these belong wholly to verbs of 
the old Saxon vocabulary. 
There are a few-defective verbs that are lacking in 
one or more of their principal parts. Most of the aux- 
iliaries are of this class. The verb be has principal parts 
derived from different roots and is the most irregular 
verb in English. Go also has different roots in its 
principal parts.
-P-A-G-E-173
  Verbs and Their Principal Parts 157 
The classification of verbs according fo the method 
of forming their principal parts gives two great groups 
whose forms represent the two conjugations of English 
verbs. (See Chapter 33.)
-P-A-G-E-174
  XXXTII 
THE TWO CONJUGATIONS OF ENGLISH 
VERBS 
Language, like the rocks, is strewn with the fossilized 
wrecks of former conditions of society.—Sarcz. 
‘A frequent recognition of the historical element is neces- 
gary to a true understanding of English grammar.” 
The dying out of forms and sounds is looked upon by 
etymologists with painful feeling; but no unprejudiced 
judge will be able to see in it anything but a progressive 
victory over lifeless material.—KravuTER. 
The terms strong and weak were first applied to verbs for 
a somewhat fanciful reason; the strong verbs were so called 
because they seemed to form the preterite term out of their 
own resources without calling to their aid any ending. The 
weak verbs were so called because they were incapable of 
forming their preterites without the aid of the ending ed, 
d, or t.—KiTTREDGE AND ARNOLD. 
The terms strong and weak preterites in all our better 
grammars have put out of use the wholly misleading terms 
of irregular and regular.—TreEncu. 
A strong verb is really just as regular as a weak verb; 
that is to say, all strong verbs form their preterites in accord- 
ance with definite rules and not in obedience to mere chance. 
To ascertain these rules, however, requires a fong study, 
not merely of the English language but of several other 
languages, like German and the Scandinavian tongue, with 
which English is closely related. The student who is begin. 
ning the study of English Grammar, therefore, must learn 
the forms of the strong verbs as separate facts, without 
158
-P-A-G-E-175
  The Two Conjugations of Verbs 159 
much regard to the reasons for their existence.—KiTTrEpGB 
AND ARNOLD. 
The history of the English verb is, from one point of view, 
the history of a conflict between the weak and the strong 
conjugations in which the former steadily tended for three 
centuries to become the one exclusively in use. A satis- 
factory account of the later history of the strong conjugation 
has been made a task of no slight difficulty in consequence 
of the irregularities that appear in many verbs, and the 
seemingly capricious changes that have taken place in tueir 
inflection at different periods.—LounsBuRY. 
Verbs are divided according to their manner of form- 
ing their principal parts into two great classes, called 
strong and weak verbs. The strong verbs form their 
past tense and sometimes their past participle by chang- 
ing the vowel of the root, as sing, sang, sung. They 
take no additional ending in the past tense. ) This vowel 
change is allied to the German modified vowel orwmlaut. 
The past participle of these verbs formerly took the 
ending en, and this is still found in some of the verbs 
of this class, as tread, trod, trodden. The form in en is 
sometimes retained in adjective formations, after it has 
been dropped in the participial use, as in misshapen. 
The weak verbs do not change the vowel of the root, 
but they make the past tense and the past participle by 
adding d, t, or ed to the root, as spill, spilled or spilt. 
A few verbs that are classed with weak verbs have also 
a vowel change in the past, as tell, told. In general, the 
test of a weak verb is that is has a d or é in the past 
that does not occur in the present. 
The name strong signifies that the verb makes its
-P-A-G-E-176
160 - Grammar and Its Reasons 
principal parts within its own root, while the weak verbs 
are incapable of this and require the additional ending. 
There seems to be an affinity between strong and in- 
transitive verbs, though some of the most common of 
the strong verbs (as do and see) are transitive. Most of 
the transitive verbs, however, are of the weak type. 
The names Old Conjugation and New Conjugation 
are also frequently given to these two great types of 
verbs. They have also been called (by Sweet and other 
grammarians) vowel verbs and consonant verbs. In 
some grammars the two great types are called irregular 
and regular verbs. The name regular is a convenient 
one to apply to the modern verbal forms that end 
strictly in ed. Yet there are many irregularities in the 
weak type of verbs. The lists of irregular verbs 
given in the older grammars include very many that are 
now seen to belong to the new or weak conjugation. 
The terms strong and weak are more distinctive in 
describing the type to which a verb belongs than the 
words irregular and regular. 
The forms of the strong verbs are also regular 
according to the principles of old English, though not 
made in accordance with the present active rule for 
verb formation. 
Although the strong verbs are now treated as one 
conjugation of English verbs, they include various types 
of vowel changes. They are really the survivals of 
several ancient Saxon conjugations whose differences 
can still be noted, and to some extent classified. In 
their past participles there are three vowel types:
-P-A-G-E-177
  The Two Conjugations of Verbs 161 
First, like the infinitive—come, came, come. 
Second, like the past tense—find, found, found. 
Third, distinct from either—sing, sang, sung. 
There is a tendency on the part of strong verbs to 
adopt newer and weak forms. Thus glide and creep 
were formerly strong verbs. In a few verbs this change 
has been only partly accomplished and they are known 
as mixed verbs, as swell, swelled, swollen. Weak verbs 
which have also a vowel change in the past (as tell, told; 
seek, sought) are also a type of mixed verbs in which 
the two ways of forming the preterite are combined. 
Both the strong and weak forms of a verb are often in 
use, and sometimes with different meanings, as, 
Hang, hung, hung. 
Hang, hanged, hanged. 
More than a hundred verbs originally strong have 
passed over wholly or in part to the weak conjugation. 
Also more than a hundred strong verbs have dropped 
out of the language and weak verbs derived from the 
Norman-French have taken their place. 
Of the two forms of weak verbs in d and #, the forms 
in ¢ have usually been regarded as somewhat archaic. 
They have often been used by poets, not in the interests 
of simplified spelling but because the archaic appearance 
added poetic flavor to the verse. In verbs having both 
forms in common use the form in ¢ is more frequently 
found in participial relations than in the past tense. 
In some instances the older participial form in ¢ has 
become a pure adjective (as past, blest) thus gaining a 
clear grammatical distinction from the usual verb form.
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 Grammar and Its Reasons 
In not a few weak verbs the forms spelled with d are 
necessarily pronounced with a ¢ sound, as grasped, 
crushed, ete. Among the three hundred words for 
which the Simplified Spelling Board advocate a revised 
spelling there are the past tenses of seventy-three weak 
verbs which phonetically require t rather thand. There 
are some difficulties in the full application of this prin- 
ciple. Some of these past tenses (as past, blest, rapt, 
carest) suggest to the mind other words of like spelling. 
A few verbs requiring the t sound (as hope and hop) are 
omitted from the list, probably because of more com- 
plex ambiguities. 
On the whole, this return to the original and more 
phonetic verbal form has good sense in its favor, and 
for careful students of pronunciation the change is not 
difficult to make. Yet it can scarcely be expected that 
persons trained in the grammars of the last generation 
(which spelt almost all weak verbs with d rather than 2) 
will at present distinguish perfectly between the phon- 
etic differences of such verbs as lived and wisht, lookt 
and showed. 
There are twenty or more verbs in English which end 
in ¢, and have no change for their principal parts, such 
as bet, burst, cast, cost, cut, bit, put, etc. These are 
classed in the older grammars as irregular verbs. Most 
of them, however, are really verbs of the weak type 
from which the weak ending has dropped away. Sev- 
eral of them, however, as burst and Jet, are historically 
allied to the strong conjugation. 
All new verbs added to English are of the weak con-
-P-A-G-E-179
  The Two Conjugations of Verbs 163 
jugation. The weak forms of verbs are by no means 
all new, however. Some of the oldest verbs in the 
language are of this weak type. Indeed the weak 
conjugation itself is simply one of the Saxon conjuga- 
tions which has been adopted for all the newer verb 
formations of English. 
The strong verbs of English are a limited and dwind- 
ling class, but they add much to the charm and variety 
of the language. 
There are many interesting survivals of old irregular 
verbal forms in the language used by elderly people or 
in out-of-the-way localities. To find one of these in an 
unexpected quarter is a delight to the antiquarian 
student of language. It is also a matter of interest to 
notice how little children unconsciously form irregu- 
lar past tenses and participles, according to the ancient 
pattern, as, “If a bee stang you, what would you do?” 
The poets also with true poetic spirit are fond of reviving 
these older forms, which add much to the poetic style 
by their archaic flavor.

AUXILIARY VERBS 
The richness and flexibility of English in its auxiliary 
forms is one of its most striking characteristics.—Joynus. 
When a full verb is associated with an auxiliary it is always 
made into a verbal, so that the function of predication. is 
transferred to the auxiliary. If more than one auxiliary is 
used, only one of these keeps its finite form; all the others 
are verbals.—Sweet. 
The auxiliary is always the verb form, the finite predicate; 
to say auxiliary and verb is an error.—JoyNrs. 
Our auxiliary verbs give us a power which the ancients 
with all their varieties of mood and inflections of tense 
could never attain.—SourTHey. _ 
There is a small but very important class of verbs 
that are not used alone as complete predicates but are 
combined with the participles and infinitives of other 
verbs to make verb phrases. Most of the so-called 
verbal inflections of voice, mood, and tense are made 
in this way. The final participle or infinitive in the 
phrase expresses the principal idea and is sometimes 
called the principal verb. Yet it is the first auxiliary 
that has the assertive power and is the true finite verb. 
Thus “may have been done”’ is a phrase of the verb do, 
but the first auxiliary may is the asserting word. 
But while the auxiliary retains the power of predica- 
tion, its original meaning has been greatly modified and 
164
-P-A-G-E-181
  Auziliary Verbs 165 
is sometimes almost. or entirely lost in the combined 
verb form. The following participle or infinitive also 
loses some of its distinctive character in the blending of 
forms. A participle loses some of its adjective character 
and an infinitive is not preceded by to. 
The amount of specialized meaning that is retained, 
however, differs greatly in the different auxiliaries. For 
this reason they are treated in very different ways by 
grammarians, some of whom restrict the term auxiliary 
to those having no distinctive meaning of their own, but 
whose office is entirely structural or functional. It 
seems convenient, however, to consider together all the 
verbs that have more or less of the auxiliary character. 
The verbs used as auxiliaries are be, have, do, shall, 
will, may, can, must, might, could, would, and should. 
Let, and sometimes also need and dare, resemble the 
auxiliaries in not requiring to before the following 
infinitive. Ought retains to but is similar in meaning 
to some of the auxiliaries, and like them is defective in 
its principal parts. 
Be, have, do, and will are used also as principal verbs 
with definite meanings. They have participles and 
infinitives of their own and can themselves take auxil- 
iaries. May and can also retain to some extent their 
own meanings when in combination. May, can, must, 
might, could, would, and should, are often called the 
modal auxiliaries, since they take the place of a mood 
inflection. Must is usually indicative, expressing 
a necessary fact rather than a contingent one. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  166 Grammar and Its Reasons 
other modals are potential, and some of them are often 
subjunctive in character. 
Be is the most important and most widely used of 
all the auxiliaries. It occurs in all passive and pro- 
gressive verb phrases. Have is also very extended in its 
use, occurring in the perfect tense forms, but with its 
original meaning almost wholly lost. In the older 
English, be was used with intransitive verbs where we 
now use have. The idiom is still sometimes used, as, 
“Tam arrived.” Doasan auxiliary has lost its original 
meaning. Its chief use is to supply an auxiliary to a 
phrase that seems to need one, either for emphasis, as, 
“T did make the effort,” or for reasons of word order, 
as in interrogative and negative sentences. In the 
older English, did was often used as an auxiliary without 
emphasis, as,“ The Serpent beguiled me and I did eat,” 
“Tt did address itself to motion.” —Hamuer. 
The use of auxiliaries is a modern form of language 
growth. It is most highly developed in English. Ger- 
man and the other Teutonic languages, however, have 
similar sets of modal auxiliaries, though these differ 
considerably from those of English in their idiomatic 
usages. 
Auxiliaries have been one of the most potent factors 
in the change of English from an inflectional to a 
highly analytic language. They give great freedom 
and wide range of expression and also furnish many 
of the idiomatic mysteries that make English difficult 
to foreigners. The study of the auxiliaries gives a 
large and interesting field for philological investigation.

VERB PHRASES 
What is the use of teaching the child that successions 
of words, each of which has its own meaning, and any two 
of which may be separated at pleasure by the introduction 
of other words, each of which has also, no more and no less, 
its own meaning, are voices, moods, and tenses? —RicHaRD 
Grant WHITE. 
A conjugation of the verb can hardly be said to exist. 
We have laid aside not only the passive and middle voice, 
the optative and other moods of Greek verbs, but we have 
abandoned also the many tenses of the Latin verb which 
the Romance languages still retain. And after thus strip- 
ping the verb of all power to express tense and mood the 
tendency of our day is to free it more and more even of its 
connection with person.—M. ScHELE pE VERE. 
We should draw a distinct line between the genuine in- 
flection of the verb and those verbal phrases, “compound 
forms,” by which the scheme of conjugation is in part filled 
up.—WHITNEY. 
The amount of true inflection that belongs to the 
verb in English is exceedingly small. There are in- 
flectional changes for the past tense, the third person 
singular of the present tense, and each of the two parti- 
ciples. _ There are ancient forms used with the subject 
thou in all the modes and tenses. If we add several 
irregularities of the verb be we have well-nigh covered 
the true inflection of English verbs. 
167
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 _ Grammar and Its Reasons 
* To state.the same thought in another way: An 
English verb—with the one exception of the verb be— 
can have only eight distinct forms, as, write, writest, 
writeth, writes, writing, wrote, wrotest, written. Three 
of these (writest, writeth, and wrotest) are practically 
obsolete. In~-regular verbs only four forms are in 
common use, as, sail, sails, sailing, sailed. 
Most of the so-called verb-forms are phrases made by 
uniting participles and infinitives with the auxiliary 
verbs. In any verb phrase the first word has the asser- 
tive power and is the true verb, though the last word 
expresses the most significant idea and gives the name 
to the phrase. Thus, “I have seen”’ is a phrase of 
see, but have is the asserting word. The phrase 
can also be separated by adverbial words which are 
no part of the phrase but have their own distinct mean- 
ing and use, as, “ He will probably be elected.” 
The method of the older grammars in conjugating a 
verb with various subjects through all the phrase forms 
of the moods and tenses had little value as a school 
exercise. Pupils should be able, however, to recognize 
all the classes of verb phrases. These may be grouped 
as follows: 
Passive—formed by the auxiliary be with the past 
participle. 
Perfect—known by the auxiliary have and found in 
both voices. 
Future—having the auxiliary will or shall. 
Potential—known by the potential auxiliaries, may, 
can, must, might, could, would, and should. — 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  Verb Phrases 169 
Progressive—formed by the present participle with the 
auxiliary be. 
Emphatic, or Interrogative—containing the auxiliary 
do, and found in the present and past tenses. 
Students should be able to name verb phrases, ap- 
plying these terms. Thus “shall have been seen”’ is a 
future perfect passive verb phrase. “May have been 
tunning”’ is a perfect potential progressive verb phrase. 
Although most of the verb phrases are formed after 
some regular pattern of a given voice, mood or tense, 
idiomatic phrases of more or less irregularity are of 
frequent occurrence. There are intransitive forms 
with the verb be, as, “He is gone,’’ “The tower is 
’ fallen,” also progressive ‘phrases of passive meaning, 
as, “The house is building,” and “The house is being 
built.” 
“Many other irregular verb phrases are also in use, as, 
“T was going to do it,” “I am about to write,” “This is 
to be seen.” The power to make new verb combina- 
tions is very largely developed in English. 
For ordinary purposes of classification a verb phrase 
may be treated asa whole. Yet the practice of looking 
at each word in its individual relations is also of value. 
A full knowledge of the grammatical structure requires 
that the student should sometimes analyze the phrase 
completely. In the sentence, “He might have been 
seen,”’ the verb phrase may be analyzed as follows: 
This is a perfect potential passive phrase of the verb 
see. “Might” is the true verb. “Have’’ is an in- 
finitive, originally the object of “might.” “Been”’ is 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 Grammar and Its Reasons 
the past participle of be. “Might have been” is a 
copulative phrase connecting the past participle “seen’’ 
with the subject. 
A synopsis of verb phrases, including one form for 
each mood and tense, gives a good general view of the 
verbal forms, and is useful in comparing English verbs 
with those of other languages.

THE MODAL AUXILIARIES 
Six little words do claim me every day, 
Shall, must, and can, with will and ought and may. 
Shall is the law within inscribed by heaven, 
The goal to which I by myself am driven. 
Must is the bound not to be over-past, 
Where by the world and Nature I’m held fast. 
Can is the measure of my personal dower 
Of deed and art, science, and practised power. 
Will is my noblest crown, my brightest, best, 
Freedom’s own seal upon my soul imprest, 
Ought the inscription on the seal set fair, 
On Freedom’s open door, a bolt ’tis there. 
And lastly May, ‘mong many courses mixed 
The vaguely possible by the moment fixed. 
Shall, Must, and Can, with Will and Ought and May, 
These are the six that claim me every day. 
Only when God doth teach, do I know what each day 
I shall, I must, I can, I will, I ought, I may. 
—TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN FOR The School Journal. 
The Modals, can, may, must, shall, will, show special de- 
fects of verb forms. They have no personal endings, no 
infinitive, no participle, and hence no compound tenses, 
except by special idiomatic phrase (can have done, etc.). 
They cause special difficulty in the study of other languages 
where such forms are relatively complete and regular, the 
difficulty being chiefly in the English idiom. This is per- 
haps the chief difficulty in English.Joxnezs. 
A mere declaration of ability is indicative in mood. To

-P-A-G-E-188
  172 Grammar and Its Reasons 
term this potential would be parallel to asserting that ‘‘there 
are thirty sheep in the pasture” is in the thirty-sheep mood. 
If, however, the assertion of ability is made doubtfully, it 
goes into the subjunctive not because it is an assertion of 
doubtful ability, but because it is an assertion of ability 
made doubtfully—DavEnrorT aND EMERSON. 
Whether we call the contingent mood potential or sub- 
junctive is not material.—Brown anp DeGarmo, 
There is an interesting group of verbal phrases in 
English with wide diversity of meanings, which are 
variously expressed in other languages by the condi- 
tional, optative, obligative, and subjunctive 
moods. In English these phrases have often been 
classed together as a potential mood. The German 
language is nearly allied to the English in having a set 
of verb phrases with modal auxiliaries that are similar 
to our own. The two languages differ widely, how- 
ever, in the subtler shades of meaning which these 
can convey. 
But the English potential forms are rapidly being 
withdrawn from classification as a distinct mood. 
They are always used with either an indicative or a 
subjunctive force, and may always be classed in one of 
these moods. Yet it is often convenient to treat this 
class of phrases together, under the name potential 
phrases, even if these are not called a distinct mood 
of the verb. 
The chief modal auxiliaries are the present and past 
tenses of the defective verbs, may, can, shall, and will. 
The present tenses of shall and will are also the aux- 
iliaries of the future tense, and are commonly called     
        
    
  
-P-A-G-E-189
The Modal Auxiliaries 173 
the future auxiliaries. Yet the second form of the 
future (used to express will power or compulsion) is 
as truly a modal form as any of the phrases which are 
called potential. 
Ought, must, dare, let, need (and a few others), have 
some similarity with these in meaning and use. 
Ought, originally the past tense of owe, differs from 
the others in that it requires to with the following 
infinitive, thus making a less compact verb phrase. 
Let is used in the imperative to produce a kind of 
third or first person, as “ Let him go,” “Let us go.” 
It is interesting for the grammar student to search 
through the older literature for instances where poten- 
tial words are used as principal verbs, and in their 
original sense, as 
I will no reconcilement.—Hamuer. 
I would that thou wert cold or hot.—Brsuz. 
What can man’s wisdom 
In the restoring his bereavéd sense?—Kine Lear. 
May is sometimes used with the force of must, as 
Whose loves I may not drop.—Macsers. 
In negative sentences cannot is generally used rather 
than may not, as “May I go to the city?’’ “No, you 
cannot go to-day. You may go next week.” 
An ancient form of might was mought, as 
That mought not be distinguished.—Suaxsprare. 
Might, could, would, and should are often used sub- 
junctively, especially since the older subjunctives have
-P-A-G-E-190
    174 Grammar and Its Reasons 
mostly disappeared. Yet the older literature also has- 
many potential phrases used as subjunctives, as 
‘Would I might but ever see that man.—Tuxr Trmpzst, 
O, could I speak the matchless worth.—_Oup Hymn. 
O, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes!—Kine 
Ricuarp III. 
If an angel should have come to me 
And told me Hubert should put out my eyes 
I would not have believed him.—Kine Joun. 
Should is especially the subjunctive auxiliary. (See 
Chapter 38.) 
The potential phrases are sometimes classed as pres- 
ent and past, according to the tense form of the auxiliary 
itself. There are also present perfect and past perfect 
tense forms, made by adding have to the other aux- 
iliaries. Yet the time signification does not usually 
correspond with these names. When used as sub- 
junctives these auxiliaries often refer to future time. 
In, “ How could I thus forget myself yesterday ?’’ could 
is indicative and refers to past time as the tense form 
indicates. But in “How could I atone to-morrow for 
the fault of yesterday?” could is subjunctive, and re- 
fers to future time. An interesting contrast between 
indicative and subjunctive uses of auxiliaries is shown 
in the following: 
“Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.” 
“But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong?” 
To obtain complete command of the modal auxil- 
iaries is one of the most difficult tasks for the foreign

student of English. It is only by long usage and care- 
ful discrimination that he learns to grasp all the deli- 
cate distinctions which the “native born’’ seem to ar- 
rive at_almost intuitively. 
The idiomatic mysteries of the potential phrases are 
increasing in number as the evolution of language 
gives new occasions for the use of these auxiliaries. 
The intricacies have never all been formulated in gram- 
matical statements and cannot be, but by a careful 
comparison of the potential forms in literature a feel- 
ing of the “genius of the language”’ in respect to their 
use can be cultivated. /

SHALL AND WILL, SHOULD AND WOULD 
In the first person simply shail foretells, 
In will a threat or else a promise dwells, 
Shall in the second and the third doth threat, 
Will simply then foretells a future feat. 
—QuarTraIn Founp IN AN OLp GRAMMAR, 
It must be admitted that there is no absolute rule (for 
shall and will) given by any grammarian that will apply to 
all cases without leaving room for doubt.—M. ScuELe pr 
VERE. 
Learn to say, “I shall, I should, we shall, we should.” 
This rule guards the switch, where pupils most easily get off 
the track.—ToMan. 
“English-speaking people of Celtic origin are seldom per- 
fect in these idiomatic usages. An educated Celt would not 
indeed be guilty of the Hibernianism ‘‘Will I do it?” Yet 
even Sir Walter Scott sometimes showed his Scotch national- 
ity in his use of would and should.” 
The distinction in the use of shall and will in forming the 
future tense is less carefully observed by intelligent writers 
and speakers of to-day than it was by those of the middle 
of the nineteenth century or earlier.—Sourawortu. 
The exact and forcible use of these two words is one of the 
niceties of English style—a nicety that not only furnishes 
a peculiar difficulty to foreigners but is also a stumbling- 
block to the great majority of those whose mother-tongue 
is English. Buackpurn. 
Historically, shall is the more ancient and universal, will 
the more modern and at least primarily more rare peri-

phrastic form. With some weakening of both, the primitive 
meaning has not perished. The glimmering through of the 
latter gives to the modern tongue on the one hand occasion 
to avoid ambiguity, on the other to express more delicate 
shades of thought apart from the conventional distribution 
of the auxiliary verbs among the several persons.—TRANS- 
LATED FROM MATZNER. 
The great Shibboleth of modern speech;—the peculiar 
use of the auxiliaries will and shall.—Jaminson. 
In the oldest English there was no distinct form for 
the future tense, its place being supplied by the present. 
This usage is still found in modern English, as “He 
goes (or is going) to town to-morrow.” But from the 
thirteenth century shall and will have been in com- 
mon use to denote future time. ‘These words are used, 
however, as modal auxiliaries, as well as signs of 
futurity, and various grammatical distinctions must be 
observed regarding them. 
In simple prediction (the true future tense) the aux- 
iliaries are used in the following order for the three 
persons: I shall, you will, he will. 
To express the speaker’s determination (the most 
common modal use) the order is as follows: I will, 
you shall, he shall. 
In expressing the determination of another person 
one uses the same auxiliary that the person himself 
would use, as 
He means that I shall go. 
He will do it, and I cannot help it. 
In expressing mere futurity by indirect speech, usage
-P-A-G-E-194
  
  178 Grammar and Its Reasons 
varies. Sometimes the auxiliaries follow the usual 
agreement of persons, as 
He seems to think that I shall be the last to leave. 
You hope that you will be elected. 
But there are cases where such use would convey 
ideas not intended. Thus, “You say that I shall 
regret it”’ gives the idea of compulsion. “He says 
that he will go” gives the idea of promise or purpose. 
In most cases, to express another’s thought, for sim- 
ple futurity as well as purpose, we use the same auxil- 
_iary that he himself would use. As 
You hope that I will succeed. 
He fears that he shall be misunderstood. 
He fears that you will be misunderstood. 
Yet no absolute rule can be given that will cover all 
cases of indirect speech. Common sense, or the speak- 
er’s sense of idiom must be the final arbiter in many 
cases. 
In questions, mere futurity is usually expressed by, 
Shall I? Shall you? Will he? “Shall he?” asks 
for authority. “Will you?” asks for a promise. Will 
is not used with the first person in interrogative sen- 
tences. 
The forms in common use may be summarized as 
follows: 
Pure future I shall be invited of course. 
ina You will be invited of course. 
statement. He will be invited of course. 
Pure future Shall I be invited? 
ina Shall you be invited? 
question. Will he be invited?
-P-A-G-E-195
  Shall and Will, Should and Would 179 
I will have my own way. 
Volition. You will have your own way. 
He will have his own way. 
I will pay you to-morrow. 
Promise. You shall be paid to-morrow. 
He shall be paid to-morrow. 
Compulsion He says that I shall do it. 
or Thou shalt not steal. 
Command. He shall suffer for this. 
The most common mistake in usage is in the first 
person, and consists in using will when no special voli- 
tion, but mere futurity, is to be expressed, as “I will 
probably be there.” The checking of this tendency 
in those who have a weak sense of idiom is a practical 
part of the teacher’s work. 
Yet there are instances where only a slight element 
of volition or purpose is intended; and in these cases 
persons of unlike temperaments may differ in their 
choice of the auxiliary. A person of straightforward, 
positive nature, may say “will,” where one with a 
more suave or yielding disposition prefers “shall’’; as 
“T will be there if the weather is fine’; or, “I shall be 
there if the weather is fine.” 
HISTORICAL CHANGES IN USE 
The foregoing statements cover the important prac- 
tical rules regarding shall and will. Yet students will 
be aided in keeping these grammatical distinctions by 
noting the original meaning of the words, and know- 
ing something of their history as signs of the future 
tense. For the benefit of those who would enter more 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  180 Grammar and Its Reasons 
deeply into this difficult subject, some account of the 
historical change in usage is here appended. 
Shall means to owe, to be obliged, and its subject 
usually names one who is controlled by outside in- 
fluence. The original idea in shall was more of duty 
than of command. Chaucer used the word in the 
original sense: “For by the faith I shal to God, etc.” 
A curious outgrowth of the meaning of shall is found 
in the word “Shilly-shally,” which is applied to the 
action of one who cannot make up his mind, but asks 
continually, “Shall 1?” “Shall I?” The word may 
perhaps be traced to an old sentence from Congreve: 
“TJ don’t stand shill—I—shall—I; if I say’t, I'll do’t.” 
Will means to determine, and its subject originally 
named one who controlled the action. The primary 
sense of the two words is closely followed in a sentence 
by Gibbon: “If you will call, my servant shall show 
you the book.” 
It will be seen that neither of the two words is entirely 
colorless as a mere future auxiliary. The idea of voli- 
tion in will, and that of compulsion in shall, argue 
against such use. The German language is fortunate 
in having an auxiliary werden, that can express mere 
becoming without any extraneous idea. 
While the original meanings of shall and will greatly 
affect their use in modern English, the words vary very 
much in their force, and sometimes seem to be used 
without any special force. Thus will in the third 
person, unless emphasized, is entirely void of any 
meaning except that of a mere future, as
-P-A-G-E-197
  Shall and Will, Should and Would 181 
“Christmas will soon be here.” 
It may even be used without the sense of futurity. 
Thus, “He will often go to the river at the hour of sun- 
set,” denotes a customary, rather than a future action. 
Yet, in spite of the modern weakening of the idea of 
volition in will, the general verdict of English-speaking 
people has usually been that shall is less inconsistent 
than will with the pure future meaning. The idea of 
compulsion includes that of fate or destiny, and a pre- 
destined event is not very different from a future event. 
At a very early date shall began to lose its original 
meaning, its inflectional forms, and its use as a princi- 
pal verb. Wéll, on the other hand, is still in use as an 
independent verb with past tense and participial forms, 
and in its auxiliary use the original idea is more dis- 
tinctly retained than is the case with shall. At a very 
early date shall became the common future auxiliary 
except for cases where volition was to be expressed. 
But there is also some counter argument to this 
preference for shall. In both the second and third 
persons the compulsive idea proves a bar to the use of 
shall as a mere future auxiliary. So a rule prescribing 
such use presents the curious phenomenon of having 
the exceptions twice as numerous as the regular cases; 
and for all these exceptions will is the auxiliary em- 
ployed. Also, since a voluntary choice is likely to be 
carried out, will at an early day began to be employed 
not only when choice was intended, but sometimes 
when little or no volition was really exercised. 
There have therefore always been two opposing 
’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  182 Grammar and Its Reasons 
lines of thinking, each having some foundation in 
reason. Although the one giving will the right of way 
in cases of doubt has never been generally sustained 
by scholars, certain modern writers on grammar 
have openly favored it. (See Ramsey’s Grammar. 
Putnam’s Sons. 1892.) 
I will, they tell us, is more direct and frank 
than I shall. Shall, they would say, is an im- 
perious word. Let us not use shall when a better 
word can be found. So they would make the volun- 
tary future “I will arise and go to my father, the 
common future, reserving the involuntary future, as, 
“T shall go to him, but he shall not return to me,” 
for those cases where lack of volition is conspicuous. 
Although this position has never been endorsed by 
most grammarians, it is supported by a considerable 
amount of current usage. The people of Scotland and 
Treland often use “I will’? where grammarians would 
say “I shall.” And in different sections of America 
to-day people variously say “I will be in Cleveland 
to-morrow,” or, “I shall be in Boston to-morrow.” 
Professor Tolman, of Chicago, has suggested that 
the large German element in the population of the 
Western States, may partly account for the fact that 
will and would have become in some localities the 
words of all work. 
In the historical development of the English lan- 
guage there have been some curious and marked 
changes in the usage of these words at different periods; 
but the history clearly shows that shall has, at least his-
-P-A-G-E-199
Shall and Will, Should and Would 183 
torically, the right to be considered the primary auxiliary 
in pure future phrases. The changes in use have 
been carefully traced in a pamphlet by Prof. F. A. 
Blackburn, of Chicago, entitled The English Future; 
Its Origin and Development. Leipsic (1882). 
Before the Norman Conquest shall and will were 
occasionally used, but only in their original meaning. 
A little later, phrases began to appear in a sense ap- 
proaching that of the future tense, but shall occurs 
more often than will. By the thirteenth century the 
new future phrase had mostly superseded the old 
present tense usage. 
But for more than a century shall became more and 
more the prevailing word. In some writings of the 
fourteenth century it is three or four times as frequent 
as will. It is used in all persons, but especially in the 
second and third persons. In the third person shall 
seems to have been nearly twelve times as frequent as 
will. The latter auxiliary, when found, is almost 
always in the first person, where a sense of volition 
can easily be understood, though it is often difficult 
to determine how much volition it was intended to 
express. 
During the fourteenth century people began to see 
a logical consistency in the use of will for the future, 
especially as offering a distinction from the compul- 
sive force of shall in the second and third persons. So 
the floodtide of shall was gradually in a measure swept 
away by an influx of will. 
In the time of Wycliffe, shall was at its height as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  184 Grammar and Its Reasons 
chief future auxiliary, though in Wycliffe’s gospels will 
occurs sometimes with an indefinite future force. 
Tyndale’s version shows an increase in the number 
of times will is used. But this increase is mostly in 
the first person, showing the gradual establishment 
of two forms in the first person, a mere future, and 
a voluntary future. In Tyndale’s Testament, shall 
is still the ordinary word in the third person future. 
Our common version of the Bible is founded largely 
on Tyndale’s version, and in it “J shall’’ is a very un- 
common phrase. Yet the Bible abounds in shall 
phrases for all future events, as 
“Tt shall come to pass in the last days, etc.” 
“Nation shall rise against nation.” 
“Neither shall they learn war any more.” 
“Thou shalt endure, and thy years shall not fail.” 
This use of shail in the third person, though orig- 
inally an ordinary future (to be replaced mostly by will 
in a later age), has been called by modern grammarians 
the “shall of prophecy.” 
Even after will had to some degree supplanted shall, 
Shakespeare and later writers continued to use shall 
in all three persons to denote inevitable futurity, as 
My country shall have more vices than it had before.—~ 
Macsera. 
Whoever shall practice physicke not having these afore- 
said sciences shall kill more than he shall save.—Breviary 
or Hearts. 1575. 
Sir Thomas More, in one sentence declares six times 
oo
-P-A-G-E-201
  Shall and Will, Should and Would 185 
that Christ “shall” do certain specified things. 
The “shall of prophecy” is still to be found in 
modern English, and poets continue to use shall in 
some cases where the prose writers say will. 
It seems evident that in the historical development 
of future forms it was shall that first lost its original 
meaning and became the future auxiliary, afterwards 
dividing the ground with will in the first person, so as 
to enrich the language with two forms, a pure future, 
and a mixed, or indefinite future in that person. It 
. was at a much later date that will, having become 
weakened in force, replaced shall as a pure future 
for the second and third persons, leaving to shall its 
original modal office of expressing compulsive action. 
A very different explanation of the shall and will 
usages has, however, found its way into modern thought. 
It is sometimes said that “the extreme modesty of 
modern times” forbids the use of “I will,” except in 
extraordinary circumstances, as expressing too much 
self-assertion. “I shall,” however, gives us a phrase 
by which we may shirk all responsibility. In other 
words we are permitted to say “I shall,” and avoid 
the question of egoism suggested by “I will,” since 
the speaker is merely the humble instrument of 
events. 
The fallacy in this reasoning is that “I will’’ is 
assumed to be the original and natural first person 
future, whereas we have seen that this is not the case. 
But while this cannot be taken as the explanation of 
our future phrase forms, the principle here suggested
-P-A-G-E-202
186 Grammar and Its Reasons 
throws some light upon certain delicate points of 
modern usage. 
The principles to be employed, it may be said, are 
not merely those of grammar, but also of politeness. 
Will in the first person must always have a touch of 
volition, and shall in the second person gives emphasis 
to authority. But courtesy demands that both au- 
thority and self-assertion be avoided whenever need- 
less. The person in command does well to say, not 
“You shall,” but “You will please do this’; as if 
predicting that it will please you to do it of your own 
accord. The euphemism deceives no one. “You will 
please’’ is known to be “merely the glove that covers 
the hand of power.” But we like the princes and 
potentates better if they make their authority unob- 
trusive. So the conventional form for a military order 
has become, “You will report to the headquarters of 
the commanding general,” etc. 
Without denying the true history of the idiom of 
the future tense, one may agree in a sense with the 
thought expressed by Archbishop Hare, that “the pres- 
ent law of the future may be interpreted on ethical 
grounds. When speaking in the first person we speak 
submissively, but in the second and third persons we 
speak courteously.” 
As a delicate application of the same principle in 
interrogative sentences, it is sometimes felt that “Shall 
you?” belittles the person addressed by assuming that 
he has no volition in his own acts. “Will you?” how- 
ever, gives the appearance of a request. But if anyone
-P-A-G-E-203
  Shall and Will, Should and Would 187 
considers these two forms as the opposing horns of a 
dilemma, he has the alternative of falling back upon 
another interrogative form that is more colorless than 
either. Instead of saying “Shall you be at the meeting 
to-night ?”’ or “Will you be at the meeting to-night ?”’ 
we may use the present tense as in Old English, and 
say, “Are you going to the meeting to-night ?”’ 
SHOULD AND WOULD 
The intricate principles that govern the use of shall 
and will are applicable also to should and would. Yet 
these latter words have some additional distinctions 
that are all their own and that make the uncertainties 
even greater than those of shall and will. 
Should and would are primarily the past tenses of 
shall and will, as, 
I think I shall. 
I thought I should. 
I think I will. 
I thought I would. 
But should (far more than shall) retains the original 
idea of ought. “You should do it’’ means “ You ought 
to do it.” 
Perhaps the most important use of should, however, 
is in such conditional clauses as “Should you do so, 
you will regret it.” In modern English conditional 
clauses with should have largely taken the place of the 
old subjunctives. 
Would often gives the idea of habitual action, as 
‘The squire would often fall asleep in his pew.”
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 Grammar and Its Reasons 
It may also denote a wish. This is sometimes called 
its optative or subjunctive use, as “Would to God I 
had died for thee.” 
Should and would are sometimes merely softened 
forms of shall and will, as 
I shall like it if you will go. 
I should like it if you would go. 
> “T should be cautious,” etc., merely means “It is 
well to be cautious.” “It should seem,” and “It 
would seem’”’ are both modestly used in the sense of “It 
seems.” An interesting distinction in the use of should 
and would is disclosed by a comparison of the sen- 
tences: 
If I should go there, I should return soon. 
If you should go there, you would return soon. 
If he should go there, he would return soon. 
We see that in the principal or indicative clause, the 
auxiliaries follow the law of the future tense, while in 
the hypothetical clause should is used in all three per- 
sons. 
The use of these words in questions also presents 
some slightly different considerations from those which 
apply to shall and will. The confusions in their use 
are greater than those of shall and will, and they seem 
to be increasing, as apparently antagonistic principles 
seem to be controlling the language development of 
these idioms. 
An attempt to summarize the principles that control 
the use of should and would may be made as follows:
-P-A-G-E-205
Shall and Will, Should and Would 189 
When should and would are used as true past tenses 
for shall and will (that is, when they express either mere 
futurity or a definite determination in some past time) 
they follow the same order for the three persons that 
belongs to shall and will, as 
I feared I should fall. 
I hoped you would succeed. 
I expected that he would have it. 
But if a hypothetical or subjunctive idea is to be 
introduced should becomes the preferred auxiliary, thus 
If I should. 
If you should. 
If he should. 
Yet the principles of euphemism or of courtesy that 
can modify the choice of shall and will (leading us to 
avoid needless egoismy in the first person as well as 
needless compulsion in the second and third)—while 
they affect also the choice of should and would, are felt 
to be less strenuous in their application to these derived 
forms. Thus “I thought I would fall,” while held to 
be incorrect by a person of keen grammatical sense, 
carries less of emphasis on the unintended idea of willing 
than is given by “I will fall.” For this reason many 
persons, in expressing actions which may be the result 
of a degree of volition (though without intending to lay 
special emphasis on this idea) use would where others 
prefer should, as “I thought I would (or should) go to 
Boston before the end of the season.”
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Should, in the sense of ought is used for all three 
persons, as 
I know I should do it. 
I think you should do it. 
He should do it, but he may not. 
In such cases the word is often emphasized. 
Although these principles seem complex, the num- 
ber of cases in which native-born users of English can 
go grammatically wrong is not numerous. Whenever a 
sense of obligation or of compulsion is to be made promi- 
nent, one naturally uses should, and if volition is to be 
emphasized, would is used intuitively. 
If one can learn to use “I should,” “we should,” in 
those instances when it is not desirable to lay emphasis 
on one’s own volitions, he can scarcely make a serious 
grammatical error. It is true that there remains a 
large area of cases in which certain persons use should 
and others would, (as in the second person of questions, 
“Should you like to go?” “ Would you like to go ?”’) but 
the difference is not so much due to disregard of gram- 
matical principle as to a difference in people’s prefer- 
ences on the question of hiding or obtruding the slight 
element of volition that is involved. If an action is 
voluntary at the moment the speaker must be allowed 
a certain degree of choice in the matter of bringing 
this volition into notice. 
So long as even the “native born” are not entirely 
agreed as to the idiomatic use of these four auxiliaries 
it is not strange that for foreign students of English 
the difficulties go deeper. The mistakes made by
-P-A-G-E-207
  Shall and Will, Should and Would 191 
foreigners often remind us of the merry tale of the 
Frenchman who declared, “I will drown; nobody 
shall kelp me.” Yet the absurdity lies not so much 
in the blundering use of the English idiom as in the 
inconsistencies of the language itself which lead to this 
confusion. 
It is impossible for the ordinary grammar text-book 
to deal with these four auxiliaries exhaustively. One 
English writer, Sir E. W. Head, has written an entire 
book on the subject of “Shall and Will.” Yet the impor- 
tant points can easily be mastered and applied by one 
who has a sense of grammatical idiom and will give 
the matter discriminating attention. 
A good exercise for grammar students consists in 
searching for these words in literature and interpreting 
their use by the original meaning of the words and the 
historic changes in their application. 
A suggestive quotation on the subject may be taken 
from the wfitings of Richard Grant White, who says: 
“J do not know in English literature another passage 
in which the distinction between shall and will, and 
would and should, is at once so elegantly, so variously, 
so precisely, and so compactly illustrated as in the 
following lines from a song in Sir George Etheridge’s 
She Would if She Could (1704). 
“How long I shall love him I can no more tell 
Than had I a fever when I should be well. 
My passion shall kill me before I will show it, 
And yet I would give all the world did he know it. 
But oh, how I sigh, when I think, should he woo me 
I cannot refuse what I know would undo me.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  XXXVUOI 
THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD* 
“The subjunctive is not a simple mood, but a composite 
form, the wreck of two moods.” 
In English the distinctions between thought forms and 
fact forms are to a great extent levelled—Swerr. 
Just how rare. this usage now is may be seen from the fact 
that in ten representative volumes by recent writers of 
high reputation, containing approximately 900,000 words, 
there are said to be only 269 instances of the subjunctive 
use of the verb beand only fifteen instances of the subjunctive 
of any other verb than be.-—From The Author. London, 1897. 
The same feeling of doubt or indeterminateness that char- 
acterizes the subjunctive is often conveyed to the form now 
assigned to the indicative. The conditional force in the 
two differs in degree rather than in kind.—Souruworrs. 
The subjunctive mood has so nearly died out of every-day 
English that it becomes a questionable and hazardous pro- 
ceeding to give to the subjunctive idea a distinct meta- 
physical existence, and then to use this fictitious entity to 
conjure with.—Totman. 
If we lose the subjunctive verb it will certainly be a 
grievous impoverishment to our living language, were it 
only for its value in giving variation to diction, and I make 
bold to assert that the writer who helps to keep it up de- 
serves public gratitude—Joun Earue. 
The discriminating use of the subjunctive lends a grace 
and delicacy to the expression of thought, of which the most 
finished writers of to-day gladly avail themselves.—SouTH- 
WORTH, S 
*Allen’s School Grammar (Heath and Co.) gives a 
full treatment of the uses of the subjunctive mood. 
192
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Subjunctive Mood 193 
“The poet will not relinquish the subjunctive mood. He 
knows its value too well.” 
It is not many years since text-books in grammar 
conjugated the subjunctive mood like the indicative 
with the conjunction 7 prefixed. These older gram- 
mars also added a subjunctive form, but the student 
was left to infer that the essence of the subjunctive 
mood lay somehow in a conjunction. 
No text-book or teacher in good standing to-day 
would endorse this absurdity. In the treatment of 
the subject at present, many grammars lay chief empha- 
sis upon the fact that the subjunctive mood is seldom 
heard in modern English. Both teacher and text- 
book sometimes say virtually to the young student, 
“The subjunctive mood is so nearly obsolete that it is 
scarcely worth our while to consider it.” 
Yet the subjunctive were is still a required form 
of the English language. It is used to express a pure 
hypothesis that is known to be contrary to facts, as 
Would that he were here. 
If I were a Frenchman (I am not) I might think differently. 
Another subjunctive form that is less common than 
were, but is not going out of use, is the present sub- 
junctive be in the hypothesis of a scientific demon- 
stration. Our text-books still say: 
“Tf the triangle A be superimposed. on the triangle 
B,” etc., and “If a pendulum be drawn to one side it 
will swing to the other.” 
The verb be has another old subjunctive form, wert
-P-A-G-E-210
194° Grammar and Its Reasons 
(the indicative being wast), used with a subject of the 
second person singular. But this, like its subject pro- 
noun, thou, only occurs in the solemn style or in poeti- 
cal writings. 
Other verbs have a subjunctive form in the third 
person singular, as, “Tf it rain to-morrow, you cannot 
go.” But this is now exceedingly rare in spoken Eng- 
lish, and even in prose writings it is seldom met with. 
It is still, however, the preferred form of poetry. 
_—~Although the subjunctive were (the only common 
subjunctive in spoken English) has the form of the 
past tense, it has, when thus used, no reference to 
past time. 
To express a similar hypothesis in relation to past 
time, had may be used either with or without the con- 
junction 7, as 
Had the boat capsized, all would have been lost. 
If the boat had capsized all would have been lost. 
Had, with 7, has sometimes an indicative sense, 
however, as 
If he had already left the room that alters the case. ° 
A subjunctive verb is generally found in a subordi- 
nate clause following one of the conjunctions, #, 
though, until, lest, or that. 
It may express 
(1) A condition or hypothesis, as 
Té thou have power to raise sy bring him hither. 
I Heaney IV,
-P-A-G-E-211
  The Subjunctive Mood 195 
(2) A purpose, as 
‘Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost.” 
(3) A future contingency, as 
“Come down ere my child die.”’ 
“Tf I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?” 
(4) An indirect question, as 
“Ye shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.” 
In some of these instances the subjunctive would 
wow be replaced by an indicative or a potential form. 
But although the subjunctive is most frequently 
found in subordinate clauses, it is not confined to these. 
It is used in principal clauses to express a consequence, 
of which the hypothesis may or may not be expressed, as 
It were madness to attempt it. 
It had been so with us, had we been there. 
Returning were as tedious as go o’er.—Macseru. 
Modern English generally uses would instead of 
these subjunctives of consequence. 
But the most frequent use of the subjunctive in 
principal clauses, occurs in a class of sentences that 
have a general exclamatory character, and are used 
with either an imperative or an optative force, as 
Heaven forgive him! 
Thy kingdom come. 
Strike we a blow for freedom! 
Come one, come all.
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Sit we down, and hear Bernardo speak of this. 
Be it resolved: 
Sentences of this class which express a wish, have 
sometimes been classed together as an optative mood. 
Modern English generally uses may or let for sentences 
of this kind, as “Let us strike a blow for freedom!’’ 
Other grammarians would class these sentences with 
the imperatives, yet the true imperative is usually con- 
sidered as belonging only to the second person. It 
seems reasonable to group together all the peculiar 
thought forms of the verb (as distinguished from the 
indicative or fact forms), and there seems to be no serious 
objection to making the term, subjunctive mood, cover 
these optative and exclamatory phrases also. 
The tendency of modern English is against the sub- 
junctive in many cases where the bias of the older 
English was in favor of its use. Both the indicative 
and the potential forms have been extended in appli- 
cation as the subjunctive has dropped out of use. 
Modern English uses the indicative in most cases 
where the hypothetical or doubtful character of the 
statement is not clearly and emphatically marked. In 
the expression of future uncertainties, there are still 
cases where either the indicative or subjunctive may 
be considered legitimate, yet in which the potential 
(or conditional) auxiliary should is to be preferred to 
either. Thus, “If he go’’is correct in poetry, and “If he 
goes’’ is the common spokenform; but “If he should 
go’’ (since it expresses more doubt than “If he goes”’), 
is the best substitute for the older subjunctive mood.
-P-A-G-E-213
  The Subjunctive Mood 197 
The reasons for the rarity of the subjunctive in mod- 
ern English are chiefly two: 
(1) A growing carelessness in discriminating be- 
tween thought-form and fact-form, which has led to 
the actual loss (in some cases) of the subjunctive 
forms themselves. 
(2) The large development of the auxiliary forma- 
tions. These being more specific than the subjunctive 
have in large measure taken its place. 
But although the subjunctive is rare in modern 
English, the student should remember that the occa- 
sional and peculiar forms of language still in good use, 
are those which it is most needful to study. So long 
as Shakespeare and the King James’s version of the 
Bible retain their present value, it is going to be need- 
ful for the grammar student to understand the sub- 
junctive mood. 
Nor is its modern literary use unimportant. There 
is many a line in modern poetry and hymn literature 
that would become prosaic if the mode of the verb 
were changed to the indicative. 
As examples of this literary use we may quote: 
Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune.—Lowe tt. 
To fight were deadly peril.—Scorr. 
For if the flour be fresh and sound, 
And if the bread be light and sweet, 
Who careth in what mill ’twas ground?—LonereLiow. 
If happiness have not her seat 
And center in the breast 
We may be wise, or rich, or great 
But never can be blest.—Burns. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
198 Grammar and Its Reasons 
<A 
As we look back into the earlier English literature 
we find more abundant examples, not only in poetry 
but in prose as well. The student of grammar should 
explore the fields of literature for illustrations of the 
subjunctive mood. He will find instances, however, 
which were properly considered as subjunctives by 
the older grammarians, but which it is hardly worth 
while to class with these at present. The forms of 
the indicative and the subjunctive in some tenses, wer 
never distinct. In advanced classes it may be worin 
while to try to distinguish the subjunctive from the 
indicative by historical and logical tests, even when the 
forms are identical. But for the ordinary purposes of 
elementary grammar it is enough for the student to 
recognize the peculiar subjunctive forms in the Englisa 
which he studies and uses, and to see the principles 
which have led to this use. 
The intelligent use of the subjunctive is one of the 
niceties of expression, even in modern speech and 
writing. It often gives a slightly different meaning 
to a phrase. A striking example is shown in the lan- 
guage of formal acts and resolves, as 
“Resolved, That the Superintendent be, and is hereby 
instructed to do” so and so. 
The teacher of grammar should recognize the loss 
of subjunctive forms in modern English. But he 
should not forget that it is possible, by unduly empha- 
sizing the fact, to hasten its departure, causing real 
impoverishment ‘of the language. -

PARTICIPLES 
Buehler treats infinitives and participles as separate 
parts of speech. Will this prove to be an application of 
the maxim “Divide and conquer”?—TouMan. 
The participle is the most delicate part of speech in the 
language, and as such is the one most frequently abused or 
maltreated.—Arto Bares. 
Pronouns and participles — both elusive, and both re- 
quiring most careful supervision to prevent their establish- 
ing with other parts of speech relations which cannot for a 
moment be allowed without scandal.—Ario Bars. 
In verb phrases compounded with have, the participial 
form has lost its proper force and cannot always be ex- 
plained grammatically. In all other verb phrases the par- 
ticiple has its proper adjective force.—Harpir AND BurcEss. 
The participles are words which are derived from 
verbs and may take the limitations of the verb, yet 
which have the nature and use of adjectives. 
Neither the participle nor the infinitive is usually 
' considered a distinct part of speech, yet the place 
to teach the definitions of these is in connection with 
the parts of speech. Until these are both known 
the phrase forms of the verb cannot be understood, 
and it is impossible to name the parts of speech in 
miscellaneous sentences. 
There are two simple or primary participles and 
several phrase forms. The first primary participle 
199 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  200 Grammar and Its Reasons 
ends in ing, and belongs to all verbs except afew of the 
auxiliaries. Its adjective character even when used in 
verb phrases, as “He is running,” is plainly seen. It 
is usually called the present participle, though as its 
time signification is only relative and depends on the 
verb with which it is connected, some grammarians 
prefer to call it the imperfect or simply the active 
participle. This verbal form. in ing has also an infini- 
tive use. (See Chapter 40.) 
There is another primary participle that is variously 
known as the past, the perfect, or the passive participle. 
Its use and meaning vary greatly. It is one of the prin- 
cipal parts of the verb, and enters into a larger number 
of verb phrases than any other verbal form, being used 
in making the perfect tenses of the active voice and all 
the tenses of the passive voice. 
The true participial character of the past participle 
does not always seem evident. Been, the most com- 
mon of all the past participles is never used adjectively. 
The same is true of the past participles of most of the 
other neuter or intransitive verbs. 
In active verb phrases where past participles occur, 
such as, 
I have lived here many years. 
I have written a letter. 
the past participles have a certain remote or historic 
adjective relation which may be dimly recognized, 
but the meaning is so blended that the verb phrase is 
usually thought of as inseparable. If we compare
-P-A-G-E-217
  
Participles 201 
I have written a letter, 
with 
I have a letter written, 
we see that in the latter sentence have is no longer an 
auxiliary, but has reverted to its original use as a prin- 
cipal verb, and written though used adjectively has 
gained a passive meaning, like that of the participle in 
a passive verb phrase, such as “The letter is written.”” 
In a similar way, the participle of any transitive verb 
may be used adjectively outside of a verb phrase. But 
in this connection it is in no sense past. It has ac- 
quired a passive meaning and is usually called the 
passive participle, as, “ The house seen in the distance, 
looks small.” 
A few past participles of intransitive verbs have 
acquired an adjective use in somewhat of a passive 
sense, as “a grown man,” “The risen sun,” “A gone 
goose.” 
The past participle of an intransitive verb is some- 
times used as a predicate adjective after the verb be, 
producing a phrase that resembles the passive voice, 
though without the true passive signification, as, 
“Babylon is fallen.” The phrase thus formed is also 
related in meaning to the perfect tense of the active 
voice. Thus “I am arrived” and “I have arrived’’ 
are nearly equivalent in meaning. The former is the 
more logical form of expression, however. It was 
the usual form in old English for intransitive verbs, and 
is still the common idiom of German, though in modern
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 Grammar and Its Reasons 
English it has mostly been discarded in favor of the 
phrase with have. 
The past participle has more irregularities ‘of spell- 
ing than any other verbal form. When a strong verb 
loses its ancient inflections, or acquires those of the 
weak conjugation, the older participial word is often 
retained for adjective uses, while the new or weaker 
form is used in true participial relations. Thus, 
shaven, molten, and sunken are now adjective forms, 
while shaved, melted and sunk are the forms generally 
used in participial relations. By some grammarians 
the past participle is called the perfect participle, 
though this name is usually reserved for one of the 
phrase forms. é 
In addition to the two primary participles there are 
four participial phrase forms. 
A complete view of the participles of the verb may 
be given as follows: 
Seeing, present active participle; seen, past or passive 
participle. 
Phrases. 
Having seen—perfect active. 
Having been seeing—perfect active progressive. 
Being seen—passive imperfect. 
Having been seen—passive perfect.

  xL 
INFINITIVES 
The true, or simple, infinitive is the name of the verb, as 
go, while to go is a phrase or constructive form. I know of 
no error in English Grammar so fruitful of confusion to the 
student of English Grammar as the false idea that to go is 
the true (or only) English infinitive. In French and German, 
aller or gehen usually means go, while to go is @ aller or 
zu gehen.—JOYNES. 
The practice of joining to the simple infinitive the preposi- 
tion to was itself a corruption originally. In our early 
speech to belonged strictly to the gerund, or, as it is some- 
times called, the dative case of the infinitive. Prefixed to 
the gerund it meant something. But with the simple 
infinitive it merely precedes; it does not govern. It is so 
valueless in itself that when it is omitted, as it regularly is 
after certain verbs, its absence is not even felt.—LounsBury. 
The infinitive is perhaps the most difficult subject in 
English grammar on account of the great variety of its 
uses.—Harper AND BurGEss. 
It is long since up-to-date teachers or text-books 
have called the infinitive a mood of the verb. Its entire 
lack of assertive power precludes such an interpretation. 
Grammarians struggled long with this form, and by 
common consent infinitives and participles are usually 
classed together as verbals, although in their logical 
relations they are nouns and adjectives rather than true 
verbs. 
203
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The infinitive is an abstract noun. The chief or 
root infinitive of a verb names the idea which the verb 
stands for, and thus becomes the name of the verb 
itself. 
The infinitive originally had no to, and is occasion- 
ally still so used, as, 
“Better dwell in the midst of alarms 
Than reign in this horrible place.” 
But the modern infinitive is usually accompanied by 
to, which was originally a preposition, but is now 
thought of almost as a part of the infinitive itself and 
has sometimes unfortunately been called its sign. 
When an infinitive becomes a part of a verb phrase to 
is not used, as in “may go,” “can do,” etc. 
The infinitive originally had different cases. It was 
often used in the dative though sometimes in the ac- 
cusative, or in the old case called in some languages the 
locative. The infinitive of purpose was a dative in- 
finitive and corresponded in meaning to the dative 
supine in wm, as, “A sower went out to sow his seed.” 
Such phrases as, “rooms to rent,” “apples to sell,” 
also represent the usage of the old dative infinitive. 
It was this infinitive of purpose only that in old 
English had to. Later, in the seventeenth century,when 
the sense of to was weakened, for sometimes preceded 
this infinitive form, as, “What went ye out for to see?” 
The usual infinitive termination was an, as drinc-an, 
to drink. In the twelfth and following centuries, an 
became en and finally ¢ and the ¢ itself became a silent
-P-A-G-E-221
Infinitives 205 
letter. As the terminations of the infinitive fell away 
the to of the infinitive of purpose extended itself to 
the other forms. 
Yet some verbs were so constantly followed by an 
infinitive that the preposition to was not introduced. 
To this class belong the potential auxiliaries, and a few 
other verbs, such as bid, dare, need, let, make, and a 
few others. In many of the phrases thus formed the 
infinitives seem to have lost their original independence, 
and the phrase is usually treated as inseparable. Yet 
the student of English should be able to recognize in 
each phrase the original character of each component 
word. 
There are also various idiomatic or abbreviated 
expressions in which to is not used, as, 
Please go. 
You had better go and see. 
What, be gone all day? 
Why not tell me? 
He cannot choose but know. 
A colloquial idiom that has come into use during the 
last century is the use of to in place of the entire 
infinitive, as, 
“T should like to.” 
The little beggars are doing just what I don’t want them 
to.— STEVENSON. 
An adverb is sometimes placed between to and the 
_ infinitive, though this practice was objected to by the 
older grammarians. (See Chapter 57.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Besides the ordinary simple infinitive with to, there 
is also a participial infinitive. It has the form of the 
active participle, but the use of a noun, and can take 
the limitations of the verb from which it was derived 
as, “There is a pleasure in seeing plants grow.” It 
resembles the Latin gerund, and is sometimes called 
by that name in English. (See Chapter 41.) 
In addition to these two simple infinitive forms, 
there are several infinitive phrases. 
All the infinitives of the verb give may be shown 
as follows: 
Give, or to give, root infinitive; giving, participial infinitive. 
PurasE Forms. 
To be giving—active progressive. 
To have given—active perfect. 
To have been giving—active, perfect progressive 
To be given—passive. 
To have been given—passive, perfect. 
In its primary use the infinitive is a noun in either 
the nominative or the objective relation, as, 
To do so is to be a coward. 
I want to try it. 
But the infinitive (as well as other substantive words) 
has certain uses that shade off into adjective or ad- 
verbial constructions, as “a house to let,” “good to 
eat,” “wonderful to tell.” It is not always easy to in- 
terpret an infinitive in its relationships. In an adjective 
relation an infinitive may limit a noun directly as, 
A rule to go by; 
Or as an appositive, as, 
A desire to be loved.
-P-A-G-E-223
Infinitives 207 
It may also be the attribute of a sentence, as, 
He is to die at sunrise. 
Or an objective predicate, as, 
I declare ‘this to be true. 
I wanted him to go at once. 
In an adverbial relation, it may limit an adjective, as, 
Glad to see you. Eager to go. 
Or an adverb, as, 
Not strong enough to lift it. 
The infinitive of purpose is an adverbial infinitive, as, 
He went to find it. 
In a similar way the infinitive may express a result 
adverbially, as, 
It fell so as to obstruct the view. 
Some knowledge of historical and comparative 
grammar will help a teacher to understand and 
interpret the infinitive in its various uses.

  XLI 
VERBAL FORMS IN ING. 
The grammarian in some unexplained way became greatly 
afraid of the word “gerund,” and huddled that form of the 
verb in with participles, or with nouns, by extending too 
widely the use of the phrase ‘verbal noun.’”’ In the best 
of recent grammars this error has been righted and the gerund 
is given its proper recognition. The matter is complicated 
by the fact that the ending ing belongs also to nouns pure 
and simple.—Arto Barss. 
The gerund is Janus-faced; a nounon one side and a verb 
on the other.—Ramsry. 
“The gerund gives the idea of processes going vitally 
forward with vivid force.” 
Modern English forms in ing represent different orig- 
inal forms which in old English had different end- 
ings. 
The participle in old English ended in ende, or ande, 
which later became inde or ynde and finally yng or ing. 
‘The abstract or verbal noun originally ended in wng 
and this was afterwards also written yng or ing. The 
two verbal forms thus became blended and were finally 
thought of as one. 
The true infinitive of the verb is aio closely ‘related 
to the abstract noun. Thus, “Seeing is believing” and 
“To see is to believe” are nearly alike in meaning. 
Modern English uses a verbal in ing in many cases 
208
-P-A-G-E-225
  Verbal Forms in “ing”? 209 
where in older English the infinitive in an or en would 
have been used. 
Partly on account of these different origins the verbal 
form in ing has many uses in English, as follows: 
She was singing—a participle used in making a verb 
phrase. 
The bird singing on the tree is a thrush—a participle 
having verbal limitations, but an appositive adjective re- 
lation. 
The singing bird sits on the tree—pure adjective. 
Singing is a good exercise—abstract or verbal noun. 
She amused us by her singing of that song—also an ab- 
stract or verbal noun, limited like a noun. 
She pleased us by singing the song so well—verbal noun 
with verbal modifiers (called participial infinitive and also 
sometimes called gerund.)* 
Some modern grammarians have revived the old term 
gerund for these verbals that show combined character 
and uses.. The term is somewhat loosely applied, but 
is usually confined to verbals that are participial in   
*It seems desirable in English grammar to distinguish 
by some explicit term those verbals which retain much of 
their original verbal character from those that are exclusively 
nouns in their sentence construction. The term gerund, 
which is used in Latin grammar to refer to a verbal noun 
governing cases, and which has been adopted by some 
recent writers on English, is therefore used in this chapter 
with this signification. But the use of this word in English 
grammar is not without some elements of confusion. . Louns- 
bury and other writers on grammar speak of the old dative 
infinitive as the gerundial use of the infinitive, and Bain and 
other grammarians apply the term gerund to the modern 
infinitive of purpose, as, ‘“‘I come to write a letter.” It 
would seem to be needful at present in using the term ge- 
rund in English grammar, that one should first clearly 
define his own application of it.
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 Grammar and Its Reasons 
form and substantive in use and that at the same time 
have verbal modifiers (usually a direct object). In- 
transitive participial nouns, however, are also called 
gerunds by these writers when the verbal limitation 
is made prominent, as “His walking to the village 
was needless.” 
When a verbal in ing is preceded by the and followed 
by of it is a pure verbal noun. Verbal nouns in ing 
may be pluralized, but cannot at the same time take 
objects or other verbal limitations, as, “'The windings 
of the river.” “Paul’s teachings.” 
A pure noun in ing names the act or state, but the 
gerund generally shows explicitly that the act is going 
forward, as, “'The putting it into place again was no 
easy task.” 
The noun character of the gerund is frequently em- 
phasized by its having (in addition to the verbal modi- 
fiers) a preceding adjective modifier, as the or a pos- 
sessive case; as, 
My leaving Guido were a kind of death. Brownina. 
The gerundive use is not confined to the simple 
verbals in ing but is shared by participial phrase forms 
also, as, 
They heard of his having written the letter. 
I distinctly remember having seen him. 
There isa still older English construction containing a 
verbal in ing after a noun or pronoun, but having the 
adjective rather than the noun use, as, 
What’s the use of me reciting that chapter? 
Ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in us.—B1BLB, 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  Verbal Forms in “ing” 211 
This is occasionally met with in modern literature, as, 
Would you mind me asking you a few questions?— 
STEVENSON. 
The construction is not uncommon when it is a noun 
phrase that is limited by the participle, as, 
Who ever heard of an army superior in numbers retreat- 
ing without a blow? 
But when a pronoun is used the modern gerundive 
form is generally preferred, as, 
I never thought of his doing it—(not, him doing it.) 
The thought in the two cases differs slightly, however. 
In “Think of me doing it”’ the thought is of me. 
In “Think of my doing it” the thought is of the 
doing. 
The verbals in ing in their participial use sometimes 
take a passive meaning, as, 
The tea is making. 
One thing is wanting. 
So much is owing. 
The house is building. 
In the older English this was usually preceded by 
the prepositional prefix a, as, “The house is a-building.” 
This prefix is sometimes used also for an intransitive 
form where the meaning is not passive, as, 
Old Time is still a-flying.—Herricx. 
We see then that the verbals in ing have a mixed char- 
acter among the parts of speech. Sometimes the ad-
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 Grammar and Its Reasons 
jective character is prominent, sometimes the noun 
. character. And in each of these relations the verbal 
character may be very obscure (or almost wholly lack- 
ing) or it may be made prominent by the presence of 
a direct object and other verbal modifiers. 
Modern writers on grammar have shown much in- 
terest in the history and the uses of these complex par- 
ticipial forms in ing,
-P-A-G-E-229

ADVERBS 
Words of more or less obscure descent, belonging to no 
one of the regularly defined classes of nouns or verbs, sub- 
ject to no laws or rules, and yet not only incorporated into 
the idiom but always of undeniable importance,—this ex- 
ceptional and generally ill-treated class of words we call 
after the fashion of ancient grammarians, adverbs. The 
old Latin writers, whenever a word was found to be estab- 
lished in use which differed from its ordinary manner of 
signifying, thrust it aside into the class of adverbs.—M. 
ScHELE DE VERE. 
The common sink and repository of all heterogeneous and 
unknown corruptions.—Horng Tooxs. 
When a man says “I didn’t never say nothing to nobody,” 
this is a sound Old English idiom, traces of which are found 
after 1600.—Kinaton OLIPHANT. 
“Adverbs shade off into prepositions and conjunctions, 
and the same word is often used as two of these parts of . 
speech or even as all the three.” 
“No other interchange of classification is more frequent 
than that of adverb and preposition, and vice versa, and in 
these cases at least the change is generally due to ellipsis.” 
Judging from the names of the two parts of speech 
one might suppose that the adverb was strictly a verb 
modifier and that the adjective had a general limiting 
power for other parts of speech. But on the contrary 
it is the adjective which is confined to the one relation 
213
-P-A-G-E-230
214 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of noun modifier, while all other limiting words are 
indiscriminately classed together as adverbs. 
Many of the adverbs were originally of some other 
part of speech; some are abbreviations or corrupt forms 
of other words. Many of the prepositions have also 
an adverbial use. The one essential characteristic of 
an adverb is that it is a limiting or subordinate word 
that is joined to some other part of speech than a 
noun. 
An adverb may limit a verb, an adjective or another 
adverb. Occasionally also it limits a preposition or a 
connective. It frequently gives intensifying or diminish- 
ing force to an entire statement, as, “Truly God is 
good.” In such cases it is called a modal adverb. 
Even the independent words of negation or affirmation, 
yes and no, are sometimes loosely classed with the 
modal adverbs. They are equivalent to abridged sen- 
tences, however, and are sometimes classed with the 
interjections. 
Adverbs are loosely subdivided according to meaning, 
into those denoting place, time, cause, manner, quantity, 
etc. In reference to grammatical use we speak of con- 
junctive, relative and interrogative as well as modal 
adverbs. 
Many adverbs are used in pairs with correlative sig- 
nification, as, to and fro, now and then, here and there, 
hither and thither, up and down, right and left. An 
adverb is often repeated with correlative force, as, 
“partly, partly; now, now. English is also rich in 
adverbial phrases, idiomatic and sometimes hard to 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
Adverbs 215 
explain, as “at once,” “at all,” “in vain,” “of old,” 
“one by one.” 
The line of division between adjective and adverb 
is not very clearly marked. The same word often 
allows the two uses. Some. adverbs, like adjectives, 
admit of comparison, and the degrees of comparison 
are formed in the same way as for adjectives. 
Many of our Anglo-Saxon adjectives of one syllable 
had originally an adverbial form ending in e. Thus 
Chaucer uses the word h ote as the adverbial form of 
the adjective hot. This final e shared the fate of many 
other final e’s and was gradually dropped. With the 
dropping of the termination such adverbs became 
identical in form with the adjectives. 
An ly added to an adjective is a modern adverbial 
termination. Adverbs thus formed are not used ad- 
jectively; though the corresponding adjective form is 
frequently used in an adverbial relation, especially 
by the poets, who find the adjective more poetic than 
the strictly adverbial form. This usage is not an in- 
novation but has its root in the older English. Such 
colloquial expressions as “Walk slow” are common 
among people who are not “bookish,” even when the 
adverb in ly is the modern literary form. 
One of the time-honored battle grounds of grammarians 
is the question whether certain predicate terms are modi- 
fiers of the subject or the verb. In most of these cases 
the real truth is that both noun and verb are in a de- 
gree modified. In “He walks erect,” the predicate term 
has both an adjective and an adverbial relationship. 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 Grammar and Its Reasons 
It is a peculiarity of the English idiom that the use 
of not in a sentence requires the auxiliary do, as “He 
does not like it.” The poetic form allows the not with 
the common verb form, but the not is placed after the 
verb, and usually at the end of the sentence, as, “She 
likes me not.” There are exceptions in literature, 
however, to this position of the not, as, 
She not denies it—SuaxsPEARE. 
If the adverb not be placed in a sentence containing 
another negative it neutralizes it, as, 
He does not work for nothing. 
Formerly two negatives were used to make a stronger 
negative but this was given up under the influence of 
Latin, in which two negatives make an affirmative. 
In old English nay was used to answer a question 
affirmative in its form, and no a negative one, as, 
Is he going? Nay. 
Is not he going? No. 
But this distinction fell away, and yea and nay are 
now used in poetic style only. 
In a bright paragraph in a literary journal a modern 
writer discusses “nervous adverbs,” that is those that 
are “nervous”’ either in position or in literary form. 
As illustrations of the two cases he quotes, “Few 
people learn anything that is worth learning, easily,” 
and also the little girl who “liked eggs boiled softly.” 
Only and certain of the modal adverbs show an 
especial tendency to lose their right position in the
-P-A-G-E-233
  
Adverbs Q17 
sentence. The usual place for only is immediately 
before the word which it modifies. Yet there are in- 
stances in which other considerations may alter this 
position. In the poem “Identity” no less careful a 
writer than Thomas Bailey Aldrich has included the 
line, “Ionly died last night.” To have placed only after 
died would of course have spoiled the meter; but it 
would be interesting to know just how long Mr. Aldrich 
struggled with that line before deciding to let it go in 
this shape. 
The propriety of placing an adverb between an 
infinitive and its sign has often been questioned, but the 
practice seems to be increasing. (See Chapter 57, 
on “The Split Infinitive. *’) 
Some critics have also objected to the placing of an 
adverb between the parts of a compound tense, prefer- 
ring “probably will go,’’ “has searched carefully,” etc., 
to “will probably go”? and “has carefully searched.” 
It is frequently better that the adverb should precede or 
follow the entire phrase, but there are many instances 
in which the middle of the verb phrase seems to be the 
required place for the adverb. 
It is a good principle in writing that adverbs should 
be somewhat sparingly used. This is especially true 
of the intensive adverbs. The effect of very is quite as 
often weakening, as strengthening, to the force of a 
sentence. Vastly seems to have been abused in the 
eighteenth century somewhat as awfully was dur- 
ing the latter part of the nineteenth. 
Yet a writer’s skill is sometimes emphatically shown 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  218 Grammar and Its Reasons 
in the choice of an unusual and appropriate adverb. 
Thus Dickens speaks of two men at a funeral “who 
spoke as if they themselves were notoriously immortal.” 
The adverb may indeed be the most decorative and 
distinguishing of words. Ruskin somewhere tells us 
of the humility of great men who are nevertheless, 
“endlessly, foolishly, incredibly, merciful.” 
Sir Arthur Helps in describing a weighty sentence 
says that it should be so constructed that no other 
writer will ever be able to “say the like thing so choicely, 
tersely, mellifluously, and completely.”” Such an occa- 
sional prodigality of adverbs may give a fine touch to a 
piece of writing. Yet it is only the master’s hand that 
should venture to lay them on so thick.
-P-A-G-E-235
XLIit 
PREPOSITIONS 
The grammatical function of a preposition is to make the 
noun-word it governs into an adjunct-word.—Sweer. 
Some grammarians have given lists of adverbs, preposi- 
tions, and conjunctions, for what reason I know not, seeing 
that they have not attempted to give lists of the words of 
other parts of speech.—Cossert. (1818.) 
The small parts of speech are so fine as constantly to elude 
the critical attention of the writer, but so important as 
constantly to determine the critical effect of the sentence 
as a whole.—Arto Barzs. 
“TI was made a victim in a court of law of two preposi- 
tions and a conjunction. Oj}, concerning, and that were the 
abject instruments of my cruel extinction.” 
In the sentence “This is a good country to be born in, to 
live for, to die for,” the position of the preposition is the 
most genuine English.—Jornzs. 
“‘Inflectional decay was the chief tendency of the language 
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This increased 
the value of English prepositions.” 
In English the prepositions play so important a part that 
they are really of more weight than the scanty remains of 
ease inflection.—Swezer. 
Their importance rises in proportion as a nation begins 
to think more acutely and to express its thought more 
accurately.—M. ScHELE DE VERE. 
Prepositions were originally and for a long time 
219  
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 Grammar and Its Reasons * 
classed with conjunctions. There is a similarity be- 
tween the two parts of speech, yet a clear differentiation 
should be made. Conjunctions are primarily sentence 
connectives. Only a few conjunctions can connect 
words, and these only in co-ordinate relations. A 
preposition connects words, yet not in co-ordinate 
relations. It establishes a relation of dependence 
between its object and some other word, thus forming 
a phrase which may be either adjective or adverbial 
in character, according to the nature of the part of 
speech which is modified by the phrase, As one writer 
has said, “'The preposition puts a noun into relation 
with some other word in the sentence.” 
There is a prevalent idea that the name preposition 
was given to this class of words because they are placed 
before nouns. The word seems to have come, how- 
ever, from the fact that in Greek and Latin the pre- 
position was often compounded with a verb, being 
placed before it as a prefix. The same thing is some- 
times found in English, as in wndergo. 
There is a tradition that school children of a former 
generation had to commit to memory and recite verba- 
tim et seriatim the list of English prepositions. Modern 
schools certainly do not follow this plan, yet pupils 
ought to be familiar with the prepositions and able 
to recognize them quickly. 
Many of the prepositions are also used as adverbs, 
as, “He came in.” Sometimes a prepositional adverb 
seems to bea part of the verb itself, as, “to be addicted 
to,” “to laugh at.” Some grammarians speak of
-P-A-G-E-237
  Prepositions 221 
“detached prepositions,’’ as in the sentence “I don’t 
know what he is thinking of.” Such prepositions 
have very nearly an adverbial use; yet of, though often 
a “detached preposition,”’ can never be a true adverb. 
An ancient rhetoric contains the rule that “A pre- 
position is not a good word to end a sentence with.” 
Doubtless in some cases there is a better place for the 
preposition than at the end of the sentence. Yet the 
English idiom allows and sometimes prefers this posi- 
tion for the preposition. “What did you ask for? ” 
“Whom did you come with?” are stronger sentences 
than “For what did you ask?” and “With whom did 
you come?” 
Some of the prepositions were originally participles, 
as, respecting, excepting, ete. There is also a large 
class of prepositional phrase forms, that are usually 
treated by grammarians as one word, although they 
will admit of closer analysis. Such are “in regard to,” 
“according to,” “in spite of,” “by means of,” and 
“for the sake of.” In “for the sake of peace,” peace is 
grammatically the object of of, but logically it is the 
object of the whole phrase, which is therefore often 
treated together as one preposition. 
While the object of a preposition is usually a noun 
or pronoun, a phrase or a clause may stand in this 
relation, as, “till after the shower,” “Listen to what I 
say.” An adjective or an adverb may also take the 
place of a noun as the object of a preposition, as, “till 
then,” “on high.” 
The time honored rule that “Prepositions govern 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  222 Grammar and Its Reasons 
the objective case’’ applies of course only to the seven 
words in English that have an objective case form. 
But these are so frequently used that the rule is of con- 
siderable importance. 
The English student should distinguish carefully be- 
tween related prepositions, such as, between and among, 
at and in before names of places, in and into, etc. 
Much care should be taken in choosing appropriate 
prepositions to convey subtle shades of meaning, or to 
follow certain words. A choice of prepositions must 
often be made in such phrases as, “agree with or to,” 
“adapted to or for,” “a taste of or for,” “correspond 
with or to,” “reconcile with or to,” and many others. 
In making such choices one has to rely mainly on his 
sense of idiom. One who is not thoroughly familiar 
with English usage often makes mistakes in such 
points. 
The use of for before an infinitive, and of than as a 
preposition before a relative pronoun, was common 
in the earlier English, as, “for to see,” “Beelzebub, 
than whom,” etc., but both of these usages have dis- 
appeared from modern English. 
Owing to the various and subtle shades of meaning 
which prepositions take, they are less intelligible to 
foreigners than most words, and are therefore less 
likely to be adopted into other languages. The exist- 
ence of similar prepositions is therefore a good evidence 
of affinity in languages. 
The preposition has had an important part to play 
in the transformation of English from a highly in-
-P-A-G-E-239
Prepositions 223 
flected language to a “logical” one. It is largely by 
the exchange of case-endings for prepositions that this 
has been done. This change has introduced some 
new possibilites of error in sentence arrangements and 
has also added new elements of freedom and of strength 
to the language. But a considerable degree of training 
and skill is needed to bring fully into play the subtle 
powers and possibilities of the English prepositions.

XLIV 
CONJUNCTIONS 
“In the order of nature, the conjunction comes last among 
the parts of speech. It proclaims the maturity of the simple 
sentence. The need of conjunctions did not come until the 
language had advanced to form compound sentences.” 
Only a few conjunctions connect words, and these only 
on an equality.—CarpEnrer. 
We have a feeling of and, a feeling of ij,.a feeling of but, 
and a feeling of by, just as really as a feeling of blue or a 
feeling of cold.—James. 
If we take the word conjunction in its widest sense we may 
say that and, and that (in, I know that it is true), represent 
the extremes of abstract co-ordination and abstract sub- 
ordination.—S weer. 
The gouty joints of whereuntos and wherebys, thereofs, and 
therewiths. -SHAFTESBURY. 
A good literary workman is at once to be known by his 
handling of connectives.—Arto Barzs. 
“The conjunction shows the thought connection and so 
makes thinking clear and accurate.” 
It is in the right use of these (7. e., the connecting terms 
or particles), that the brevity and clearness of good style 
must chiefly consist.—Locxkr. 
As regards composition generally the greatest refine- 
ments and the most common inaccuracies attend the four 
simple conjunctions—and, or, but, i7.—Bain. 
The primary office of a conjunction is to connect 
224
-P-A-G-E-241
Conjunctions 225 
sentences (7. ¢. clauses), but since clauses, especially if 
co-ordinate, can be abridged by the omission of like 
words, a very few of the conjunctions have extended 
their use to connect also words and phrases in the 
same construction, as, “ Will you take cheese or butter ?”” 
Almost all such connected expressions may be thought 
of as elliptical forms of clauses; but the most important 
conjunction and (alone among the connectives) can 
connect words or phrases in like relations even when 
there is no ellipsis that can be supplied, as, “John and 
Mary are a happy couple,” “Pompey and Caesar were 
both great men.” We may say therefore, that con- 
junctions connect clauses, and occasionally also, words 
or phrases in like constructions. 
There are many words which add the conjunctive 
office to some other function. Such are the relative 
pronouns, relative adjectives, relative adverbs, and 
many other adverbs which are not relative. 
Conjunctions are of two main classes, co-ordinate 
and subordinate. A co-ordinate conjunction connects 
clauses or parts of clauses of equal rank. These con- 
nected clauses may be either principal clauses or sub- 
ordinate clauses holding the same relationship in the 
sentence. 
The most common co-ordinate conjunctions are 
and, but, and or. The name copulative is applied to 
and and a few others of similar meaning. But repre- 
sents another small group called disjunctive or adversa- 
tive conjunctions; and or represents a small group called 
alternative conjunctions. These, however, are dis-

tinctions of meaning rather than of grammatical re- 
lation. For is a co-ordinate conjunction with causal 
signification as, “He will do it; for this is already agreed 
upon.” For is to be distinguished from because, 
which is subordinate and adverbial in character. For 
represents the objective relations of events, while 
because shows the subjective or thought relations be- 
tween them. 
A subordinate conjunction connects a subordinate 
clause to the principal one; or, more strictly, to that 
word in the principal clause which the subordinate 
clause limits. A subordinate conjunction performs 
for a subordinate clause a like office to that which the 
preposition does for its object; as may be seen from 
the fact that the same word may often be used either 
as preposition or subordinate conjunction without 
change of its essential character, as, “ He studied until 
noon,” “He studied until the teacher came.” Yet a 
conjunction connects without governing, while a prepo- 
sition governs the case form of an adjunct pronoun. 
Subordinate conjunctions are divided according to 
meaning into those of cause, purpose, comparison, etc., 
but the classification is neither very definite nor com- 
plete. Most of the subordinate conjunctions sustain 
also more or less of an adverbial relation. The con- 
junction that is called the substantive conjunction, 
because its chief use is to introduce a noun clause, as, 
“That you have wronged me doth appear in this,” “I 
hope that you will do it.” That may also be used to 
connect an adverbial clause after so or such.
-P-A-G-E-243
Conjunctions 227 
There are a few phrases that are occasionally used 
as conjunctions. Common examples are, “as if,” 
“provided that,” “in order that,” etc. They are 
really elliptical in character, however. 
There are many connective words that are used in 
pairs, the first pointing out that the connection is to 
follow. Such are both—and, either—or, not only— 
but also, ete. ‘These are called correlative words (i. e.: 
having a mutual relation) and are usually co-ordinate in 
character; but i/—yet, and a few other pairs, belong 
with the subordinate connectives. One of the two 
correlative words is frequently an adverb, as, “It was 
so hard that he gave it up.” 
And, also and or, among the co -ordinate conjunctions, 
and ij, though and a few others among subordinate 
ones, are never anything except conjunctions. But, 
for, since, and a good many others may be used as 
prepositions as well. Some of the conjunctions (es- 
pecially the co-ordinate ones) are sometimes used to 
introduce sentences, thus forming “ prepared” sentences 
in distinction from the unprepared, as, 
“And seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain.” 
Or sometimes introduces formally a long paragraph, 
which is thus logically (though not grammatically) con- 
nected with what goes before. Also, too, and therefore 
are frequently used in a similar way. 
A few adverbs, as still, nevertheless, however, are 
similarly used to connect logically though not formally, 
and these are sometimes called “half-conjunctions.”  
-P-A-G-E-244
  228 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Certain cumbrous words sometimes used are made 
by compounding where and there with many of the 
prepositions, as, whereupon, wherein, thereafter, there- 
unto. Those compounded with where are generally 
used as connectives, those with there as adverbs. 
Although called by’ Campbell “the luggage of par- 
ticles,” these words have a convenient use in forming 
complex sentences. 
The conjunctions are really few in number. About 
twenty-three words have been enumerated that per- 
form most of the conjunctive offices in English. But 
although so few and so loosely related to the rest of the 
sentence, conjunctions form an important element of 
speech. Coleridge once wrote, “A clear reasoner and 
a good writer in a general way may be known by his 
pertinent use of connectives.”

INTERJECTIONS 
The miserable refuge of the speechless.—Horne Tooxn, 
Primary undifferentiated language material; word proto- 
plasm, so to speak.—Davenport AND EMERSON. 
A stepping-stone to true language, both by suggesting 
the idea of articulate speech and by supplying a large number 
if not the entire number of actual roots—Max Mu.uzr. 
“An interjection implies a meaning which it would take 
a whole grammatical sentence to expound, and it may be 
regarded as the rudiment of such a sentence.” 
In conversation they serve to help the timid, to give 
time to the unready, to keep up a pleasant semblance of 
familiarity, and, in a word, to grease the wheels of talk.— 
Dean Axrorp. 
The idle word is not quite free from blame.—Dzan Atrorp. 
Sacred Interpreter of human thought 
How few respect or use thee as they ought.—Cowrzr. 
Cry ‘‘Hola” to thy tongue, I prythee, 
It curvets unseasonably.—As You Lixs Ir. 
The interjection stands among the parts of speech, 
but it is not really of them. It is, rather, “a whole 
speech, characterized by a maximum of brevity and 
a minimum of clearness.” In this respect it is closely 
allied to the gesture, which usually gives its accom- 
panying force to the ejaculation. Emotion is quick. 
There is no .time to “fit a phrase.” Yet speech will 
229
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 Grammar and Its Reasons 
break out when the feelings are stirred; hence, the 
need of interjections. 
Although the interjection is said to be independent in 
its sentence relations, other words may depend upon it. 
In, “O that I had wings,” the clause “that I had 
wings”’ is the object of a verb of wishing implied in 
0. 
The interjection was probably the primary form of 
articulation. The ones first used may have had an 
imitative quality, such as we now recognize in pop, 
bang, ding-dong, and rub-a-dub. The best command 
of the rhetoric of the interjection, perhaps, belongs 
to children, and also to savages whose peculiar grunts 
contain whole areas of condensed thought. With 
civilization the use of interjections diminishes, and 
their character changes. It has been said that the 
degree of a man’s civilization can be pretty fairly 
judged by the expletives which he uses. There are 
many interjections which have a historic meaning, 
and some are truly philological in character. There are 
whole classes of literature, however, which have no 
interjections. One will look in vain for them in treatises 
on mathematics, physical science or history, though 
these, as has been well said, “are often provocative 
of interjections.” Fiction and oratory make large use 
of them; and for the poet the interjection is an im- 
portant part of his stock in trade. 
In conversation these ejaculatory words serve some 
ends, and we could scarcely do without them. They 
fill up the gaps. They put the listener into touch
-P-A-G-E-247
Interjections 231 
with the talker. Even in writing they sometimes give 
balance to a halting sentence. Well before a reply 
shows that one does not wholly repudiate the ques- 
tion even if he cannot fully answer it. Why rallies 
the questioner, or puts a doubtful aspect upon the 
subject discussed. But useful as these and other inter- 
jections are, they are much overworked by nervous or 
unthinking minds. 
The early grammarians, wiser perhaps than we, 
did not rank the interjection as a part of speech. It 
seems to have slipped into the list at a later era, partly 
perhaps to preserve the historic number eight after the 
article had been crowded out, and other “parts’’ had 
become differently divided. 
Some of the ancient grammarians classed the inter- 
jection with the adverb, and there is indeed a cognate 
relation between the two. Verily, truly, and other 
modal adverbs have a strong affinity with interjections. 
Yes and no, though sometimes called independent 
adverbs, are more truly interjections. Each of them 
implies a statement, as, “It is so,” or “It is not so,” “TI 
will do it,” or “I will not do it.” Many of the com- 
monest interjections are adverbs put to an independent 
use, as, Here, There, Now, Why, Well. 
But there are other interjections that are closely 
related to the verb, such as, Hold, Hush, Halt, Whoa, 
Gee, Haw, See here, Look out. 
There are many vapid and meaningless expletives, 
while others are fraught with tremendous meaning. 
Colorless words often grow into interjections and
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 Grammar and Its Reasons 
become current, but afterwards sink out of sight again. 
Changes come faster in the interjectional vocabulary 
than in any other. There is also more local and in= 
dividual variation in this linguistic department than 
in others. 
There are old historic interjections long disused, 
which one often meets in reading the English classics 
and which may be found in. our dictionaries. Such 
are Marry, Gramercy, Zounds, and Well-a-way. La 
was a feeble expletive much in vogue among feminine 
fiction characters of the eighteenth century. There 
are several religious responses, having a wide-spread 
and important use, that are classed with the interjec- 
tions. Such are All Hail, the Selah of the Hebrew 
Psalms, Hallelujah and its Greek form Alleluia. Such 
also is the great response of prayerful souls through 
all the ages, Amen. 
Many of the literary interjections are ‘pda heard 
in conversation. Such are Lo, Alas, Behold, Hail, 
Huzza, Heigh-ho. There are others, however, having 
a dictionary recognition, that are in common use 
orally as well, such as Whew, Hurrah, Pooh, and 
Indeed. 
One often makes a limited number of interjections 
cover a wide range of meanings. In Oh we may find 
surprise, joy, pain, disgust, pity, and a whole gamut of 
emotions, according as the tone of voice may reveal 
or circumstances decree. 
There is a tendency of late to obliterate the spelling 
distinction between the emotional interjection oh,
-P-A-G-E-249
  Interjections 233 
and the vocative O that comes to us from the Latin 
and is almost like a prefix to the following name, as, 
“O Lord.” But there is some gain to the language 
in retaining the distinction, which we hope may not 
be wholly obliterated. 
It is a lamentable fact that interjections show an 
almost universal tendency to verge towards the expres- 
sions of profanity. Many of the historic interjections 
were originally mild oaths. Thus Zouwnds is a con- 
traction of “God’s wounds,” and “Marry” came into 
use through the practice of swearing by the Virgin 
Mary. 
The word of prayer, or praise, or imprecation, used 
in the highest emotional states, is easily drawn upon 
and degraded to express less intense or lower emotions. 
People whose high moral sense or refined taste would 
never sink to the use of “Billingsgate’’ often use ex- 
pressions that are everywhere current, but are essentially 
forms of prayer or cursing that have become more or 
less disguised by conventional spelling or the cloak 
of a foreign synonym. 
Such modern expressions as “Gracious,” “Good 
Lord,” “Good Heavens,” “Diable,” “Mon Dieu,” 
show how extensively the appellations of God and 
of his Satanic Majesty have entered into the ejacula- 
tory language. Among this class of words and phrases, 
there are some, such as “Good-bye,” and “Adieu,” 
which are rich and important contributions to the 
English tongue. Others also have achieved an inno- 
cent and respectable position, for even the most refined
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 Grammar and Its Reasons 
and modest mind is scarcely repelled by such a modified 
form of language as reveals itself in “O dear” 
«(O Dieu).” 
One should not underestimate the sin and vulgarity 
of profane expressions. Yet there is less real difference 
perhaps, between the “profane swearing” of the saloon, 
and the conventionalized expletives of the “Club,” 
than may at first appear. 
The use of interjections is a difficult but important 
subject for the teacher to deal with. To prevent the 
use of expletives would be impossible. But to curb 
the tendency, to direct it, to help the children to under- 
stand the real nature of the interjections they use, and 
to cultivate their taste so that only refined and ex. 
pressive ones shall find utterance from their lips is one 
of the important parts of the language teaching of 
American schools.
-P-A-G-E-251
XLVI 
SENTENCES AND CLAUSES 
A sentence is a completely worded statement, inquiry, or 
command,—Lewis’s Apptinp GRAMMAR. 
“Every group of words having a verb is grammatically 
a sentence.” 
“‘A sentence is a word or group of words whose form 
makes us expect. it to express a full meaning. We say 
expect because it depends on the context whether or not 
any sentence expresses a complete meaning.” 
Exclamatory sentences are closely akin to interrogative 
and are usually placed in that class.—CarPENTER. 
The Ideal Sentence.—It should be powerful in its substan- 
tives, choice and discreet in its adjectives, nicely correct in 
its verbs. Withal, there must be a sense of felicity about 
it, declaring it to be the product of a happy moment, so that 
you feel that it will not happen again to that man who makes 
the sentence, nor to any other of the sons of men, to say 
the like thing so choicely, tersely, mellifluously, and com- 
pletely.—Sir Arruur Hexps. 
The sentence is the primary unit of language in form 
as well as in thought. Words and phrases can only 
be dealt with grammatically as parts of the sentence. 
A study of the general plan of the sentence is therefore 
necessary at the beginning of a course in grammar. 
Sentences are classified according to their general 
form and meaning into declarative, interrogative, 
imperative and exclamatory sentences. Thus: 
235
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 Grammar and Its Reasons 
You will do it.—Declarative. 
Will you do it?—Interrogative. 
Do it.—Imperative. 
How well you do it!—Exclamatory. 
The student of grammar needs to examine carefully 
the structural differences in these classes of sentences. 
Some writers on grammar omit the exclamatory 
sentence as a distinct type. Sentences in this form 
are rare. They also approach the interrogative in 
form, beginning with a word that is in its nature inter- 
rogative (how or what) though the word order differs 
from that of the usual interrogative sentence. Declara- 
tive, interrogative and imperative sentences that are 
short and emphatic are often logically exclamatory and 
are punctuated as such. 
There are various types of the assertive (or declara- 
tive) sentence determined chiefly by the character of 
the verb, as, 
The apple is a fruit.—Verb copulative. 
Dogs bark.—Verb intransitive. 
Bees make honey.—Verb transitive. 
Honey is made by the bees.—Verb passive. 
You. forget yourself.—Verb reflexive. 
It rains.—Verb impersonal. 
There are also negative sentences: 
Old form.—I like it not. 
Modern form.—I do not like it. 
Every group of words containing a verb and subject 
is by some grammarians called a sentence. But sen-
-P-A-G-E-253
Sentences and Clauses 237 
tences can be combined into complex and compound 
sentence-wholes, and it is convenient to have some 
other word than sentence for the smaller sentences 
within the larger sentence. The term clause, rather 
than sentence, is generally used to refer to a subject and 
predicate that forms one of the parts of a complex or a 
compound sentence. 
Clauses are either principal or subordinate, and 
subordinate clauses may be adjective, adverbial, or noun 
clauses according to their relation in the complex sen- 
tences to which they belong. 
A noun clause is usually connected by the substan- 
tive conjunction that. It may be: 
Subjective—That it should fail was inevitable. 
Objective.—I hope that he will come. 
Predicative.—The reply was that he had already written it. 
Appositive.—The wish that he may succeed is very general. 
A sentence may be only partly compound, as, “He is 
tall, but not strong.” “ John and not Mary, was there.” 
Sentences that are logically connected are often put 
together without'a conjunction, as, “ The grass is green, 
the sky is blue.” Some writers would put into several 
sentences what others would punctuate as one. A 
succession of such short and logically connected sen- 
tences is sometimes called a sequence. 
A clause (or sentence) is sometimes interjected as a 
parenthesis into another sentence, as, “I understand 
(and this view is confirmed by others) that the matter 
had already been decided by the action of the com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  238 Grammar and Its Reasons 
mittee.” The grammatical relationship of such an 
interjected sentence to the principal one is not always 
the same as the logical one. In the sentence, “He 
thinks, I believe, that the world belongs to him,” that 
which is really the principal sentence is logically the 
object of believe. 
In the evolution of language the order of sentence 
development seems to be as follows: 
First.—The isolated sentence.—He went away. 
Second.—Parallel sentences.—He went away. Iam sorry. 
Third.—The compound sentence.—He went away and I 
am sorry. 
Fourth.—The complex sentence.—I am sorry that he 
went away. 
The development of a child’s language usually 
follows this order of sentence growth. 
Although the sentence as a whole must be studied at 
the beginning of the grammar course the clauses of a 
complex sentence cannot be fully discussed until the 
study of the parts of speech has thrown some light upon 
the relations of these larger component parts of sen- 
tences.

    PHRASES 
A large proportion of the elements of sentences are not 
single words, but combinations or groups of words.—GREEN’Ss 
EneuisH ANALYSIS. 
Each of the parts of speech has what we may call a power 
of extension; that is, it may consist of a group of words, 7. e., 
a phrase or a clause.—CARPENTER. 
A phrase is a combination of two or more words, not in- 
cluding a subject and predicate, having in a sentence the 
office or value of a single part of speech, and capable of 
being regarded and parsed as such.— WHITNEY. 
There is no good reason for giving special prominence to 
prepositional phrases over others.—Brown anp DeGarmo. 
A sentence can be broken up into as many phrases as there 
are groups of two or more words connected in meaning, 
which, taken together, perform the office of a part of speech. 
—Brown anp DeGarmo. 
Groups of words in sentences are often used to per- 
form the function of a single part of speech. When 
such a word group contains a subject and predicate 
it is a clause. When it has no verb within it, it is a 
phrase. Phrases are named from the part of speech 
whose office they hold, as noun phrases, adjective 
phrases, adverbial phrases, etc. 
Phrases are also called participial, infinitive, and 
239 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 «= Grammar and Its Reasons 
prepositional phrases according as the nucleus of the 
phrase is a participle, an infinitive, or a preposition 
and its object. A word of any part of speech, however, 
as a noun, adjective or adverb, to which grammatical 
modifiers may be joined, can become the basis of a 
phrase. 
Verbs, participles, and infinitives have many phrase 
forms, which are usually treated as wholes, but admit 
of further analysis. Prepositional and conjunctive 
phrases, such as, “provided that,” “for the sake of,” 
“in order that,” are usually elliptical and capable of 
analysis, though it is often better to treat them as wholes. 
A phrase can be very long and very complex in 
structure. Participial and infinitive phrase construc- 
tions are often of great length. (See Chapter 48, on 
“Abridged Clauses.’’) 
Phrases, as well as clauses, are sometimes inter- 
jected into sentences with which they have a logical 
rather than a grammatical connection, as, “ Your ad- 
mission, to speak very frankly, goes further than you 
intended.” 
A knowledge of the parts of speech is necessary before 
the student can deal intelligently with the word groups 
in sentences. Yet the analysis of a given sentence 
should deal first with these larger wholes and after- 
wards with the individual words.
-P-A-G-E-257
XLVI 
ABRIDGED CLAUSES 
“The absolute or independent use of the participle is one 
of those constructions which, while entirely well supported 
by authority yet seems somewhat out of harmony with the 
idiomatic spirit of the English tongue. Probably all writers 
of standing sometimes employ this form.” 
The grammarian does not make rules to teach us to speak 
and write correctly, but he calls attention to the method 
employed by writers and speakers whose methods of writing 
and speaking are approved by the educated section of the 
community. When we speak of an expression as ungram- 
matical or ‘“‘bad grammar,’”’ we simply mean that educated 
people do not approve of its employment.—Swezet. 
There are many participial and infinitive expressions 
which may be thought of as abridged clauses, and 
which may contain certain subjective, copulative, 
and attributive elements, as, 
For him to be absent is unusual; 7. ¢., That he should be 
absent, etc. 
He being absent, I took his place; i. ¢., Because he was 
absent, etc. 
These are not strictly clauses, but are often called 
infinitive and participial clauses. 
In an infinitive construction of this kind, the pronouns 
used will be in the objective case; hence the rule of the 
old grammars, “The subject of an infinitive is in the 
241  
-P-A-G-E-258
242 Grammar and Its Reasons 
objective case.” Yet there is always a verb, or a 
preposition (usually for) that governs this case-form. 
In the sentence, “I want him to come,” him is called 
the subject of to come, but its case-form is determined 
by its relation to the preceding verb. Whenever an 
objective attribute is an infinitive the expression falls 
into this class of constructions. 
An abridged adverbial clause usually takes the par- 
ticipial form and is called an absolute phrase or 
the absolute construction. Thus, “He being ab- 
sent,” is an abridgment of the adverbial clause “Be- 
cause he was absent.” When such absolute phrases 
occur in Latin they require that their parts should 
agree with each other in the ablative case. In Greek 
the genitive is the absolute case. In modern English 
the nominative case is used in these constructions, as, 
“Tt being he, I went to meet him.” In Old English, 
however, the dative was used as the absolute case. 
About the middle of the fourteenth century the 
dative began to be replaced by the nominative; or 
perhaps, as the dative case-endings disappeared, the 
form began to be felt as the nominative case of the 
noun, and the pronoun finally fell into the same case 
by analogy. Yet there are instances in later literature 
where this old dative (now represented by the objective 
form of the pronoun) occurs. Milton often uses par- 
ticipial expressions preserving the old dative form, 
or possibly imitating the Latin construction, as, 
“Us dispossessed, the seat of the Deity supreme 
He trusted to have seized.”
-P-A-G-E-259
  Abridged Clauses 243 
“Dagon hath presumed, me overthrown, 
To enter lists with God.” 
Such expressions are historically correct, though 
modern English is decidedly in favor of the nominative 
as the absolute case. 
Absolute participial phrases, though grammatically 
allowable, do not seem entirely in harmony with the 
English language and are less used than formerly, as 
writers generally prefer a more direct form of expression. 
There is a certain class of nearly independent parti- 
cipial phrases which like modal adverbs limit an entire 
statement, as, 
Generally speaking, the figurative use of a word is derived 
from its sense.—JaMEs. 
Judging from many hereditary anecdotes this peculiar 
temper was hardly less than a monomania.—HawrTHoRNE. 
The very chin, modestly speaking, was as long as my whole 
face.—AppDISON. 
For the abridgment of a substantive clause either a 
participial or an infinitive form may be used. 
Thus: 
“T never thought that it was he,’’ may become 
“T never thought of its being he,” or, 
“T never thought it to be him.” 
These substantive abridged clauses usually follow 
such verbs as wish, think, desire, perceive, etc. 
Not every substantive clause can be thus abridged, 
however. Thus, “I said that I would do it’’ cannot 
take either the infinitive or the participial abridged 
form.
-P-A-G-E-260
244 Grammar and Its Reasons 
For the abridgment of an objective clause after think 
and a few other verbs the participle is generally used 
and the subject term is’put into the possessive thus 
limiting the participle, as, 
I never thought of his going so soon (i. e., that he would 
gO so soon.) 
I did not think of its being he (i. ¢., that it was he.) 
In such sentences modern English generally uses 
the nominative absolute for the case form of an attri- 
butive pronoun, though the vacillation of case form 
in such sentences as, “It is I,” “It is me,” leaves an 
opportunity for variation here, especially in the first 
person, as, “ He did not think of its being me.” 
(See Chapter 54 on “Case Shiftings of Pronouns.”) 
Instead of the possessive case before the participle, 
however, the objective is occasionally used, and the 
participle then takes the adjective relation, as, 
Would you mind me asking you a few questions?— 
STEVENSON. 
Instead of the better form, 
“Would you mind my asking,” ete. 
In the abridgment of substantive clauses after most 
verbs the infinitive form is used. Even with the verb 
think, this is sometimes the case, as, 
I wish him to be my messenger (i. e., that he should be 
my messenger.) 
I did not think it to be him (i. ¢., that it was he.) 
In such sentences the attributive pronoun after the 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  Abridged Clauses 245 
infinitive takes the objective case because of its relation 
to the subject of the infinitive. A question is some- 
times asked as to the case of an attributive noun or 
pronoun following the copula to be when there is no 
subject of the infinitive, as, 
To be a lawyer is his desire, * 
He wishes to be a lawyer. 
Would the genius of the English language use a nomi- 
native for the absolute case in such a sentence, or would 
the association with the infinitive suggest the objective 
as the case to be used? The question is purely specu- 
lative, however, as there are no instances in English 
literature where a pronoun is used in such a connection. 
Indeed it seems impossible to imagine an instance in 
which a well written sentence could contain such a 
pronoun; or if we could conceive of such a use, it would 
be wholly problematical what view the writer would 
take of. the necessary relations. 
In other words, it is possible to raise grammatical 
questions whose discussion would have neither practical 
nor educative value. In the light of common sense, 
the use of a sentence involving such a hazy grammatical 
question would be a blemish on rhetorical style, and 
contrary to the genius of the English language.
-P-A-G-E-262

WORD ORDER 
Languages tend on the whole more and more to utilize 
word order for grammatical purposes.—JESPERSEN. 
Inflectional forms serve for a device for clearness in lan- 
guages careless of word order.—Davenrort AND EMERSON. 
When the relations between words are shown by word 
order, concord is not of much use, and consequently is re- 
ducible to very narrow limits in such a language as English. 
Conversely, in a highly inflected language with a highly 
developed system of concord, such as Latin, fixed word 
order is not required to show the grammatical relations of 
words.—SWEET. 
The mere fact that in English the pupil is obliged to get 
the meaning of the sentence from the order of the words 
and from a logical insight into the contents of the thought, 
with little or no aid from the form of the words—this fact 
makes the study of English grammar a more abstract and 
difficult and disciplinary subject than the grammar of any 
highly inflected speech.—Banrsour. 
The freedom of arrangement required in poetry makes it 
somewhat superior to prose as a means of expelling from a 
pupil’s mind the delusion that word order is a safe guide to 
grammatical construction.—Harper anp BurGzss. 
The substitution of word order for flexions means a vic- 
tory of spiritual over material agencies. —JESPERSEN. 
246
-P-A-G-E-263
  Word Order 247 
We have in mind an established order, the “regular pat- 
tern of thought,” and also a psychological order, a con- 
scious arrangement to give effect.—KxELLNER. 
The rigidity of English word order is often much exag- 
gerated; it is hardly rigid at all—Harrnr anp Burazss. 
The change of English from an inflected to a non- 
inflected language has had many subtle effects upon 
the language as a means of expression. It has relieved 
us of the burden of learning many forms and has given 
us large freedom in the logical relationship of words. 
It has made it possible for a word to hold several rela- 
tionships at once, and thus has added new elements 
of force to expression. But it has also made certain 
requirements more stringent. Word order has acquired 
grammatical significance, and so has become more 
specific and obligatory. 
Old English with its large elements of concord had 
very wide freedom in the order of its words. There 
was little possibility of a word’s getting detached in 
thought from its proper relations, since the form showed 
so emphatically its logical connections. In the changes 
that occurred in the twelfth and thirteenth century, 
inflections dropped away, and word order became more 
fixed. Either the establishment of word order made 
agreements needless so that they fell away, or else 
the inflections having decayed the word order of neces- 
sity became more rigid, or more probably still, each 
process was in some degree the effect of the other. 
The parts of speech and their functions are largely 
dependent upon the position that the words occupy.
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Almost any change in word order is likely to give 
some change in syntactical relations. Thus when 
several adjectives limit the same noun the one is placed 
nearest which expresses the most essential and perma- 
nent quality. This adjective limits the noun alone, 
while each preceding adjective limits the noun as modi- 
fied. Thus in the phrase, “a poor old colored woman”’ 
age is more inherent than poverty but less so than race 
relations. So “colored” is made to limit “woman”’ 
alone, while “old’’ and “poor’’ limit the whole phrase 
following. The question of the order to be observed 
when a cardinal and an ordinal numeral are connected 
in the same phrase (three first, or first three) is of this 
nature. The order depends on the question as to which 
of the two numerals expresses the most inherent and 
primary idea. (See Chapter 29.) 
Adverbs are perhaps the words that show most lia- 
bility to lose their right connections, though pronouns 
and participles also have a way of escaping from their 
normal positions in the sentence. 
Most that we know of word order in English comes 
to us unconsciously and it is difficult to put matters so 
subtle into the form of rules. Indeed, many grammars 
are entirely silent on the important subject of word 
order. The general principle, “Keep the parts that 
are related near together,”’ is the chief one that can be 
consciously applied in making English sentences. 
Yet early in the grammar course the attention of the 
student should be definitely given to the natural order 
of parts in assertive and interrogative sentences. Ex-
-P-A-G-E-265
  Word Order 249 
amples of common inverted types should also be ex- 
amined and the advantages gained by the inversion 
should be estimated. These advantages are some- 
times grammatical, making the relation of the parts 
more evident, and sometimes purely rhetorical, as in 
“Great is Diana of the Ephesians.” The rhetoric 
of a sentence (even more than its grammatical relations) 
is very dependent upon questions of word order. Even 
when clearness and grammatical correctness are both 
present, a change of word order will often give force 
and elegance to a halting sentence. 
Poetry uses inversion far more than prose. Even the 
verb in poetry is sometimes allowed to begin an assertive 
sentence, as, 
Rose a nurse of ninety years, 
Took his child upon her knee.—Trnnyson. 
Putting an adverb at the beginning of a sentence is a 
common way of causing an inversion in word order, 
as, 
“Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight.” 
The poetical device of placing an adjective after its 
noun, as, “pastures green,” “tresses brown,” merely 
for metrical effect, is frowned upon by some critics. 
Yet all will agree that a greater freedom of word order 
in poetry than is admissible in prose, is not only a proper 
“poetical license’? but a true means of giving poetic 
beauty. To make a prose paraphrase of a piece of 
poetry may not be of great value as an exercise in com- 
position, but as a study of word order (by comparison 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
250 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of the word order of prose and poetry) it has some 
genuine value. 
Inversion is rare in a dependent clause of English. 
It sometimes occurs, however, as in the expression, 
“as much as in me lies.” In Old English, though its 
word order was on the whole much more free than 
ours, there were a few restrictions that the modern 
language has freed itself from. The verb of a dependent 
sentence was usually deferred to the end, as in German, 
thus demanding a more strained attention. The 
word order that was introduced by French influence 
after the Conquest was of a lighter and brighter kind. 
The study of the word order of specific sentences, 
the comparison of word order in different classes of 
sentences, and the noting of changes in meaning made 
by changes in arrangement, form an important part of 
grammatical study. Also a comparison of the word 
order of the English sentence with the unlike idioms 
of German or with the freer word order of Latin, is 
a good way to throw added light upon the characteristics 
of the English tongue.

GOOD USAGE 
The rules of grammar have no value except as statements 
of fact. Whatever is in general use in a language is for that 
reason grammatically correct.—Swzet. 
However language may be abused, the usage which gives 
law to speech is still that usage which is founded on the com- 
mon sense of mankind.—Gooip Brown. 
The genius of a language unconsciously presiding over 
all its transfigurations and conducting them to a definite 
issue, will have been a far truer, far safer, guide than the 
artificial wit, however subtle, of any single man or any 
association of men.—TRENcH. 
The English which we ought to speak and write derives 
its authority, not from the dicta of grammarians and lexi- 
cographers, but from the slowly evolved will of the nation. 
—WEILSH. 
We are not of those who are the obedient slaves of re- 
lentless grammatical rules, but those whose usage, barring 
slips, makes or mends them.—N. Y. Independent. 
Everyone knows that the ultimate standard for 
correctness in language is good usage, but where 
is the authority that shall tell us beyond a doubt what 
good usage is? 
The French have their “Academie,” founded in 
1635, and consisting of “Forty Immortals,” elected 
for life. This body meets twice a week at the Palace 
251
-P-A-G-E-268
  252 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Mazarin in Paris, and constitutes “the highest authority 
on everything appertaining to the niceties of the French 
language, to grammar, rhetoric, and poetry, and the 
publication of the French classics.” 
The literary journals of England and America have 
sometimes called upon their readers to vote for the 
“Forty Immortals’’ of these respective nations. It is 
a harmless and interesting pastime. But the distin- 
guished writers thus voted for do not “stay elected.” 
Literary reputations rise and fall. And where is the 
literary journal whose clientage has authentic power 
and prestige to pronounce upon the proper membership 
of such a tribunal ? 
We are often told—and*in general it must be agreed— 
that only “present, reputable, and national usage’? 
can be considered good. But even in these forceful 
adjectives there is some debatable territory. 
When a poet uses for poetic reasons an archaic 
word, it is often better poetic usage than the modern 
term would be. It may be said, however, that the 
occasional use of archaic terms is really “present”’ 
usage in the field of poetry. 
When a Shakespeare, or a Tennyson, or a Kipling 
introduces a word or phrase not hitherto received 
into good linguistic society, but which seems appro- 
priate to the occasion, the new term is very likely 
to become at once “reputable.” Even a lesser genius 
has sometimes the happy inspiration to match an 
occasion with a word or phrase that proves its right 
to live.
-P-A-G-E-269
  
Good Usage 253 
Yet the practice of one writer, or of seveyal writers, 
or of one or more periodicals, however high they may 
stand in the world’s estimation, cannot alone make 
an expression “reputable.” Nor is the wide-spread 
use of a term a sure guarantee of its respectability. 
“You often hear it” is no proof that it is in good repute. 
There must be something in the word or phrase itself 
which is fitted to call out the uniform, or nearly uniform, 
support of those whom the world deems worthy to decide 
such questions, or else its linguistic standing rests on an 
insecure basis. 
But it is the question of national usage that gives 
the largest room for variations of opinion. There is 
many a word or phrase of limited territorial extension 
that is in good repute in the region where it is “at 
home.” Perhaps it is a language growth, and will 
finally conquer the whole field. It is not always needful 
to frown upon a word because some parts of the national 
domain have not yet heard of it. 
Or, if universality of acceptance be requisite, why 
stop with the national idea? The niceties of the 
English tongue would seem to be a more promising 
field for an Anglo-American alliance than is to be 
found along political lines. Language has a larger 
empire than any single nation. This is more fully 
recognized than it used to be. English hypercriti- 
cisms of “ American English’’ and American super-sensi- 
tiveness as to English opinions regarding the same, 
are being outgrown together. America and England 
are both in the jury box in deciding the standards  
-P-A-G-E-270
  254 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of the mother tongue which is our common heritage. 
But if America—then the same is true of each part 
of our large domain—the South and the North, the 
West as well as the East. And if England and America 
—then also Australia, and the new English-speaking 
peoples that are growing up in Africa and Asia and 
the islands of the Pacific. 
In other words, language movements defy terri- 
torial limits, and if a language has within itself the 
qualifications that tend to make it a world language, 
there cannot be any sectional or national authority 
that has power to judge all its usages. 
But while we have no authoritative tribunal that 
can settle all our linguistic questions, we believe that 
we are better off than the French because of this fact. 
It is not an authority for good usage that an educated 
person needs, but a knowledge of the principles that 
guide usage, and the habit of mind that will enable 
him to be both a leader and a follower in his relation 
to the usages of his generation. 
Under such conditions there will be both sectional 
and individual differences in usage, which help to 
make life interesting, and are not to be wholly de- 
precated. Yet, after all, it is only in colloquial English 
that large differences occur, and it is not with these 
that English grammar is chiefly concerned. The 
principles of English grammar are derived by the 
inductive study of the usages found in the standard 
literary works that are written in the English tongue. 
These standard works are read wherever the language 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  Good Usage : 255 
is spoken, and give a degree of unity to the language of 
all localities. ‘The usages of literary English change 
with the generations, but the changes are slowly evolved, 
and are the result of the combined thought of the whole 
mass of educated people. The literary use of a language 
has a somewhat stable, as well as nearly universal, 
basis, and is, in general, “present, reputable, and 
¢nternational”’ in character.

IDIOMS 
Idiom is the dress and fashion of experience.—Prccn’s 
Awnecpotss oF THE EneuisH Laneuace. 
“Isolated forms that are survivals sometimes go against 
our grammatical sense.” 
The idiom of language admits only of being observed. 
Let no man ask why.—Burrman. 
“Idiom is not seen in full force so long as we can recon- 
cile it to grammatical structure. There is something arbi- 
trary and masterful about true idiom.” 
There is much forcible English that cannot be parsed.— 
ALLEN. 
Many of the puzzles of word-parsing arise from asking of 
English what it does not give, or rather has given up.— 
Joynes. 
The attempt to adjust the words of an idiom to grammati- 
cal rules would be an attempt to rob our tongue of some of 
its choicest elements of life and strength.—T owNsEND. 
If any rules stand in the way, so much the worse for the 
rule.-—Branpur Matruews. 
The peculiar mould in which a language shapes 
itself is the idiom of the language. Every language has 
many peculiarities that belong to itself alone. The 
idioms show the modes of thought that belong to the 
people that speak the language. 
256
-P-A-G-E-273
Idioms 257 
Idiom in its largest sense, includes all special mean- 
ings given to groups of words, as, “How do you do?” 
and “Look out;’’ also variation from the general rules. 
of agreement, as, “It is they.” All special cases of 
diction and of the government, arrangement or agree- 
ment of words, in which one language differs from 
others, belong to its idiomatic structure. Thus the 
placing of the past participle of a verb phrase at the 
end of the sentence is an important idiom of the German 
tongue. 
“The sun rises at six’’ is idiomatic English, while. 
the French idiom is a phrase that translated literally 
would be “at six hours of the morning.’’ The use 
of the present tense with a future meaning, as, “He is 
going home to-morrow” is also an English idiom. 
The sentence, “How long have you been here?’ 
though it seems simple and natural to the native En- 
glishman, is nevertheless an idiom. “How long are 
you here?” is the form which the sentence takes in 
general grammar. Natives of other countries tell us 
that it seems to them absurd to say “have been”’ while 
one is still here. Idiomatic expressions cannot be 
classified by analogy but must be studied one by one. 
Every teacher of a foreign language knows well the 
mongrel kind of expression called “ translation English,’* 
which retains some of the peculiarities of one language 
while using the words of another. It requires a far- 
reaching knowledge of both languages to transfer 
perfectly the thought of a well-written production of 
one to an equally well-written production of the other.  
-P-A-G-E-274
  258 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Indeed it is a question whether it ever can be perfectly 
transferred, as the thought itself is shaped partly by 
the mode of its expression. Even the most successful 
translation seldom has as vigorous a style as the original. 
The foreigner who has learned to speak “correct 
English”’ seldom gets above a certain “bookishness”’ 
in his speech which he himself is probably unaware of; 
and owing to our long-continued national isolation 
it is doubtless still more rare for an American to acquire 
perfectly the idiomatic command of a foreign tongue. 
An illustration of the difficulty which one finds in an 
attempt to express himself in a foreign idiom, may be 
given by certain quotations taken from examination 
papers of the Porto Rican teachers who during the 
summer of 1904 studied at Harvard and Cornell Uni- 
versities : 
“We not talk English often, not can.” 
“We like stay very much.” 
“Columbus fell over his knees to tell his downfall to Isa- 
bella.” 
‘Isabel is six years old and is therefore on time to attend 
school.” 
“Tf Jefferson don’t would make other important thing 
in his public life, this notable work have would being enough 
to make him live in the hearts of the American people.” 
But in his efforts to translate, a foreigner sometimes 
gets a more conscious knowledge of the idiom of the 
new language than the native possesses who has un- 
consciously been using the correct idiom all his life. 
The scholar needs not only to be able to speak and
-P-A-G-E-275
  Idioms 259 
write his native language correctly, but to know why 
he uses the idioms which he does; to be able also to test 
them, to interpret them to others. He also needs to 
gain from his knowledge of language a knowledge of 
his own forms of thinking and so to be led into more 
logical and cogent lines of thought itself. 
There are many idioms of local extension within a 
given language. Those which are true idioms (and 
not merely expressions loose in syntax) are of real 
value and give flavor to life and to literature. American 
idioms are different from those heard in England, 
while in different parts of America there are great 
differences in the colloquial idioms in current use. + 
Idiom is morefundamental than dialect and far less 
localand temporary. Colloquial language is more idio- 
matic than the language of literature. Thusin spoken 
language, contractions of the negative verb phrases, as, 
“T can’t,” “You don’t,” ete., are constantly used, and 
are preferred to the unabridged form, but this idiom is 
excluded for the most part from the language of books. 
Slang expressions, if they are of such a nature as to 
be permanently valuable, may finally become idiomatic, 
but it takes time for them to become approved and to 
grow into idiom. A good idiom is old, while good 
similes and metaphors in language should be new. 
Most of the slang that is invented is not permanently 
valuable and never grows into idiom. There are also 
various peculiar expressions which we hear and see, 
that are not at all idiomatic, but are the result of loose 
and illogical thinking, Even the native needs a critical 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
err rr re 
260 Grammar and Its Reasons 
taste and acumen to be able to distinguish always 
between the idiom of a language which is its strength, 
and the confusions of loose thought or doubtful syntax 
which are the weakness of linguistic expression. 
Y Unusual expressions, if they are true idioms, are 
™~ forcible and give vivacity and flavor to life and to lit- 
erature. But while all true local and colloquial idioms 
are of interest, it is the idioms of literary English 
that grammar is chiefly concerned with. 
In dealing with the general traits of English we have 
been dealing with its idiomatic character. But there 
are also many special words and phrases having an 
idiomatic character that engage the attention of the 
philologist. 
Among idiomatic English phrases may be named, 
““many a man,” “a great many,” “this many years,” 
“the more the merrier,” “what with this, what with 
that,” ‘by and bye,”’ “ever and anon,”’ “so to speak,” 
“of course,” “to be sure,” “the house is building.” 
The older English had many idiomatic phrases not 
now in use, as, “the tane and the tother,” “go to 
now,’’ “good your ladyship,’’ “dost hear?,” ‘have 
at you.” “Knock me at the gate,” and “He went 
strange countries for to see,” also contain idioms. 
Among idioms of syntax may be named, the omis- 
sion of the conjunction éhat in substantive clauses, as, 
“T knew it was he;’’ the use of the double or cumulative 
genitive, as, “This child of ours;” the retained object 
in the passive voice with the indirect object made the 
subject, as, “I was shown some pictures;” and the use
-P-A-G-E-277
Idioms 261 
of the sign to to take the place of the whole infinitive, 
as, “I asked him not to.” 
One markedly peculiar class of idiomatic English 
phrases is represented by “had rather,” “had as lief,” 
with others similarly formed. (See Chapter 53.) 
In dealing with the more peculiar idioms of English, 
many grammarians make it their effort to explain away 
all deviations from general grammar and so make 
it appear that the peculiar phrase is “not much of an 
idiom”’ after all. “How shall I dispose of this?” is 
the common grammatical formula. But to explain 
away, is not to explain. And why should we “dispose 
of” our idioms? We ought indeed to try to interpret 
them. The student of language should face firmly, 
and deal frankly with, these expressions that puzzle 
the grammarians. Every irregularity arises by devia- 
tion from some regularity, and historic grammar will 
frequently do much to elucidate idiomatic mysteries. 
But since one of the most common causes of irregu- 
larity is confusion of thought, the peculiar phrase should 
be called on to “ show its credentials.”” We should draw 
as clear a line as possible between true idiom, and loose 
syntax, or slang which has overstepped right bounds. 
The proper grammatical way to treat an idiom then, 
is to test it—to accept it if it is good, and reject it if of 
doubtful value; also to explain its history if historical 
grammar reveals such an explanation. 
Then, if it really belongs to the genius of the language 
the way to dispose of it is to call it by its true name 
adiom, and let it go.

IMPERSONAL VERBS AND SENTENCES 
An abundance of impersonal verbs is a mark of an early 
stage in language, denoting that a speaker has not yet ar- 
rived so far in development as to trace his own actions and 
feelings to his own agency.—AxssortT. 
The business of the grammarians and the verbal critics 
is not to make language or prescribe rules, but more modestly 
to record usage, and to discover the principles which may 
underlie the incessant development of our common speech. 
—Branper Marruews. 
In every language there are certain idiomatic forms 
that express in a general way facts that are not explicitly 
referred to any specific agency. Such sentences are 
called impersonal sentences, and the verbs that belong 
to such sentences are impersonal verbs. Thus, rains, 
hails and snows are impersonal or unipersonal verbs. 
The earlier English abounded in impersonal sen- 
tences which had a somewhat different form from 
those used at present. The impersonal verb was 
usually accompanied by a dative construction, as, 
Me remembereth of the day of doom.—Cuavcrr. 
“Whether lyketh you better,” sayd Merlyn, “the sword 
or the scabbard?” ‘Me lyketh better the sword,” sayd 
another.—Matory, 
Many of the old impersonals were subjunctive ir 
262
-P-A-G-E-279
  
Impersonal Verbs and Sentences 263 
their verb forms, as, “Me were liever,’’ “him hadde 
rather.” Out of these certain peculiar modern idioms 
have developed. (See Chapter 53.) 
As the dative usually preceded the verb it came to be 
thought of in time as a kind of psychological subject. 
A small remnant of these old datives is found in the 
words “methinks” and “methought’”’ which though 
archaic are still in recognized poetical use. A collo- 
quial expression sometimes vulgarly used, “Thinks I 
to myself,” however, has no grammatical nor any other 
authority. 
Later the pronoun 7 came into use as a kind of ex- 
pletive subject for these impersonal verbs, and the 
dative object then followed the verb. Thus, “Me 
remembereth”’ became “It remembereth me.” 
Examples: 
It yearns me not.—SHAKESPEARE. 
It would pity any living eye.—SHakEsPraRE. 
T'll dispose them as it likes me best.—Martowz. 
It recks me not.—Mitton. 
The dative construction in these sentences is clearly 
allied to the dative object sometimes found in sentences 
not impersonal in form, as, “Knock me at the gate.” 
And from such sentences one may pass by easy grada- 
tions to the indirect objects in ordinary modern use, as, 
Dance me no dance. 
Saddle me the horse, 
Bring me the book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  264 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Modern English has replaced most of the old imper- 
sonals with other idioms or with personal forms. Thus, 
“Loth him was” has become “He was loth.” The 
old subjunctives with had are now “I had rather,” 
“He had as lief,”’ “You had better,” etc. Instead of 
“Tf it pleases you,” we now say “If you please,” or 
simply, “Please, do so and so.” 
But although the old impersonal usage is mostly 
obsolete, writers occasionally revive it for poetic effect. 
Thus Walter Scott wrote: 
When in Salamanca’s cave 
Him listed his magic wand to wave, 
The bells would ring in Notre Dame. 
Lay or THE Last MinsTREL. 
Modern English retains in common use a few im- 
personal forms though without all the marks of the 
ancient impersonals. 
Among these are “What ails you?” “It pains me,” 
and most common of all, those describing the weather, 
as, “It is cold,” “It freezes.” Modern impersonals 
usually have it for the expletive subject, and this is 
therefore called the impersonal pronoun. It has a simi- 
lar expletive use when the real subject is an infinitive or 
a clause following the verb, as, 
It is pleasant to walk on the beach, 
It is too bad that he should do so. 
There has a similar expletive use, as, 
There is a pleasure in the pathless wood. 
He would go if there were need.
-P-A-G-E-281
  Impersonal Verbs and Sentences 265 
All of these sentences are therefore allied to the 
impersonal sentences of the older English. 
Another important class of modern sentences having 
a kind of impersonal character includes those in which 
It stands as the subject, while the sentence attribute 
may have any person, number or gender, as, “It is I,” 
“Tt is they,” “It is the boys.” The early form of these 
sentences had a different verb agreement, as, “Tt am I,” 
or “TI am it,” which is similar to the German of to-day. 
“Tch bin es.” Thus Wycliffe and Tyndale wrote in 
their Scripture translations, “I it am.” 
Although the nominative is the recognized case for 
the attribute in such sentences, Dean Alford and some 
other writers have contended for the propriety of the 
objective form, especially in colloquial usage and in 
the first person, as, “It is me.” ‘These sentences have 
an analogy to such expressions as, “C’est moi’’ in 
French and other languages. 
A few indefinite expressions in modern colloquial 
English have a kind of impersonal meaning. Thus 
the French “On dit’? (one says) has its counterpart 
in the English “They say.” In modern usage, how- 
ever, Mrs. Grundy is sometimes made the scapegoat 
for irresponsible gossip. A similar lack of personality 
sometimes occurs in the use of you, as “ He was so thin 
that you could almost look through him.” This 
impersonal and familiar use of you is common in con- 
versation, and a few writers have made use of it in 
literary writings, though it could easily become a 
mannerism.

HAD RATHER, HAD BETTER, HAD AS LIEF 
Idioms have their kindred as well as men.—JEsPERSEN. 
Idioms not understood, like men in the same situation, 
are sure to be misunderstood.—LounsBury. 
One of the most peculiar of all English idioms is the 
use of had with rather, better, as lief, etc., as, “I had 
rather do it than not.” Such phrases seem to con- 
tradiet the logic of language, and have given great 
trouble to writers on grammar. 
It is perhaps enough for practical purposes to know 
that all these phrases have the sanction of good and 
abundant literary usage from an early period, and 
that their history can be traced through natural pro- 
cesses of language from original language forms. Yet 
some knowledge of this history, as well as of certain 
peculiar considerations that are influencing present 
usage in regard to each specific phrase, is also desirable 
for the advanced student of English grammar. 
In an article entitled The Story of an Idiom, in 
Harper’s Maguzine for June, 1904, Professor Louns- 
bury of Yale Unixersity has traced in a very compre- 
hensive way the history of these phrases, acknowledging 
however, as an aid in this work, the investigations of 
Dr. Fitzedward Hall nearly a quarter of a century ago. 
It is from this article by Professor Lounsbury that 
267
-P-A-G-E-284
  268 Grammar and Its Reasons 
much of the material has been gathered for the following 
brief discussion of the history and nature of this class of 
idiomatic phrases. 
The first traces of this idiom are found in subjunctive 
impersonal sentences containing the comparative of lief 
or liev (meaning dear) and a dative personal pronoun, 
as, “Me were liefer,”’ 7. e.: “It would be dearer to me.” 
Similar sentences were formed with the subjunctive of, 
have which meant to hold, as, “ Him hadde it liefer,”’, 
tz. e.: “It would be held dearer to him.” Later the 
dative of the pronoun was-changed for the nominative. 
These impersonals with liefer or liever are often met 
with in the writings of Chaucer, as, 
Liefer I had to dien on a knife 
Than thee offendé, trué dearé wife. 
For about two hundred years “had liefer’’ was in 
full sway, but in the fifteenth century a rival phrase 
“had rather’? sprang up, conveying the same idea 
with a different word. This grew rapidly and finally 
drove “had liefer’’ almost entirely out of use. In 
Shakespeare’s plays “had rather”’ occurs many times, 
but “had liefer’? not at all. “Had liefer’’ was not 
wholly extinguished, however, and Tennyson revives 
the old phrase in his poem Enid. 
Far liever had I gird his harness on him 
A descendant of the phrase is in full colloquial use 
to-day in the positive form “had as lief.” 
In the phrase “had rather” which thus supplanted
-P-A-G-E-285
Had Rather, Had Better, Had as Lief 269 
“had liefer,” rather seems to have been thought of as an 
adjective as liefer had been. It being the comparative 
of rathe, meaning early, or quick, the phrase “had 
rather” carried the meaning of “hold it quicker’’ or 
“more desirable.” Thus the Bible verse “I had 
rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,” 
may be paraphrased as, “I hold it preferable to be a 
doorkeeper,”’ etc. 
For a long time the phrase was accepted naturally 
without close analysis. But in the eighteenth century, 
when English began to be studied critically, it was 
inevitable that so peculiar a phrase as “had rather’’ 
should attract attention, and become the object of 
criticism from those who did not understand it. The 
corresponding phrase “had better’? was also in occa- 
sional use, and had been from an early period, having 
been first used in the original form “me were better’’— 
a form which was never in use with rather. But “had 
better’? had never come into extensive use, and was 
now rarely heard. “Had liefer’’ also had gone out of 
use, so the force of the grammarian’s attack fell only 
on “had rather.” In all other connections rather had 
come to have an adverbial instead of an adjective use, 
so that the incongruity of the phrase was sensibly felt. 
Dr. Johnson in his dictionary of 1755 defines “to have 
rather’’ as “to desire in preference,” but adds, “This 
is, I think, a barbarous expression of late intrusion 
into our language, for which it is better to say will 
rather.” In Sheridan’s grammar, a few years after- 
wards this thought is repeated.
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 Grammar and. Iis Reasons 
Lowth’s grammar of 1762 adds to this misinterpre- 
tation of the idiom by advancing the theory that the 
proper form was “I would rather,” that this had been 
contracted into “I’d rather’? and then erroneously 
expanded into “I had rather.” This ingenious ety- 
mology, for which there is no justification in fact, be- 
came for a long time the accepted solution. It was 
adopted into the early editions of Webster’s Dictionary, 
and may be found in some of the nineteenth century 
grammars. Recent dictionaries and grammars, how- 
ever, have corrected this misinterpretation, giving the 
true origin and history of the phrase, and have endorsed 
it as a true English idiom that has had an accepted 
‘literary use from an early period. 
| But while “had rather” has been reinstated among 
the approved literary idioms of English, it is undeniable 
that the use of “had rather’’—both the literary and 
especially the colloquial use—has declined in modern 
times in favor of the newer phrase “would rather.” 
Although “would rather” lacks the ancient prestige 
that belongs to “had rather,”’ it does say, even if a little 
imperfectly, what it is intended to say. While in “had 
rather” both words are used in a somewhat archaic 
sense and relationship, in “would rather’ the verb 
is used in its modern sense, and rather sustains its usual 
adverbial relation. But in spite of the growth of 
“would rather”’ it is not likely that “had rather’’ will 
share the fate of “had liefer’’ and be abandoned as a 
true idiom of the English tongue. 
Although “had liefer,” “had rather’? and “had
-P-A-G-E-287
  
Had Rather, Had Better, Had as Lief = 271 
better”’ were originally formed after the same pattern of 
speech, the history and present status of “had rather” 
and “had better’’ are by no means alike. “Had 
better’’ developed very slowly into general use, but 
in recent years it has become very common and it is 
more frequent than “had rather’ in modern English 
literature. The phrase also has positive and superla- 
tive forms, “had as good,” and “had best.” But 
while “had rather’’ has in a sense accommodated itself 
to the modern sense of idiom by suggesting for rather 
a quasi-adverbial character, this cannot so easily be 
done for good, better and best. 
The analogy of “would rather” has also inaugurated 
the doubtful phrase “would better’? which is now oc- 
casionally met with in speech and in newspaper English. 
In the words of Professor Lounsbury, “This is as 
ungrammatical as it is unidiomatic. What the one 
who employs it really says . . . is that he would 
do so and so better than something else. What he is 
trying to say is that it would be better for him to do so 
aud so instead of something else.” 
In the phrases “had rather” and “had better,”’ the 
tendency of both rather and better to suggest an ad- 
verbial instead of an adjective use, has also led to the 
employment of other adverbs in the same connection, 
and “had sooner,’’ “had as soon,” “had as well,” are 
sometimes heard. The propriety of these may be 
questioned, but as to the original consistency of “had 
rather’? and “had better’? with the true idioms of 
English, there is no question.

CASE SHIFTINGS OF PRONOUNS* 
“It is me,” a stereotyped, idiomatic, colloquial form used 
by the masses, and shunned by the fastidious. “‘It is I,’ 
more literary and formal, used by those with strong feeling 
for grammatical consistency.—CaRPENTER. 
It is only the influence of ignorant grammarians that pre- 
vents such phrases as “It is me” from being adopted into 
the written language and acknowledged in the grammars.— 
Sweet. : 
“Tt is me*’ is an expression which every one uses. Gram- 
marians (of the smaller order) protest; schoolmasters (of the 
lower kind) prohibit and chastise; but English men, women, 
and children go on saying it, and will go on saying it as long 
as the English language is spoken. Duan ALrorp. 
“Tt seems as if the last refuge of ‘whom’ is the construc- 
tion ‘than whom’ where it had originally nothing to do.” 
Every error in grammar might be established if frequent 
usage or the occasional slips of good authors are to be ac- 
cepted as final authority.—Marsuauu T. BicELow. 
When the English language gets in my way it doesn’t 
stand a chance.—Hrnry Warp Brrcunr. 
The case distinctions of the pronouns are often 
obscure or variable. Grammatical laws have always 
seemed to have a weak hold on the case forms of the   
*JESPERSEN’S Progress in Language (London, 1894) has 
an important chapter on Case-Shiftings. 
272
-P-A-G-E-289
  Case Shiftings of Pronouns 273 
pronouns, so that a mere point of euphony has some- 
times been held to justify variation. These case 
shiftings are of great interest to philologists and there 
is much divergence of opinion as to what should be the 
allowed liberty in this field. 
We have already noticed (See Chapter 52 on “Im- 
personal Sentences’) the somewhat widespread use 
of the expression, “It is me.” It is allied to the old 
impersonal sentences containing datives, and also has 
an analogy to certain expressions in other languages, as 
the French “C’est moi,” where the nominative form 
je is never used, In America the nominative form, 
“Tt is I,” has been generally approved as the literary 
form, but the objective is frequent in colloquial usage 
and is approved by some grammarians as correct. 
This form of construction is less frequent in the third 
person than in the first and second, though sometimes 
heard. 
Dean Alford, however, who contends strongly for 
the correctness of “It is me,” thinks the same construc- 
tian should be extended to the other pronouns as well. 
But regarding the Scripture expression “It is I, be not 
afraid,” he says: “This shows us why the nominative 
should be sometimes used. 'The majesty of the speaker 
and his purpose of reassuring his disciples . . . point 
out to us the case in which it would be proper 
for the nominative and not the accusative to be used.” 
As a grammatical argument, however,, this may not 
seem wholly convincing. 
In commenting on the difference in this usage among 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
274 Grammar and Its Reasons 
the three persons Dr. Latham, in his History of the 
English Language, points out that “me is not the 
proper, but only the adopted accusative of I, being 
in fact a distinct and independent form of the personal 
pronoun.” He argues therefore that “me and ye 
may be called indifferent forms, nominative as much as 
accusative and accusative as much as nominative. 
Him and her on the other hand are not indifferent. 
The m and r are respectively the signs of other cases 
than the nominative.” 
Perhaps, however, phonetic influence is in a measure 
the reason why pronouns of the first and second per- 
sons are more free than those of the third person to use 
their accusative forms in these predicate constructions. 
The forms me, and thee, are thus brought into har- 
monious relation with we, ye, he, and she, thus making 
more orderly set of phrases for this predicate relation. 
In the line, 
“Be thou me, impetuous one.” 
found in Shelley’s Ode to the West Wind, the use of 
me gives a desirable poetic euphony, which the nomi- 
native case could not give. 
In “Fare thee well,” thee is sometimes thought of 
as a subject, although the older and fuller form was 
“may it fare thee well.” It bears a resemblance, 
moreover, to “Haste thee,” “Stay thee,” “Awake 
thee,” “Hear thee,” used by Shakespeare and 
other writers. In such sentences thee was not perhaps 
i
-P-A-G-E-291
  Case Shiftings of Pronouns 275 
originally thought of as the subject of the imperative, 
but as a reflexive object or dative. 
There are many cases in literature, however, where 
thee is used for thou, as, 
Scotland and thee did in each other live-—DrypeEn. 
*Tis better thee without than he within.—Macseru. 
The Quaker dialect has emphasized this tendency 
to make thee a colorless form by such expressions as, 
“Did thee say thee wanted to go?” 
When a pronoun is not in close proximity to its 
governing word the case sense seems difficult to carry, 
and writers have often ignored the true relation, as, 
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.—SuaxesPrarn. 
Let you and I cry quits.—Txos. Hueuss. 
But such lapses as these on the part of writers are not 
to be justified. 
In exclamations the objective is often used, as, 
“Dear me!” “Oh me miserable!’’ Yet in address the 
nominative is the usual form as, “Oh unhappy thou!’? 
“Thou blessed One!’? For an unattached pronoun 
(as in the reply to questions) colloquial idiom often uses 
the objective, as, “ Who goes there?” “Me.” This 
may be thought of, however, as an abbreviation of the 
colloquial “It is me.” 
But and save have sometimes been followed by the 
nominative as though they were conjunctions rather 
than prepositions, as,
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 Grammar and Its Reasons 
None save thou and thine I’ve sworn 
Shall be left upon the morn.—Byron. 
Away went Gilpin, who but he?—Cowprr. 
An elliptical expression following as usually takes the 
nominative as the obviously grammatical form of the 
pronoun, as, “ Who is so happy as I?” Yet there are 
instances in literature where the objective is used with 
good effect, as, 
The nations not so blest as thee—Tsomson’s RULE 
Britannia. 
Yet oft in Holy Writ we see 
Even such weak minister as me 
May the oppressor bruise.—Sir Water Scorvt. 
The usage in the last instance does not seem to be a 
happy one, and was perhaps adopted by the poet 
chiefly for rhyming purposes. Yet the idea of a half- 
preposition seems sometimes to reside in as, giving a 
degree of justification for the objective form. 
Case shifting is especially common after than. The 
natural and approved case for an abridged comparative 
clause would seem to be the nominative, as, 
I have known much more highly instructed persons than 
he make inferences quite as crude.—Gxorex Exror. 
He seems mightier far than thou.—Byrron. 
A greater soldier than he.—Cuaucer. 
But literary usage is by no means uniform. Bishop 
Lowth in his grammar quotes many instances of the 
use of the accusative after than, as,
-P-A-G-E-293
  Case Shijtings of Pronouns 277 
She fancies herself better than you And me.—THacKERY. 
She should be two inches shorter than me.—Tro.uopx. 
A fool’s wrath is heavier than them all.—Bis.n. 
On the other hand, in 
My soul hates nothing more than he.—As You Lixz It. 
the elliptical construction seems to require that the 
objective rather than the nominative should have been 
used. 
The explanations given to these varied case forms after 
than seem nearly as uncertain as the usage itself. 
Whether the feeling that prompts the variation rests 
in a shifting character of the case form itself or in a 
wavering sense of the character of than (as preposition 
or conjunction) may be doubted. Yet in the minds of 
most persons of strong grammatical sense than is 
usually a conjunction and the following pronoun would 
take the nominative case unless the objective is sub- 
stituted for reasons of euphony. The most anomalous 
of all these case variations is found perhaps in the 
phrase “than whom”’ found in classic writings, though 
there is no very good syntactical explanation of the 
phrase, as, 
Beelzebub, than whom, Satan except, no higher sat.— 
Miron. 
We have already seen (See Chapter 30, on Interrog- 
ative Pronouns) that there is a tendency to make who a 
colorless word as to case, especially when used inter-
-P-A-G-E-294
  278 Grammar and Its Reasons 
rogatively, and when the governing word is far removed, 
as, 
Who should I see in the lid of it [a snuffbox] but the Doc- 
tor?—Appison. 
“Who,” I exclaimed, ‘“‘can we consult but Miss P.?”— 
Mrs. Humpurey Warp. 
Perhaps one reason for the loss of case in such sen- 
tences as, “Who are you speaking of ?”’ is that who 
is felt to be in a sense the logical subject, as if the sen- 
tence were, “ Who is it that you are speaking of ? ” 
There are many instances in literature where who 
seems to be used objectively, as, 
Tell who loves who.—Drrpzn. 
Tl tell you who Time ambles withall, who Time trots 
withall, who Time gallops withall, and who he stands still 
withall.— SHAKESPEARE. 
This ignoring of case form is sometimes extended to 
the relative use of who. Schmidt’s Lexicon of Quota- 
tions from Shakespeare gives fifteen instances of the 
interrogative and twelve of the relative use of who 
in objective relations. It is to be noted, however, 
that the early editions of Shakespeare have who in many 
cases where the later ones have whom. The influence 
of schoolmasters is here shown. There are also in- 
stances in literature where what may be called a super- 
grammatical sense has attracted whom into relations 
where it was not required, as, 
Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?—Bistz.
-P-A-G-E-295
  
Case Shiftings of Pronouns 279 
While case variations are very common in literature, 
colloquial variations are‘carried much farther still. 
Some of the dialects used in England show such 
expressions as, “Is that him? No. It’s no him; it’s 
just me.” 
The following couplet is said to be taken from a 
Hampshire churchyard: 
“Him shall never come again to we 
But us shall surely go one day to he.” 
Cowper uses this colloquialism with humorous effect: 
“You shall ride on horseback after we.” 
To sum up this discussion :— 
The English pronouns still have case forms, and 
the use of the wrong case form is perhaps one of the 
most conspicuous faults in grammatical usage that can 
be made. Yet in not a few expressions (more or less 
idiomatic) usage differs widely. The pronoun case 
forms are to some extent in a state of flux. It is the 
part of grammarians to be conservative in resisting 
changes that may be detrimental to the purity of the 
language. Yet there are limits beyond which it is 
useless for dogmatic criticism to go. One should keep 
one’s eyes open to the tendencies, and seek to under- 
stand the reasons for the variations, and then decide 
in a given case with discrimination as well as con- 
servatism, trying always to preserve whatever is worth 
preserving in the inflectional forms that are still left to 
the English tongue.

LV 
WORDS OF PECULIAR OR VARIED USES 
Not only does the same word serve now in one capacity 
and now in another, but also it constantly occurs that the 
characteristics of different parts of speech are manifested 
at one time by one word in its ordinary sense.—Davrenport 
AND EMERSON. 
The word it is the greatest troubler that I know of in 
language.—CosBBeErt. 
The instrument ever adapting itself to the uses which it 
is to subserve.—WHITNEY. 
There are a few words that are so often used in 
peculiar relations or are capable of taking so many 
different uses that they may well be made the subject 
of special grammatical examination. These are for 
the most part small indeclinable words of little special- 
ized meaning, and for this reason capable of filling 
grammatical gaps. 
A good exercise in grammar is to take a certain 
word and trace it through all its idiomatic uses, writing 
sentences that will illustrate all the uses to which the 
word can be put. 
One of these words is the neuter pronoun it, some- 
times called the indefinite or impersonal pronoun. A 
comprehensive study of the word would begin with its 
earlier form hit and trace also the gradual introduction 
280
-P-A-G-E-297
  Words of Peculiar or Varied Uses 281 
of its modern possessive form ts. To-day the poet 
still uses his where the philosopher says its. Some 
of the impersonal, expletive, and other uses of it have 
been already noticed. In the games of children 7 
has a wide-spread and peculiar use as a proper noun, 
as, “It is now my turn to be IT.” 
What is a word of very varied relationship. Its uses 
as pronoun and adjective, both in relative and interrog- 
ative relations should be illustrated; also its use as an 
interjection, as, “ What! do you really mean it?” 
Other idiomatic uses of what may be illustrated as 
follows: 
“He found a miscellaneous collection of shells, stones, 
chips, and what not.” 
“What though the day be lost, all is not lost,’’ 
“Tn building of chaises I tell you what,” 
“ What with this, what with that,” 
These expressions with what are usually very ellip- 
tical, and it is not always easy to see what the ellipsis has 
been. They may be recognized as current idioms 
of English, even when the history of the idiom is in a 
degree lost. 
Similar treatment may be given to as, which may 
be either conjunction or adverb, or both combined, and 
is occasionally used as a relative pronoun as, “Such as 
I have give I thee,” 7. e.: “ Those which I have,” ete. 
The correlative relations of as with such, same, so, 
etc., should be specially noticed, also the connection of
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 Grammar and Its Reasons 
as with certain stereotyped phrases, as for me, as yet, 
as far as I am able, ete. 
The important verbal form be may be either infinitive, 
subjunctive, imperative, or an auxiliary in a verbal 
phrase. As a finite verb be is now always subjunctive 
or imperative, but it formerly had an indicative use 
also, as, “Ye be righteous men.” In provincial dia- 
lect we still sometimes hear this ancient indicative 
used by fural citizens as, “Be you going to plant pota- 
toes in that field?” 
The verbs do and have when used as principal verbs 
have a very definite and specialized meaning; but this 
is almost wholly lost in their auxiliary relations. Have 
especially shows the results of change in its use and 
meaning. Beginning as a principal verb with the idea 
of possession it loses this almost wholly when made an 
auxiliary for the perfect tense. The idea given by 
have in these phrases is that of completed state or 
action, rather than of possession. The original idea 
of have as possess, also included the idea of to hold and 
so to esteem, which gave rise to the idiom had rather. 
Have has gained also a modern meaning of obligation, 
giving rise to such expressions, as, “I have to do it.” 
“Have at thee!’’ illustrates another ancient idiom 
now out of use. 
As a subjunctive had frequently begins a sentence, as, 
“Had I the power, I would not use it.” 
Get as a principal verb means to obtain, as, “Get 
wisdom, get understanding,” but it is sometimes need- 
lessly used with have to denote possession, as, “I have
-P-A-G-E-299
Words of Peculiar or Varied Uses 283 
got five sisters,” “Have you got anything to say?” 
Get has acquired certain auxiliary uses in colloquial 
idiom that take the place of a kind of passive, as, “To 
get married,” “You must get excused.” Many con- 
ventional idiomatic phrases are also formed with get, as 
“get away,” “get off,” “get up,” “ get through,” etc. 
It-is obviously impossible in one brief chapter to 
name or illustrate all the peculiar uses of these variable 
words. Some of these have been noticed in other 
chapters of this book. Most of the indeclinable words 
of the language admit of varied uses. A few of the 
more prominent ones are here appended with illustra- 
tions of some of their special variations in relationship. 
All. All in all, at all, all but enough, all forlorn. 
*When ail is used adverbially with an adjective it is often 
connected by a hyphen, as, all-holy. There is a tendency in 
some quarters to make a closer compound of “all right” 
(i. e.: alright), as is done in already. 
But. He is but a man. 
None knew him but to love him. 
All but he (but him?) had fled. 
There was not a child but knew his lesson that 
day. 
Who knows but I may go too? 
The. The more, the merrier. 
Each. Each other. 
Else. How else can it be done? 
Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I givé it. 
Any one else.

  284 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Little. It matters little. 
Give me a little. 
tke. Like produces like. 
Like as a father pitieth his children, ete. 
She sings like a bird. 
The use of like as a conjunction, as ‘“‘he talks like he was 
crazy,” is in common colloquial use in certain regions, but 
isnot sustained by literary usage. Like was originally an 
adjective or adverb, and followed by to or unto, as “Like 
unto the Son of Man.” It has acquired the prepositional 
use (to being now omitted), and there seems to be no absolute 
and inherent reason why it should not acquire a conjunctive 
use as well. The extensive use of like in some sections 
seems to show that in many minds like expresses a more 
definite idea than is given by as if. Yet like will probably 
not be adopted at present as a conjunction, either for literary 
use or in the language of most educated people. 
Hard. Hard by. 
While. Worth while. 
While away the time. 
Over. Turn over.

The labor of searching out and collecting such 
idiomatic usages of various important words, is of 
great value to grammar students, arousing interest, 
and leading them into true lines of grammatical 
thinking. 
Most of the prepositions, conjunctions, modal ad- 
verbs, adjective pronouns, and in fact most of the 
indeclinable words of English have acquired idiomatic 
usages, and may be thus treated.

INTERMEDIATE GRAMMATICAL CON- 
STRUCTIONS 
Why, sir, it is easier to tell what it is not. . We all know 
what Light is not, but it is not easy to tell what it is— 
Boswe.t’s Lirr or JoHNSON. 
“There are blendings or hoverings of two constructions 
in all languages.” 
“We should not deny the reasonableness of classification, 
but insist on an inevitable indefiniteness in the boundaries 
between classes—just as in the prism no line can be drawn 
which separates one color from another.” 
In English the logical connections between words extend 
over a wider area than the purely grammatical ones.—Swexer. 
And if such things are too hard for children then grammar 
is too hard, for there neither is nor can be any grammar 
without them.—R. JoHNson’s GRAMMATICAL CONVERSA- 
TIONS. 
The indeterminate (or intermediate) form of English words 
and phrases, the same form fulfilling various relations, is 
one of the most striking characteristics in English.—Joyners. 
Grammatical relationships often shade into one 
another by almost imperceptible gradations. There 
are a few well defined types of construction. But there 
is also many a word or phrase which lacks some marks 
of the type with which it is usually classed, or which has 
certain additional marks belonging to another type. 
286
-P-A-G-E-303
  Intermediate Grammatical Constructions 287 
The verb be in its original sense is an attributive verb. 
In the sentence, “God is, and therefore we are,” it is 
an absolute verb of existence, and the sentence contains 
no other attribute. But in “I am ready,” it is a pure 
copula, and has no attributive idea) In “I am 
here,” or “ Where I am, there shall my people be,” the 
verb seems to have something of its original idea of 
existence combined with a hovering sense of a copula- 
tive office that is also found in it. In “I am here and 
ready,” here and ready are treated as co-ordinate 
terms after a copulative verb. 
It is manifest that there is much similarity in the 
predicate terms of, 
Thomas is late. 
Thomas is behind time. 
Thomas is absent. 
Thomas is not here. 
Thomas is in the garden. 
If the first of these be an adjective it is easy to find some 
adjective character in all the others. 
But it is equally true that a close analogy exists in the 
sentences, 
Thomas is in the garden. 
Thomas stands in the garden. 
Thomas works in the garden. 
and the adverbial element that is evident in the last 
sentence seems in some degree to be present in them all. 
In spite of their resemblance, however, there are 
real differences in sentences like these, and the study 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
288 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of these minute differences with a view to classification 
is a valuable exercise in grammar. 
The essential kinship of adjectives with adverbs 
manifest in these sentences is further shown by the fact 
that in poetic expression the adjective form usually 
takes the place of the adverbial, as, “Sleep soft, beloved, 
we sometimes say.” It is also illustrated in participial 
phrases expressing accompanying action, as, 
The boy walked on, throwing the ball. 
He came running. 
In an inflected language such participles would agree 
in case with the subject, yet it requires little discern- 
ment to see that the verb also is to some extent modified. 
In such sentences as, “He walks erect,” walks has 
been called a sort of half-copula, the word erect com- 
bining to some extent the relations of both attribute 
and adverbial modifier. 
Here and there and some other adverbs have occa- 
sionally a kind of adjective use, as, “the man here.” 
Yet we do not say, “the here man.” 
Few elements of a sentence are more distinct than the 
direct object and the adverbial modifier. Yet through 
various modifications of the indirect object the line of 
division seems sometimes almost obliterated. 
Verbs taking two objects (one meaning a person and 
the other a thing) sometimes sustain to each object 
a relationship so close that some grammarians (follow- 
ing the analogy of the Latin rule for two accusatives) 
would call both of the objects direct. But, laying aside
-P-A-G-E-305
  Intermediate Grammatical Constructions 289 
all thought of Latin accusatives and datives, can any 
one see in the purely logical relations of the English 
sentence, any good reason for finding two direct objects 
in, 
He taught me the phrase,

Another series of finely graded relationships may be 
found in the element variously known as objective 
predicate or attributive object. Who is able to dis- 
tinguish perfectly between this construction and that of 
indirect object in these sentences ? 
They thought him wise. 
They wished him to be wise,

They asked him a question. 
They asked of him a favor. 
They advised him to stay. 
They advised him that he should stay. 
But how shall the grammarian deal with these inter- 
mediate constructions? First, let him ask himself, 
What is the end to be gained by the classification of the 
logical relations of language? Is it that one may be- 
come an expert in “disposing of’’ all the words and 
phrases of literature? Then would grammar be a use- 
less study indeed! Too much of what is called gram- 
matical discussion is the belittling effort to explain away 
the intrinsic beauties of language. There is no small 
harm in trying to wrest good English to fit grammatical 
law. Who is so learned that he can claim to fully 
interpret all the idioms of our English tongue ? 
Syntax is based on logic, and in almost every sentence 
can be found one or more words bearing logical relations 
to several others at the same time. Inflected languages 
point out by inflectional terminations the most promi- 
nent of these relations. In English, a change in em- 
phasis or in the position of a single word may bring into 
prominence a new set of logical relations. Many a 
reader finds in a sentence elements of thought which the 
author of the sentence never conceived of. The varied 
relations of many English words show something of the 
nature of the language in this respect. In not a few 
cases more than one of the relations which a given word 
can hold will be present in the same phrase construction. 
The case shiftings of the pronouns also show the blend-
-P-A-G-E-307
Intermediate Grammatical Construction 291 
ing or hovering sense of two relations which many a 
word can carry. If this is found to a considerable 
extent in the pronoun relations, it is even more con- 
spicuous in the indeclinable words which are so easily 
changed from one part of speech to another and which 
form so large a part of the English speech. 
The student of English should examine carefully all 
the main types of grammatical relation, and then apply 
the tests of these types to the elements of various sen- 
tences. But let him not be disconcerted by the fact 
that many a word or phrase may lack some of the marks 
of the standard, or may combine the marks of several 
distinct types, or may be even capable of more than one 
sound interpretation or explanation. 
In the interpretation of these intermediate construc- 
tions, grammarians have always differed and will con- 
tinue to differ. But when a word holds multiplied re- 
lationships in a sentence it is not a matter of large 
consequence that different minds give somewhat vary- 
ing prominence to the several relations. 
To be many-sided in the study of grammar is a very 
different thing from being superficial. It is this very 
element of gradation in grammatical construction that 
makes English syntax a broadening subject if rightly 
pursued. The best result of syntactical study is clear- 
ness in thinking and the power of making logical dis- 
tinctions. If this be gained, it will act strongly, though 
indirectly, toward the increase of real language power.

  LVIT 
THE “SPLIT INFINITIVE’* 
The rule given by grammarians, ‘“‘T'o,the sign of the infini- 
tive, should never be separated from its verb,” should be 
modified by the clause,“‘ unless the meaning can be more 
clearly expressed by the insertion of the adverb.”—J. T. 
Baker, In Correct ENGLISH. 
The usage of the split infinitive has been violently con- 
tested by rhetoricians, yet has gained ground. In some 
eases it has the advantage of bringing an adverb into an 
emphatic position. In other cases it is very awkward.— 
CARPENTER. 
- “The split infinitive is a synthetical combination now 
establishing itself.” 
Every day is confirming the usage. It will stay because 
it was needed, and is unquestionably a clear gain in logical 
precision.—J oyNEs. 
This practice, examples of which go as far- back certainly 
as the fifteenth century, has now become quite common. 
In spite of the opposition it encounters there is little ques- 
tion that it will establish itself permanently in the language. 
—Lovunspury. 
The insertion of a modifying word between the sign 
to and the infinitive has been greatly censured by gram-   
*The ‘‘split infinitive” so-called, is comprehensively 
treated in an article by Professor Lounsbury, of Yale Uni- 
versity, entitled ‘“‘To and the Infinitive,” and published in 
Harper’s Magazine of April, 1904. 
292
-P-A-G-E-309
    The “Split Infinitive’ 293 
marians, on the ground that we must not divide a part 
of speech. 
‘But the history of the infinitive shows that to is in no 
sense an integral part of the infinitive. It was never 
used originally with the ordinary infinitive, but only 
with its dative (sometimes called its gerundial) form. 
The extension of the sign to to the common infinitive 
during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was itself at 
that timea language corruption. Many infinitiveforms 
(as in verb phrases) are still used without the sign to. 
Yet even if to were essential to the construction, the 
reason is by no means obvious why the verbal noun 
should be debarred from having a closely-joined modi- 
fier any more than any other noun that follows the pre- 
position fo, as in the phrases “to this end,” “to my 
father.” 
But a question of propriety is finally one of good 
usage. More than twenty years ago Dr. Fitzedward 
Hall showed conclusively that this separation of the 
infinitive from its sign has occasionally been made by 
good writers in all periods since about the fourteenth 
century. Beginning with Wycliffe who wrote “to never 
have received”’ and “to evermore trow,” he gives ex- 
amples of this use from a host of writers including 
Pecock, Sir John Fortescue, Tyndale, Sir Thomas 
Browne, Bentley, De Foe, Dr. Johnson, Burke, Southey, 
Coleridge, Lamb, De Quincy, Matthew Arnold, Charles 
Reade, Ruskin, Herbert Spencer, and Leslie Stephen. 
To Dr. Hall’s list could be added examples from Frank- 
lin, Byron, Keats, the Brownings, Lowell, Holmes, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
    294 Grammar and Its Reasons 
many other prominent English and American writers. 
Yet it must be conceded that in spite of this imposing 
array of names, the general practice of good writers 
until recently has been against this separation. For 
some of the writers quoted (as Dr. Johnson) a single 
example of its use is all that could probably be given. 
With others the use seems to been have confined to 
certain stereotyped phrases, as, “To far exceed”’ used 
by Burke. Although Browning and some others used 
such forms freely, Tennyson certainly abstained and 
perhaps never used one. 
Grammarians also have always been on the opposing 
side. Goold Brown indeed tells us that the right to 
place an adverb between the sign to and the infinitive 
must be conceded to poets, and quotes from Burns’s 
poem, “The Cotter’s Saturday Night,” the line, 
“Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride, ” 
where the meter of the verse may be thought to have 
imposed its form upon the construction. 
But usage which can lay restrictions upon language 
can also remove those restrictions. Within the last 
fifty years there has been a growing feeling that it is to 
the advantage of the language that the separation should 
sometimes be made. 
Thus Macaulay wrote in 1840, “In order fully to 
appreciate the character of Lord Holland it is necessary 
to go back into the history of his family.” But in 1843 
he brought out an edition of his essays carefully revised 
in which the phrase reads, “In order to fully appreciate
-P-A-G-E-311
  The “ Split Infinitive” 295 
the character,” etc. Macaulay was never careless in 
his modes of expression, and the change evidently 
shows his mature thought on this subject. 
The influence of modern journalism with its in- 
sistence on conciseness has been strongly in favor of 
this practice, as making often a much more compact 
phrase, or giving truer emphasis to the important idea, 
as in, 
To almost succeed is not enough. 
Indeed it would be difficult to find a substitute for the 
divided infinitive in such a phrase as, “to more than 
counterbalance.” There are certain conventional 
phrases, however, as “never-to-be forgotten,” in which 
the adverb is never inserted within the phrase. 
Some careful writers of to-day, who have been 
trained in the older school of literature, seldom use 
a “split infinitive,” or do so with hesitation only when 
there is clearly a gain in meaning or in energy. But 
probably the words of Professor Lounsbury are justifi- 
able, when he says: 
“Tt is clear that most of those who now refrain from 
the practice under discussion no longer do so instinct- 
ively as was once the case, but rather under compulsion. 
They refrain, not because they feel that it is unnatural 
or unidiomatic but because they have been told that it 
is improper. Artificial bulwarks of this sort will never 
hold back long a general movement of speech. . 
The time, indeed, will come when men will be unaware 
that there has ever been any dispute about the matter 
at all.”
-P-A-G-E-312

DISPUTED POINTS IN GRAMMAR 
Grammar appeals to reason as well as to authority, but 
to what extent it should do so has been matter of dispute.— 
Gootp Brown. 
“The same fact thought of in different ways may make 
perplexing differences in construction.” 
A fallacy,—that of two ways of expression one must be 
wrong.—Dran ALrorp. 
And for there is so great diversitie 
In English and in writing of our tong 
So pray I to God that none miswrite thee. 
—CHAUCER, 
“Baith did fight, 
And baith did win, 
And baith did rin awa’.” 
In the multiplicity of subjects that invite the world’s 
attention questions of grammatical propriety sometimes 
seem of minor importance. Many minds absorbed 
in other interests are content to believe that their own 
language does not differ greatly from that of the per- 
sons around them, and are willing to let alone the finer 
and more subtle questions of linguistic usage. 
Yet there is an increasing number of persons—edu- 
cators, literary men, and other cultivated minds— 
who prefer to be among those who mould language and 
decide in regard to its finer distinctions, rather than with 
296
-P-A-G-E-313
  Disputed Points in Grammar 207 
those who follow blindly rules that have been laid down 
for them by others. The vigorous discussion that 
arose over the number form of the verb, after the pub- 
lication of Kipling’s line, 
“The shouting and the tumult dies,” 
gave evidence that questions of grammatical propriety 
are of real interest to the modern world. 
Some of the questions that receive discussion among 
grammarians themselves deal with the grammatical 
relationships of words or phrases, and with the logical 
interpretation of accepted idioms. These are of in- 
terest to scholars, and the determining of these fur- 
nishes tests of construction that can be applied in de- 
ciding the correctness or incorrectness of other expres- 
sions of more doubtful propriety. Yet in these purely 
logical and scientific questions the general public is not 
greatly interested. 
But in questions of practical usage all intelligent 
minds have a personal interest. Among the expres- 
sions which one hears there are not a few that are mani- 
festly wrong, and require no discussion. There are 
provincialisms, solecisms, and vulgarisms, that must 
be condemned, but that scarcely need to be argued 
about. 
Among the grosser ones may be named impure 
contractions, as, don’t with a subject of the third person 
singular (He don’t), and the bastard form ain’t (I 
ain’t); them used as an adjective (them apples), those 
limiting kind or sort (those sort of people); real as an
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 Grammar and Its Reasons 
adverb (It is real pretty) and the interchange of the 
principal parts of strong verbs (He done it.) More 
subtle are the errors of “dangling participles,” unre- 
lated clauses, and the mistakes in arrangement and 
agreement that come from confusions of thought. A 
general knowledge of grammar ought usually to be a 
sufficient defense against such impurities as these. 
The questions of most interest relate to the tolera- 
tion or deliberate adoption of certain alleged improprie- 
ties under special conditions that seem to invite their use. 
For instance, the usual position of the word only is 
just before the word which it modifies, yet there are 
occasions when smoothness of style is gained by placing 
it in some other position, as, “I will only mention some 
of the best.” In spite of the protests of rigid gram- 
marians, the use of either in offering a choice among 
more than two objects seems to be increasing, and is , 
supported in a measure by some of the modern dic- 
tionaries. There is also some good reason for this 
allowance,as any implies plurality and is less definitive, 
while any one seems needlessly labored and formal. 
The comparative form is sometimes accorded to an 
adjective of absolute meaning, as, “more universal,” 
“less complete.” Again, where the stickler for, exact- 
ness would say “Come to see me,” the use of and (as, 
Come and see me) is often tolerated and is illustrated 
in the Scripture words of Jesus, “Come and see.” 
“And they came and saw where he dwelt.” And yet 
again, some would prefer the softened and less egoistic 
expression, “I do not think so,” where others may
-P-A-G-E-315
  Disputed Points in Grammar 299 
insist that the precise thought to be expressed is, “I 
think it is not so.” 
Shall we say “the three first”’ or “the first three’? ? 
Are the relative pronouns that, and who or which, 
to be sharply differentiated? The reciprocal pronoun 
phrases, each other and one another? 'The interjections 
O and oh? May we use whose as the possessive of 
which? And may we use the possessive case when 
possession is not indicated, as, “the waves’ roar ?”’ 
Has the interrogative who become indeterminate in 
case form? 
Shall me be used attributively (It is me) ? 
Has the subjunctive had its day? 
Has the “split infinitive’ established its claim to 
recognition ? 
How far may the general sense of a passage, rather 
than the strict number form of a subject or an antece- 
dent, determine the forms of agreement for verbs and 
pronouns ? 
All these and many other questions receive unlike 
answers at the hands of different speakers and writers 
and grammarians. 
The question of correctness in speech and writing is 
largely one of usage; but it is also one of good sense. 
The final arbiter in the decision for the man of educa- 
tion will be his own practical and cultivated judgment, 
which tries to weigh carefully all the facts and. prin- 
ciples of historic and comparative grammar as well as 
those of actual and widespread contemporaneous 
usage, and then chooses from among the available

‘forms of expression the one that gives with the greatest 
force and smoothness and the fewest objections the 
clearest utterance of his own inner thought. One 
should be conservative in this judgment, however, and 
not let down the bars to impurities of speech except 
for good and sufficient reasons.

CHANGES IN THE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH* 
English is not a dead language. It grows from roots in 
the lower soil.—N. Y. Independent. 
“A dead language neither gains nor loses. English still 
has the vital sap flowing.” 
The process of dropping inflections seems nearly to have 
reached its limit, yet there are two forms of the verb which 
we may even now see undergoing the process of reduction. 
—Sovuruworts. 
Every falling away of inflection is followed by some new 
synthetical formation, as the loss of mood ending brought 
in the auxiliaries —KELLNER. 
The evolution of language shows a progressive tendency 
from inseparable irregular conglomerations to freely and 
regularly combinable short elements.—JEsPERSEN. 
The English language is developing daily according to its 
needs. It is casting aside words and usages that are no 
longer satisfactory; it is adding new terms as new things 
are brought forward, and it is making new usages as con- 
venience suggests, to the neglect of the five-barred gates 
rigidly set up by our ancestors.—Branpir Marruews. 
These changes are the result of natural tendencies of the 
organs of speech and of the human mind, and are therefore 
to a great extent uniform in their operation.—Sw=er. 
*Some of the points mentioned in this and in the following 
chapter are referred to also in the preceding chapters under 
the appropriate heads. It seemed desirable, however, that 
there should be a brief summary of these important facts.

  802 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The vicissitudes of language are a thing over which our 
volitions rarely have a calculable control.—FirzppwarpD

It may not be possible to stem the tide, but certainly the 
efforts of teachers and text-books should be directed towards 
keeping the language free from conflicting and weakening 
forms of speech.—SouTHwortTH. 
The great innovator Time manages his innovations so 
dexterously, spreads them over such vast periods, and so 
gradually, that often while effecting the highest changes he 
seems to be effecting none at all.—Trencu. 
The fluidity of the English language is a fluidity not like 
that of a river, but rather like that of a glacier, the move- 
ment of which is noted by years or generations rather than 
by days.—N. Y. Independent. 
The universal law of change and progression applies 
to all forms of knowledge, and grammar is no exception. 
At first thought this may not seem to be the case. The 
tendency and effort of grammar is to fix the condition 
of the language by forbidding irregularities that pro- 
duce confusion. Thus the formulas of grammarians 
and the language of literature are much the same 
wherever English is spoken. It is the colloquial ex- 
pressions of uneducated people that show the most 
tendency to fluctuation. 
Yet there are real changes in the facts of language 
with which grammar deals. They are slow in their 
operation and it requires careful study and the com- 
parison of the literature of different ages to trace their 
order of progression.
-P-A-G-E-319
  Changes in the Grammar of English 303 
All the language changes are the result of natural 
tendencies in the human mind, and of social develop- 
ment. The speakers and writers of the language do 
not decree such changes. They can to some extent 
modify and retard tendencies that they think are harm- 
ful to the language. In fact if they did not to some 
extent control these changes the language of two suc- 
cessive generations would become mutually unintelli- 
gible. But the laws that lead to change are never 
inactive. Ours is a living and growing language and 
this fact must be recognized in all forms of language 
study. 
Most of the changes in language come in the field of 
diction, and are therefore etymological rather than 
grammatical. Yet some of these word changes have a 
grammatical bearing as well. A large increase in 
vocabulary comes by converting one part of speech 
into another. With extraordinary license English 
takes words of all classes and uses them as nouns. 
Thus we speak of a “walk’’ through the fields, the 
“up and down” of a piece of cloth, the “whys” and 
“wherefores’”’ of an argument. With nearly equal 
freedom nouns become adjectives and both of these 
classes become verbs. We speak of a “university’’ 
man, a “provision’’ store; we “black’’ our boots, and 
“idle”? away our time. A girl “queens” it among her 
companions, and the poet reminds us that “a man 
may gentle his condition.” 
When a word in its passage from one part of speech 
into another carries with it the limiting terms of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
304 Grammar and Its Reasons 
original state, a new grammatical relation is acquired. 
In the expression “a run on the beach’’ the preposi- 
tional phrase “on the beach”’ has been changed from 
an adverbial to an adjective character by the new 
noun meaning given to run. The key to not a few 
grammatical puzzles can be found in the simple fact 
that the word at the basis of the peculiar phrase was 
originally of another part of speech and has carried 
its belongings with it into the new associations. 
A careful study of the prefixes and suffixes used in 
making one part of speech from another throws much 
light on the relations of the parts of speech among 
themselves. Thus we add ness to an adjective to make 
an abstract noun, as greenness, goodness. Ly added 
to an adjective gives a strictly adverbial word, as, 
slowly, firmly. Er or or with a verb makes a noun, as, 
actor, singer. There are many such semi-grammatical 
laws that govern word formations. 
Changes in inflection come far more slowly than 
those of diction, and are usually subtractions from the 
language rather than additions to it. The study of 
comparative grammar shows that the languages of 
Europe have tended toward an analytical character, 
away from the synthetic or highly-inflected types that 
belonged to Sanskrit, Greek and Latin. Modern 
languages tend to break away from inflected forms, 
and to make large use of short indeclinable words 
that can be separated from each other and recombined 
into new phrases at pleasure. All the languages of 
southern Europe have shown this tendency, but English
-P-A-G-E-321
  Changes in the Grammar of English 305 
has gone farther in this direction than any other Euro- 
pean tongue. 
In such a process prepositions usually come in first, 
and are brought to the aid of the inflectional form. 
Later the inflection itself seems needless, and the weight 
of the relation seems to fall on the preposition. The 
inflection may then live on, as an ancient fashion, or 
under changing social conditions there may be a 
shedding of inflections which are not really needed to 
show the logical relations. 
Such a history belongs to the Saxon tongue. For a 
time it had both the inflections and the prepositions; 
then with the general shake-up that came to the lan- 
guage after the Norman Conquest, the inflections were 
largely cast off as a burden that could be dispensed 
with. 
With this loss of inflections came other changes 
as well... The order of words in the sentence became 
more rigid. Old English with its large elements of 
agreeing forms was naturally careless of word order. 
There was little danger of related words getting de- 
tached in thought since the forms showed the logical 
connections. Some grammarians have maintained 
that it was the strengthening of word order first that 
made the inflections unnecessary so that they fell away. 
But it is needless to affirm too definitely as to the re- 
lations of cause and effect here. The loss of inflections 
and the strengthening of word order went on sim- 
ultaneously, each process aiding and hastening the 
other.
-P-A-G-E-322
806 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The loss of the inflectional form gave a new syntacti- 
cal freedom to words, making it possible not only that 
they should be transferred easily from one part of 
speech to another, but especially that they should be 
able to hold several relations at the same time. The 
intermediate constructions in English—the same word 
fulfilling several functions—is one of the most marked 
results of this falling off of inflectional agreements. 
Although in general the loss of inflections comes to a 
language very gradually, there is in the history of 
English one apparent exception to this principle of 
slow change, owing to a peculiar epoch in English 
history in which two peoples became united into one. 
During about two hundred years, while the Saxons 
and Normans were becoming amalgamated, the process 
went on with comparative rapidity, and at the end of 
that period there was a new language. At least the 
English tongue had undergone such large modifications 
as to make the literature of the periods before and after 
this epoch distinct in language characteristies. Yet 
the grammar of modern English is, nevertheless, 
deeply rooted in the grammar of the old Saxon tongue. 
But there were various nations in the old Saxon 
heptarchy. Their languages, or dialects, had differing 
grammatical forms, and our remaining old English 
inflections have come to us from various sections of 
Britain. Yet the legacies are not equally from all the 
dialects. The gieat writers of the fourteenth century, 
Robert of Brunne, Wycliffe, Gower and Chaucer, used 
the dialect of the east Midland. Their popularity and
-P-A-G-E-323
  Changes in the Grammar of English 307 
the wide circulation of their writings made this dialect 
the literary language of England. 
The northern dialect continued to be used, but had 
little or no literature. At last it seemed strange to the 
English people and they refused to call it English but 
called it Scotch. It was the language of Burns and 
of Scott, and is to-day more like old English than 
English itself. 
Old English, in the form in which it kas been pre- 
served, was a highly inflected language. It had six 
cases of nouns, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, 
vocative, and a case similar to the ablative which has 
been called the instrumental case. The noun 
plurals were formed on various patterns, of which a 
few examples have come down to us in such words as, 
oxen, mice. We call them irregular plurals but they 
are remnants of old regular declensions. 
Adjectives and participles had case agreements with 
the nouns. Verbs were of various conjugations, and 
the remnants of all these conjugations except one 
(the one making its past tense in ed) we now group 
together as one conjugation of strong verbs. The 
one in ed we have retained as the rule of the language 
and call it the new, or weak, or regular conjugation. 
With the coming of William the Conqueror a new 
set of language forces was introduced. The early 
pages of Ivanhoe have an interesting scene between 
Wamba and the Swineherd, showing the relations 
which the Norman and Saxon languages naturally 
assumed in the range of vocabulary—the animals,
-P-A-G-E-324
  308 Grammar and Its Reasons 
swine and oz, retaining their Saxon names while under 
the Swineherd, but becoming pork and beef when re- 
duced to articles of commerce and served in the dining- 
hall of a Norman castle. 
But with the grammatical character of the language 
the results were different. 'The Normans did not know 
the Saxon inflections and dropped them whenever they 
could make logical connections without them. As a 
result English is a virtually uninflected language but 
retains various shreds of the old forms and agreements, 
For a century or two after the Conquest, there was a 
period of broken Saxon, known as early English, the 
Norman language also being used by some. During 
the period 1350-1550 English became moulded into 
the national language, gradually acquiring most of its 
present characteristics. Since that time it is essen- 
tially modern English. 
In the early years after the Conquest many Norman 
words found their way into common use. During the 
fifteenth century Latin was used extensively by 
learned men. The fashion became so extravagant 
that it was at last made the occasion of satire. Men 
laughed at “ink-horn words.” 
Butler (in Hudibras) thus describes this style of 
foreign English: 
“A Babylonish dialect 
Which learned pedants much affect, 
’Twas English cut on Greek and Latin 
Like fiction heretofore on Satin.” 
But under the influence of classical study many
-P-A-G-E-325
  Changes in the Grammar of English 3809 
words derived from Greek and Latin roots found 
their way into English. Modern science also draws 
its nomenclature largely from these sources, so that new 
words of classical origin are continually coming into 
English. 
But while the more significant words of the English 
vocabulary, nouns, adjectives, and verbs, have come 
in immense numbers from Norman French, Greek and 
Latin, all or nearly all the connecting and filling-in 
parts of speech,—the prepositions, conjunctions, modal 
adverbs, articles, adjective pronouns, personal pro- 
nouns, and auxiliaries, are Saxon in origin. And since 
the inflections that have been retained are also Saxon, 
it may be said that while English is much mixed in 
vocabulary, its grammar is purely Saxon. 
The invention of printing in the fifteenth century 
gave fixity to the forms then in use. But perhaps no 
single influence in this direction has been stronger 
than that of the English Bible. Wycliffe’s and Tyndale’s 
Bibles, especially the latter, did something in this direc- 
tion. But after King James’s version, published in 
1611, became the “Authorized Version,” and the rise 
and spread of Puritanism gave tremendous influence 
to this book throughout the kingdom, the expressions 
used in the Bible became familiar and entered into the 
language of all. A similar influence has been exerted 
upon the German language by Luther’s Bible. 
Although the dropping of inflections nearly reached 
its limit several centuries ago the language has not been 
stationary since then. Looking over the four hundred  
-P-A-G-E-326
310 Grammar and Its Reasons 
years of the modern English period, we find not a 
few grammatical changes in all the parts of speech, 
and the tendencies to change are still active. During 
this long period nouns have established their modern 
possessive form, have reduced greatly the number of 
their irregular plurals, and their feminine forms. The 
old noun compounds, including such gender forms as 
manchild, he-goat, have mostly gone out of use. 
The pronouns thou and ye have been relegated to 
archaic or poetic uses, its has found its way into the 
language, his and her have restricted their gender 
significations, mine and thine have become absolute 
pronoun forms, and certain old relative and interrog- 
ative pronouns, as whosoever, whatso, whether, have 
dropped out of general use. 
Adjectives are more strict in their modes of com- 
parison, and they no longer double their comparative 
and superlative forms. 
Among verbs, some strong verbs and many strong 
forms of verbs have gone out of use, subjunctive forms 
have become few, auxiliary verbs have enlarged their 
functions, shall and will phrases have been modified, 
and many new verbal phrases have grown into favor. 
Many adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions have 
enlarged their sentence functions, and special words 
among them have defined more precisely their meaning 
and usages. 
Certain constructions, as impersonal sentences and 
absolute participial phrases, are more rare than formerly 
and the dative (or accusative) case used by Milton as
-P-A-G-E-327
  Changes in the Grammar of English 311 
the absolute case has given way to the nominative. 
A comparison of modern English with the language 
of King James’s version of the Bible published in 1611 
is one of the best ways of discovering how far English 
grammar has changed in the last three hundred years. 
Shakespeare’s works offer a similar opportunity for 
profitable comparison, and Abbott’s Shakesperian 
Grammar gives convenient and scholarly assistance 
in this work. 
The most conspicuous difference which the Bible 
of 1611 shows from the English of to-day is in the con- 
stant use of thow and ye, and the verbal forms in est 
and eth, which give to the writing that peculiar structure 
which we call solemn or ancient style. 
The extensive use of subjunctives (If he find it, 
Though he slay me) and of the “shall of prophecy,” the 
absence of many of our modern verb phrases, the oc- 
casional use of obsolete verbs (wist, wot, wit, trow, etc.), 
or of archaic verbal forms (holpen, spat), or of verbs 
with an obsolete meaning (let, prevent), the use of be 
as an indicative (Ye be spies), of did as an auxiliary 
for the ordinary past tense (I did eat), the lack of an 
auxiliary in negative and interrogative sentences 
(Lacked ye anything ?), the use of for before the in- 
finitive (for to see); all these things and many more 
show the decided changes that English grammar has 
been making especially in its verb forms. 
The use of his and her without sex signification 
(Every tree is known by his fruit), the use of which 
where the modern word would be who (Our Father
-P-A-G-E-328
  312 Grammar and Its Reasons 
which art in Heaven), the use of impersonal sentences 
(It sufficeth me), of expletive objects (Saddle me the 
ass), of the intransitive phrase with be rather than 
have (I am come that they might have life), the use of 
to after like (like to a sardine stone); all these testify 
to the movements that have been taking place in Eng- 
lish grammar since 1611. 
In sentences as a whole time brings changes. It is 
the custom of the modern age to make shorter sentences 
than of old, to have fewer long participial and infinitive 
constructions. It has been estimated that Edmund 
Spenser’s average sentence was forty-nine words, 
Macaulay’s twenty-three, Emerson’s twenty. As the 
style of thought changes, the “genius of the language”’ 
modifies its constructions to suit the new mental mood. 
Within the memory of living people some gram- 
matical changes in English may be perceived. The 
subjunctive mood, the forms of strong verbs, the gender 
forms of nouns are not quite what they were a genera- 
tion ago. The “split infinitive’? has become more 
common and finds defenders among present-day gram- 
marians, and various idiomatic usages have been gain- 
ing or losing in public favor. 
The question of the proper attitude of grammarians 
and of educated people in general toward these language 
changes is an important one. There is a sense in 
which a language should be encouraged to follow its 
own bent, and to adapt itself to the changing needs of 
the people who use it. Yet if there is no restraining 
tendency the generations will not keep in touch with
-P-A-G-E-329
  Changes in the Grammar of English 313 
one another. People of different countries who orig- 
inally spoke the same language will find their speech 
mutually unintelligible and the language will break up 
into dialects. This has sometimes been the case. 
Thus Scotch has differentiated itself from English; 
thus also the three countries of Scandinavia, originally 
one, have now different languages; thus also the Taal 
spoken by the Hollanders of South Africa is so different 
from the language of the Dutch people that Dutch 
literature cannot easily be understood by those 
whose native language is still supposed to be Dutch. 
The man of education who understands and values 
his native tongue should watch the flowing currents 
with sympathy and yet with caution. While a general 
attitude of conservatism should be maintained, dis- 
tinction should be made between those changes whick 
impoverish and those which merely simplify the lan- 
guage. Thus, the use of who for whom in questions 
produces no misunderstanding and tends toward sim- 
plicity, while the loss of the subjunctive were would 
result in a real weakening of language power. 
Grammar then is the preservative of language, and 
the natural tendencies of the science are necessarily 
conservative. It is its business to keep out solecisms, 
and to prune away irregular growths that cannot show 
good reason for their existence. But the true gram- 
marian will not try too strictly to “margin a living lake 
by rigid bounds.” It is his privilege to be not only the 
critic but also the interpreter of language, both in regard 
to its past history and its present tendencies,

GRAMMATICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 
ENGLISH* 
Poverty in grammatical forms is no drawback to a lan 
guage.— JESPERSEN. 
“The simplest of all languages in form, the most spiritual 
in the mode of expression.” 
English grammar is at once the simplest and most difficult 
of all the grammars.—ALLEN. 
English enjoys the distinction of having freed itself from 
ancient and unnecessary inflections to a greater degree than 
any other language.—CarPENTER. 
That language ranks highest which goes farthest in the 
art of accomplishing much with little means, or,in other words, 
which is able to express the greatest amount of meaning 
with the simplest mechanism.—JxEsPERSEN. 
An elaborate linguistic structure with a variety of endings 
in declensions and conjugations, has certain advantages, 
but it may be that the advantages of the opposite simplicity 
are still greater.—ScHLEICHER. 
Anglo-Saxon is the basis of English. All its joints, its 
whole articulation, sinews, ligaments, articles, pronouns, 
conjunctions, prepositions, numerals, and auxiliary verbs— 
all the words that bind together the sentence, are exclusively 
Saxon.—W. H. Low. 
*Some of the facts given in this chapter are mentioned in 
other sections of this book. But a brief final summary of 
this subject seems desirable.

Grammatical Characteristics of English 315 
Hardly less wonderful, perhaps, than the extraordinary 
development of its vocabulary is the slow process by which 
English has changed from a synthetic to an analytical lan- 
guage. It has in this way gained greatly in simplicity, 
though it must be granted that there has been in some degree 
a loss in precision and in delicacy of expression.—SourTu- 
WORTH. 
It is safe to say that the fixed word order, the freedom 
from inflections, the abundant use of prepositions and aux- 
iliary verbs, which characterize modern English, are a dis- 
tinct improvement upon the contrasted phenomena of the 
older languages.—Toiman. 
Great is the English speech—what speech is so great as 
the English!—Waur Wurman. 
English, however, is at the opening of the twentieth cen- 
tury the greatest language power in existence, and bids fair 
to become ultimately the universal tongue.—Sourawortu. 
It is in its vocabulary, as inherited, acquired and adapted, 
that English finds its highest claim to supremacy among 
languages.—JoyNEs. 
Grammar it (7. e., English language) might have had, but 
it needes it not; being so easie of itselfe and so voyd of 
those cumbersome differences of cases, genders, moodes and 
tenses, which I thinke was a peece of the Tower of Babilon’s 
curse that a man should be put to schoole to learne his mother 
tongue. But for the uttering sweetly and properly theconceits 
of the minde which is the end of speech that hath it equally 
with any other tongue in the world.—Srr Purp SipNEy’s 
APpoLoGIg For Porrry. 1585. 
The English is plenteous enough to express our myndes in 
anything whereof one man hath neede to speke with another.

-P-A-G-E-332
  316 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Most of. our knowledge of our mother tongue comes 
to us by what are called Natural Methods, and the 
distinctive marks of the language being native to our 
thought are not always recognized clearly even when 
known correctly for use. 
But the student should sometimes step outside his 
own relation to the language in order to look at it ob- 
jectively, to compare and classify, to note its variations 
from other general language types and so gain a more 
explicit knowledge of its distinctive language forms. 
The scholar’s knowledge of a language should be 
broader and deeper than that of one who would simply 
use the language as a vehicle of thought. The reasons 
of English grammar must underlie a scholarly knowl- 
edge of the subject. 
English has inherited traits from the two kinds of 
languages that represent the two ruling races of Christen- 
dom, the Roman and the Germanic. Yet while many 
English words are of French or Latin or Greek extrac- 
tion the grammar of English is mostly Teutonic in char- 
acter. Its idioms are Anglo-Saxon and not Latin or 
French in their origin. 
But modern English has diverged very far from the 
original Saxon type of language structure. Instead 
of being a highly inflected language, it is now one of 
the simplest of all languages in its word forms. While 
not in a condition of absolute simplicity like the Chinese 
_ which requires a new word for every modification 
of an idea—it is yet nearer to this than any other lan- 
guage of Europe is, being made up very largely of
-P-A-G-E-333
  
Grammatical Characteristics of English 317 
short indeclinable elements that can be readily com- 
bined into all needed logical arrangements. 
Languages are often roughly classed into two groups 
as showing two types of grammatical structure. Of the 
synthetic or inflected type Latin is one of the best ex- 
amples, while of the analytic type English is a pro- 
nounced illustration. 
The active powers of English in making inflectional 
forms seem now to be reduced to the action of two or 
three very simple rules. The addition of s or es for 
plural nouns, of ’s to denote possession, of er and est 
in the comparison of adjectives and of s, ed, ing, for 
verb forms, with est and eth in solemn or poetic 
style—these are all the present inflectional powers of 
English. 
But while the active inflections of English are few 
and simple, there are various remnants of old inflections 
still remaining that seem to us to-day not so much 
like real inflections, as irregular forms with which 
certain ideas have become associated. These give 
trouble not only to foreigners but to native speakers 
of the language, and mar the ideal simplicity of English 
for universal use. Yet the political and commercial 
growth of the English-speaking peoples, together with 
the highly analytical character of the language itself is 
giving it an increasing importance among the languages 
of the world. 
By the changes in its grammar English has acquired 
certain unique and high powers. The record has been 
one of progress, and not of decay or retrogression. The
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 Grammar and Its Reasons 
simple form allowing free interchange of grammatical 
‘functions gives peculiar vigor to style. With some loss 
of freedom of arrangement, there is nevertheless an 
economy of words, and greater idiomatic power and 
clearness. 
The power to transfer a word from one part of speech 
to another is remarkably developed in English. An 
especial prerogative seems to be the power to change 
almost any noun into a verb. Thus we “cable” our 
dispatches, and “phone” our verbal messages. We 
“table”? a resolution and “bed’’ plants. Thus, also, 
Skakespeare’s Portia uses the phrase, “ Being so fathered 
and so husbanded.” 
There are also large classes of words, such as 
the adjective pronouns, that belong equally to 
two parts of speech. The power of a word to 
perform several functions at the same time is most 
remarkably developed. A majority of the connec- 
tive terms (including relative pronouns, relative 
adjectives, and conjunctive adverbs of various types) 
unite in the same sentence the offices of two or more 
parts of speech. 
English is very rich in its variety of verb phrases. 
Foreigners find it hard to learn these and English- 
speaking travelers find great difficulty in rendering all 
our verb phrases into the idiom of other tongues. Many 
irregular phrases, for instance, are in use as substitutes 
for the future tense. The following examples show 
different ways of expressing nearly the same future 
action.
-P-A-G-E-335
  Grammatical Characteristics of English 319 
I shall write. I shall be writing. 
I will write. I will be writing. 
I am to write. I am to be writing. 
I am going to write. I am going to be writing. 
I am about to write. Iam about to be writing. 
To these might be added perhaps the interesting Hiber- 
nianism, 
“T’ll be afther writing.” 
“Is to be’’ is one of the most common future phrases, 
as, “He is to be married to-morrow.” ‘The ordinary 
present tense may be used with future signification, as, 
“T go to-morrow,” and most of the potential auxiliaries 
may also be used so as to convey a future idea. It 
may fairly be said that in the abundance and flexibility 
of its verbal combinations English is not surpassed 
or perhaps equalled by any other language in the 
world. 
English is not particularly rich in adjectives. 
“Ho, for an epithet’? is the mental ejaculation of 
many a writer in search of choice and fitting words 
with which to clothe his thoughts. In passing from one 
language into another adjectives change their meaning 
more than nouns or verbs do, and English adjectives 
are often quite different in meaning from the foreign 
adjectives to which by form they are allied. 
A few idioms are very peculiar to English. Among 
these may be mentioned the use of the same term self 
as both a reflexive and an emphatic pronoun; the free 
omission of a relative pronoun in a restrictive adjective 
clause, as, “The man I met,” and the double or 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
320 Grammar and Its Reasons 
cumulative possessive, as, “This speech of Caesar’s.” 
To these may be added that form of a passive sen- 
tence in which the indirect object is made the subject, 
and the direct object is left in the predicate as a re- 
tained object, as, “I was given some oranges.” 
But the phenomena of modern English are not very 
thoroughly classified and known. The older stages of 
the language are of much interest to scholars and are 
more studied than the shifting phases of the present. 
Grammars and dictionaries are necessarily conserva- 
tive, and are never quite up-to-date. But the study of 
these flowing currents and marks of modern English 
usage should be of great interest to students of language 
and of life. As has been well said, 
Those who are born to be heirs of a highly analytical lan- 
guage must needs learn to think up to it.—THomson’s 
Ovutinzs or THE Laws or THovGHT.

RELATION OF GRAMMAR TO OTHER KINDS 
OF LANGUAGE STUDY 
Even the analysis of sentences, important as it is, has its 
limits as a means of instruction and training.—BuraLER. 
It is intended that the study of literature be taken up as 
early in the course as is practicable, and continued in such 
way as to supplement the technical part of the instruction. 
—Locxwoop. 
To the question of how to become familiar with the best 
use, the first answer is, Read the best literature—Bunuatnr. 
Practice in writing should be constant.—Locxwoop. 
The teaching of English is difficult, its results often un- 
satisfactory. Jornzs. 
Hamlet.—Will you play upon this pipe? 
Gilderstern.—My lord, I cannot. 
Hamlet.—I pray you. 
Gilderstern.—I cannot, I know no touch of it, my lord.

with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, 
and it will discourse most excellent music. Look you, these 
are the stops. 
Gilderstern.—But these cannot I command to any utter- 
ance of harmony.—I have not the skill.—_SuakEsPEARE. 
There are three distinct kinds of English study that 
321 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  322 Grammar and Its Reasons 
must enter into school work. They are adapted to 
different ends, and pursued by different methods. All 
of them are important, and each is defective if not sup- 
plemented by both of the others. 
There is the formal or structural study of the lan- 
guage itself, known specifically as language study or 
linguistics. 
In this department, grammar is the central study. 
But the formal study of language includes also all 
that relates to spelling, pronunciation, etymology and 
all else that belongs to the scientific or formal make-up 
of spoken or written English. This line of work is 
chiefly technical. Its primary aim is to give the student 
control of his native tongue as an instrument that may 
be used for the higher ends of self expression. Yet 
grammatical study, by its appeal to the logical faculties 
has educative elements that are broader and deeper 
than belong to mere technical training. | 
This study of English on the structural side begins 
with the earliest grades of school; but it also reaches 
on with increasing interest and importance, through 
the historic and comparative philological study that 
belongs to high school and collegiate work. 
A second kind of English study for schools is that 
which is pursued by literary methods and devoted to 
literary ends. The study of the literary treasures of a 
language has elements of culture which the structural 
study of language can never give. It touches the 
emotions and cultivates the taste. Its appeal is to the 
motives and the spiritual life of the soul. It is there-
-P-A-G-E-339
  Relation of Grammar to Other-Language Study 323 
fore a corrective for certain faults of mind that merely 
technical study sometimes induces. 
The study of literature used to be thought of as 
belonging to the later part of school life. Yet even for 
the youngest children in schools there is literary mate- 
rial in abundance which can be studied for artistic ends. 
The study of literature, not in name but in its essence, 
should begin in the kindergarten and extend through 
all stages of school and college life. 
But literary study as well as the technical study of 
language has its limitations. The study of a literary 
masterpiece is in a degree a receptive study. It does 
not always lead to active effort in the use of one’s own 
language powers. It may even have a tendency to 
paralyze active literary effort, as one yields himself 
to the passive enjoyment of the work of others, or to the 
sense of discouragement sometimes induced by the 
disparaging comparisons which great writings invite 
toward all humbler performances. While the critical 
taste is cultivated, the creative faculty is not always 
aroused by the study of noble writings. 
Both literary study and formal language study there- 
fore need to be reinforced by plenty of practical com- 
position work. By well-graded exercises and the use 
of stimulating motives the teacher should call forth 
the best creative energies of the pupil and lead him 
to the habit of free and correct expression of his own 
thoughts in both spoken and written English. 
From the primary school to the university, then, 
these three lines of English study,—the formal or 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
824 Grammar and Its Reasons 
structural, the literary or artistic, and the creative or 
practical—need to be pursued side by side, with no one 
of the three overshadowing, but each aiding and cor- 
recting the others, uatil by their joint actions and re- 
actions the student comes to deserve the praise once 
bestowed upon an English scholar, “He was well- 
languaged.”
-P-A-G-E-341
    Tr 
RELATIONS OF THE STUDY OF ENGLISH 
GRAMMAR TO THE STUDY OF FOREIGN 
GRAMMARS 
Most of us wish to learn other languages than our own. 
We can do this more easily and accurately if we understand 
how our own language is made and used.—WHITNEY AND 
Locxwoop. 
It may fairly be said that the construction and compre- 
hension of an English sentence demand and suppose the 
exercise of higher mental power than are required for fram- 
ing or understanding a proposition in Latin.—Wetsu. 
There is a strong difference between the analytical 
study of English and that of a language of the highly 
inflected type. In Latin, for instance, the part of 
speech of a word and its logical relations are usually 
shown by its inflectional form. But in English it is 
chiefly the sense that must decide, and so the study of 
the English sentence has a disciplinary value that is 
all its own. 
There are many teachers of foreign languages, and 
educated persons that have drunk deeply from the full 
cup of classical learning, who feel a doubt whether the 
study of English grammar can give much aid to the 
acquirement of foreign tongues. 
It may well be granted that a knowledge of English 
inflections, so meagre, so incomplete, and seemingly 
325
-P-A-G-E-342
  326 Grammar and Its Reasons 
irregular as they all are, is but a slight aid to a study 
of inflection and inflectional agreements, in general 
grammar. ‘The remnants of inflection that are left 
seem arbitrary and inconsistent, and seldom give an 
adequate impression of inflection in its true sense. 
For a primary knowledge of grammatical inflections 
and what they signify, one must agree with the report 
made years ago by Mr. George H. Martin (at that 
time agent of the Massachusetts Board of Education, 
of which he is now the secretary), in which he said: 
“After noting carefully the mental operations of thous- 
ands of pupils in the high schools, I am convinced that 
nothing can take the place of Latin in high school work.” 
But, in gaining a knowledge of the syntax of Latin, 
that is spread out on the pages of the Latin grammar, 
and that is so vital to the knowledge and use of the 
language, will a knowledge of English syntax avail 
nothing ? 
Is a knowledge of the twelve or more different rela- 
tions in which an English noun can be placed, no aid 
in seeing these same relations when found in another 
tongue? Can our varied objective constructions, the 
indirect objects, the factitive or double objects, throw 
no light on Latin datives and accusatives ? 
Have the absolute constructions of other languages, 
the participial and infinitive phrases and clauses, the 
impersonal or unipersonal, and many abbreviated 
forms of foreign tongues, nothing to gain from the stu- 
dent’s knowledge of such constructions in his native 
speech ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
Study of English and Foreign Grammars 327 
If it be said that the study of English syntax 
gains great advantage from the study of foreign forms 
and agreements which point out by external marks 
the syntactical relationships, no one can question the 
truth of this statement. The recognition of syntax 
relations is easier when the word-form is limited to a 
certain use. No one can deny the value to an ele- 
mentary student of such plain guide marks as inflec- 
tion gives to a knowledge of the structure of sentences. 
But this gain is chiefly in a certain elementary part 
of the subject. There are syntactical relations in 
every language which far transcend all the powers of 
inflection to point them out. The very fact that in- 
flections are largely depended on to show syntax, tends 
to obscure the more subtle language relations. 
While Latin study can greatly aid the study of Eng- 
lish it is also most true that a right study of English 
constructions will bring very effective aid to the study 
of Latin. And the same thing is even more true in 
relation to the modern languages which follow more 
nearly than Latin the English type of structure. 
But there is a reason still greater than that of the 
inherent nature of the study, why the study of English 
_ may and should be made a help to the acquirement of 
foreign tongues. The mind goes always most natu- 
rally from the known to the unknown, from the native 
to the foreign. The facts of English are already mostly 
in the possession of the native student. He has not 
tested nor systematized his knowledge. But he does 
understand in general how to construct his sentences
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 Grammar and Its Reasons 
on the right logical basis, and to put the words that he 
knows into their right order and relationships. It is 
good pedagogy and good sense that all this knowledge 
should be turned to account in gaining entrance into - 
the syntactical relations of other tongues. To ignore 
it all, to begin dogmatically with the foreign grammar, 
and afterwards compare it superficially with our own, 
does not meet the demands of the case. The thought 
and practice of the best educators to-day is against 
such ignoring of the value of English study. While 
careful comparisons should be made, it is the English 
construction that should first be known, and the empha- 
sis of the comparison as a rule should rest on the Eng- 
lish side. 
But this is not an argument against the early study 
of Latin, nor against accepting all the aid that it can 
give to the study of English. Action and reaction 
must both be allowed. Comparisons of two kinds 
of grammar made from both sides, will do more for the 
increase of language power than either alone can do, 
But it seems reasonable (and the results are also 
capable of demonstration), that after the student of 
Latin has become in a degree familiar with the com- 
mon Latin inflections, and has gained a general insight 
into the government and agreement of inflectional 
forms, the later study of Latin has as much to gain 
from the study of English as it can contribute to the 
same; nay, that it will receive even more than it can 
give by such comparative study.

PLACE OF GRAMMAR IN THE SCHOOL 
COURSE 
If past history, experience, and the history of education 
be taken for guides, the study of grammar will not be neglected 
and the method of its inculcation will become an object of 
particular inquiry and solicitude—Gootp Brown. 
The body of grammatical facts appropriate to the ele- 
mentary school is rather limited—CarrentTeR, BAKER, AND 
Scorr. 
A little technical grammar sympathetically taught. is 
within the normal powers and interests of grammar school 
students.—Lrwis. 
The teacher can introduce the idea if the class is sufiiciently 
advanced to take it without getting confused. It is good 
teaching to give children hints of what is to come.—Brown 
anp DzGarmo. 
Without intelligent interest there can be no profitable 
study. For many pupils the higher study of English gram- 
mar is a vain and cruel martyrdom, worse than a waste of 
time.—Joynrs. 
High school pupils need in some way or other to be trained 
systematically in a knowledge of the important facts relat- 
ing to inflection, syntax, sentence structure, word order, and 
word composition in their native language.—CarPENntTnER, 
Baxer, AND Scorr. 
Grammar is not the stepping-stone, but the finishing 
instrument.—M. Marcg.. 
329
-P-A-G-E-346
    830 Grammar and Its Reasons 
The work of learning to speak and write correctly, 
properly precedes technical grammar. The ideal plan 
is for the child to be reared in circumstances in which 
he never hears any but correct English, and so finds 
no other kind natural to him. 
But the circumstances of life are not ideal and the 
child who enters school has usually many faults that 
need correction. For these and other reasons the lan- 
guage lessons which furnish the occasion for the child 
to gain freedom in expression must also supply some 
simple principles of criticism that will enable him to 
recognize and so to correct his own faulty language. 
In other words, the language work of the lower 
schools must be largely constructive and proceed along 
the practical lines of aiding the children to express 
themselves correctly under intelligent supervision. But 
mingled with this constructive work, even from an early 
age, there should be some analytical work also, and 
some attention should be given to the grammatical facts 
that come within the range of the child’s observation. 
The teaching of these elementary principles is in 
a sense grammar. Yet it is not a scientific course in 
grammar. The facts and principles are not intro- 
duced in logical order, but are determined by the 
present needs of expression, and the faults that are 
to be corrected. 
It is the practice of some teachers in their elementary 
language lessons to avoid so far as possible the terms 
of technical grammar. The forming of such arbitrary 
compounds as action-words, quality-words, etc., illus-

trates the devices that have been employed to avoid 
the language of scientific grammar. 
But we think that many mistakes have been made 
along this line. While there can be no objection to a 
roundabout mode of expression if the precise scientific 
word would be misunderstood, or if it interrupts too 
much the present purpose of the lesson to introduce 
and explain it, yet the true grammatical terms are all 
to find their place finally in the pupils’ vocabulary. 
The first time when it would be convenient to use 
the word would seem to be the proper time to intro- 
duce it. Nor is it needful always to interrupt the les- 
son by teaching fully the scientific meaning of the terms, 
but only far enough to prevent any present confusion 
of thought. Logical definitions (if grammatical defi- 
nitions can be made really logical), may be postponed 
until a later period of study. It will not only be a 
saving of time in the end to use the terms of grammar 
somewhat freely in the language-lessons, but it is 
entirely consistent with the way in which most of our 
words are acquired. It may be said, not of children 
alone, but of men and women, that among the words 
which they use freely and correctly in speech and writ- 
ing, there are many which they would be at a loss to 
give a logical definition for, and that the dangers in 
such use are no greater in the vocabulary of grammar 
than in other lines of thought. 
At the end of the language-lessons of the elementary 
course, then, the child ought not only to know most of 
the important facts of grammar, but the terms of gram-
-P-A-G-E-348
  
3832 Grammar and Its Reasons 
mar should, to a considerable extent, be familiar to his 
ear and thought. But the simple principles of language 
thus gained in a somewhat desultory fashion through the 
language-lessons of the lower grades, need to be reviewed 
and placed in a more orderly arrangement in the child’s 
mind, if he would hold them in memory ready for use. 
It would seem that the work of the last year of the 
elementary language-lessons should be a classified 
review of the terms and principles of grammar that have 
already come before the children in applied form. 
Such a year’s course will include simple definitions of 
the grammatical terms that have been used. It will 
always be in a measure unsatisfactory with a certain 
proportion of the pupils, whose interest can only be 
aroused by subjects of a less abstract nature than 
analytical grammar. Yet many of these pupils are 
well ready for this study, and if it be entirely relegated 
to the high school or college course, those who never 
enter upon high school work will miss entirely the special 
and important kind of linguistic training which gram- 
mar alone can give. 
But the work in grammar cannot be finished in the 
grammar school. Under one name or another it is 
an important part of the high school course. It ex- 
tends itself also into the advanced language training 
of the college and the university, becoming ever more 
interesting and valuable as the knowledge of foreign 
tongues brings the student into closer touch with all 
those lines of comparative and historical grammar 
that belong to the large realm of philological research.

IV 
DEFINITIONS IN GRAMMAR 
“Tt is difficult to make perfectly accurate grammatical 
definitions, and still more difficult for a pupil to understand 
them accurately; but difficulties are not surmounted by 
being evaded.” 
Definitions are not the only means by which a knowledge 
of the import of language may be acquired nor by which the 
acquisition of knowledge may be aided. To point out things 
and tell their names constitutes a large part of the instruc- 
tion by which the meaning of words is conveyed to the mind, 
and sometimes a mere change of terms sufficiently conveys 
an idea. Yet if we would guard against all possibility of 
misapprehension and show precisely the meaning of a word, 
we must define it.—Gootp Brown. 
Elementary definitions however simple—or even incom- 
plete—must be strictly true.so far. Nothing should be taught 
which in either method or matter shall ever need to be un- 
taught.—Joynus. 
A loose definition of a class necessarily fails to meet the 
instances that arise; consequently easy cases alone are 
noticed, difficulties are slurred over, distinctions are con- 
founded; in short, where explanation is most wanted, it is 
not forthcoming.—Bain. 
Definitions invariably follow the completion of the study 
of that which is defined.—W. T. Harris. 
Although grammar is based on logic, there is no 
333  
-P-A-G-E-350
334 Grammar and Its Reasons 
subject of school study in which it is harder to frame 
logical definitions than in this. Indeed, the grammar 
definitions which are strictly logical are often hard to 
apply as tests of classification. To define a noun as 
a name is not logical, since the basis of classification 
for parts of speech is the relation which the word holds 
in the sentence. Yet no definition based on logical 
relationships can be given which children can easily | 
use in selecting the nouns of a given sentence. 
A definition that seems labored and confusing, even 
if it is true, has little educative value. An elderly lady 
once said that she had remembered for sixty years the 
definition of a common noun as she learned it from 
Murray’s grammar: “A common noun stands for kinds 
containing many sorts and for sorts containing many 
individuals under them.” But she could not remem- 
ber that she ever attached any particular meaning 
to the phrases which she had thus committed to 
memory. 
The difficulty of framing grammatical definitions 
that are wholly satisfactory is plainly illustrated by the 
failures and disagreements of the text-books in trying 
to tell just what is meant by case, number, mood, ete. 
It is far easier to see the difference between “book” 
and “books’’ and to call these forms singular and 
plural, than it is to decide whether number is “that 
property of”’, or “that change of form which,” or “the 
distinction between,” etc. 
The explanations of grammatical terms for elementary 
classes should record what needs to be understood at
-P-A-G-E-351
Definitions in Grammar 335 
this stage of the teaching. Fuller understanding and 
more logical definitions will follow later. The early 
definitions should, however, be consistent with what 
is to follow: Thus, to use the words of another * 
“That a pronoun stands for a noun is true, but not ‘to 
avoid repetition of a noun,’ which is only true in cer- 
tain instances and is incidental to the real character 
of pronouns.” 
Definitions are the highest and most difficult depart- 
ment of science. There can be successful classification 
of words and clear recognition of their grammatical 
forms with very few definitions of technical terms. 
The grammatical work of very elementary classes should 
be somewhat broadly done. Yet enough of technical 
grammar can be given to children’s classes to serve 
as a basis for the very large amount of practice work 
which is needed to lead the child to speak and write 
correctly, and also to know the reason why the 
forms he is taught to use are the correct ones. 
By advanced students of English finer and more 
numerous distinctions should be drawn. In _ this 
maturer stage of the study the student should form 
for himself, by careful examination of the language as he 
knows it, logical definitions of the grammatical terms 
that he uses. The most educative part of grammar 
study will lie in this line. 
Yet it is the work of making the definition that is 
chiefly of value, rather than the definition itself after

it has been made. With the successful accomplish- 
ment of the effort there is little further need of the 
definition as a test for classification. It has done its 
work for the student, and may now for the most part 
be safely pigeon-holed or laid upon the shelf.

ANALYSIS AND PARSING 
“‘Ah, it’s me,” said Mr. Squeers, ‘‘and me’s the first person 
ingular, nominative case, agreeing with the verb it’s and 
overned by Squeers understood, as a acorn, a hour.”— 
DICKENS. 
Since the English Language was not made to parse, it is 
ot necessary that we should subordinate any of our idioms 
o parsing.—Snoppy. 
A sentence is a living thing, and all analysis is, in a way, 
in insult to it.—Lrwis. 
If a noble sentiment clearly expressed and of literary 
eauty is needlessly subjected to grammatical analysis, that 
s pedagogical crime; but if an obscure passage is being’ 
leared up by patient analytic process, that may be the best 
eaching possible.—BArBour. 
The pupil who is taught to separate a sentence into its 
lements is learning to analyze thought, and consequently 
p think. — Prerace To First Epition or Green’s Ene-

The intelligent analysis of English sentences is really an 
malysis of the processes of thought there expressed. This 
iscipline is fundamental and of the highest value; it sharp-

lelps him directly in every department of his work.—To1- 
LAN. 
Analysis should be confined to simple sentences until these 
re thoroughly familiar.—Joynus.

I have taught, more or less, almost every subject embrace 
in the ordinary school or college course, and the most fruit

grammatical analysis. —PRESIDENT GARFIELD. 
With the birth of English grammar began the 
time-honored exercise known as parsing, whic 
consists in giving the grammatical description of eac 
word, by naming its part of speech, its inflection: 
form, and its relation to other words in the sentence 
The exercise had its value, but the numerous prope 
ties assigned to each word, and the parrot-like repet: 
tion of rules of agreement, sometimes made it as be 
numbing to the faculties as it was tedious to the listene: 
Kirkham’s grammar, published in 1823, had a prc 
nounced effect on the teaching of English gramma 
by means of its carefully developed “Systematic Orde 
of Parsing.” As an example of its parsing model 
we may give the one for nouns. : 
Noun, why? Common, proper or collective, why 
Gender and why? Person and why? Number an 
why ? i 
Case and why? Rule. Decline it. 
The parsing of thethree words “John’s hand trembles 
occupies an entire page in Kirkham’s grammar. 
In 1847 another important grammatical event o 
curred in the publication of Samuel S. Greene’s Englis 
Analysis, which was soon used as a text-book in a 
parts of the United States. Analysis begins with th 
sentence as a whole, and recognizes phrases and claus¢ 
also as parts of the sentence, thus adding to the =

   arsing exercises some important elements. Yet analysis 
s well as parsing has a tendency to exalt technique and 
become tedious through repetition of useless details. 
Another objection that is sometimes urged against 
oth analysis and parsing is that by the emphasis laid 
n the technicalities of language much good literature 
as been deprived of its true literary effect. 
This misuse of grammatical drill, however, has 
ostly disappeared from American schools. In the 
pinion of some, the reaction against parsing has been 
rried too far and it would be an advantage if some of 
could be reinstated in American schools. There is a 
ammatical drill in both analysis and parsing which it 
foolish to frown upon. As has been well said, 
Although what is called parsing, or assigning words 
their part of speech, is a juvenile exercise yet it is 
levertheless, the surest test of a person’s having learnt 
at which grammar has to teach.” 
The botanist who investigates the structure of a 
lower is not thereby debarred from the enjoyment of 
wers, nor from seeing them also in poetical relations. 
either is the study of the grammatical structure of a 
iece of literature necessarily a foe to the appreciation 
its aesthetic value. On the contrary, excellences 
lost upon the student unless he first grasps the 
gical relations of the thought itself; and the attempt 
the pupil to formulate these relations gives the 
acher the best evidence as to whether the thought is 
ly understood. 
Parsing in Latin is chiefly an exercise in accidence; in 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
340 Grammar and Its Reasons 
English it is an exercise in syntax. Thesimpler grammat 
ical ideas are easily grasped through the study of Latin 
but in a logical language like ours, parsing has anothe 
kind of disciplinary value that is not to be depreciated 
For the convenience of teachers some models fo: 
analysis and parsing are affixed to this chapter, but eacl 
teacher should be able to modify all such models, or te 
construct new ones according to the needs of the class 
Parsing models should be as simple as possible, anc 
emphasis should always be laid upon the correct inter 
pretation of the thought rather than upon adherence ti 
the form of the model. There are idiomatic words anc 
phrases to which models cannot apply, and in dealin; 
with ordinary sentences there is constant danger o 
useless repetition of points already fully known. The 
teacher should therefore often turn from the form: 
model, and fall back upon the more educative exerci 
of a good grammatical “quiz.” 
The questions for this are of two main classes: Firs 
questions of fact, as, What part of speech? Wh 
mode? What case? What relation? and_ secon 
the still better class of questions: Why the subjuncti 
mode in this sentence? Why this tense or case ? 
In a word, a good grammatical drill passes light] 
over well-known or useless points, and brings out tho: 
of greatest linguistic value. In the hands of a wise an 
skillful teacher analysis and parsing are among t 
most useful tools for language teaching, but th 
should both be used always for broad ends and not fi 
trivial ones.

discourage him by insisting too closely on adherence to 
form of statement. More real thought is often awaken 
by a good grammatical question than by formally parsit 
the word. Models should be used so far as they save tim 
or stimulate consecutive thinking. If they begin to co 
sume time needlessly, or to stultify fresh thought and inte 
est, it is time to dispense with them.

ENTENCE DIAGRAMS AND OTHER DEVICES 
Some device by which the whole class can work together 
y be of value in large classes.—SouTHWworTH. 
A diagram is almost necessarily misleading in many ways. 
e half mechanical accomplishing of diagraming comes to 
sought rather than an intimate comprehension of the 
entence. Those peculiar features of a sentence which can- 
ot be diagramed are lost sight of.—Toiman. 
At this stage of his studies the pupil should not be required 
lways to analyze sentences to their very dregs, nor should 
e be expected to analyze any sentence that is so compli- 
rated as to be very puzzling.—Kirrripge AND ARNOLD. 
Too minute analysis may prove perplexing in complex 
sentences. Sufficient drill in the analysis of phrases will be 
siven by the simple sentences.—Harpur AND Burcsss. 
In the study of the individual sentence, analysis 
sroperly precedes the work of parsing. The early 
xercises in analysis should be of a broad and general 
ind, marking out merely the main features of the 
entence. There should be abundant practice in this 
eneral analysis without confusing the pupils’ minds 
y points of detail. At a later period clauses and 
hrases should be analyzed and specific words parsed. 
In dealing with long and intricate sentences, a rapid 
1ethod of interpretation called “construing” is often 
343
-P-A-G-E-360
344 Grammar and Its Reasons 
of most value. It is a kind of continuous analysis, 
combination of the methods of parsing and analysi 
giving rapidly the functions of clauses, phrases or word 
in their order, but pausing here and there for fuller dis 
cussion of the more difficult points. An extension o 
this analytic interpretation to the paragraph, or t 
connected thought in narrative prose and poetry, sup 
plies some elements of value that are not met by th 
analysis of single disconnected sentences. 
Caution should be used against supplying ellipses fo 
the sake of ease in parsing, when they are not needed fo 
the correct structure of the sentence itself; no 
are dead forms and idioms always to be explained by 
analogy. 
A device once extensively used in grammar teaching 
was that of diagraming sentences. But there ha 
been a great reaction against its use. Teachers dis 
covered that the complications of English sentence: 
require many variations of the form of diagram, anc 
that some of the subtler points of analysis can neve! 
be truly shown in this way. In short, diagraming 
degenerated into an unprofitable puzzle, the technica 
effort to fit the diagram to the sentence crowding ou 
the real language study, which is the main object of th 
teaching. 
Yet the fact that there are limits to the usefulness o 
diagrams is no reason for rejecting them wholly. Man 
a device that has often been misused is still of value ii 
the hands of a wise teacher. 
The diagram analysis appeals to the eye, which i

Sentence Diagrams and Other Devices 845 
the most impressible of all the senses. The diagram 
can be made rapidly and left upon the blackboard for 
further study. It is of use in reviews, being specially 
adapted to the testing of large classes to see whether 
logical relations have been truly grasped. It gives a 
great saving of time over other forms of sentence 
analysis. 
The form used should be as simple as possible and 
omit all needless elaboration. One diagram that has 
been found useful is simply a tabulated statement of 
the great sentence elements, as illustrated by the follow- 
ing sentence :— 
“Yesterday, during the recess, two little boys of my 
school found a strange animal in the schoolyard.” 
| Two 
Subject, boys. { little 
(of my school 
{ a strange animal (obj.) 
Predicate, found yesterday 
during the recess 
in the school yard. 
The detailed analysis of the phrases is omitted, 
since the relations of these words would seldom be 
misunderstood. If one of the elements of a sentence 
is a clause, this can be included in an abbreviated form 
and then analyzed below in another diagram. 
A plan of analysis which does not involve the re- 
writing of the sentence is suggested in Southworth’s 
English Grammar and Composition. This is ac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  346 Grammar and Its Reasons 
complished by means of underscoring, overscoring, 
parentheses, brackets, etc. 
The limit of usefulness for diagrams is very quickly 
reached. Idiomatic phrases and all complicated points 
are best discussed orally. When a word or phrase 
holds several relations in the sentence, the diagram 
is likely to do harm rather than good. All of the sen~ 
tence relations need to be expressed, yet the repetition 
of a word or phrase in various parts of the diagram gives 
confusion. We must see to it that the aids we use in 
teaching are never suffered to become burdens or to 
detract from the main end that is to be gained. 
To sum the matter up: Diagrams are of use in 
teaching and in testing classes (especially young classes), 
as a rapid form of expressing to the eye the general rela- 
tions of sentences, But for difficult points of analysis 
they have only a limited value. For unravelling the 
mysteries of idiomatic English nothing can take the 
place of a good grammatical “quiz.”

SOME WORDS TO TEACHERS. 
Theory guides practice, practice modifies theory.—Borpmn. 
“Tt is easy to lay down general principles, but hard to 
apply them successfully.” 
The study of grammar develops and perfects those forms 
of thought which, like the honey-cell of the bee, only later 
become filled with rich and substantial content.—Joxngs. 
Since grammar is a subject that must be taught in 
the schools, happy is that teacher who loves to teach it, 
and can awaken in his pupils a love for the study. It 
must be confessed that grammar as often taught pre- 
sents few attractions to children; yet if their interest 
is really gained there is no subject in the common 
school curriculum that can yield larger educative 
results than this. 
If the children are to love grammar the teaching of 
it must be adapted to their age and experience. They 
should not be troubled with too much grammatical 
technique until they know enough to perceive its de- 
sirableness. It takes some maturity of judgment to 
appreciate truly the value of a close analysis of one’s 
own thought. The teacher should not waste time in 
what may seem to the pupil like hair-splitting discus- 
sions over matters of no practical importance. 
It is not easy for mature minds to make logical defi- 
347 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
348 Grammar and Its Reasons 
nitions of grammatical terms, and it is well-nigh im- 
possible for children to appreciate or apply strictly 
logical definitions for some of the grammatical terms 
which they need to use. Because of this difficulty 
some teachers demand no definitions at all that even 
approach exactness. There is certainly a serious error 
to be avoided on this side. Loose teaching will always 
produce loose thinking, and the chief value of grammar is 
to secure careful discriminations in thought and speech. 
How then shall the teacher find and keep the wise 
mean between no attempt at logical definition and the 
labored assumption of logical correctness which makes 
the subject tedious, and is useless for application in ele- 
mentary language teaching? Some definitions must be 
given. Some logical distinctions must be drawn. But 
the number and form of these must depend on various 
circumstances and will vary greatly with different classes. 
It is by no means easy to keep the right balance be- 
tween looseness and inaccuracy on the one hand and 
the insistence on logical exactness which lays fetters 
hard to be borne upon immature minds. But on the 
teacher’s skill in doing this the success of the work in 
grammar will very largely depend. 
Grammar may be taught so as to be narrowing and 
pedantic on the one hand or obscure and uninteresting 
on the other. It may carry its analytical method 
beyond the point of really educative influence over the 
minds which the teacher has to deal with. Grammar 
also sometimes assumes a false arrogance as to its own 
authority in matters of usage. The emphasis should
-P-A-G-E-365
  
  Some Words to Teachers 349 
always be laid upon real facts found in the language, 
and not upon negations or prohibitions of this or that 
form of expression. It is hardly worth while to be 
continually setting up men of straw to be knocked down 
by argument. 
The method used should be inductive rather than 
authoritative. The students of grammar are them- 
selves the explorers in the field of language, working, 
however, under the wise guidance of one who has 
traversed the same paths before them. ; 
The teacher must not forget that in the closer dis- 
tinctions of grammar, absolute decision of a disputed 
point cannot always be reached. The grammarian 
must not be over positive in his opinion on some of 
these points. It has been said that “ Dogmatism saves 
time,” but does it in the end? Two interpretations 
may sometimes both be correct. In dealing with dis- 
puted questions it is not needful always for the teacher 
to bring every one of his pupils to the same under- 
standing of the intricate points that he himself holds. 
He should have a definite opinion, of course, and make 
it known to the class, with his reasons therefor. But 
let him beware how he dwarfs the power of judgment 
in his pupils by insisting on entire unanimity in their 
verdict, or invariable conformity to his own view. In 
the discussion of the subtler questions of syntax it is 
not the decision reached that is of chief importance. 
It is the power of thinking gained by the effort to 
compare and discriminate the relations of a thought 
that is of truest educational value. _
-P-A-G-E-366
350 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Finally, let the teacher who loves language work and 
has labored faithfully for his pupils in this field, be of 
good cheer, even if the results seem small. In every 
class there are illogical minds that grasp imperfectly, 
or sometimes apparently not at all, the abstract relations 
of the ideas and words with which grammar deals. 
But results do not show themselves all at first. Many 
are the men and women, who showed no brilliant 
powers as boys and girls in the grammar class but who 
yet look back gratefully upon the school training that 
gave them their first glimpses into the character of 
logical thinking. By and by these grammatical ideas, 
partly perceived by children, grow into more perfect 
clearness in their minds as they come to perceive that 
the fundamental relations of thought and of speech 
are identical and that a knowledge of these relations is 
of practical importance to every thinking mind. 
The real results of school work are seen in their 
true perspective relations only through the vista of 
later years. But even if the work of the grammar class . 
for some of the pupils may seem to be but a qualified 
success, it should not cause discouragement. Gram- 
mar is only one means toward language power. The 
teacher is only one of many agencies that are at work.

T. W. Hiaarnson. 
Good style is impossible without grammatical correctness, 
but grammatical correctness does not necessarily carry with 
it good style.—KirrrepGE AND ARNOLD. 
Journalists and authors as well as teachers have a 
professional interest in the grammatical characteristics 
of English usage. The power of the daily press is one 
of the strongest influences at work to modify language 
idioms. Brevity and force are the qualities chiefly 
sought, and in the effort to gain these many a newspaper 
writer seems to indorse the sentiment of Thomas Jef- 
ferson who wrote,“ Whenever by small grammatical 
negligence the energy of the idea can be condensed or a 
word be made to stand for a sentence, I hold grammati- 
cal rigor in contempt.” 
Possessive cases not used by the older writers, such 
as “Boston’s mayor,” “Chicago’s city government,’” 
are often seen in the daily papers. Even phrases of 
several words sometimes receive the sign, as, “The 
Pacific Coast storm’s havoc.” (N. Y. Tribune), Such 
expressions have conciseness in their favor, though they 
mark a wide departure from the principle given in 
some of the older books that personality is necessary 
to the true possessive idea. The growing frequency 
of the split infinitive whenever logical precision or 
compactness of phrase can be secured thereby is largely 
due to journalistic practice. The radical tendencies 
of the daily press are undoubtedly carried too far. But 
in spite of some carelessness and some objectionable
-P-A-G-E-369
Some Words to Writers 353 
disregard of linguistic purity, American newspaper 
English has steadily grown in strength and incisiveness, 
so that it has been justly described as “a limpid, strong, 
simple and fairly admirable vehicle of thought.” 
But although a journalist can perhaps afford to be a 
little less conservative than a teacher in regard to new 
language forms, yet for him also the general rule is a 
safe one: 
“Be not the first by whom the new is tried, 
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.” 
Within a recent period the proposed establishment 
of schools of journalism, or of college courses for jour- 
nalists, has emphasized the idea that writers can have 
training for their work. It may be said that the studies 
for a journalist are of general rather than technical 
character. Yet there is certainly a choice among 
general subjects to be studied if one would prepare 
himself for the work of a writer. Grammatical knowl- 
edge is, indeed, far from being a main requisite for 
successful writing. But given “a call to write,” the 
“sense for news,” the terseness and originality of 
thought that produce a “telling style,’’ and the general 
common-sense that gives adaptability to the needs of a 
given paper or class of readers, it is still possible for a 
journalist’s work to be greatly marred by a lack of 
grammatical knowledge or by carelessness in sentence 
constructions. 
The work of the book writer is more deliberate than 
that of the journalist and requires still greater care in
-P-A-G-E-370
  354 Grammar and Its Reasons 
  style and grammatical construction. Imperfections 
of grammar that may be to a degree pardonable in a 
daily newspaper would effectually kill a more dignified 
effort at bookmaking. Authors, even more than 
journalists, cannot afford to undervalue the need of 
familiarity with all the tests of grammatical correctness 
that can be applied to their work. 
Even for the technical forms of a written paper, 
grammatical knowledge is required. Punctuation is 
dependent upon grammar. Marks of punctuation 
are simply the mechanical means of interpreting the 
grammatical relations of the sentence. Even for this, 
the most formal part of a writer’s work, a knowledge 
of grammar must lie at the basis. 
Many journalistic writers are led into their work 
by force of circumstances rather than premeditated 
choice. Employment on some country paper is often 
the first step toward the higher walks of journalism, 
and there are hosts of country editors and local re- 
porters who have drifted into their profession without 
college training or any extended courses of study. 
For these and for other busy writers compendiums of 
grammar seem to be needed that are neither so element- 
ary as the ordinary school text-books of grammar, nor 
so profound as most of the works on philology. There 
are certain flagrant errors that occur so often in the 
work of young or careless writers that they become a 
weariness to the more experienced editors or critics 
on whom devolves the task of correcting the imperfect 
manuscript. To meet such cases various lists of
-P-A-G-E-371
  Some Words to Writers 355 
“Don’ts” for writers have been compiled, as William 
Cullen Bryant’s once famous Index Expurgatorius, 
which, however, condemned some things that would 
now pass without criticism. “Is being done,” for in- 
stance, is now in general use. Some of these “ Don’ts’’ 
belong to the field of diction rather than that of gram- 
mar, but many have a grammatical bearing also. 
Among many “Don’ts” which writers may well pay 
heed to, the following may be noted: 
Don’t use couple for two; lengthy for long; eapect for 
believe; aggravate for irritate; stopped for stayed (He 
stopped at the hotel); past for last (the past two weeks) ; 
less for fewer; without for unless; if for whether; such 
for so; between for among; quite for very or rather (as 
quite pretty; quite means entirely); during for in 
(during means throughout); but what for but; as for 
that (I don’t know as I shall go); as though for as ij. 
(Fill out the ellipsis and see which conjunction is 
needed, as, He walks as [he would walk] if [not though] 
he were tired.) 
Don’t use a plural verb or pronoun after each and every. 
Don’t say and which (unless there are co-ordinate 
clauses with which), or, “Try and do it”? for “'Try to do 
Thi 
Don’t use superfluous words, as, ponder (over); All 
(of) those needles; Come back (again); Where is he 
gone (to)? Don’t speak of a “widow-woman”’ or of 
“new beginners.” 
Don’t use contractions often in writing, and never 
the wrong contraction (as don’t for doesn’t). 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
    356 Grammar and Its Reasons 
Don’t be careless as to the use or the omission of 
articles. 
If connected phrases or clauses require different 
particles or connectives see that each is expressed, 
as, “This is as old as or even older than the other,” 
‘as ” is sometimes erroneously omitted.) 
Say J if you mean I, and not we. The editorial we 
is often abused. 
Don’t mix thou and you pronoun-forms in the same 
piece of writing. This is sometimes done by writers 
of verse. 
Don’t omit pronoun subjects merely for the sake of 
brevity. The telegraphic style (Went to New York; 
consulted with the mayor; attended a committee 
meeting, etc.), is not to be commended. 
Don’t allow a verb to be attracted into a tense that 
does not belong to it as, “He declared the moon was 
made of green cheese,” “He hoped to have gone to 
Europe.” The older writers allowed such attractions 
as giving unity to the sentence, but modern English 
does not favor them. 
If you use a pronoun, either personal or relative, have 
a care that its antecedent and agreements are both 
correct and evident. 
Don’t make quotations carelessly nor use “dangling 
participles,” and before using a parenthetical sentence 
or a long inyolved construction ask yourself whether 
two separate sentences would not better express the 
thought. 
But a writer needs a deeper knowledge of grammar
-P-A-G-E-373
  Some Words to Writers S57 
than is suggested by a list of grammatical “Don’ts” if 
he is to be a discriminating critic of his own writings 
and a master of the tools of his trade. The harder 
questions of syntax are the subtle ones that do not even 
occur to the superficial mind. For these no rules will 
be of much avail. There must be clear discernment 
of all the intrinsic relations of the sentence. Unless 
these are as familiar to the writer as are the hidden 
parts of his engine to the competent machinist it is 
impossible that he should know what is the matter 
with a halting sentence or how to change it so as to give 
it effectiveness. 
It may be said that there have been good writers 
who had no grammatical training, and also that there 
are instances in which an extensive knowledge of phil- 
ology seems to induce erudite sentence forms that are 
fatal to force of expression. John Bright was one of 
the most forcible of writers. General Grant in his 
“Memoirs” showed himself superior as a master of 
style to most of the trained linguists. But both John 
Bright and General Grant had the logical habit of 
mind, however it had been gained. The study of 
grammar is not the only, nor indeed the chief means 
by which a person learns to think logically. Yet it 
is one of the important correctives to that turgid, illog- 
ical manner of thinking which expresses itself in long, 
involved and loosely related sentences that weary and 
confuse the mind of the reader. 
The understanding of difficult grammatical construc- 
tions is no hindrance to simple forms of expression. On
-P-A-G-E-374
  358 - Grammar and Its Reasons 
the contrary, the one who best understands these com- 
plex relationships is the one most likely to choose the 
simple sentence for ordinary purposes, reserving the 
complex constructions for those cases where they are 
really needed. A logical thinker, if he uses a long 
sentence at all, will usually construct it after a very 
simple plan,—perhaps as a sequence of clauses or 
phrases co-ordinate with one another or formed after 
a similar pattern. It has been said that the longest 
sentence known is that of “The House that Jack Built,” 
which is composed chiefly of adjective clauses piled one 
upon another. 
The great principle of style, according to Herbert 
Spencer, is economy of the reader’s attention. This is 
secured, first of all, by having the plan of the sentence 
such as to give perfect clearness of meaning. Perspicu- 
ity and precision are due more to the forms of sentence 
construction than to anything else. An inexperienced 
writer, in reviewing his own work does well to ask 
himself, “Have I made it perfectly evident what is the 
subject of every verb, the antecedent of every pro- 
noun, and the modifying relation of each adjunct 
term? If not, if the reader’s mind is delayed for an 
instant by any doubt as to the relations of ideas in the 
connected thought, attention is distracted and the 
style is weakened. 
The good writer will recognize not only the logical 
relations within a given sentence, but also those which 
bind the sentences themselves into an harmonious 
whole. He must have a keen sense of the idea of and, 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  Some Words to Writers 359 
but, or, ij, because, or therefore, between the successive 
thoughts. He must also know whether this idea will be 
apparent without the medium of an expressed conjunc- 
tion. He needs also many synonymous terms or ex- 
pedients by which he can give variety to his sentence 
connections and avoid the infelicity of the too frequent 
use of the same conjunction. Among the niceties of 
style there is perhaps nothing that distinguishes a good 
writer more than the pertinent use of connectives, mak- 
ing the flow of thought consecutive while avoiding all 
redundancy of expression. 
Many of the specific grammatical points which a 
writer must deal with relate to the question of concord 
or agreement, especially when a collective noun, or a 
“false plural”? (as wages) is used, or when there is a 
hovering sense of either singular or plural. Since most 
verbal forms are neutral in number, cases of agreement 
are so rare that when they occur at all they ought to 
add something to the effect of a sentence and not detract 
from it. If the idea of singularity or plurality is spe- 
cially important it is well that the verb form should 
emphasize this prominence. Thus in “A thousand 
years is as one day” the singular verb gives emphasis 
to the fact that the thousand years is but one period of 
time. 
There are instances in which the mere sound of 
the sentence suggests a disagreement that is a blemish 
to style, even if not strictly a grammatical error, One 
of the best marks of a good writer is that he can evade 
the question of doubtful concord so that the reader will
-P-A-G-E-376
  360 Grammar and Its Reasons 
not be troubled with any questions regarding it. In- 
stead of “Cards were invented to amuse an insane 
king’’ it is better to say “The game of cards was in- 
vented.” Instead of “Damages were awarded,’ it 
may be better to say “The jury awarded damages.” 
A neutral form of the verb can often be substituted for 
the form that requires concord. Thus in “Nine tenths 
of the happiness of mankind depends on,” etc., some 
verb phrase as “must depend,” “will depend,” may 
sometimes be preferable. In “Neither poverty nor 
riches affect (affects) a man’s happiness,” a careful 
writer will often choose a neutral phrase, as, “will 
affect,” “can affect.’ 
The great principle of economy of attention is appli- 
cable here. The writer’s own discriminating judg- 
ment must decide whether grammatical agreement 
shall be brought directly before the reader’s mind, 
or avoided, as not increasing the precision or force 
of the sentence. 
Some of the least satisfactory attempts at concord 
occur in the use of pronouns having both gender and 
number agreements, as, “If any one calls tell (him? 
him or her? them ?) I am not at home.” While literary 
usage has adopted the use of im in such cases (unless 
only women are in the class referred to), grammatical 
fastidiousness sometimes employs the awkward and 
obtrusive him or her, while colloquial disregard of 
grammatical fetters tends more and more to substitute 
them as the preferred neutral form. But an evasive 
expression such as ‘‘Say I am not at home,’’ has its
-P-A-G-E-377
    
Some Words to Writers 361 
own advantages in the situation. “Avoid the appear- 
ance of evil” is a good rule of grammar as well as of 
morals. a 
But among the grammatical questions which engage 
the writer’s attention none are more important or per- 
plexing than those that relate to the order of the parts 
of the sentence. And here few rules can be given. The 
only rule of much value is the general one: Keep the 
parts that are related near together, letting nothing 
intervene that will confuse the mind as to the relation 
that is intended. To keep a relative clause near its 
antecedent, a participial phrase near the noun which 
it limits, and such adverbs as only and even next to the 
words which they modify, these are some of the sim- 
plest points to be observed. But questions of euphony, 
rhythm, emphasis, and agreeable variety in sentence 
forms are also involved in the word order to be chosen. 
An exercise in composition sometimes used in schools 
consists in arranging a sentence in all possible ways 
that are consistent with grammatical correctness and 
then deciding upon the comparative merits of these 
sentence forms. Although the professional writer 
has passed beyond the period for such juvenile exercises, 
his mind must nevertheless be continually performing 
a somewhat similar process regarding the sentences 
that he writes. 
When a sentence contains several adverbial ele- 
ments, either words, phrases or clauses, it may require 
no little study to distribute them most effectively. If 
there are several long adverbial elements one is usually  
-P-A-G-E-378
re ee er eer nee ee, Sea 
362 Grammar and Its Reasons 
found at the beginning of the sentence, as, “After this 
conversation he went at once to the city to look for 
work.” One of the most common ways of effecting an 
inversion is to put an adverb at the beginning, as, 
Now came still evening on. 
Then ensued a lively scene. 
While questions of word order are grammatical _ 
questions, it is by constructive effort rather than by 
ordinary grammatical analysis that they are to be _ 
solved. It is by practice in writing, aided by some 
grammatical tests, that a writer acquires skill in his - 
sentence arrangements. 
The pressure that is often felt by the journalist to 
write rapidly and also in a way to win instant attention, 
gives peculiar temptations to the disregard of gram- 
matical principles. But a writer cannot afford to forget 
that while “ grammatical correctness does not necessarily 
carry with it good style,” it is also emphatically true 
that “good style is impossible without grammatical 
correctness,”

  A BRIEF ENGLISH GRAMMAR 
By 
H. A. Alshouse and Minnie R. Root 
Cloth, 28 Cents 
  
Comprehensive and inclusive, this little book contains 
the essentials of English construction. It is just what is 
needed to give pupils proficiency in grammar. Admirable 
for review in the High School or study in the upper grades 
of elementary classes. 
“The very best, much in little, just the thing we were looking 
for.’—Superintendent Wm. Aldrich; Keokuk, Iowa. 
“A Brief English Grammar exactly fills a needed want in our 
school. The rudiments of English Grammar are concisely set forth. 
There is nothing to confuse the dullest mind, everything is within 
the grasp of the pupil. The exercises are typical and well selected. 
For those who have failed to ‘pass’ this little text is certainly a 
great boon.’—District Superintendent E. E. McIntire, International 
Falls, Minn. 
“I put your Brief English Grammar in the hands of a boy who 
wanted to try the examination but had not made a careful study of 
the subject for two years. He passed with a mark of 82 per cent. 
I think this speaks well for the book. We shall undoubtedly use it 
in our work this year.”—Hugh L, Gillis, Principal Alfred Academy, 
Alfred, N.Y.

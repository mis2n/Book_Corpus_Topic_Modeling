    PREFACE 
Ir has been evident for some time that if manual 
training is to take its proper place among the 
other subjects of the school curriculum it must 
be taught by methods which, while giving due 
prominence to the practical usefulness of the 
subject learned, will develop the general intelli- 
gence of the pupil. 
This is the aim the authors have kept steadily 
in view throughout the book. By linking the 
classroom with the laboratory and workshop they 
have provided the pupil with a course of manual 
work which will increase his stock of general 
information, and at the same time make it evident 
that the knowledge acquired is capable of producing 
visible results of a useful and valuable kind. 
The construction of science models, which forms 
an important portion of this course, has been 
found to lead to exceptionally good and careful 
work, especially in the case of boys in secondary 
schools, who have to use the apparatus afterwards.

vi PREFACE 
The pupil should keep a notebook in which 
to record his observations and answers to the 
questions. The master should make a point of 
examining these books every week. 
It is hoped that candidates for the Examinations 
of the City and Guilds of London Institute, the 
Board of Examinations of the Educational Hand- 
work Associatiom, and the National Union of 
Teachers will find the book of great service in 
preparing for the Manual Training Certificates.

drawing-board is fixed by means of cleats, which 
allow the board to be easily removed. Part of 
the diagram can be traced out on the drawing- 
paper when the board is in position, and the 
parallelogram afterwards completed to scale. The 
resultant is obtained by measuring the length of 
the diagonal, each unit of length representing the 
unit of weight decided upon when commencing

Solder a rather thick copper wire to the middle of 
each piece underneath, as shown, one 24” long and 
the other 30” long, and a short one from top left 
hand binding-screw to brass plate of 8” long. 
Each piece of brass should be filed across the 
middle, so that the wire, when soldered, lies flush 
with the surface. Drill holes near the ends of the 
brass pieces large enough to carry a binding-screw. 
Also drill smaller holes at D and E. Place the 
pieces on the board so that the inner edges of B 
and C are exactly 50 centimetres apart, and mark 
the position of the holes by pushing a bradawl 
through ; then mark a place on the board at the 
points where the wires spring from the pieces. 
Remove the brass pieces, and bore holes through 
the board at the marked places. 
Now solder a piece of German silver wire to the 
ends of the left and right brass pieces, so that it 
is exactly 50 centimetres long between them. 
Pass the end of the wire attached to A through 
the hole in the board at that point; pull the wire, 
and then fasten the brass in place by means of the 
binding-screws M andN. Similarly, after passing 
the wires from the middle of B and C through the 
holes, fasten one end of each piece by the binding- 
screws at Rand S. Now place the other ends of B

This consists of an upright frame of wood, about 
3’ high. It is supported by a ledge at the back, 
so that it can be used on ‘the edge of the 
bench. 
Almost at the top is a platform of hard wood, 
provided with a slot. The platform is screwed to 
the support. On this platform the knife-edge of 
the pendulum rests. The pendulum is a bar of 
wood about 4° long and 1” square. It is cut away 
at the top, so that it can swing freely in the slot 
of the platform. Holes at right angles tothe plane 
of oscillation are bored in the pendulum. 
A silk thread, to which a double conical bob is 
attached, is connected with the pendulum, and 
passes over two light pulleys, as seen above. 
Small boxwood pulleys, bushed with glass tubing 
and pivoted on steel hat-pins with large heads, can 
be used.

of the screws are slightly inclined towards the end 
of the board. At the other end of the board fix a 
small pulley and an iron ‘wrest-pin,’ the latter 
inclined at an angle of 45°. The pulley is to be 
near enough to the end of the board to allow a 
wire passing over it to hang freely, and of sucha 
height that the wire rests upon, but is only just 
deflected by, the edge of the bridge. The wrest- 
pin is to fit the hole stiffly, so that it may be turned 
with a key. Two hard-wood bridges are to be 
cut, 3° x 14" x 2"; the upper side of each bridge is 
bevelled to a blunt edge, and along this edge is 
fixed a stout brass wire for the stretched wires to 
bear upon. 
Glue the bridges in position equidistant from the 
ends of the board, with the centres of the brass 
wires exactly 30” apart. Make a scale between 
the bridges 30” long and divided into 3”, and 
fix it on the board between the bridges. 
Twist a loop at the end of a steel or other wire, 
about 3° 6” long, and slip it over the head of one 
of the screws on the board. Pass the other end 
through the wrest-pin. 
Over the head of the other screw loop a similar 
piece of wire. Pass the other end of the wire over 
the pulley, and at the end make a loop from which 
to hang weights. 
Make two movable bridges }” higher than 
those at the end, and face these also with brass 
wire.

cut, measuring 2” across. A small hole is bored 
in the centre of each button, and one of them is 
provided with a very small brass screw and nut, 
shown apart as FF. One side of the buttonhole 
is countersunk, so that the head of the screw will

carbon. Cut the surface of the buttons criss- 
crosswise with a _ three-cornered file. When 
mounted in the receiver, the surfaces of the buttons 
face each other. Cut a small washer of felt or 
flannel and place it in the bottom of the hole in 
block A. Line the side of the hole with a narrow 
strip of the same material; then place the button 
in the hole, pass the screw through the button and 
through A, and make it fast with nut. Place a 
thin flat washer under the nut, and twist a fine 
piece of insulated copper wire for connections. 
Solder all joints whenever practicable.

RECEIVER OF TELEPHONE. 
The tube A is made from a piece of curtain-pole 
1}” diameter and 33” long. A hole 2” diameter is 
bored through its entire length, and through this 
hole the magnet passes. 
At one end of the tube a wooden pill-box (C) is 
made fast with glue, or a wooden cup may be 
turned on a lathe and attached to the magnet 
tube. 
If a pill-box be used, it must be 2}” in diameter, 
and at four equidistant places inside the box small 
lugs of wood (D) are to be glued fast. Into these 
lugs the screws employed to hold the cap are 
driven,
-P-A-G-E-149
    RECEIVER OF TELEPHONE 45 
The cap E is made of thin wood, fibre, or hard 
rubber. It is provided with a thin rim or collar 
to separate its inner side from the face of the 
disc K, which is made of very thin iron. Four 
small holes are bored near the edge of this cap, so 
that the screws which hold it fast to cup C may 
pass through them. The magnet B is a piece of 
hard steel #” in diameter and 4}” long.

shown by dotted lines may be placed in grooves, 
cut on the under side. These binding-posts 
can be bought; or brass end-fasteners from sash 
curtain-rods can be used as substitutes. 
The current-breaker (C) is cut from a piece of 
soft tin. One end is soldered to a piece of soft 
iron (D), and the other to the head of a machine 
screw (FE). 
The ends of the spool for the coil are of thin 
white-wood. Besides the holes for the core, there

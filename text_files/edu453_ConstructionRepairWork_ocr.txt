  EDITORS’ INTRODUCTION 
Farm construction and repair work has been during recent years rapidly 
finding a place as a part of the instruction in vocational agriculture of 
secondary grade. This work in its initial stages was naturally largely of 
the manual training type. Gradually there has been a growing recogni- 
tion of the importance of centering the instruction in this phase of farm- 
ing around the needs of the farm. 
The author of this volume is peculiarly qualified to make a contribu- 
tion to the more complete development of this aspect of vocational in- 
struction in agriculture from this viewpoint. He made one of the pioneer 
studies dealing with the needs of the farmer for knowledge and skill in 
farm construction and repair work. In addition he brought to the prepa- 
ration of this text an unusual background of trade experience, technical 
training, teaching and supervisory experience, and broad professional 
training. 
The content is so organized that the teacher can easily correlate the 
instruction with any given phase of agriculture that the pupils may be 
pursuing, or it can readily be adapted to meet the demands of their home 
farms. This fact should make it possible for teachers to overcome the 
rather pronounced tendency that exists to make farm construction and 
repair work a course separate from the other courses in agriculture. It 
should be made an integral part of the instruction in agriculture. 
The editors desire to direct attention to the fact that the material pre- 
sented has been tried out in the author’s classes at Pennsylvania State 
College, demonstrating its value as a text for students of agriculture. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the drawings are also the work of the author. 
In the organization of the teaching content of the several chapters an 
effort has been made to present it in order of the learning difficulties 
involved. ‘ 
Teachers who use this as a textbook and others who may use it asa 
reference book should find the bills of materials and the directions of 
assistance to them. The author and editors will appreciate criticisms 
and suggestions from any who may use this volume.

PREFACE 
TuE object of this book is to give concrete help to those who are inter- 
ested in practical construction and repair work as it pertains to various 
kinds of farming. While the book has been written primarily for voca- 
tional agricultural students in secondary schools and colleges, it should 
also be helpful to farmers or others who are engaged in practical plant 
or animal production. 
The projects have been arranged according to major divisions com- 
monly observed in teaching technical agriculture. This has been done 
so that the shop instruction may readily be correlated with such major 
phases of agriculture as poultry husbandry or horticulture. Other 
things being equal, it is felt that the shop instruction should clearly 
reflect the major phase of agriculture that is being studied at the time. 
An effort has been made to present the subject from a national rather 
than a sectional standpoint. Projects are included, therefore, that have 
been worked out in many States. In making the selections preference 
has been given to designs and to data that have demonstrated their 
worth, that have the approval of successful farmers and specialists, 
and for which there is more than a local demand. 
The arrangement of this book is such that sections of it may well be 
used for short-unit courses of instruction. For this purpose such sec- 
tions may be selected as are vital to the specific needs of the special 
groups of learners. For other classes instructors may wish to amplify 
_ or expand the material presented. This can be done by using the ref- 
ererices contained in the text. It is hoped that students may have access 
to a good deal of this reference material. 
Grateful acknowledgment is due to many former colleagues of the 
author at the Pennsylvania State College, to associates in the Penn- 
sylvania State Department of Public Instruction, and to many teachers, 
directors, supervisors, and specialists. The author feels especially in- 
debted to Mr. William S. Taylor, formerly Head of the Department of ° 
Rural Life, of the Pennsylvania State College, and now Assistant 
Director, the Teacher Bureau, Pennsylvania State Department of 
Public Instruction, and to Mr. L. H. Dennis, State Director of Voca- 
tional Education for Pennsylvania.

CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 
FOR THE FARM 
CHAPTER I 
THE SCHOOL SHOP 
Purpose. Boys who study vocational agriculture should have access 
toaschool shop. This shop should have facilities for instruction in such 
practical construction and repair work as successful farmers of the given 
locality undertake. In addition to instruction that can be given in such 
school shops every effort needs to be made to supplement this by similar 
work on the home farm or elsewhere. 
While one purpose of the shop instruction is to give certain physical 
skills with tools and to impart technical knowledge that is needed, this 
is by no means the dominating aim. The school shop offers exceptional 
opportunities for developing good citizenship. In the handling of tools 
and materials, and in the execution of shop projects, pupils learn how to 
work and to think not only as individuals, but as members of a group. 
Fundamental ideals about work, coéperation with others, and the rights 
and welfare of the group are probably learned better in the shop than in 
the classroom. 
Kinds of work that should be undertaken. The kinds of work that 
should be undertaken in a school shop depend upon the purpose of in- 
struction. If it is purposed to give instruction primarily for appreciation 
and for vocational guidance, it may well be that shop projects can be 
included that would not be advisable if the instruction is to be vocational 
in nature. The opposite of this may also be true. 
From the standpoint of vocational agriculture the shop projects 
undertaken should be such as successful farmers perform in the pursuit 
of their vocation. This differs somewhat in various sections of the 
country, and with the type of farming that is followed. 
The successful teacher makes it a point not only to know the require- 
ments of his community at large, but selects shop projects on the basis 
of the individual needs on each pupil’s home farm, and from the stand- 
point of giving broad, useful training. 
Farm blacksmithing. Farm blacksmithing can well be taught as an 
integral part of the course in construction and repair work in a composite 
shop as described under ‘“‘Shop lay-out.” For information relative to 
tools and materials to be used see the Index.

  2 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
- In the State of Pennsylvania ! twenty per cent of the successful 
farmers use taps and dies, nineteen per cent shoe horses, or replace 
horseshoes, fourteen per cent have forges on their farms, weld and 
temper steel. The same percentages may not hold for other States, 
but it is probable that they are fairly typical of large sections of the 
United States. 
With such data as a basis the conclusion is reached that relatively less

attention needs to be given to teaching farm blacksmithing than to 
teaching projects largely involving wood. This should not be taken to 
mean that farm blacksmithing is not essential to a well-balanced cur- 
riculum. 
A great deal of farm blacksmithing should be in the nature of drilling, 
punching, cold and hot bending, and simple welding and tempering. 
Figures 9, 10, and 11 show typical farm blacksmithing, such as is being 
done in the vocational agricultural classes in Pennsylvania. 
Farm blacksmithing should grow out of, and dovetail with the farm 
shop projects that are being carried out by the pupils. The iron work 
is therefore not listed separately in this book. 
Work in concrete. Cement is used as a material of construction by 
thirty-one per cent of the successful farmers in Pennsylvania. It has 
grown rapidly in favor among farmers as well as with builders and 
engineers. Information regarding tools used in concrete work and data 
on proportioning and on methods of handling conerete are given else- 
where in this volume. 
Cement is a valuable material of construction that is beginning to

receive the attention it rightly deserves in courses in construction and 
repair work for agricultural students. 
Leather work. In teaching farm shop work, attention should also be 
given to simple repair and construction work on harness, saddles, and 
belting. Basic training can be given in a short time, and should be a 
part of the modern curriculum for farm boys. 
Rope work. Some instruction may well be given to the end that 
students may know how to make knots, hitches, and splices such as are 
used by farmers.

  4 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
Sheet-metal work. In a complete shop a little instruction in soldering 
and in pipe-fitting will prove of interest and value to students. 
Materials to be used. An analysis of the construction and repair 
work done on 365 farms in Pennsylvania! shows that the bulk of such 
work is in wood, but that other materials such as concrete, and iron and 
steel are likewise used. In Pennsylvania seventy per cent of the farmers 
carry on general farming. In view of the fact that this is rather repre- 
sentative of the country at large, and from such data as there are avail- 
able, it is certain that several materials of construction should be used in 
the school shop rather than limit the teaching to woodwork as is too 
frequently the case. 
Cost of material. One argument sometimes advanced in favor of 
making small, miniature models of things is that material is expensive. 
This is true, but cost of material should prove no handicap. There are 
several ways in which material may be supplied without cost to the board 
of education. The first method is to have pupils or parents pay for all 
expensive material that is used in making or repairing objects that they 
keep upon completion. If shop projects are selected that fit in with 
educational requirements as well as with the needs of the home farm, 
there should be no difficulty in getting material with which to work. A 
second plan that is used in exceptional cases, as in the case of boys from 
town who do not live on farms, is to have them work on objects for other 
farmers, or for the school. If the objects are to be kept by the school, 
the material should be paid for out of school funds. A third method is 
to build such objects as self-feeders for hogs, or for poultry, as class 
projects, and sell them to farmers either on an individual order basis, or to 
the highest bidder at some school program to which parents and friends 
may be invited. Any of these methods or combinations of them may be 
used to advantage, and the actual cost of material to the local school dis- 
trict can be kept as low as circumstances may require. 
Type of shop. The school shop that is most economical and at the 
same time satisfactory for rural districts is what may be termed the 
“composite” or “general”? shop. By this is meant a shop that has - 
several units of equipment for working materials such as wood, cement, 
iron, and leather, rather than equipment for only one kind of material 
such as wood or steel. Some of the advantages of the composite shop are 
as follows: 
1. The composite shop is less expensive to equip than several separate 
unit shops which might be used to offer instruction in the same 
materials. 
2. It provides a maximum of essential equipment for a minimum cost. 
3. It makes possible a richer course of study than is possible in a one- 
unit shop.

  6 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
5. It sustains interest on the part of learners because projects can be 
completed even though they involve several different kinds of 
material, such as wood and steel. It therefore makes for effective 
instruction. 
6. The composite shop may well be used for purposes of industrial 
arts education as well as for vocational agricultural instruction. 
Shop lay-out. From a practical standpoint, it is recognized that in 
many instances the lay-out of the shop as far as size and location are 
concerned is definitely fixed. The teacher can simply adapt the available 
space to his needs as best he may. Whenever possible the shop should 
have an outside ground floor entrance, and a door wide enough to admit 
farm machinery upon which work may need to be done. 
It is often satisfactory to place shop benches along the walls of the 
shop so that the central floor space can be used for assembling, or for 
work of other kinds. 
The wood-working equipment can be grouped in one part of the shop, 
the metal-working equipment in another, while still other parts are 
reserved for concrete, sheet-metal, or leather work. The amount of 
space devoted to each of these need not be very large since the idea is to 
have just enough equipment for a class of not over twenty pupils. Not 
all pupils will be working with any one material at a given time, so that 
instead of having equipment for twenty pupils in wood-working, the 
shop can contain equipment for ten. Instead of a separate forge room 
with equipment for twenty pupils, the composite shop may contain one 
or two forges only. Near these there may be a metal-working bench 
equipped with a blacksmith’s vise, and a machinist’s bench vise. Work 
with taps and dies can also be done on this bench. About three pupils 
can work at such a bench to advantage. In another part of the shop, 
not far away, there may be a pipe vise fastened either to a bench, a post, 
or to a portable horse. Here simple pipe-fitting work can be done by 
two or three of the pupils. Still another part of the shop can be used 
for cement work, and some harness repairing and rope work can be 
taught elsewhere in the same shop. In this way a class of twenty pupils 
may be given basic instruction in practical construction and repair work 
that is worth while to the extent pursued, and which does not need to be 
justified in terms of deferred values that may be claimed for such in- 
struction. The pupils should select projects which will assure good 
training with all the equipment in the shop. 
Size of projects to be undertaken. Farm boys should be taught to 
do the work that arises in practical farming. The projects should have 
real value in the minds of the pupils as well as in the teachers’ estima- 
tion. Small models of things should be discouraged in favor of full- 
sized jobs. A boy may get certain skill and knowledge from making a 
small model of a farm gate, but he will get better and more effective 
instruction for farming by making a full-sized gate 14 feet long. Planing

a board 14 feet long is quite different from planing a board 1 foot long, 
and using real bolts and hinges is different from using miniature imita- 
tions. 
' Standards of workmanship. The standards of workmanship for 
repair and construction work that is taught as a part of the vocational 
agricultural curriculum should be the same as those that obtain for this 
work in good farm practice. It needs to be kept in mind that the funda-

mental purpose is to prepare for successful farming, and not for car- 
pentry, cabinet-making, blacksmithing, or garage work. 
Method in teaching construction and repair work. Both the subject- 
matter of instruction and the 
method of teaching should 
| be governed by fundamental 
educational considerations. 
The instruction should aim to 
a. Develop skill in con- 
struction and repair 
work. 
b. Give information about 
tools, processes, mate- 
rials, and designs used 
in construction and re- 
pair work. 
ce. Develop in pupils ini- 
tiative and the power 
to think independently. 
d. Guide pupils that their

rowly selfish. 
e. Develop the spirit of codperation. 
f. Lead pupils to have the problem-solving attitude. 
The project method is one 
that is particularly well 
adapted to the realization of 
the aims stated for the fol- 
lowing reasons: : 
a. It offers opportunity for | 
individual purposing and 
planning. - 
. It enlists, at the outset, 
the pupil’s interest in the | 
thing to be done, or act 
to be performed. 
¢c. It gives opportunity for,

the “stay at your bench Mr. J. Jacobs, instructor. 
and do as you are told” method. 
d. The method is pedagogically superior to the exercise method of shop 
instruction in that the psychological rather than the so-called logical 
order (as conceived by trained adult minds) is followed.

e. It emphasizes immediate as distinguished from deferred values. 
To put it tersely, it involves a minimum of ‘cold storage’’ process. 
The project method in farm shop work is analogous to the same 
method in technical agriculture. It requires the pupil under guidance 
to take the initiative in purposing a given piece of work that he later 
plans and executes. The pupil keeps records of time and material and 
seeks to develop general truths from the specific work undertaken. 
Projects in farm shop work cannot be as large in terms of time or labor 
required as can projects in a major enterprise in farming, such as crop 
or animal production. They must be limited to the time allowed for 
such work in the general plan of agricultural education. 
Shop equipment. The minimum amount of equipment that will be 
needed for effective instruction must necessarily vary. Some States can 
require more equipment in their schools than others. The list given 
in Table 1 is to be considered merely as a suggestive list for a composite 
shop.

CHAPTER II 
TOOLS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 
THERE is as much difference in design and utility for given purposes in 
most tools intended for construction and repair work as there is in 
plows or in cream separators. Hand tools like farm machinery have 
become somewhat standardized. The following descriptions are given 
in order to aid persons in selecting tools that are suited to the needs that 
arise on the farm. 
A. Tools for working wood. 
1. The brace illustrated in Fig. 13 is used for boring wood with 
auger bits, for drilling wood or metal with twist drills, for 
  
    
Fig. 11. Farm BuacKsMITHING DONE By Popits ar TowAnDA, Pa.

reaming, and for driving screws where more power is needed 
than can be applied with a screwdriver. 
Braces are made either with or without ratchets. A ratchet 
is an attachment (usually enclosed on a brace) which permits 
the operator to use only a part of the “swing” if he desires, as 
is sometimes necessary in boring holes in places where access 
is difficult, or the working room is limited. This may happen 
in case a hole needs to be bored ina place in which there is little 
access or working room. 
By the “swing” of a brace is meant the diameter of the dis-
-P-A-G-E-23
  TOOLS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 13 
tance through which the hand passes in one complete revolu- 
tion or turn of the brace. For example, a brace having a ten- 
inch swing will measure five inches from the center of the 
handle used for turning the brace to the center line of the bit 
or drill used. A ratchet brace having a ten-inch swing will be 
found very desirable. 
. Bits and drills. The auger bits commonly used in braces are 
made in sizes varying by one sixteenth of an inch. Common 
sizes run from three sixteenths of an inch to one and one-half 
inches. Farmers are likely to need most of the following sizes: 
yl", 6", 4", %"", %"", 1. The diameter of auger bits is stamped 
on the shank in terms of sixteenths. For example, 10 stands 
for ten sixteenths. For larger sizes it is desirable to have an 
expansive bit which may be adjusted to cut from seven eighths 
of an inch to three inches. 
Twist drills may be purchased in varying diameters and with 
bit-stock shanks which fit the brace. 
For driving large screws it is well to have a screwdriver bit 
with a bit-stock shank. 
Gimlet bits are available with bit-stock shanks. A combina- 
tion gimlet bit and countersink are also obtainable. It is use- 
ful when a number of screws of a given length and diameter 
are to be used. 
. Carborundum and oilstones. Carborundum stones are made 
in a number of shapes and sizes and in various degrees of fine- 
ness. They are very good as tools may be sharpened more 
quickly on them than on oilstones. Carborundum stones act 
quickest when used dry, that is, without oils. A carborundum 
stone 8” X 2’”” X 1” with combination faces (two of different 
degrees of fineness) is handy and useful. 
Oilstones likewise are made in a number of shapes end sizes, 
and vary in hardness and fineness. A light lubricating oil, or 
one part kerosene to two parts light motor oil works nicely on 
oilstones. 
. Chisels. Chisels are made with tanged and with socket handles. 
The latter hold up best under heavy usage such as they fre- 
quently get on the farm. For general farm use firmer socket 
chisels with leather or with metal tips are desirable. The sizes 
likely to be most in demand are 4’, 4’, and 1’. 
. Drawing knife. A drawing knife having an eight-inch blade 
will save labor at times. It is ordinarily not as necessary as 
are saws, planes, and other tools that might be mentioned. 
. Files. The majority of farmers could use to advantage a greater 
variety of files than they ordinarily possess. Files are so cheap 
that it pays to have several different kinds on hand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24

The following deserve special attention: 
a. Mill file, single cut, 8” or 10” 
b. Three-square file 5’’ special for cross-cut hand saw 
ce. Three-square file 5’’ regular taper for rip-cut hand saw 
d. Auger-bit file : 
e. Cabinet or wood-working rasp, 8’’ or 
f. Half-round bastard cut file, 8’’ 
7. Grinder or grindstone. Carborundum or other bench grinders,

that is grinders that fasten to work benches, are desirable. 
Tools can be sharpened more quickly on them than on sand- 
stone grindstones. The latter are cheaper and last longer as a 
rule, but either may be used to advantage on the farm. 
8. Hammers. Claw-hammers are made bell-faced and flat-faced.

The slight crown on the bell-faced hammer tends to keep the 
wood from being cut in case the hammer misses the nail head or 
the latter is driven in below the surface of the wood. Adze-eye 
bell-faced claw-hammers are recommended because the adze- 
eye strengthens the handle. Hither a curved claw or a straight 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
claw-hammer may be used. One weighing about 16 ounces will 
give satisfaction for all-round work. 
9. Hand aze, or hatchet. Hither a hand axe or a hatchet will prove 
to be of considerable service in a variety of construction and 
repair work on the farm. A hand axe having a blade four or 
four and one-half inches wide is satisfactory. 
10. Level. A level is indispensable when buildings of any size are 
to be erected, or when establishing grades for sidewalks and 
terraces. For farm use a level about 30’ long, with adjustable 
  Fie. 14. Types or PLanEs

bubbles is desirable. In case of breakage it is easier to “true- 
up” the new bubble when the fittings are adjustable, than if 
they are not. 
1l. Nail set. Nail sets are made with different sized points varying 
from those designed to set very thin brads or nails to spikes. 
The cup-pointed nail sets are preferred for the smaller brads 
and nails as the “cup” on the end of the set tends to slip less 
and therefore will “follow” brads and nails better than will a flat- 
pointed nail set. 
12. Planes. 
a. The block plane. Block planes are small planes made of iron 
or steel. They usually vary in length from 3% to 7% inches,
-P-A-G-E-27
  TOOLS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 17 
and in width of cutting blade from 1% to 1% inches. Block 
planes are used primarily for planing end-grain — that is, 
across the grain of lumber. For this reason it is desirable 
that block planes have their plane blade set at a lower angle 
than smoothing planes. Some block planes have their blades 
at lower angles than do others. Since block planes are also 
used for gouging out irregular surfaces, it is well to have such 
planes in rather small sizes. An adjustable throat in a block 
plane is not necessary for the ordinary work of the farm. A 
lever or screw by means of which the depth of the blade can 
readily be regulated is desirable. 
. Planes for smoothing and jointing. From the standpoint of 
construction there are three principal kinds of planes that 
are used for plane surfaces. The first of these is the wood 
bottom plane, with wood wedges to hold the plane blade in 
place. This style of plane was used for many years but is 
not as satisfactory as either of the two styles about to be 
described, largely because it takes more time to adjust it and 
more time to sharpen it since the blades are thicker than in 
later styles of planes. 
The second style is that having a wood bottom with an 
iron or steel throat and adjusting screws. It is an improve- 
ment over the wood bottom plane. It costs less than the 
iron plane. 
The third style of plane is made almost entirely of metal, 
the knob and handle alone being of wood. The Bailey and 
the Stanley Bed-rock planes illustrate the construction. 
See Fig. 14. This style of plane is probably the best on the 
market. The price is high, but not more so than other 
planes when durability and service are considered. Adjust- 
ments are easy to make in these planes. Hither plain or 
corrugated bottoms may be had in the iron planes. There 
is little difference between them. 
Sizes of Iron Planes 
Note : These sizes vary somewhat according to the make, 
and wood planes differ in size from those of iron.

tain sizes. If a farmer has a block plane and a jack plane he 
can get along without the others. H he is mechanically inclined 
and has considerable use for planes he may want to add a 
smooth plane to his tool kit. 
13. Saws. Hand saws are made in a variety of styles and for special 
purposes, as for example, for pruning and for cutting meat.

man cross-cut saw.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
14. TOOLS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 19 
may be grouped into two classes, namely, cross-cut saws and 
rip-saws. Cross-cut saws have teeth specially designed to cut 
easily across the grain of lumber while rip-saws have teeth made 
specially for ripping, that is cutting lengthwise of boards or 
with the grain of lumber. 
Cross-cut, rip-saws, and sharpening devices for them will be 
discussed more fully under “ Fitting or filing saws.” For gen- 
eral farm work an eight or ten point cross-cut saw 26 inches 
long is desirable. A rip-saw may well be 5% to 7 point, and 
26” long. By “point” is meant the number of tooth points per 
inch of blade. 
Back saws are not suited for general work such as farmers 
have to do. 
Squares. The standard framing square as used by carpenters 
is the best all-round square for farm use. Framing squares 
have a blade 24’’ long by 2” wide, and a tongue 16’’ long and 
12" wide. The cheaper squares are made in bright steel 
finish. They will give good service if kept oiled so that rust 
does not get on them. 
A try-square is a smaller square which is handy when narrow 
lumber, such as flooring, ceiling, and sheathing is to be squared 
off. A try-square made entirely of metal and having a 6” or 
8” blade makes a good tool of this kind. 
For those who desire an additional square a combination 
square with: a ten or twelve inch blade is recommended. 
The following is a suggestive list of wood-working tools that 
usually are needed on the farm. This list as others given may 
be added to or may be reduced as circumstances may warrant. 
It will be appreciated that no two farmers will want to purchase 
exactly the same outfit of tools.

. Tools for pipe-fitting. 
Steam and water, and in some sections gas, are finding their way to the 
farmsteads. Farmers should be able to make the common repairs, 
and do simple construction jobs with pipe. The tools required for 
this are not many, and will prove a good investment, as much damage 
may result through lack of timely repair work. ~

various states, but it is safe to conclude that they are less frequently 
used than they used to be. Better highways and the automobile 
make it possible to depend in many instances on the town blacksmith.

TOOLS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 25 
G. Tools used in painting. 
1. Paint brushes. A paint brush is the only tool that is absolutely 
necessary to do a job of painting. It is usually desirable to have 
brushes of several sizes. The best brush for plain painting is a 
round brush about 134” or 2’ in diameter, having bristles four 
to six inches long. When new, tie a string or rag around the 
top to reduce the effective length of the bristles. Another type 
of brush that gives satisfaction for general work is an oval brush 
about 2!4’’ wide. Flat brushes from one to five inches in width 
are used a good deal. Paint can be spread rapidly with a brush 
four or five inches wide, but the paint is not likely to be rubbed 
on well as is the case with round or oval brushes. 
For painting window and door screens, sash, and narrow 
mouldings small round brushes with either convex ends or with 
chisel points are used. 
2. Care of paint brushes. Paint brushes may be made to last for 
years on the farm if properly taken care of. The following 
points should be kept in mind: 
a. Brushes that are to be laid aside for some time should be 
thoroughly cleaned. 
Use kerosene, or turpentine, though kerosene is cheaper, 
for brushes used in oil paints, oil stains and varnish. 
If possible finish by rinsing in gasoline, or by washing in 
warm soapy water. 
Use denatured alcohol to clean brushes used in shellac, 
alcohol stain, or any preparation having an alcohol ve- 
hicle. 
b. If a brush has become more or less hard with paint it may 
be cleaned with most good varnish removers. Varnish re- 
movers are strong solvents used to remove paint and varnish 
for purposes of refinishing. 
ce. To keep brushes for short intervals: 
A brush used in oil paint may be kept over night by wrap- 
ping it tightly in paper. 
A brush used in shellac, varnish, or varnish stain should 
be cleaned after use or stored properly. 
d. Store brushes in covered pails or jars containing 
linseed oil, turpentine or kerosene for brushes used in 
these vehicles, and substitute 
denatured alcohol for brushes used in alcohol. vehicles. 
e. Hang brushes so that their tips do not touch the bottom of 
the pail or jar, as this would destroy the shape and effective- 
ness of brushes. 
3. Putty knife. Ifa putty knife is not at hand one can be made by 
filing or grinding a square end on an old case-knife.

4. Scraper. A scraper may be made from an old saw blade or other 
piece of sheet-metal. 
5. Oily waste. Rags or cotton waste soaked with oil, turpentine, 
japan, or alcohol should never be left lying around as spontane- 
ous combustion may take place. Many a fire has been started 
that way.

CHAPTER III 
SHARPENING TOOLS: 
A GREAT deal of pleasure and satisfaction are derived through the use of 
tools that are in proper condition for the work for which they are in- 
tended. Aside from this pleasure it is good business to work with sharp 
edge tools, as time, human energy, and patience are conserved by using 
tools that are in good working condition. 
A precaution that may well be observed by all people in sharpening 
tools consists in carefully examining all tools used to see just how the 
manufacturer has adjusted and sharpened them. The same slant or 
pitch that has been given them by the manufacturers should nearly al- 
ways be maintained. 
A. General principles. 
There are certain fundamental principles to be observed in sharpen- 
ing edge tools. 
a. Turn the grindstone, emery, or carborundum wheel toward the 
edge to be ground instead of away from it. 
Turning the stone toward the edge to be ground favors rapid, 
easy grinding, and reduces chances of having a rounded or a 
wire edge. 
b. Time is usually saved by using stones of different degrees of 
fineness — one to “rough-off” the tool and the other to smooth 
off or whet the cutting edge. 
ce. If high-speed wheels, such as geared bench grinders, are used, 
be careful not to apply too much pressure on the tool as it may 
become heated to the extent of drawing the temper. This is 
evident when a bluish color appears at the edge of the tool where 
it is in contact with the revolving stone. 
d. Always use protective goggles when using high-speed grinders. 
B. Certain edge tools. 
1. Auger bits. An auger-bit file is the best tool to use in sharpening 
auger bits. In the absence of an auger-bit file, the tip of a three- 
square (three-cornered) file used for hand saws can sometimes 
be used. 
Before filing the auger bit, look at it carefully to see how and 
where to file it. Be sure not to file the nibs (Fig. 13) on the 
outer side, If they need sharpening, file them on the inside 
where they were sharpened by the manufacturer. If possible 
keep the nibs as long as when new.
-P-A-G-E-38

  CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
If the cutting lips need sharpening, file them on the underside, 
considering the shank as the top end of the bit. In sharpening 
the cutting lips, as well as other parts of the auger bit, keep the 
same bevel or slant that it has when new. It may happen that 
the auger bit has been run on a nai! and the cutting lips dulled. 
If an auger-bit file is not at hand, and other files are too large to 
file the lips on the under side, then the best thing to do is to file 
the lips on the upper side, making the slant meet the twist of the 
bit. 
In case the lead-screw is stripped or otherwise injured, pass a 
three-square file over the original threads. 
2. Twist drills. Since “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound 
of cure” it is well to use plenty of good lard-oil on twist drills 
when boring cast iron, steel, or other hard substances. 
‘When the drill becomes dull it may be sharpened by using a 
good file — preferably a single-cut mill file — or by grinding. 
The following points may be noted: 
a. If the clearance of a drill is not sufficient, it will not cut. 
This means that the cutting edge should be the lowest edge 
~ on the drill, so that no part of the twist extends below the 
cutting edge as it revolves. 
b. The cutting edges should be straight and at an angle of 59 
degrees to the center line of the drill. If no drill gauge is at 
hand, grind or file so as to keep its original form as closely 
as possible. 
In order to see if the clearance is sufficient, place the drill 
against the inside of the blade of a steel square. Turn the 
drill slowly and note the distance from the point of the drill 
to the end of the ground edge as shown by the reading on the 
tongue of the square. 
3. Screwdriver bits. The side faces of screwdriver bits should be 
ground or filed perfectly flat. The end of the bit should be 
straight and blunt and thin enough to fit into the slots in the 
heads of the screws. The most common mistake in sharpening 
consists in giving the side faces a rounded shape and drawing the 
end of the bit to a sharp thin edge. This is unsatisfactory, as 
the thin edge tends to break or bend, and the curved surface 
tends to force the bit out of the slots in the head of serews when 
much pressure is applied. 
4. Chisels. The angle at which chisels should be ground depends a 
little on the nature of the work they are to perform. For fine work 
the edge may be thinner than for heavy work including the cutting 
of knots. In general an angle of 20 degrees is good. In whet- 
ting, use about 22 to 25 degrees. In other words, whet only the 
cutting edge.
-P-A-G-E-39
  
SHARPENING TOOLS 29 
It is important that chisels be ground only from one side, and 
that the edge be square and straight. 
In whetting, the wire edge may be removed by a few strokes 
with the chisel flat on the oilstone. 
5. Plane blades. Plane blades are sharpened like chisels, with this 
exception: the extreme corners of plane blades are ‘“‘rounded 
off” or ground about %2’’ lower than the main edge, which should 
be straight across. This slight rounding off or lowering of 
corners helps to prevent the plane from “streaking” the surface 
that is being planed. The streaking referred to consists in 
grooves cut below the surface that is desired by the corner or 
corners of a plane blade. 
A block plane bit is rounded or crowned very little, often 
not at all. Smooth plane bits should also have very little 
rounding of the corners. Jack planes and larger planes may be 
crowned a little more, but the amount of crowning given must 
be governed by the work that is to be done. 
6. Shears. Pruning shears and other shears are ground from one 
side only. Follow the bevel put on the tool by the manufac- 
turer. When the surface is ground it should be whetted to a 
smooth, sharp edge. Particular care needs to be exercised that 
shears are not ground on the flat sides that pass each other. 
C. How to joint, set, and file hand saws. 
The processes of jointing, setting, and filing saws go to make up 
what is technically called saw-fitting. Since these three operations 
are distinct they will be described under the separate headings 
mentioned. 
1. Saw-jointing. The tool used is a saw-jointer such as is shown 
in Fig. 22. This figure shows a form of commercial jointer made 
largely of cast iron and two types of wooden, home-made saw- 
jointers that give satisfaction. In the absence of a saw-jointer 
a flat mill file may be passed over the saw. 
The purpose of the saw-jointer is to make the saw teeth of 
uniform length, so that the points will be in the same line. This 
line, by the way, is usually crowned somewhat in hand saws. 
This is done to make the saw work more freely. When a saw 
has been run on a nail, and when because of imperfect filing the 
teeth tend to vary from the slightly crowned line given a saw 
by the manufacturer, jointing is necessary to maintain the 
proper height and line of the teeth. 
The first step in fitting a saw consists in jointing it. Joint 
saws just before each time that they are filed. Place the saw 
in a saw clamp or vise such as is shown in Fig. 15. Keep the 
saw teeth far enough above the clamp to permit the jointer to
-P-A-G-E-40
30 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
pass freely. Pass the jointer over the teeth lightly, taking off 
enough to line up the teeth properly. This usually requires only 
about two strokes, unless the teeth are very irregular in height. 
    3       
Fic. 22. Typrs or Saw-JoinTers 
In this latter case it may not be best to true up the teeth in one 
jointing and filing, but do it by means of two or three separate 
fittings. 
It is important that the jointer, or the flat file if a jointer is 
not at hand, be passed over the saw squarely; that is, at right 
angles to the side of the saw. Unless this is done the saw will 
“run” or cut faster on the side having the longer teeth, thereby 
making it more difficult to saw to a line, especially on material 
two or more inches thick. 
2. Saw-setting. After jointing the saw it should be set, provided 
it does not already have set enough. 
The tool to use is a saw-set euch as is illustrated in Fig. 15.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
SHARPENING TOOLS 31 
Remove the saw from the vise, hold it with the handle toward 
you, with the saw blade resting between your knees as you sit on 
a sawhorse, bench, or box, and with the saw-set in position 
approximately at right angles to the saw teeth, begin to set the 
saw from heel (the part near the handle) to toe (or the tip). 
Then reverse the saw, holding the tip toward you while the 
handle rests between your knees, and set every alternate tooth 
in the direction opposite to that given the first half of the teeth. 
The saw then will have half of its teeth set to the left, and the 
other half to the right as one looks along the cutting edge. 
The process of setting consists in bending every alternate 
tooth outward by means of a plunger which bends the tooth over 
an anvil or small disk. In some saw-sets these anvils have faces 
bearing numbers that correspond to the number of points per 
inch on saws, so that it is easy to adjust the saw-set. Upon 
examination it will be found that there is always one less tooth 
per inch than there are points per inch of saw blade. Saws are 
marked according to the number of “points” ‘they have per 
inch of cutting edge. 
In general the set should be just wide enough to allow the saw 
to work freely. For green or wet lumber it must be more than 
for hard or dry lumber. About Moo’’ projection on each side is 
often sufficient, due to the fact that many hand saws are taper- 
ground. This means that the saw blade is ground thinner 
toward the top of the saw than where the teeth are. This may 
be observed by looking directly at the front end of the saw. 
The depth to which the teeth are set is important. It should 
not be greater than half of the length of the tooth, as otherwise 
the teeth may be broken off, or the saw blade may be kinked. 
The greatest danger of setting the teeth too deep occurs at the 
extreme ends of the saw where the set can rest only partially 
on the blade. 
The set should be as uniform as possible. Set the anvil of 
the saw-set for the number of points per inch that the saw has, 
as is often shown by the figure stamped near the teeth at the 
base of the saw, and press the plunger firmly against the teeth. 
Be sure not to set teeth over in opposite directions during suc- 
cessive settings. In other words, set the teeth always in the 
same direction originally given them — half of them to the left, 
the other half of them to the right as the eye looks along the row 
of teeth. 
Several disadvantages grow out of having too much set in 
saws. If the teeth have too much set the saw will cut a wider 
kerf than it needs to. This means that more power is needed 
to push the saw, and more material is wasted by sawing than
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
| there needs to be. The saw also tends to “chatter” or quiver, 
making it more difficult to split a fine line in sawing. 
3. Saw-filing. (General information.) 
a. Tools used in saw-filing. The only tools required for filing 
saws are three-cornered files of the proper kind, and a saw 
clamp to hold the saw. The proper files to use for various 
saws are given in Table 2.

Various forms of cast-iron saw clamps are on the market. A 
good home-made clamp is shown in Fig. 219. A clamp may also 
be made by taking two stiff, straight: boards about 28’’ long 
which may be held in a vise and adjusted so as to serve as a 
saw clamp.
-P-A-G-E-43
SHARPENING TOOLS 33 
b. Height of saw clamps. Whether one sits down to do a job of 
saw-filing or stands up, the top of the clamp should be at a 
height so that it will come up to one’s elbow joint. It is 
usually best to stand when filing, as one can work to a little 
better advantage that way. 
Obtain the best light possible on the clamp, such as that of 
a north window. 
c. How to place the saw in the clamp. Place the saw in the clamp 
with the heel of the saw to your left, and the tip to your right 
as you face the saw in the clamp. Let the teeth project above 
the jaws of the clamp just far enough to permit filing. The 
less the bottoms of the teeth project above the saw clamp, 
the less likely the saw is to chatter or screech when filed. 
Filing can be done more easily and more accurately when the 
saw blade is held low and firmly in the clamp or vise. 
d. How to hold the file. The file should be firmly fastened in a 
good handle such as the one shown in Fig. 209. A corn cob 
or a piece of a buggy spoke is a poor substitute. 
If you are right-handed, grasp the file handle firmly in the 
right hand letting the index finger rest upon the tang or base 
end of the file. The left hand is used to steady and guide the 
file, the tip of the file being held between the thumb and the 
index finger of the left hand. The left forearm is held in an 
approximately horizontal position. 
File only on the forward stroke, lifting the file slightly each 
time on the return stroke rather than letting it drag. Drag- 
ging or running a file opposite to the way it is meant to cut 
tends to spoil the edges of the file, and should not be encour- 
aged. 
The handle end of the file is held a little lower than the tip- 
3 end in most saw-filing. 
4. Filing hand saws for cross-cutting. Saw manufacturers do not 
agree in their recommendations as to whether one should begin 
at the heel of the saw and file toward the toe or whether one 
should begin at the tip of the saw and file toward the heel or 
handle end of the saw, and mechanics differ in their practice in 
this regard. It may be advisable for the amateur saw-fitter to 
stick to the same method of filing as used by the manufacturer. 
This is done by placing the file in the gullet or bottom of the 
tooth in such a way that the file will exactly fit the two adjoining 
teeth. The file will then have the correct position which, for 
general purpose cross-cut hand saws, is an angle of 45 degrees to 
the side of the saw. The front of the tooth may have an angle 
of 12 degrees from the vertical, and the back of the tooth an 
angle of 48 degrees from the vertical.
-P-A-G-E-44

If one wishes to file hand saws for cross-cutting by working 
from the point of the saw toward the heel, the process is as 
follows: : 
a. With the saw clamped in position, and the file held as.already 
explained, face the clamp, standing slightly to its left, with 
the tip of the saw nearest to you or at the left end of the Xv

clamp. Place the file in the gullet of the first tooth that was 
filed from that same side. (The gullet will slope toward you 
and will line up with your file as you hold it at an angle of 45 
degrees toward the handle.) 
b. Proceed by filing every alternate tooth-space, touching the 
front of one tooth and the back of the adjoining one until that 
side of the saw is completed. The same angle and bevel 
being kept throughout that side. 
c. Reverse the saw end for end and file this side also, placing 
the file in the alternate gullets not touched in going over the 
opposite side of the saw. 
In filing remember that the teeth are all to come to the 
height to which they were jointed. The dull points seen at 
the ends of the teeth as one looks down upon them should be 
removed half from one side, and half from the other. There- 
fore, do not file the teeth to a point from one side of the saw, 
but reserve half of the job for the time when the saw is turned 
end for end and the teeth are filed from the other side. 
If the teeth are not of uniform size, apply pressure on the 
file in such a way as to equalize the teeth as to size, and so as 
to have the angle and bevel of filing the same for each alter- 
nate tooth. 
d. After the saw has been properly set and filed, the next opera- 
tion consists in side-dressing it. By side-dressing is meant 
the process of removing the wire edge, and any excessive set 
that a saw may have. In order to side-dress the saw, lay it 
flat on a board or work bench in such a way as to give the saw 
blade a uniform bearing all along its cutting edge. Then pass 
a fine hard carborundum or other whetting stone over the 
teeth on each side of the saw, using a light touch, and a 
rotary motion. In this way the wire edge is removed. After 
a few strokes squirt some sperm oil on the saw and try it ona 
piece of scrap lumber. If the saw kerf is too wide, the set of 
the saw may be reduced by repeating the side-dressing. Side- 
dress the saw an equal amount on both sides. 
5. Bucksaws, pruning saws, and compass saws. All of these saws 
differ in the angles and bevels used in filing, but the principles 
as explained for filing hand saws for cross-cutting apply in each 
case. Simply use the angle and bevel that is used by the manu- 
facturer. This is best noted in the teeth that are used least in 
saws that have seen some service. If the saw is old and the 
teeth are in such poor condition that you do not feel equal to the 
task of putting them in good working order, either have some 
local carpenter or saw-fitter do the job or else send the saw back 
to the factory to have it retoothed.

6. Filing hand rip-saws. A rip-saw can easily be distinguished 
from a cross-cut saw, not necessarily by the size of the teeth, 
though the latter tend to be larger in rip-saws than in cross-cut 
saws, but by the fact that rip-saws are filed square across at 
right angles to the side of the saw instead of at an angle of 45 
degrees as is the case in hand cross-cut saws. The fronts of 
the teeth on rip-saws should be straight up and down or at an 
angle of 90 degrees to the line of the teeth, while the back of 
the teeth make an angle of 60 degrees with the front of the 
teeth. 
Half of the teeth should be filed from each side, every alternate 
tooth being filed from the same side. This is to equalize the 
wire edge and bevel that may be given in filing. 
Hold the file with the tip slightly higher than the handle and 
file square across. By lowering the handle, a slight bevel may

SHARPENING TOOLS 37 
be given to the top or points of the teeth. This bevel is con- 
sidered desirable by some. Others file square across, and as 
level as possible. 
Rip-saws are jointed, set, and side-dressed just like cross-cut 
saws. 
D. How to joint, set, and file one and two-man cross-cut saws. 
1. Clamp or vise to use. One-man or two-man cross-cut timber 
saws are held in clamps of various kinds. Out in the woods, 
away from bench and vise conveniences, the saw is placed 
between two boards which are crowned the same way that the 
saw is. These boards are held together by means of upright 
pegs that are driven into a plank. Holes are bored for these 
pegs. 
A work bench having a vise, preferably a blacksmith’s, or a 
metal bench vise can be used to advantage. Boards can be 
clamped together by means of the vise in such a way that the 
saw is well supported for filing. 
2. Height of clamp. The saw should be clamped at about elbow 
height from the floor. The best light is obtained by having 
the filer face a north window. If out of doors, the filer should 
select a shaded place, and face the north. 
3. Tools required. 
1 mill file, 8”. 
1 combined jointer and raker gauge. 
1 setting hammer. 
1 setting block or anvil. 
1 set gauge. 
4, Directions. 
a. Place a file in the jointer, and joint the teeth until the shortest 
cutting tooth is reached. Use the jointer lightly, and keep 
the file square to the saw blade. — It is not necessary to joint 
the saw heavily before each filing. If a partially worn file 
is used in the jointer there will be less danger of jointing off 
too much of the teeth. 
b. If swaged rakers are used, the next step will consist in filing 
the rakers to sharp square edges without changing their 
length. The fork at the top should be 34” to 4” deep. With 
the swaging hammer next bend the tips of the rakers out- 
ward, and downward. For very hard and dry wood the 
rakers should be Moo’’ shorter than the cutting teeth; for 
hard, green wood such as oak or chestnut %’’, and for soft 
green wood such as pine, hemlock or Douglas fir %2’’. 
The best way to get the rakers exactly the right length is 
to use a raker-tooth gauge such as the one shown in Fig. 25.  
-P-A-G-E-48
    38 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
The gauge is adjusted according to numbers that indicate the 
adjustment. The teeth can then simply be made to come 
flush with the top edge of the part of the gauge that fits around 
the raker tooth. 
c. In filing, shape the teeth to their original form, and bevel the 
edges as required by the work to be done. Care should be 
exercised to see that the teeth are brought to sharp points 
at the length to which they were jointed. The cutting 
teeth should always be longer than the rakers; otherwise the 
saw will not cut. It is well for right-handed persons to file 
the right-hand side of teeth first. The bevel obtained helps 
to guide the eye in pointing up the other side. 
d. Side-dress the saw, or remove the wire edges from the teeth 
by passing a hard whetstone along the sides of the teeth. 
e. It is not necessary to set the saw at each filing, especially if 
the latter is taper-ground. In case the saw needs to be set, 
the process is as follows: A hammer and set block are used in 
preference to a spring set, such as is commonly used for hand 
saws. Lay the saw on some flat surface, such as a plank, and 
pass it over the set block in such a way that the point of the 
tooth projects 4’ over the apex or corner of the set block. 
Strike the tooth over the apex of the set block, then test the 
tooth with the set gauge. If the blow did not give set 
enough, repeat it; if the set is too great, reduce it by placing 
the tooth on the flat part of the block, and strike a blow that. 
will cause the tooth to straighten out. 
Set every other tooth from one side, and then reverse the 
saw, setting the other teeth in the opposite direction as in 
the case of hand saws, so that half the cutting teeth are set 
outward to the left, and the other half outward to the right 
as the eye looks along the saw-tooth edge of the saw.

CHAPTER IV 
MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 
A. Lumber. 
The term “lumber” as ordinarily used includes all material 
sawed from logs which is used for structural purposes. Lumber 
is usually cut in lengths of even feet, for example in lengths of 10, 
12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 feet. The length and width varies according 
to the characteristics of the tree from which it is cut and with the 
purpose it is to serve. 
1. Units of measurement and terms used. All rough lumber is sold 
by the board foot. A board foot is equivalent to a board 1 inch 
thick, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot Jong. Lumber less than 1” thick 
is sold by the square foot, face measure. Lattice and mouldings 
are sold by the lineal foot. Laths and shingles are sold by the 
thousand. 
Boards vary from %” to 134” in thickness. Lumber that is 
from 1%'’to 4” thick is usually spoken of as planks in most parts 
of the United States. 
2. Common sizes of lumber. Lumber that is surfaced or dressed 
measures less than nominal size as may be seen in the Table: 
RovucH LuMBER Dressep LuMBER 
Nominat THICKNESS Ner THIckNness 
” ” 
a %, en eh ne 1" Lu," 
134" 1-56" 
yn 134” 
244" 24" 
In addition to reduction in thickness there is a corresponding 
reduction in width of %” to 4” or even up to %” in case of 
wide material. 
3. Estimating quantities of lumber. In estimating quantities of 
lumber allowance must be made for the amount lost in dressing 
and in matching. 
The following rules may be followed: 
For 3” matched flooring or ceiling add % to the area to be 
covered. 
For 4” matched flooring or ceiling add % to the area to be 
covered. 
For 6” matched flooring or ceiling add % to the area to be 
covered.
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
For common sheathing add % to Mo to the area to be covered. 
For lap-siding laid 4’ to the weather add % to the area to be 
covered. : 
1000 shingles averaging 4’’ wide (4 bundles) cover about 110 
square feet with 4’”” exposure. 
100 laths (1 bundle) each 4” X 1%” X 4’ cover about 150 sq.ft. 
  
  
  4. Rule for finding board feet in lumber. The following method is 
often used to figure the board feet in lumber: 
Multiply the thickness and width in inches by the length in feet, 
and divide by 12. 
Example: Find the board feet in a 2” x 4” X 12’. 
2x4 X12 + 12 =8 board feet.

Directions: To find the board feet in a given piece of lumber read across the table in the 
column containing the thickness and width of the piece, and down the column 
corresponding to its length. The result is the figure found where these two 
columns intersect. For example, let it be required to find the board feet in a 
piece 2’’ X 10” X 16’. The answer as given in the table is 27 board feet. 
The board feet in pieces not listed here may be found indirectly. For example, 
if it is desired to find the board feet in a piece of plank 6” X 8” X 2’. Find the 
answer from the table for a piece 6” X 8” X 4” and divide by two (since 2’ is half of 4’, and the latter was used because 2’ is not given in the table). 
B. Materials used in cement and concrete work. 
3 Kinds of cements. Cementing materials in general are classified 
as follows: 
1. Common limes 3. Natural cements 
2. Hydraulic limes 4. Slag cements 
5. Portland cement
-P-A-G-E-51
    MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 41 
2. Natural cement. Natural cement, mortar, or concrete should 
never be allowed to freeze while setting; it should not be laid 
under water, nor exposed to it for a month after laying. Owing 
to the fact that natural cement does not set or harden readily, 
it is not well adapted for use in footings, piers, walls, etc., which 
need to hold up loads soon after construction. 
3. Portland cement. The term ‘‘Portland”’ does not refer to any 
one locality in which this cement is made. Portland cement is 
manufactured in many parts of the United States and elsewhere. 
It is used much more widely in the United States than either 
natural or slag cement. : 
Portland cement is usually to be preferred to any other cement 
because of its exceptional qualities. It hardens readily under 
water and in damp places. It sets quickly, can be made water- 
proof, and its compression strength is great. The latter varies 
with the quality of the cement and the kind and the proportion 
of the mixture used. A “rich” mixture of one part of cement, 
one part of sand, and one of granite rock may stand up under a 
load of 3300 Ibs. per square inch, while a mixture of one part of 
cement, one of sand, and three of cinders may withstand only 
400 Ibs. per square inch. 
4. Special terms used. 
a. Aggregate. The term “aggregate” refers to sand, gravel, 
stone, or cinders which are bound together by cement to form 
either mortar or concrete. 
b. Bank-run gravel. Is a term that is applied to unwashed 
gravel as it usually comes from the pit. 
c. Mixture. The various proportions of cement, sand, and 
gravel that go to make certain mixtures is indicated as fol- 
lows: 1:3:5. The first figure used stands for cement, the 
second for sand, and the last for gravel, crushed stone, or 
cinders. 
5. Proportions recommended for certain kinds of work.+ 
A 1: 2:3 mixture: for feeding floors, one-course floors and 
sidewalks, water troughs, milk-cooling vats. 
A 1:2%:4 mixture: for silo walls, and building walls above 
foundations. 
A 1:3: 5 mixture: for basement walls, foundations, mass foot- 
ings, base of sidewalks, small engine foundations, windmill 
footings. . 
6. For mortar. 
1: 2% mixture: for finish coat of exterior plaster and for fence 
posts. :

8. Washing aggregates. Bank-run gravel, and often creek and   river gravel, should be screened and washed before use. Clean 
water should be used in mixing mortar and concrete. Soil in 
mortar or concrete reduces its strength by affecting the binding 
power of the cement. 
  9. Hand-mixing concrete. Before mixing make sure that every- 
thing is ready so that the concrete can be poured or otherwise 
used as soon as it is mixed. The mixture must be used within 
twenty or thirty minutes after the water has been added. The 
following steps should be followed in mixing concrete: 
a. Spread a uniform layer of clean sand on the mixing platform 
which should be water-tight. 
b. Spread the cement over the sand and mix thoroughly by 
~ shoveling. The material should be shoveled over at least 
twice, or until a uniform color is secured. 
c. Add the screened gravel, crushed rock, or cinders, and shovel 
over at least twice in order to secure a uniform mixture. 
d. Add water slowly from a sprinkler or with a hose, and mix 
thoroughly until the concrete becomes wet enough so that it 
tends to flatten out when piled in a heap. The amount of 
water to be used varies with the nature of the work, but never 
have it so wet as to become “soupy.” Too much water in the 
mixture weakens it. 
C. Materials used in pipe-fitting. 
1. Kinds of pipe. Various kinds of pipe are used for cold water 
supply, such as wrought iron, steel, lead, brass, and tin-lined

brass pipe. Black iron or steel pipe rusts more quickly inside 
and outside than does galvanized pipe. Galvanized pipe and 
fittings are superior to black iron and should be used almost: 
exclusively for water-pipe in the home or on the farmstead.

to fill up tiny blow-holes and cracks as well as acting as a pre- 
ventive to rust. 
Steel pipe is manufactured more cheaply than wrought-iron 
pipe. With good quality adjustable dies threads may be cut on 
steel pipe somewhat more slowly, but as good as those on 
wrought-iron pipe. Wrought-iron pipe is generally held to be 
superior to steel pipe. 
. Lengths of pipe. Wrought-iron pipe may be purchased in 
lengths of 16 to 20 feet. Pipe mills furnish one coupling with 
each length of pipe. 
. Fittings. Pipe-fitting has been greatly simplified through the 
use of parts such as bushings, caps, crosses, elbows, flanges, 
plugs, tees, etc., called fittings. Fittings that are used for water, 
steam, and gas are of two general kinds. These are: 
a. Malleable iron fittings. 
b. Cast-iron fittings. 
Fittings are also classified as beaded or plain, depending on 
whether or not the fittings are reinforced at their ends with a 
“bead” or small ring of metal as shown in Fig. 26, No. 5. 
In describing fittings the terms “male” and ‘“‘female” are 
sometimes used. A female fitting is one that is threaded on the 
inside and a male fitting is one that is threaded on the outside. 
  
  4. Briggs standard taper pipe thread. Taps and dies used for cutting 
threads on nuts and bolts are not suited for cutting pipe threads. 
The United States Standard (U.S.S.) thread which is commonly 
used on machine bolts is different from the Briggs Standard 
pipe thread. By looking at a pipe-die or at a piece of threaded 
pipe, it will be seen that the threads taper (at the rate of Mo” 
per inch). The threads near the end of the pipe are perfect V

threads, while the last four threads have flat tops and bottoms. 
This is done in order to assure an air and water-tight fit. 
5. Right and left-hand threads. The standard thread for pipe. is a 
right-hand thread. Left-hand threads may be cut with taps 
and dies and may also be purchased. 
6. Pipe sizes. Pipe used for water, steam, and gas is made in 
sizes from 4’ diameter to large diameters. The inside diameter 
is used to describe the size of pipe.. By a 1” pipe is meant one 
having an inside diameter of 1’’. 
Table 5 gives the diameter and the number of threads per 
inch for pipes from }4” to 8” in diameter. 
7. Lengths of threads. In order to give an idea of how long threads 
should be cut on pipe, Table 6 is given:

It is common trade practice among plumbers to thread to such 
a length as will leave two full threads after the fitting has been 
tightened up. 
8. Drilling for pipe connections. In order that a tight fit may 
readily be secured when drilling holes which are to be tapped out 
or threaded for pipe connections, it is necessary to use the proper 
size of drill. Table 7 shows the sizes of drills that should be used 
for given diameters of pipe, and the number of threads per inch 
that correspond.

a. Pipe compound. The term “pipe compound” is used for  
-P-A-G-E-56
46 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
material that is applied on pipe threads to make them water 
or air-tight, and to keep the threads from rusting so that the 
connection can be opened easily in case of necessity. Pipe 
compound may be purchased or white or red lead may be 
used. In the absence of these, thick paint will serve the 
purpose. Care should be taken not to apply too much com- 
pound, lead, or paint, as it may reduce the effective diameter 
of the pipe by collecting and hardening in the pipe. 
b. Lubricating oil. The best grade of lard oil should be used 
freely on taps and dies when cutting threads, especially if 
steel pipe is used. Lard oil is made by mixing equal parts of 
melted lard and cotton-seed oil. 
ce. Cementing compound. Cementing compound or oxidizing 
paste is made of the following materials: 
1 part, by weight, salammoniac. 
2 parts, by weight, flowers of sulphur. 
80 parts, by weight, fine cast-iron filings. 
The materials should be mixed into a paste with water, and 
should be kept ina glass jar. The compound is applied at the 
time of “making up” the parts. Through oxidation it causes 
the fittings to rust together in such a way as to produce a bond 
that can usually not be broken without destroying the fittings. 
D. Materials used in farm blacksmithing. 
The materials most commonly used in farm blacksmithing are 
wrought iron, Norway iron, mild steel, and tool steel. A good deal 
of the work done is of the simpler sort, such as cold and hot bend- 
ing, drilling, sharpening, shaping, and some welding. 
Because of the various uses to which different kinds of iron and 
steel are put, and because some knowledge of the special charac- 
teristics of these materials are necessary, they are given herewith. 
1. Wrought iron. Wrought iron has a fibrous structure mainly 
because of slag seams that are introduced during the process of 
manufacture. It is light gray in color, approaching a silvery 
white. Wrought iron may be bent, twisted, or hammered out 
while cold. By working it cold the metal becomes more brittle. 
Wrought iron of good quality is much easier to weld than steel 
because the slag in the former acts as a flux and permits it to be 
heated through a greater range of temperature than steel. 
Various qualities of wrought iron are in the market. If 
certain impurities, such as sulphur and phosphorus, are present, 
they affect the ease with which the metal may be worked. 
“Hot short ” iron — that is, iron which is brittle when hot 
—usually contains sulphur. Such iron is welded with diffi- 
culty.
-P-A-G-E-57
       MATERIALS COMMONLY USED > 47 
“Cold short” iron, or iron that is brittle when cold, usually 
contains phosphorus. It is welded more easily than hot short 
iron. 
“Short” iron contains silicon or sand. This makes the iron 
harder and more brittle than it should be. 
. Norway iron. The purest soft iron on the market comes from 
Norway and Sweden. Norway iron is a much better grade of 
iron than common wrought iron. Horseshoe nails and rivets 
are made from it. It will stand a great deal of cold bending 
without injury and rusts less quickly than wrought iron. It is 
recommended for use by farmers because good results can easily 
be obtained through its use. 
. Mild steel. The difference in hardness in iron and steel is pro- 
duced largely by carbon. Common wrought iron contains 
about .04 per cent of carbon. Mild steel contains from .05 
to.5 per cent of carbon. Steel is stronger than wrought iron and is 
also cheaper because a different process of manufacture is used. 
In general an increase in carbon content also increases the hard- 
ening quality of steel, but it makes it more difficult to weld. 
Mild steel is sometimes sold as machinery steel, and as 
structural steel. A good way to describe the hardness of steel 
is by the carbon content. i 
. Tool steel. Tool steel is also known as high-carbon steel. It 
contains from .5 to 2 per cent of carbon. Other substances, 
such as chromium, nickel, manganese, and tungsten, may be 
added in small percentages to give tool steel certain qualities. 
For example, tungsten steel containing from 1 to 3 per cent of 
tungsten is valued highly for cutting edge tools. 
Steel cannot be successfully forged at a dull red heat. It 
should be worked at a “cherry” red heat. Tool steel should 
not be “upset”? any more than is necessary, as the crystalline 
structure, and therefore the quality of the steel, is affected 
thereby. 
. Cast iron. Cast iron cannot be welded in the common black- 
smith’s forge. If a break occurs, it may be repaired. by rein- 
forcing it with iron or steel fastened with bolts or rivets, or 
the casting may be brazed. 
. Coal. Hard (anthracite) coal is not suited for forge work be- 
cause it burns without forming coke. Much of the ordinary 
soft coal likewise is not suited for forge work because of the 
presence of sulphur or phosphorus. Soft (bituminous) coal 
containing no sulphur or phosphorus is satisfactory and is 
most widely used. It may be purchased from dealers under the 
name of “‘blacksmith’s”’ coal. 
In some places small-sized coke is available, and is used suc- 
cessfully for forge work.

  CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
7. Fluxes and welding compounds. By the term “flux” as used in 
blacksmithing is meant a substance which tends to keep im- 
purities, such as sulphur fumes, away from the metal protected 
by the flux, and which tends to keep iron or steel from burning. 
When iron or steel is heated, an oxide forms on the surface. 
If flux is sprinkled on the metal when it has reached a yellow 
heat, the flux melts the oxide formed and forms a sticky air- 
tight covering which prevents further oxidation. Fluxes do 
not act as cements, but prevent oxidation and make it possible 
to weld at a lower temperature. 
It is not necessary to use a flux for welding wrought iron. If 
the iron is thin, pure sand may be used as a flux. Borax may 
also be used with success. 
When welding steel, a flux such as powdered borax or sand 
should be used. 
Many welding sisniades may be purchased. Nearly all of 
them contain borax. 
E. Materials used in soldering and babbitting. 
Sheet-metal work or tin-smithing as it applies to the farm is largely 
a case of doing repair work. The principal tool involved is the sol- 
dering copper. 
1. Solder. Ordinary soft solder is an alloy of lead and tin. The 
proportions vary according to the purpose for which it is in- 
tended. Wire solder — that is, solder sold in the form of wire 
¥%"' in diameter, and used by electricians — has a lower melting 
point and different composition from “half-and-half” solder 
used by sheet-metal workers and plumbers. 
The term “half and half” means that the solder is supposed 
to contain 50 per cent lead and 50 per cent tin, but not all “half 
and half” is true to name, therefore certain dealers sell ‘market 
half and half” and “strictly half and half.” It is advisable to 
use high-grade solder. The more “tin the solder contains up to 
50 per cent, the better it is. 
2. Fluxes. Fluxes in soldering serve much the same purpose as 
fluxes in welding. They tend to clean the metal, keep it from 
oxidizing, and reduce the temperature of fusing. 
The kind of flux to use depends upon the sheet metal to be 
soldered.

-P-A-G-E-59
  MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 49 
Various soldering pastes, salts, and powders are sold under 
trade names. 
3. Description of materials used for fluxes. 
a. Muriatic acid.. Commercial muriatie or hydrochloric acid 
when undiluted is spoken of as “raw” acid by sheet-metal 
workers. 
Reduced or “cooked ” muriatic acid is made by slowly add- 
ing small pieces of scrap zinc to the acid. This is best done 
in the open air so that the fumes may not be inhaled. When 
chemical action stops, the acid is “‘reduced.” It is well to 
keep a little zinc in the reduced acid to make certain that the 
acid is at all times reduced. 
b. Tallow. Ordinary tallow will serve the purpose of a tallow 
flux. Mutton tallow is better than paraffin candle. 
c. The rosin used for flux may be bought in bulk. Only a small 
quantity isneeded. It can be pulverized readily by crushing. 
Keep it in a shaker or container. 
4. Tin plate. The quality of tin plates depends largely upon the 
quality and thickness of the steel used in the base plates, and 
in the thickness of the tin coating. 
Tin plate or sheet tin, as it is sometimes called, is made in a 
variety of sizes and thickness. The sizes vary from 10” X 14” 
to 26” X 26”. 
5. Sheet iron and steel. Sheet mills roll iron and steel to U.S. 
standard gauge unless otherwise ordered. A few of the forty or 
more gauges made are given in Table 8 with their fractional 
equivalents and weight per square foot in order to serve as a 
guide in ordering sheet iron and steel.

6. Babbitt metal. Babbitt metal like many other products is sold 
in poor as well as in good qualities. Some Babbitt metal is less 
shrinkable and has a lower coefficient of friction than others. 
High-grade Babbitt should be used for repairing bearings in 
engines, motors, and other high-speed or heavy duty machines.

F. Materials used in harness and leather repair work. 
1. Care of harness. In order that harness may last as long as 
possible it is advisable to observe certain precautions. 
a. Clean the harness whenever it gets dirty. 
b. Use water to wash off dirt or mud, but do not let leather 
soak in water. 
ce. Never use hot water on leather. 
d. After washing, dry the leather slowly in the shade — not in 
the sun or near a stove. 
e. Keep it well oiled; oil it at least twice a month when in use. 
f. If possible adjust buckles so that they will not wear in the 
same hole all of the time. This will help retard rotting and 
wear. 
2. Harness oil. Use neat’s-foot oil. If lamp-black is available, 
it may be stirred into the oil until the latter has a glossy ap- 
pearance. 
3. Leather. Oak-tanned leather, other things being equal, is better 
than leather tanned with hemlock bark. In using leather for 
belting, use the hair or smooth side against the drive wheel or 
pulley. 
4. Belt dressing. Belt dressings of many kinds are on the market. 
They are intended to prevent belts from slipping, and to act as 
preservatives. 
5. Belt lacing. The following are some of the forms of belt laces 
that are in use: 
a. Cut rawhide lace, 4’ to %” wide. 
b. Cut tanned lace, 4’’ to %’’ wide. 
ec. Metallic belt lacing (composition wire).

6. Flax thread. Flax thread is used in leather repair work of 
various kinds. A number of strands, usually from three to 
six, are twisted together and waxed. Both the thread and the 
wax may be obtained from a local shoemaker or harnessmaker. 
G. Paints, varnishes, and stains. 
1. Composition of paint. The composition of paint varies some- 
what according to the use to which it is to be put. Paint
-P-A-G-E-61
MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 5I 
made for exterior or “outside” work should contain pure lin- 
seed oil, pure white lead, coloring pigments, and not over 5 to 
10 per cent “drier.” Paint made for “inside” work, especially 
where a “‘flat”’ finish is desired, should contain considerable 
turpentine. 
In general all ready-mixed paints should be used according 
to directions, and should not have oil, turpentine, or “drier” 
added unless this is specified. 
. Linseed oil. Linseed oil is made by crushing flax seed. Raw 
linseed oil is the natural flax-seed oil. Boiled linseed oil is made 
by adding ‘‘drier”’ to raw linseed oil. 
Fish oil and other oils are sometimes used in cheap paints 
instead of linseed oil. Raw linseed oil dries in about a week 
while boiled linseed oil dries in from twelve to twenty-four 
hours under ordinary weather conditions. 
The liquid part of paint, such as the linseed oil and turpentine, 
is called the “vehicle,” for it “carries” the finely pulverized 
pigments and permits them to be spread uniformly throughout 
the paint. 
. Drier or Japan. The term “drier” or “Japan” is applied to a 
compound of lead or of manganese which acts as a drying agent 
by taking oxygen from the air and making it available for the 
paint. 
. Turpentine. Turpentine is used in paint to make it flow more 
freely, to hasten its drying, and to produce a “flat” or dull 
finish, as distinguished from the glossy finish produced by the 
use of linseed oil. 
Turpentine is a colorless liquid that is quite volatile and 
highly inflammable. It should be used sparingly in “outside” 
paint, as it lessens its durability. 
. White lead. The most essential pigment in paint is white lead. 
It acts as a binder in paint and adds to the durability of the 
latter. White lead weighs 20 to 22 lbs. per gallon. Because of 
its high price chalk and other substitutes are found in some 
cheap paints instead of white lead. 
. Ready-mixed paints. Unless one has a thorough knowledge of 
paint, it will be found better to use ready-mixed paints of 
reputable brands. The machine-mixed paints are more thor- 
oughly blended than are hand-mixed paints; they are scientifi- 
cally proportioned for certain kinds of work, such as metal 
paint, stove enamel, and exterior work, and the colors are uni- 
form. This is important, when repairs need to be made, or 
when other objects, such as flower boxes, are desired to match 
certain colors used for the farm home, the barn, or other 
buildings.

11. The best quality paints are the cheapest in the end. 
Putty. Ordinary putty is made by mixing whiting (ground 
chalk or limestone) with boiled linseed oil. Keep putty in an 
- air-tight tin or glass container. If it gets too hard to spread 
easily, add a little boiled linseed oil, or a very small amount 
(not over 5 per cent) of cotton-seed oil. 
Ordinary putty may be improved by adding about ten per 
cent white lead. This causes the putty to harden more quickly 
and to become harder. 
If putty is too soft, add whiting. In the absence of whiting, 
use flour. Rye flour is best. 
Putty may need to be warmed up in cold weather. Place 
the container in warm water, but do not put warm water di- 
rectly on the putty. 
. To remove putty. If putty is hard to remove, apply kerosene. 
This will dissolve or “‘cut’’ the oil in the putty in a few hours 
sufficiently to soften it. 
. Substitute for putty. A cheap but effective substitute for putty 
which is good for filling cracks and joints in floors and other 
woodwork is made by soaking newspapers in a paste made by 
boiling a pound of flour in three quarts of water. A teaspoonful 
of powdered alum is stirred into this mixture. Newspapers 
are then soaked in the paste until it is about as thick as ordinary 
putty. Force this mixture into the cracks with a putty. knife 
or an old case knife. The mixture will harden as it dries and 
may be stained or painted to match the woodwork. 
Estimating the amount of paint required. The number of square 
feet of surface that can be covered with a gallon of paint depends 
upon the following factors: 
a. Kind and condition of the surface to be painted. 
b. Quality of the paint. 
c. Method of application. 
It may be estimated that one gallon of paint will cover from 
250 to 400 square feet on first-coat work, and 350 to 500 square 
feet on second-coat work. 
Varnish. Varnish is made from certain resinous gums found 
mostly in the warm countries such as Africa, the Philippine 
Islands, and Brazil. These gums are dissolved in linseed oil and 
thinned with turpentine. The best varnish is made from gum 
copal; the poorest from gum resin. Cheap varnishes often 
contain much resin. They do not withstand either heat or 
water as well as the better grades of varnish. 
Spar varnish is a waterproof varnish that is used where sur- 
faces are exposed to sun or rain, as outside doors, railings, sash, 
and blinds, or for kitchen or bathroom floors.

      MATERIALS COMMONLY USED : 53 
Floor varnish is specially prepared for use on floors. A good 
floor varnish is elastic and waterproof. 
Rubbing varnish is varnish that will stand ‘rubbing down” 
well. It is used for furniture where a hand-rubbed semi- 
glossy surface is desired. 
Shellac. Shellac differs from varnish (oleo-resinous varnish) 
in that shellac is dissolved in alcohol instead of oil. Shellac and 
varnish should not be mixed. 
Shellac has the following advantages: it dries very quickly, 
it is transparent — especially when bleached; and it can be 
finished in several different ways. 
Its disadvantages are: Water will discolor it, cypress may 
make it cloudy, and it raises the grain of lumber. 
Shellac is naturally of an orange-yellow color. Orange shellac 
is bleached with chlorine to white shellac. White shellac is 
more transparent than varnish. It deteriorates with age. 
Shellac is good for a first coat under varnish used on interior 
work, and makes a good finish if several coats are applied. 
Shellac is thinned out with denatured alcohol. Always keep 
it in an air-tight glass or earthen vessel when used occasionally. 
If exposed ‘to air in tin containers, shellac will darken rapidly. 
Stains. 
a. Purpose of staining. Stains are widely used to emphasize 
the grain of wood. This is brought about by the fact that the 
“soft”? grain absorbs more than does the “hard” grain or 
annular rings. Stains are also used to imitate some other 
wood, as, for example, mahogany; but this practice is not to 
be commended so highly as is the one in which it is used to 
enhance the natural beauty of wood. 
Another use is that of giving color when desired, as in 
designs worked out in woods of different colors. Still another 
use for stains is found in giving the appearance of age to 
wood, as in the case of furniture, interior trim, and exterior of 
homes. 
b. Kinds of stains. Stains are grouped into classes according to 
the nature of the liquids used in them. These classes are as 
follows: 
Oil stains, spirit stains, acid stains and water stains. 
(1) Oil stains. Oil stains are easy to apply. They do not 
penetrate deeply, and they darken somewhat with age. 
They are the best for soft wood such as white pine. 
(2) Spirit stains. Spirit stains are more penetrating than 
oil stains. They are harder to apply, as the spirits in 
them are quite volatile and brush-laps are apt to show. 
Shellac should not be used directly over spirit stains.  
-P-A-G-E-64
54 
  CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
14. (3) Acid stains. Acid stains are not recommended for use on 
the farm. As a rule acid stains are injurious to the wood 
upon which they are used. 
(4) Water stains. Water stains are cheap, penetrating, and 
clear, but they fade unless “fixed” with a mordant, and 
they raise the grain of the wood on which they are ap- 
plied. They are often used in factories where entire 
articles are dropped in vats of water stain, but are not so 
well adapted to occasional use on the farm. 
Fillers. There are two kinds of fillers — liquid fillers and paste 
fillers. 
Good paste filler is composed of silex or ground quartz and 
linseed oil. Silex does not expand or contract much in changing 
temperatures, and is therefore desirable as a base for fillers. 
Paste fillers should be used in open-grain woods such as ash, 
chestnut, hickory, oak, and walnut. Use a stiff brush in apply- 
ing paste filler. Brush the filler well into the grain, rub off 
the surplus, and allow the filler to dry. Then sand-paper be- 
fore applying surface coats of varnish or shellac. 
If a paste filler is to be used on any wood that is to be stained 
a light color, pour off the oil from the filler and substitute 
turpentine. 
Liquid fillers are used for close-grained woods, such as bass- 
wood, birch, Douglas fir, cypress, maple, and pine. Shellac — 
either orange or white — will be found an excellent substitute 
for liquid filler in most cases. The shellac may be thinned out 
about 25 per cent with denatured alcohol. 
Fillers made of cornstarch, turpentine, and linseed oil are not 
so good as those containing ground quartz or silicon. 
. Wax. Finishing wax is used in liquid and in paste form. 
Liquid wax is recommended for furniture and paste wax for 
floors. 
Floor and other finishing waxes are made of vegetable wax 
which is dissolved in turpentine or other volatile liquids. Paste 
wax may be applied by placing the wax in several thicknesses of 
cheese cloth and rubbing it on the surface to be treated. It 
should then be allowed to dry — that is, the volatile liquids 
should be given a chance to evaporate for an hour and the 
surface may then be polished by rubbing with a cloth or stiff 
brush. Weighted brushes are sold for waxing floors. Several 
coats need to be applied to get a good effect. If a good wax 
finish has been worked up, it can be maintained with little 
effort. 
A wax finish on floors is objected to by some persons because 
it becomes rather slippery. On the other hand, many persons
-P-A-G-E-65
MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 55 
are very fond of the artistic semi-gloss produced by a wax 
finish. Such a finish can also be produced by ‘‘rubbing down ” 
varnish with pumice stone and oil. 
H. Sand-paper. 
Sand-paper is made by coating a strong paper with sharp, clean 
sand or with garnet crystals of approximately uniform size. The 
sand or garnet is held to the paper by means of glue. The term 
“flint-paper” is given to paper coated with sand, while the term 
“garnet-paper”’ is used for paper covered with garnet crystals. 
The latter is best for use on hardwood. Both forms of paper are 
sold in sheets 9” X 11” and in rolls. The finest grade made, as 
regards size of cutting grains, is No. 000, the coarsest No. 3. For 
general use on the farm Nos. 1 and 1% are good. 
1. Method of use. In sand-papering flat surfaces it is advisable to 
use a sand-paper block about 1” x 4” x10”. The most 
satisfactory sand-paper blocks are made of cork, but a good 
substitute can be made by padding an ordinary wood block 
with three or four thicknesses of worn-out sand-paper. The 
idea is to produce a soft cushion which will make it easy to 
apply uniform pressure. This tends to keep pitch, if any is 
present, from “balling up” on the sand-paper. 
* Occasionally sand-paper should be used over the finger tips 
without a block. This may be the case when a deep bruise ; 
in wood needs to be smoothed. In sand-papering curved sur- 
faces, such as moldings, use a block made to fit the curves. 
2. How to tear sand-paper. Fold the paper-sanded side against 
sanded side, press along the crease on the unsanded side with 
any hard object, such as a piece of wood, and it will be found 
an easy matter to tear the paper by hand without the use of any 
straight edge, along the line where it was folded. 
3. Emery cloth. Emery cloth is made like sand-paper, but cloth 
is used instead of paper, and pulverized emery is used instead 
of sand. It is used largely for smoothing, fitting, polishing, and 
cleaning metal. Emery cloth wears better when used on iron 
or steel than does flint or garnet paper. 
4. Use for worn sand-paper and emery cloth. Sand-paper that is 
worn somewhat may be used to good advantage in rubbing 
down shellac or varnish, between coats. If nothing but coarse 
sand-paper is at hand and a finer grade is desired, the need may 
be met by use of partly worn paper of the grade at hand, or by 
rubbing two pieces of coarse sand-paper together, sand against 
sand, until the coarse particles are cut down. 
Old sand-paper and especially old emery cloth is good for 
cleaning rusty tools and machinery. Squirt some kerosene on 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    56 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
the rusted surface and rub with old sand-paper or emery cloth 
until the metal is bright. Then oil, grease, or paint the surface 
to prevent further rusting. 
I. Glue. 
1. Dry glue. The term “dry glue” is used for glue, such as cabinet- 
maker’s or cooper’s glue which is sold in the form of dry chips or 
powders. This kind of glue must be heated in a glue-pot or else 
in a double boiler. A home-made double boiler can be made by 
placing a tin can in a larger pot which has a few pieces of wood 
in it to keep the bottom of the can from touching the bottom of 
the pot. 
To heat dry glue, soak the chips or the powder overnight, or at 
least for several hours, in a little more water than it will absorb. 
Place this soaked glue in the inner can of the double boiler, sur- 
round it with water, and heat until the glue is well heated and 
uniform in thickness. It is then ready to use. The glue may be 
reheated repeatedly. It cools and “sets” very rapidly, therefore 
it is best to use it where the temperature is moderately warm. 
Everything should be ready so that the glue can be spread and 
the parts clamped or otherwise fastened immediately afterward. 
A good quality of dry glue is probably the best glue to use for 
cabinet and furniture work. 
2. Liquid glue. Liquid glue has certain advantages. It may be 
purchased in small bottles or cans, is always ready for use, and 
requires no heating except in exceptionally cold weather when it . 
may need to be warmed up by placing the can in warm water. 
The fact that liquid glue sets and hardens much more slowly 
than heated dry glue is often an advantage, for it gives more 
time properly to adjust the parts to be glued. 
J. Nails, brads, screws, and other fasteners. 
1. Wire nails. Most of the nails manufactured to-day are made of 
wire. They vary from 2 penny (2d.) to 60 penny in size. Nails 
16 penny and larger are commonly called spikes. 
The term “nail’’ usually means that the fastener so named 
has a flat head. For example, 8d. common and all other com- 
mon wire nails have flat heads. There are special forms of nails, 
such as finishing, flooring, and casing nails, which do not have 
flat heads, but have a small head characteristic of “brads.” 
The nails shown above the number 1 in Fig. 27, illustrate 
various sized common wire nails. Those above the number 2 
are brads with the exception of a six and an eight penny finishing 
nail. They were placed there to show that nails of equal length 
vary in thickness or gauge. For repair work on small parts it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 57 
particularly well to know how to specify or describe the kind of 
brad or nail that is needed. Table 9 is given herewith to show 
the length and gauge number and the weight of nails and 
brads. 
2. Steel cut nails. Steel cut nails are used to some extent for nailing 
fencing, sheathing, flooring, battens, and other objects. Cut 
nails are harder to drive and are more likely to split lumber than 
are wire nails.

a. Styles of wood screws. Wood screws are made with flat heads, 
round heads, fillister heads, and oval heads. Flat-head 
screws are shown above number 3, in Fig. 27. It will be 
noticed that screws of a given length are not necessarily of 
uniform thickness.

Round-head screws are shown above number 6 in Fig. 27. 
Fillister and oval-head screws are not used much on the 
farm. 
b. Materials used in manufacture. Wood screws are made of 
bright steel wire and of brass, and may be finished in various 
ways; as, for example: 
(1) bright (steel color). 
(2) blue. 
(3) brass. 
(4) nickel. 
(5) bronze. 
Steel screws are sometimes brassed and bronzed to imitate 
these metals. 
Steel and brass wood screws are made in sizes varying from, 
4", 0 gauge, to 6”, 30 gauge. They are usually put up in 
packages of 1 gross (12 dozen), but may be purchased in 
smaller quantities if desired. 
c. Use of soap on wood screws. Those who have not tried it will 
be agreeably surprised to see how much easier screws may be 
driven in hard or tough wood if common soap is applied on 
the screws. :
-P-A-G-E-69
MATERIALS COMMONLY USED 59 
Another way to make screws drive easily is to drill a hole 
slightly smaller than the screw before inserting the screw. 
The best tool to drill holes of small diameters is an automatic 
push drill, but other drills may be used. In the absence of 
any kind of a drill, a hole is sometimes made with a nail 
which is driven where the screw is to go, and is then pulled so 
as to leave a hole in which the screw will follow. 
4. Coach or lag screws. Coach or lag screws are made, as shown 
above number 4, in Fig. 27, with gimlet points like other wood 
screws, but with a square head like that of a machine bolt instead 
of the slotted head found in ordinary wood screws. 
Lag screws are driven with a monkey wrench. They are used 
where wood parts need to be held securely and where bolts 
cannot be so easily used. Holes slightly smaller than the lag 
screws to be used should be bored before the latter are inserted, 
as otherwise the head may be turned off. Lag screws are made 
of iron or steel, and vary from 4” X 1’ to 1’ X 12” in size. 
5. Bolts. The bolts most frequently used by farmers are machine 
bolts, carriage bolts, and stove bolts. Each of these three 
varieties is used for a greater variety of purposes than the name 
implies. 
a. Machine bolts. Ordinary machine bolts have square or else 
hexagonal heads. The nuts are made to correspond in style. 
The threads are known as the U.S. Standard threads. The 
bolts are made from 4’ X 1%” to 14” x 30”. A machine 
bolt is shown over number 8, in Fig. 27. Machine bolts are 
often used to bolt together wood, or wood and metal. They 
have this advantage over carriage bolts and stove bolts — 
the square or hexagonal head and nut give a good grip fora 
wrench so that little difficulty is experienced in tightening 
and removing them even though somewhat rusted. When 
used in wood, washers are usually inserted under the nut. 
When machine bolts are used on farm machinery in which 
there is much vibration, as in tractors, it is well to use a 
lock-washer under the nut. 
b. Carriage bolts. Carriage bolts are shown over number 7, in 
Fig. 27. It can readily be distinguished by the fact that it 
has a rounded head and a shank that is squared directly under 
the head. The squared shank is supposed to keep the bolt 
from turning when the nut is being tightened or loosened, 
but it does not always do so, particularly if the nut has rusted 
fast more or less, and when the wood is soft. Consequently 
it is sometimes quite a job to remove a carriage bolt. It is 
sometimes necessary to file the head flat on two sides or to cut 
a slot in the head with a hack saw or a file so that it may be
-P-A-G-E-70
en Ne ee 
CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 60 
held with a wrench or a screwdriver while pressure is applied 
to turn the nut. A pipe wrench may hold the round head if a 
grip can be obtained. 
. Stove bolts. Stove bolts are easily recognized by the fact that 
they have slotted heads. These heads are round or flat, just 
as with wood screws. The nut on stove bolts is usually square. 
The slotted head permits the bolt to be adjusted with a 
screwdriver. Several are shown above number 9, Fig. 27. 
. Expansion bolts. Expansion bolts are very handy when it is 
desired to fasten objects to concrete, stone, or brick walls. 
A hole is drilled with a star drill and an expansion bolt is 
inserted. The bolts are so made that the bolt expands as 
the machine bolt or the machine screw in its center is 
turned, thus making a very firm fastening. They are made 
in sizes from 4” X 1%’ to 1” X 12”, the first figure in each 
case being the inside diameter and the second one in each 
case the length. The star drill must be of the same diameter 
as the outside diameter of the expansion bolt when the lat- 
ter is unexpanded.

satisfactorily. Copper rivets from 4” to 1%’ long are sold 
with burrs in one-pound packages. 
b. Tinner’s rivets. Tinner’s or soft metal rivets are shown above 
number 11, in Fig. 27. These rivets are sold in the black as 
well as in the tinned form. They are used for riveting sheet 
metal, and for repairing holes in kettles, as when a rivet is 
placed in a hole and then riveted down on both sides of the 
metal in such a way as to make a water-tight joint. Tinner’s 
rivets may be purchased in assorted sizes. 
c. A round or button-head steel rivet, such as is used for heavy 
sheet metal, is shown above number 12, in Fig. 27. 
d. Tubular steel rivets are made of soft steel. They are used 
quite extensively in harness and other leather work. 
7. Corrugated steel fasteners. A corrugated fastener is shown above 
number 7, in Fig. 28. They are made from %” to 1” in length, 
and have from two to eleven corrugations. Corrugated fasten- 
ers are useful in holding together two adjoining parts or boards; 
as, for example, when the end piece in an apple box cracks, two 
or three of these fasteners will hold the parts together nicely. 
8. Staples. Wire staples for fencing and for poultry netting are 
frequently used on the farm. Fencing staples are from 7’’ to 
2” long, and poultry netting staples come in lengths of }4’’, 54” 
%"’ and %’’. Staples are either galvanized, or have the bright 
wire finish. The latter rust quickly. 
9. Hinges. The three types of hinges used most by farmers are 
shown in Fig. 28. Number 21 represents a T hinge, number 22 
a butt hinge, and number 23 a strap hinge. Butt hinges should 
be “gained in” flush with the parts they hold together. Butt 
hinges are made in two styles as regards the pin that connects

  CHAPTER V 
RELATING TO VEGETABLE GARDENING 
Most persons living in rural communities and many living in suburban 
places are interested in vegetable gardening. The information con- 
tained in this chapter is limited to construction and repair work that is 
done in connection with plant production. 
A Combination Flat and Germination Box 
1. Purpose. Germination boxes are used to test the viability of seed. 
In other words, they are used to see what per cent of the seed will 
sprout when proper moisture and heat are present. The boxes 
used for this purpose may vary in size, but the one shown in Fig. 
29 is made so that it can be used as an ordinary vegetable flat that 
will fit standard sized hotbeds or cold-frames after it has been used 
as a germination box. 
The saw kerfs are placed at uniform distances apart so that 
strings may be passed through them. The proper mixture of soil 
is placed in the germination box, and is tamped and leveled to a 
height up to where the saw kerfs begin. The strings are then run 
so as to lay off squares. A certain number of seeds is placed in 
each space and the whole is then covered with a damp cloth, and 
kept at a germinating temperature. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Any scrap lumber such as box and crating lumber. 
No. or Pisces DIMENSIONS PuRPOsE 
2 1546" X 2" x 1756" Sides 
2 146" X 2" x 10” Ends 
3 1346" X 3%” X 1756” Bottom 
b. Hardware. About 20 6d. or 8d. common wire nails. 
Note: The size of the nails to be used depends on the quality 
of the lumber, since some of it splits and cracks more easily than 
does other lumber. 
If the lumber at hand works up to better advantage by placing 
the bottom pieces crosswise instead of lengthwise, this may be 
done, though the flat is more usable if the bottom boards run 
lengthwise of the box. 
3. Directions. 
a. Cut all of the material to the exact sizes given in the drawing 
and also in the bill of material. 
Lay the two sides side by side and mark them for the saw

kerfs. These are two inches apart from center line to center 
line of cut. The first saw kerf and the last one being 2'%,/’ 
from the ends (two inches plus the thickness of the end piece). 
b. Mark the depth to which each saw kerf is to go. This is 4” 
according to the drawing.

    c. Saw the kerfs either with or without a miter box. 
d. Mark and saw the end pieces in the same manner, but note that 
the first and last cut in each end are just 2’ from the end instead 
of 2'%e’’ as was the case with the sides. Look at the drawing and 
see why this is true. 
e. Stand the two end pieces on end on the floor and lay a side piece

across them. The saw kerfs should all face the same way. Nail 
the side piece to the ends using two nails on each end, and apply 
a square to the corners to see that the angles are square. 
f. Nail on the remaining side. 
g. Nail on the bottom boards. Keep '” or %e’’ joints between the 
bottom boards to allow for expansion and proper drainage.

Vegetable Flat 
1. Purpose. After seed has been tested as to its viability in a ger- 
mination box, such as the one shown in Fig. 29, it may be planted 
in vegetable flats. They are used in green-houses, hotbeds, cold- 
frames, and sometimes are placed near sunny windows in the 
home. Plants may be transplanted in them one or more times. 
The flats are used without any fillers, with paper pots, and with 
paper or earth bands, depending on circumstances. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Any scrap lumber such as box lumber and crating.

Tamper for Vegetable Flat | 
1. Purpose. A tamper is usually used to firm down the soil in vege- 
table flats before the seed is sown, or the plants are transplanted 
into it, as the case may be. A working drawing of a simple tam-

b. Nail or screw the handle in place. 
ce. Finish if desired with a coat or two of linseed oil. This may be 
rubbed on with cotton waste, with a rag, or may be applied with 
a brush. 
Marker and Leveler for a Vegetable Flat 
. Purpose. After soil has been tamped into the vegetable flat, it is 
leveled off flush with the top edges of the flat by using an edge of 
a marker, such as is shown in Fig. 31 and in Fig. 32. After this 
operation the marker is used to make the small drills into which 
the seed is sown. The method of making these drills is illustrated 
in Fig. 32.

Spotting Board and Dibble 
1. Purpose. Spotting boards are used in transplanting small plants 
to flats, or from one flat to another where the plants may have more 
room for growth than formerly. Figs. 33, 35, and 36 show vari- 
ous stages of the process, while a working drawing of a spotting 
board is shown in Fig. 34. 
The term ‘“‘dibble” is applied to pointed sticks or steel points 
with which holes are made when transplanting plants. The one 
shown in Fig. 34 is designed to fit the spotting board shown in the 
same figure. 
  
  Fig. 33. Tu Sporrina Boarp 1n Posrrion 
2. Material required. The spotting board is best made of white pine, 
though yellow poplar, cypress, and other woods may be used. 
The dibble illustrated in the same drawing is made of either soft 
or hard wood. A piece of broom-handle can well be worked into 
the shape desired.

them. Keep the edges of the boards as flush as possible when 
gluing them. If the boards do not fit tightly, fit them with the 
longest plane you have. 
ce. After glue is hard, if the board is warped, plane diagonally or 
crosswise of the board until it is level, then finish by planing 
lightly with the grain. 
d. Lay off the center lines with a framing square and straight edge 
(any straight piece of lumber of proper length). 
  Fic. 35. PLANTS BEING SET IN HOLES MADE WITH THE SporTinc BoarD 
e. Place scrap lumber directly under points where holes are to be 
bored. Rest the knee on the board so that the board will fit up 
tight against the scrap lumber, and then bore the holes. This 
will prevent the auger bit from splintering the edges on the under 
side of the board. Use center lines only, to indicate where holes 
are to be bored. Bore the holes as squarely as possible to the 
surface of the board. 
f. Ream out the holes as shown in the working drawing by using the 
end of a half round cabinet file, or with sand-paper wrapped over 
a rounded stick. 
. Square up the ends of the board and cut them off. 
. Nail or screw on the end strips. 
. Nail on the 4” X 4” guide cleat. 
. A drawing knife, spoke shave, or hand axe may be used in 
“roughing off’? the wood from the tapered end of the dibble. 
Finish up the job with a plane or cabinet rasp followed by sand- 
paper. Complete the point of the dibble before cutting the 
dibble from the broom-handle or long stick that is used. oe ee Oe

. Directions. 
a. Cut the sides and end pieces, making certain that parallel pieces 
are exactly the same length, and cut square at both ends. 
b. Plane the sides and ends on all sides. 
c. Assemble and nail the end pieces between the sides, using about 
three 6d. nails for each joint. Apply a square to the corners 
while nailing to make sure they will be true. 
d. Nail the hardware cloth on to the frame with carpet tacks, placing 
them about 3” apart. They should be covered with %’’ mould- 
ing. 
e. Cut the moulding at 45 degrees in a home-made miter box or 
apply a square, using 8” on the blade and 8” on the tongue for 
the cut, and nail in place with 4”, %’’, or 1” wire brads. 
Soil or Manure Sieve (Stationary Type) 
. Purpose. Sieves of the type illustrated in Fig. 186 have a variety 
of uses. They are used for screening garden soil, gravel, manure, 
and for removing hair from patent plaster when that is desired. 
Other uses may suggest themselves. 
The screen is placed at a steep angle to the ground and then the 
material is thrown against the screen, thus separating it with the 
desired degree of fineness.

Screened Frame for Cucurbits 
. Purpose. The term “cucurbits” is used for plants such as cucum- 
bers, melons, squash, and pumpkins that belong to the same 
family. Melons, cucumbers, and others of this family are attacked 
in many places by the striped and by the spotted cucumber beetles 
and by other insect pests. The frame shown in Fig. 38 is designed 
to protect the plants from insect pests while the plants are young,

The screening material may be either cloth or wire. Cloth will 
last two or three seasons if well taken care of. Galvanized wire 
screen having about fourteen wires per inch is better, and more 
permanent, but also requires a greater outlay of money to begin 
with.

d. Suit the size of the screen to your particular requirements. 
Glass-Covered Forcing Box 
. Purpose. The glass covered forcing box is similar in construction 
and in purpose to the screened frame just described. The forcing 
box having a glass top will force plants more quickly than a screened 
frame will in cool weather, and it also keeps off injurious insects. 
Forcing boxes are used for melons and other cucurbits, espe- 
cially where the growing season is relatively short and where grow- 
ing conditions are not so good as they ought to be.

  Garden and Lawn Roller of Concrete 
1. Purpose. A roller, such as is shown in Fig. 42, may be used for a 
variety of purposes. In the early spring-time it is used to level 
up a lawn that has been raised unevenly by the frosts of winter. A

little later the roller may be used over grass and other seed-beds, for 
crushing clods, and for 7 - 
compacting soil as on a 
tennis court. 
A concrete roller is 
more satisfactory than 
one made of wood, and 
less expensive than one 
made of sheet metal. 
handle of an old lawn- 
mower may be used to 
advantage as a handle Fig. 42. ConcreTs Rotter 
for the roller. The Buitt by boys under the direction of Mr. A. E. Mack, at the 
material needed for the owe nte iaeece cab0ou 
roller shown in Fig. 43 is as follows: 
a. Concrete. 
3% cubic feet of 1: 2:3 mixture required. 
1 sack of Portland cement 
2 cu. ft. sand will make 3.9 cu. ft. of mixture. 
3 cu. ft. stone or gravel 
b. Lumber. 
2 pes. 1’ X 12” X 2’ for bottom of form. 
24 lineal ft. 1’ x 2” for form. 
1 pe. 1%” X 1%’ X 3’ for handle. 
e. Hardware. 
One 4” round rod 27” long, or piece of %’’ pipe. 
Four }4” washers. 
Two cotter pins, 1%’’ long or two %’’ nuts, or else 2 caps to fit 
pipe if it is used instead of rod. 
1 pe. 3%” pipe, 13’’ long, with cap screwed on each end for 
handle to lawn-mower. 
2 machine bolts 4” x 244’. 
2 machine bolts 4” x 2’. 
1 pe. of sheet iron or tin, 24” X 51” (allows %” lap). 
20 lineal feet of baling wire. 
  8. Directions. 
a. Construct the base for the form by nailing two pieces of 
1” X 10” X 24” side by side to two 1’ X 2” battens. 
b. Draw diagonals, thus locating exact center of base. With this 
as a center draw a circle having a radius of 8’’, or a diameter of 
16”. 
ce. Nail four cleats of 1/’ X 2’ material tangent — that is, just 
touching this circle on the outside edges, spacing these cleats 
equally around the circumference.
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
d. Toe-nail an upright piece 1’ x 2” X 22%” at the points of 
tangency. 
. To hold the top of the form in shape, use four cleats nailed 
together so as to form a four-sided figure, the inside edges of 
which are tangent to a 16” circle. It does not matter whether 
an accurate square is formed just so that all cleats touch the 
circle. This top piece can be nailed together around the circle 
on the base of the form. 
Nail the cap just made on top of the four uprights. 
g. Rub axle grease or other grease over the inside of the tin where _ it is to come in contact with the cement. Next insert the tin or 
sheet metal into the form. Fasten baling or other wire entirely 
around it in four places so as to help it retain its proper shape, the 
wires being placed around the tin, but inside the wooden upright 
parts of the form. 
. Fasten a 1’ X 2” strip over the top in such a way as to hold the 
upper end of the rod or pipe being used as an axis directly in the 
center. A hole is bored in this strip to correspond to the one in 
the base of the form. Insert the rod or pipe. (See m, below.) 
. Mix the sand and cement thoroughly before applying water. 
Add enough water so that the mixture tends to flatten out when 
piled in a heap. 
. While pouring the cement, use a piece of band iron or a wooden 
paddle along the inside of the form in such a way as to cause 
any air bubbles to escape that might be formed in pouring 
the cement. 
. Keep in a cool, shady place. As soon as the concrete is hard 
enough to be self-sustaining, remove the forms. Patch up any 
imperfections with a 1 to 1 mixture (1 part cement to 1 part 
sand) and smooth up the ridge that may have been formed 
where the form joined together. 
. A cement-water wash made of equal parts of cement and sand, 
to which water is added until it flows freely, may be painted over 
the concrete work. Use a whitewash or a cement worker’s 
brush for the purpose. 
. The method of fastening the handle will depend on whether or 
not the central axis is a steel bar or a piece of iron pipe. 
(1) If it is a steel bar, either drill holes for cotter-pins at each 
end or cut threads on the ends and use machine nuts. 
These operations should be performed before the rod is 
surrounded with concrete. 
(2) If a piece of iron pipe is used, have pipe threads cut on the 
ends before pouring the concrete, and use pipe caps to hold 
the handle in place. 
. Oil bearings well while using the roller as there is considerable 
friction, and store in a dry shady place while not in use. |

  Green-House Bench 
1. Purpose. A green-house bench, such as shown in Fig. 44, is 
frequently used where flowers, such as roses, carnations, and 
chrysanthemums are grown, and for vegetable plants, such as 
cabbage, tomatoes, egg-plant, and peppers. The benches are 
usually about 30” high from the ground to the top of the boards

Hotbed (Wood, Pit Type) 
1. Purpose. Hotbeds are used to “force” plants; that is, seed is 
sown and plants are grown in them earlier and faster than they 
could be grown in the garden at that season of the year. This is 
largely due to the heat or warmth that may be supplied by means 
of hotbeds, and the protection that the frame affords. The heat is 
supplied from two sources, namely, sunlight that comes through 
the hotbed sash, and heat caused by the decomposition of fresh 
horse manure which is placed in the pit built for the purpose. 
A cold-frame differs from a hotbed in that a cold-frame is not 
supplied with undecomposed horse manure. After a hotbed has 
lost its internal heat, it becomes a cold-frame. 
2. Material required. Standard sized hotbed sash are 3’ X 6’. It is 
usually cheaper to buy them factory-made than to make them by 
hand. Sometimes ordinary window-sash can be purchased cheaply. 
These may serve the purpose, but the hotbed will want to be made 
to fit them. 
The following material is required for the hotbed illustrated in 
Fig. 46.

3. Directions. 
a. Dig a pit at least 22’’ deep by 6’ 2” long and 6’ wide. Dig it so 
that the 6’ 2” distance runs east and west. This will make it 
possible to face the lowest side (the front) of the hotbed to the 
south. It may be well to dig the pit a little larger to make it 
easier to nail the sides and ends together. If the ground does 
not stand up well, drive 2’’ x 4” stakes at the corners, outside 
the hotbed, and nail the boards to these stakes. 
b. Put a bevel of 6’ in 6’ on two 1” X 12’ side boards. Nail the 
sides so that they will project above the front 1%’ or a distance 
equal to the thickness of the sash. This makes the joints more 
air-tight than if the sash simply is laid on top of the frame. 
c. Nail the cross-bar in position with the upper edge (not including 
the parting stop) flush with the top of the front. Cut a notch 
1” deep X 3” wide in the front piece to hold the cross-bar. At

the back side of the frame nail through the back instead of notch- 
ing it for the cross-bar. 
d. The guide strips on the sides and back are next nailed in place 
with 6d. common wire nails. 
e. Place at least 18’’ of fresh horse manure in the pit and about 4’ 
of soil above that. The manure should be well tramped down. 
For details refer to some of the references on hotbed construc- 
tion found at the end of this chapter. 
Hotbed (Portable, Knock-Down, Surface Type) : 
1. A hotbed of the portable, knock-down type is shown in Fig. 47. 
This hotbed was designed and built by the School of Agriculture 
of Purdue University. Fig. 47 shows a frame designed for four

standard (3’ X 6’) sash, while Fig. 48 shows the same type of 
hotbed half as large. The latter is large enough for a family 
garden. 3 
Hotbeds of the surface type may be built as shown in Fig. 48. 
No pit is dug. The manure is tramped in a layer a couple of feet 
wider and larger than the hotbed frame, directly on the ground in 
a sheltered spot, and the frame is set over it. Manure is drawn 
around the frame to protect it from the weather. 
Portable frames may be used to start cucumbers, parsley, melons, 
etc., and may be removed after the plants have grown quite large, 
as illustrated in Farmers’ Bulletin No. 460 entitled “Frames as a 
Factor in Truck-Growing.”

not explained in the preceding project. 
Place two strap hinges on each of two diagonally opposite corners 
and hinge hasps, crate hasps, or other fasteners on the other two

  CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
Hotbed (Permanent, Concrete Walls) 
. Often a hotbed is located in a certain sheltered place on the farm, 
or near the garden, and the same place will want to be used for 
years. Then it will pay to build the hotbed of stone, brick, or 
concrete. 
Concrete lends itself so well to the purpose that a list is given 
herewith of the materials required for the concrete hotbed il- 
lustrated in Fig. 49. 
. Material required. 
a. Concrete. 
Mixture of 1 part cement. 
2% parts sand. 
4 parts pebbles or stone. 
b. Quantities required. 
7 sacks of cement. 
17.5 cu. ft. sand. 
28 cu. ft. pebbles or crushed stone. 
c. Hardware. 1 “T” bar 2” wide, 6’ long. 
d. Sash. Two 3’ X 6’ hotbed sash. 
. Directions. 
a. Stake out a pit 6’ 10” < 6’ 10”. 
b. Dig the pit 22’ deep. Where concrete walls are to be placed, 
dig 24” deep. : 
c. Erect forms similar to those shown in Fig. 192, with the exception 
that the form is used only on the inside below the ground level. 
This is because the earth may be spaded off in a vertical surface 
so as to make a form on the outside necessary only above the 
ground line. 
d. The forms should be constructed of surfaced lumber, and should 
be water-tight. Fasten the form by means of stakes and braces 
as illustrated in Fig. 192. 
e. Mix the cement as has been explained under “ Hand-mixing 
concrete,” Chapter III. If the weather is sunny, sprinkle the 
“green” concrete occasionally and keep it shaded with boards, 
sacks, or tar-paper. 
f. After the walls are self-sustaining, remove the forms and finish 
the parts exposed to view by giving them a cement-water wash 
or else a floated surface. 
g. Place the steel T bar in position so as to form the supporting 
cross-tie for the sash. This may well be done before the concrete 
is poured. 
. Cement-water wash. This is usually made of 1 part of cement, 1 
part of clean fine sand, and sufficient water to make a paint. 
This wash is applied to the concrete surface, immediately after

the forms are removed, with a whitewash brush. Such painting 
fills up the pores and covers irregularities, but it has the disad- 
vantage that it is likely to hair-crack and check, and may scale off. 
5. Floated finish. A better finish than the one produced by the 
cement-water wash may be obtained by floating the surface with a  
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
carborundum block or with a home-made wooden float as shown in 
Fig. 187. A floated surface will not scale off. 
Remove the forms as soon as possible. The sooner the surface 
is floated after the walls are self-sustaining and the forms-are re- 
moved, the better it will be. The procedure is as follows: 
a. Chip off all ridges or irregular projections and fill or “point-up”’ 
holes. 
b. Wet the concrete surface, and keep it wet while rubbing it with 
the block or with the float. 
c. Rinse or wash off the surface after it has been rubbed down to the 
smoothness desired. 
Stakes for Tomatoes 
The earliest and best formed tomatoes are grown when the plants are 
supported on stakes or else on some form of trellis. 
For this purpose stakes may be cut in near-by woods. Young saplings 
tapering from 1” or 2” to about 1’’, and from 4’ 6” to 6’ long, serve 
nicely. It is best to cut them in the late fall or winter and season them 
before use. 
Where saplings cannot be obtained stakes may be cut from lumber. 
Durable tomato stakes can be made of 1%’” X 1%4’’ chestnut, oak, cy- 
press, cedar, and other lumber. The length may vary between 4’ 6” 
and 6’. 
Point the stakes well and drive them when the soil is wet, either at the 
time of planting or about the time the first cluster of tomatoes is forming. 
Tomato Trellis 
The trellis illustrated in Fig. 50 is adapted to home-garden condi- 
tions. 
It will be noticed that the trellis is made so that it can be folded up at 
the end of the season for use in following years.

a 45-degree cut on one end, and a square cut on the opposite end 
of each leg. A 45-degree cut is marked off with a steel square 
by holding equal distances on the blade and the tongue as il-

legs may be spaced at various distances apart, depending upon 
how far apart the tomato plants stand in the row, and upon the 
nature and size of the lumber available. 
e. Holes are bored about 3” above the ground line for wire or heavy 
twine that will keep the trellis in proper position. These holes 
should be bored near the outside edges of the pieces so that they 
may not tear out. 
f. The plants are trained through the middle opening in the trellis. 
g. At the end of the season, before frosts come, the vines are cut off 
near the ground and hung upside down in the attic or other 
suitable place so that the green fruit may gradually ripen. The 
trellis is telescoped and stored away in a dry place for future 
use.

  CHAPTER VI 
RELATING TO POULTRY HUSBANDRY 
Poutrry husbandry is being carried on in most parts of the civilized 
world. Most eggs produced in the United States are produced as a 
“side-line,” either on the farm where animal or crop production is 
depended upon for the major part of the income, or in urban communities 
where poultry husbandry is an avocation with large numbers of persons. 
Many persons do not get as good returns as they should from their 
flocks because of poor housing facilities, and because of lack of suitable 
poultry-house conveniences. The subject-matter in this chapter is 
selected with a view to being helpful to those who wish to do construction 
or repair work in connection with poultry husbandry. 
Egg-Tester (to be used with kerosene lamp) 
1. Purpose. An egg-tester, or an egg-candler as it is sometimes 
called, may be made in a number of ways. The type of construc- 
tion is governed by the kind of light that is used. Sunlight, the 
kerosene flame, and electric light are all used. As sunlight is not 
always available, artificial light is usually provided. Fig. 51 
shows an egg-tester made for use with a common kerosene lamp. 
Notice that the chimney projects out of the box, and that air-holes 
must be provided in the bottom of the box so that the lamp will 
burn properly. 
The egg is held before the opening, the room being dark, and is 
examined for infertility, blood-ring, etc. By means of the light 
back of the egg, one is able to detect imperfections. 
It is best to test all eggs that are to be used for food, and it is 
likewise best to examine eggs for hatching, before and during the 
period of incubation.

A few 3d. brads or nails. 
A kerosene lamp. 
A small piece of felt. 
3. Directions. 
a. The dimensions given in the drawing are merely suggestive. 
Make the tester so that it will fit the kerosene lamp that is avail- 
able for it. 
. Nail the sides to the bottom piece after holes have been bored in 
the latter for air. 
. Nail back in place, and fit front piece so that the upper edge will 
be beveled to fit the lid. 
. Fit the top piece in place. Cut a hole for the chimney a little 
larger than the diameter of the chimney at this point in order 
that the lamp may be raised so that the lamp may be taken out 
through the door of the tester. 
. Line the peep-hole in the lid with felt or similar material. This 
makes it possible to fit the eggs tightly against the opening with- 
out danger of breaking the eggs. 
. The cleats are nailed under the bottom to allow the air to enter 
the tester freely.

Feed Trough (Open Type) 
1. Purpose. Troughs of several kinds are used for feeding wet 
mash, and other forms of wet food that cannot well be strewn about 
the yard or in the litter. 
These troughs can be made in various lengths and shapes to suit 
special requirements. They are usually made of lumber, but some- 
times sheet iron and cast iron are also employed. 
The open type feed trough illustrated in the drawing is easy to 
make but has the disadvantage that it is difficult to keep clean.

. Directions. 
-a. Joint the edges of the two pieces that are to form the sides of the 
trough, and fasten them together, using nails or screws set from 
4” to 6” apart. 
b. Cut out the pieces. Plane them smooth and flat and nail or 
screw them to the sides of the trough in such a way that the sides 
do not touch the ground, as this would cause them to decay more 
quickly. 
c. Fasten the cross-cleat in place:~ 
d. It is well to give feed troughs two coats of linseed oil, inside and 
outside. Let each coat dry thoroughly before applying the next 
one. Apply the oil with cotton waste or with a rag.

or tin, 2%’ wide by 6’ long, with sufficient tacks or shingle nails 
to fasten the same. 
. Directions. 
a. The method of construction is almost identical with that of the 
open type trough that has already been explained, with the excep- 
tion of the guard rail which is added in this case. After fastening 
together the sides, put on the ends, and then the cross-cleat. 
b. Next fasten the lengthwise guard rail in position, placing it as 
shown in the drawing, or so that poultry will not try to get un- 
der it. 
c. To keep poultry from flying and roosting on this rail, fasten a 
narrow strip of hardware cloth on it by means of 8d. common 
wire nails. This hardware cloth should be cut so as to leave a 
ragged edge on its top edge. 
d. If hardware cloth (square mesh wire having 3 or 4 wires per 
inch) is not available, use tin or sheet metal which is cut saw-

can be nailed on the top guard rail. 
Poultry Feed Bin 
. Purpose. A feed bin having several partitions and a sloping top so 
that poultry will not roost on it is very desirable. The bin should 
have several parts for dry mash and one or more varieties of scratch 
feed. 
. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Usually box or crating material can be secured at 
slight expense. Perhaps a box can be found that can be worked 
into a feed box as shown with little effort and expense.

Mash-Hopper for Chicks 
. Purpose. Young chicks can be fed either dry or wet mash, as well 
as small scratch feed in shallow trays or hoppers such as shown in 
the drawing. These trays are made in lengths that are conven- 
iently handled. 
If the mother hen is with the chicks in order to keep her from 
wasting feed by scratching it out of the trays it is well to place a 
piece of hardware cloth or a piece of 1’’ mesh chicken wire over the 
feed. 
It will be noticed that the two trays shown are approximately 
‘the same size. The chief difference is that one is made of wood 
while the other is of sheet metal with only the end pieces of wood. 
The trays could also be made entirely of sheet metal.

About 14 3d. common wire nails. 
8. Directions (for tray No. 1). 
a. Nail the tray together as shown in the drawing. The bottom is 
nailed to the end pieces before the sides are put on. 
b. Finish the tray with two coats of linseed oil. 
c. The piece of wire mentioned in the bill of material is to go around 
the edges of the hardware cloth so as to stiffen it, and keep it in 
shape. Bend the wire so that it will form a rectangle %” shorter 
and 5’’ narrower than the inside dimensions of the tray. 
d. With a pair of pliers crimp the hardware cloth, or the netting, as 
the case may be, around the wire frame just mentioned. Use 
it with the smooth side up — that is, with the crimped edge on 
the under side so that small chicks may not hurt themselves 
on it. 
e. If the tray is made of good smooth lumber it will pay to give it 
two coats of boiled linseed oil. It is easier to keep the tray clean, 
and it will last longer if treated with linseed oil. 
4. Directions (for tray No. 2). 
a. The piece of tin or galvanized iron that is to form the bottom and 
sides is folded in shape by laying the sheet on a bench so that #4” 
of the side of the sheet projects. Place a piece of 2’ x 4’’ x 2’ 
on top of it, and with another piece of 2’ X 4’’ material about a 
foot long bend down the projecting edge until it is at right angles 
to the sheet, and forms a sharp crease at the point of bending. 
It may then be bent down flat against itself with ease. This is 
to stiffen the edge. 
b. Perform the same operation on the opposite side of the sheet. 
c. Bend the tin or sheet metal over a length of 2’ x 4” or 2” X 6” 
material by the method explained under ‘“‘a” to the shape re- 
quired to fit the end pieces. 
d. Nail the sheet metal to the ends with shingle nails set about 1” 
apart. 
e. If bright tin is used it should be painted on both sides with iron- 
oxide or Prince’s metallic paint. Any kind of exterior house 
paint is better than none.
-P-A-G-E-111
  RELATING TO POULTRY HUSBANDRY I0r 
f. Galvanized iron is better than tin for the purpose. It need not 
be painted. 
Indoor Dry-Mash Hopper for Poultry 
. Purpose. Dry-mash hoppers are extensively used by poultrymen. 
Dry mash of varying composition is kept before poultry at all 
times, either in indoor or outdoor hoppers. 
The average dry-mash hopper is either wasteful, in that it per- 
mits the birds to waste some of the food, or it has a tendency to 
clog. The one illustrated in the drawing has been used successfully 
for several years at the Pennsylvania State College by the Poultry 
Department. 
It will be noticed that the hopper is set on a platform about 15” 
above the floor. This is done to prevent the birds from scratching 
litter into the hopper. 
  Fic. 54. Dry-Mass Hopper 
Built by students under the direction of Mr. W. G. Hall, at the Pennsylvania State College. 
The hopper is a unit in itself, and is set on the stand, but not 
fastened thereto. 
The wire guard running lengthwise of the hopper will effectively 
keep poultry from roosting on the hopper. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Many varieties of lumber can be used. Sometimes 
box or crating material will serve the purpose.

c. Fasten the cross-pieces to the legs. See to it that the inside edge 
of each leg is 9” from the end of the cross-piece, and that the legs 
are nailed on square to the cross-piece. 
d. The top boards of the stand should not be nailed fast until the 
hopper has been made. The latter should be placed on the stand 
and then the top boards may be nailed, allowing }’’ space on 
both sides so that the hopper can be removed easily when it needs 
to be cleaned. 
e. In selecting the top boards it will be well to choose lumber with

b. Select a bottom board about 1134’’ wide and cut the end boards 
exactly the same length as the bottom board is wide. : 
Cut the end boards to the dimensions shown or to fit bottom and 
side boards that may be chosen. 
. Cut the bevels on the end boards and notches '%e’’ wide by %4’’ 
deep at the top points to receive the ends of the top guard rail. 
. Nail strips 1%o’’ x 1%4’’ x 4’ on the top edge of each side, and 
bore holes about 1’’ in dianteter and 3” apart in these strips and 
in the top guard rail. 
. Pass baling or other wire through these holes. Draw the wires 
taut and fasten the ends. 
. The wire crest of hardware cloth or of tin cut to saw-tooth points 
is then fastened to the top guard rail running lengthwise of the 
hopper. 
. Finish if desired with linseed oil, or with paint. 
. Strips of wood about % ’"X 4” can be used instead of the wires 
to keep the birds from raking out the feed by means of a sidewise 
movement of their heads.

shown in the drawing for two of the 1%e’’ X 134” cleats. Use a 
square in assembling the job, making certain that the legs are 
square to the sides and the sides square to the ends. 
b. Nail the side pieces in place, and turn the frame upside down in 
order to fasten the board upon which the bottom of the pail 
rests. 
c. The top part of the stand is to be made removable, therefore nail 
the top strips to the cross-cleats only, and let the cleats fit rather 
loosely in the supporting notches. 
The two inside cleats are 26’ long and run from outside to 
outside. The two outside cleats (those nearest the outer edges) 
are cut 204” long so that they will fit loosely between the legs 
near the sides. The weight at this point is carried by the sides, 
not by the cleats. 
d. With a nail-set drive the nails in the top strips slightly below the 
surface so that a hoe or other scraping tool used for cleaning the 
stand will not catch on the nail heads. 
Oats Sprouter 
. Purpose. One of the best green feeds for poultry during the 
winter season, or when they do not have access to grass, is supplied 
by sprouting oats. Oats may be sprouted and allowed to grow 
until it is four to six inches high when it is fed to poultry. One 
square inch of the sprouted oats four or six inches high per day per 
bird is sufficient. 
A convenient way to sprout oats is with the use of an oats 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
106 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
sprouter such as the one illustrated. The drawing shows the frame- 
work only. It is made to hold four standard size vegetable flats, 
the details of which are given in Fig. 34. 
Oats are sprouted as follows: Pour a few quarts of good heavy 
feed oats in a pail containing as much water as the oats will absorb. 
To prevent mould, add one drop of formalin for each quart of 
water used. Let the oats soak in the pail in a warm room for 
forty-eight hours. Then pour the oats into the trays of the oats 
sprouter, spreading the oats 1’’ thick. Keep the rack in a fairly 
warm room, and sprinkle the growing oats twice a day. It should 
; be four to six inches high, and ready for use within a week after 
being placed.

two pieces, one piece 23%’’ long and one piece 16” long. The 
pieces should be exact in length, and the short pieces should 
start and end 3%’ from the ends of the long pieces. This is 
because the short pieces fit between the legs of the sprouter 
while the longer ones are nailed to the sides of the legs, and run 
from outside to outside of the legs. 
b, Fasten the guide strips to the legs. Hach pair of strips on op- 
’ posite sides of the sprouter should be the same distance from the 
ground. 
c. The two sides may next be connected at the top and at the 
bottom with the base boards and the top cross-pieces, all of 
which are 18%’ long. 
d. Fasten the braces shown at the back of the sprouter in place. 
Square up the various parts during the process of construction, 
and check up before fastening the braces. 
e. Screws may be used throughout instead of nails, but it is not 
necessary. 
f. It is desirable to place castors under the sprouter so that it can

Poultry Feeder (for Green Feed) 
1. Purpose. In feeding lawn clippings, cut grass, or clover to poultry, 
difficulty is usually experienced in that the birds walk over and 
waste a good deal of this succulent food. In order to overcome 
this the feeder shown herewith has been designed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
The feeder is hung on a wall at a height so that the birds can just, 
reach the lower end of it which is covered with wire mesh. The 
green food is placed in the feeder through a hinged door at the top. 
This is built at an angle to keep the birds from roosting upon it. 
The sloping bottom tends to make the contents of the feeder work 
downward, and also makes it possible for birds of different height 
to reach the food.

sions given and nail it in place. 
g. Finish the lower part of the front of the hopper by nailing the 
1346’ X 2’’ strip on the front piece and the }4’’ x 4” division bars 
in place. Wire can be used in place of the wooden division bars. 
h. Hinge the two parts of the top together before nailing the upper 
part of the top in place. 
i. Paint the hopper if desired with two coats of good exterior paint. 
Out-door Dry-Mash Hopper 
1. Purpose. Out-door dry-mash hoppers are frequently used. One 
of the greatest difficulties arises from the fact that rain may get into 
them and dampen the mash so that it may spoil, and it sometimes 
clogs in the hopper so that the birds cannot get at it. 
The hopper illustrated in Fig. 62 and in the working drawing 
shown was made for young chicks. Place the hopper with the 
closed side toward the prevailing storms.

which may be thought of as a partition running lengthwise of the 
hopper. If the working drawing and the photograph of the 
completed hopper, Fig. 62, are noted closely the method of con- 
struction should be quite evident. 
b. The lid covering the openings through which the birds feed may 
or may not be made in two parts as shown depending upon 
personal preference. 
c. Instead of the wooden division bees shown in the front view of the 
drawing, wire bars may be inserted as shown in the side view. 
d. Paint or apply linseed oil to the hopper. 
One-Hen Brooder Coop 
. Purpose. A good many one-hen brooder coops are used in connec- 
tion with small flocks of poultry. Sometimes a barrel is turned on 
one side, or a dry-goods box may be provided for the setting hen, 
but such makeshift provisions do not give the hen, nor the young 
chicks when they are hatched, the protection that should be theirs. 
They should be protected not only against the weather, but against 
rats, cats, dogs, ete. 
The figure ‘‘A’’ one-hen brooder coop that is shown herewith is 
comparatively simple to make. The roof is set over the bottom, 
but is not fastened to it. The front door with its wire panel pro- 
vides ventilation and protection. It is made as shown in detail in 
the drawing of the two-hen incubation and brooder coop. 
. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Usually box or crating material may be found that will 
serve the purpose. Many kinds of lumber can be used.

Instead of these the roof boards could be covered with tar 
paper. 
. Make the door out of '%6’’ X 2’ material. Pivot it near the 
bottom by using 8d. common nails from which the heads have 
been cut. Drill holes for these nails, and hang the door before 
nailing the boards fast that fit around the door. Note that the 
lower edge of the door is rounded off so that it will turn all the 
way to the ground. The door could also be hinged, either at the 
top or bottom instead of being pivoted. 
Portable Run-Way for Figure ‘‘ A’? Coop 
1. Purpose. Those who do not like to use a rectangular run-way with 
a Figure “A” coop can use one made as shown herewith. This

The bottom and top are not nailed to the sides so either can 
easily be removed. The dividing partition likewise is simply slid 
between the guide strips so that the entire coop can be easily cleaned 
and disinfected. 
A hinged board that ordinarily falls back upon the roof of the 
coop can easily be dropped down in case of heavy storms. Further 
protection ‘is ordinarily not required if the back or low end of the 
coop is set so it faces the direction from which the prevailing storms 
come. Additional protection can be supplied however by fitting 
small boards 4” thick against the screen in the two lower doors. 
These boards may be held in place with small turn buttons so that 
they can be inserted or removed in a moment.

  wo . Directions. 
a. To construct the bottom nail the flooring material to the bottom 
cleats in such a way that the sides will come directly on the 
cleats all around, and so that the bottom boards will fit between 
the sides, leaving %” space at both ends and sides to allow for 
expansion; this is shown in the cross-section view Fig. 67.  
-P-A-G-E-130
120 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
b. Cut the material for the two sides using the beveled piece that is 
cut from the one side for a similar space on the opposite side. 
Nail the side boards to the 1” X 2” cleats. 
c. Next nail the boards forming the back tightly against the sides, 
and square to the latter. 
d. The front of the coop is the most difficult part to make. Begin 
by cutting the various pieces as listed in the bill of material, and 
fit them together as shown in the working drawing. The corner 
boards (uprights) are nailed in place one at a time. Fasten the 
three long pieces running across the front to the uprights with 
8d. finishing nails, using a nail set. Before they are fastened 
however the doors must be made and they must be hung in place 
by means of nails on which they pivot. Small holes should be 
drilled for the pivot nails. 
e. The doors are not at all difficult to make. The process is shown 
in the detailed drawing. 
f. The hardware cloth or the poultry wire is fastened to the inside of 
the doors and the openings above them with wire staples %’’ long. 
Place these staples in such a way that they will not split the 
wood. 
g. The swinging board that is hinged to the roof is fastened on after 
the roofing material has been put on. 
h. “Prepared” roofing material such as various papers, that are 
treated by the manufacturer with asphalt and other compounds 
are usually fastened with flat-head roofing tacks or else with 
shingle-nails and tin washers. Place these along the edges of the 
boards (not on the flat surfaces). Before nailing roofing material 
in place it should be exposed to the warm sun for several hours 
so that it will expand before being nailed down. Otherwise the 
material will buckle up and wrinkle during warm weather. The 
larger the surface the more important it becomes to expand pre- 
pared roofing before it is nailed in place. 
. Observe that the top swinging board that is hinged to the roof is 
hinged one inch back from the hinge joint so that it will pass the 
projecting roof, and fit against the front of the coop. 
j. In making turn buttons such as shown in the drawing it is best to 
drill through the button a hole of the same diameter as the 
screw that is to be used. 
k. The back and the sides of the coop should be air tight. If 
tongued and gtooved lumber is not at hand, either use lathes or 
other strips over the joints or put tar-paper around the back and 
sides as well as on the roof. It is well to place the coop in a pro- 
tected place and where it is easy to reach. Use hay or straw for 
nesting material. Shavings are not satisfactory for nesting 
material for a setting hen.

Double-Tier Wall Nests 
1. Purpose. Various types of nests are in use by progressive poultry- 
men. ‘The construction differs with the design of the poultry 
house. Sometimes nests may best be placed on the side walls, at 
other times they fit in better under the dropping boards. 
The double-tier wall nests herewith illustrated are substantially 
the same as those designed by the Poultry Husbandry Department 
of Purdue University, and shown in their Bulletin No. 211. 
It will be noticed that the nests are easily cleaned as they can 
be unhooked from the wall. The steep top board prevents birds 
from roosting on top of the nests. 
An unusual feature is found in the “running boards” which are 
hinged to the nests in such a way as to make it easily possible to 
lift them out of the way and close the nests with them in the late 
afternoons and evenings so as to exclude broody hens or to keep 
young chicks from roosting in the nests.

. Purpose. The object in placing nests under dropping boards is to 
save space in the poultry house. The nests shown in the accom-

a. The bottom and the running board are nailed on cleats, and are 
entirely separate from the rest of the nest, which ipa cleaning 
easy. 
b. The nests are simple in construction. 
c. They are placed in a darkened position which hens like.

c. The top is made detachable by nailing the boards to cleats which 
rest against the front of the nest and on a strip nailed to the wall. 
A small “scab” or piece of waste lumber should be nailed against 
the board forming the front of the nest in such a way as to catch

Trap Nests 
1. Purpose. Trap nests are used primarily by poultrymen who wish 
to keep an accurate record of the egg-production of individual hens, 
and who may wish to keep separately the eggs from particular 
birds for hatching purposes. The trap nest is not frequently used 
in connection with the average farm flock because considerable 
attention is required to carry on trap-nesting. 
Since trap nests are valuable for those who can give the necessary 
time to them, a working drawing and explanation are given here- 
with of a form of trap nest that is now used in many States. It has 
been used in slightly varying forms for years by the poultry depart- 
ment of a number of State colleges. (See Extension Circular No. 
47, Farm Poultry, The Pennsylvania State College).

it keeps the nesting material in place, and it forces the hen to

that the birds will not roost upon it. Note that it is arranged so 
that it can be raised enough to allow the trap nests to be drawn 
out from under it. 
e. The triggers should all be adjusted carefully so that they will 
“spring” when a slight touch is given the door. A leather 
washer placed between the side of the trap nest and the trigger, 
and also under the head of the screw holding the trigger will tend 
to reduce friction. 
f. The openings in the doors are rounded off so that the birds will 
not injure their neck feathers when looking out. 
g. Plain boards may be used in place of the tongued and grooved 
material shown in the drawing. 
h. Place the nests so that the first battery is about 14” above the 
floor. 
i. The bill of material as made out is for one set of four nests with 
the supporting brackets and the roof. Two or more bere may be 
placed one above the other. 
Poultry-House Construction 
. Essential requirements. A large variety of types of poultry houses 
are in use throughout the country. There is no single type that is 
equally well suited to all places. Many poultry houses have been 
erected, however, without regard to fundamental principles that 
should govern such construction. 
Certain essential requirements are presented herewith. 
a. Economy of structure. From the standpoint of successful farm- 
ing, one of the most essential requirements is that the enterprise 
must be conducted on a paying basis. To favor this, poultry 
houses should not be too elaborate in design, nor too large in size. 
The income from the flock should pay for interest on the capital 
invested, for maintenance, and should render a fair profit in addi- 
tion. 
It will be recognized that true economy does not necessarily 
consist in buying the cheapest material available. On the con- 
trary, in selecting the type of building, and the kinds of material 
that are to be used, due consideration should be given to dura- 
bility and cost of up-keep as well as to the initial cost. 
b. Economy of arrangement. Success or failure in the poultry 
\ business depends to quite an extent upon whether or not every- 
thing pertaining to the poultry business is arranged conveniently 
so that time and labor will be saved. A little additional thought 
and work put upon labor-saving conveniences such as handy 
feeding, watering, and laying devices will often change what 
would otherwise be a loss into profit. 
c. Protection against weather conditions. Poultry needs to be pro-_
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
tected well against dampness, draft, and extremes in temperature. 
The dampness may be from one of several sources, namely, rain, 
soil or surface moisture, and moisture caused through condensa- 
tion within the poultry house. Poultry houses should be as dry 
as possible. 
  Fia. 74. Boys pumtpine A Pouurry Housse at Mippietown, Conn. ©

Recent practice shows that birds can stand a good deal of cold 
provided they are kept dry and out of drafts. The New Jersey 
type of poultry house is more open than the Missouri and the 
Iowa types. 
d. Ventilation. The birds from which our present domestic poultry 
was developed lived in the open. Many poultry houses do not 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
RELATING TO POULTRY HUSBANDRY 133 
have sufficient ventilation. There should be an abundance of 
pure air, without drafts. This can be provided by proper open- 
ings for ventilation. There should be no draft over the roosts,

particularly since the birds are inactive when roosting and are 
more likely to catch cold there than elsewhere. 
e. Sunlight. Sunlight has an energizing effect upon birds as well 
as upon human beings, and it destroys harmful germs and 
bacteria. It is therefore desirable to have sunlight in the 
  Fic. 76. An 8’ X 10’ Cotony House 
Built by pupils at Chippewa Falls, Wis. Photograph, courtesy of Mr.G. W. 
Gehrand, State Supervisor of Vocational Agriculture, Madison, Wis. 
poultry house as much as possible, especially during the winter 
‘months. Poultry will remain active longer hours during the day, 
and, other things being equal, will lay more if kept in a well- 
lighted pen than in a dark one. A number of poultrymen who 
can obtain electric light cheaply are using artificial light in the 
poultry house before and after sunset in the winter months in 
order to “lengthen the day” and increase egg production. 
f. Protection against rats and mice and other vermin. In some sec- 
tions of the country rats cause considerable loss to poultrymen. 
Mice are not so serious a pest, but both can be controlled by 
using concrete floors and foundations, and by taking other pro- 
tective measures. 
g. Health and sanitation. Poultry houses and yards should be as 
healthful and sanitary as possible. The location should prefer- 
ably be on a sandy soil having good drainage, and a good ex- 
posure with shade in places. The interior finish of the poultry 
house should be as plain and smooth as possible so that mites, 
lice, and microbes can be reached with disinfectants. 
2. Types of laying houses. There are three rather distinct kinds of 
laying houses. The first of these is the single unit house. Perhaps 
nine out of every ten farmers who have poultry houses, have this
-P-A-G-E-145
RELATING TO POULTRY HUSBANDRY 135 
type of ahouse. Several examples of this are shown in this chapter; 
as, for example, Figures 75, 76, 79, and 81. 
The second type is the large single unit house in which 100 or 
more birds are kept. The third type is the large multiple unit 
house in which a number of small unit flocks are kept. The 
two latter types are used when poultry is raised on an extensive 
plan. 
The single unit type of house has many variations. Some forms 
are portable; that is, are placed on skids. Others are stationary. 
They differ too in size and arrangement. The suburban back-yard 
poultry house sometimes has two or more decks or levels and a 
scratching pen underneath, while the farm-unit type of poultry 
house is built along more ample lines.

TION AT THE Kansas INDUSTRIAL AND EpucaTIONAL INSTITUTE 
Photograph, courtesy of Mr. Wm. R. Curry, Topeka, Kansas. 
3. Size of the laying house. The amount of floor space that should be 
allowed per hen depends somewhat upon the size and characteristics 
of the breed, and upon the knowledge and skill of the caretaker. 
From three to five square feet of floor space should be allowed per 
bird. The smaller the coop the greater should be the floor space per 
bird. Ordinarily it is best to make the house not less than 8’ wide 
nor less than 10’ deep. The depth is required to provide protection 
from drafts. 
Houses of the shed-roof type need not be more than four or five 
feet high at the back or low side, and should be high enough at the 
front to permit a door to be placed there or just around the side. 
4. Foundations. Posts, skids, stones, bricks, and concrete are all used 
for foundations. The conditions obtaining in specific cases will
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
determine which of these will be used. There is a trend toward the 
use of concrete for foundations for all except portable poultry 
houses. 
5. Walls. In concrete foundations some 2” X 6” planks are usually 
laid upon the foundation. These planks are called plates. The 
studdings are toe-nailed to them. Top plates are also placed on top 
of the studdings to hold the latter in place, and give support for 
rafters and openings. The top plates are frequently spiked to 
studdings before they are raised 
When posts are used for foundations the sills are sometimes made 
of 4’ x 6” or 6” X 6” timbers. 
Walls if of wood are usually covered with (a) boards and battens, 
(b) rustic, (c) siding or other forms of lumber, and the walls are 
ceiled on the inside, at least around the roosts. 
6. Openings. Openings should be of proper proportion, and should

be correctly spaced. It is desirable to have an abundance of sun- 
light in the poultry house, but too much glass area is expensive and 
unsatisfactory because it makes the house hot in summer and cold 
in the winter time. To overcome this muslin curtains should be 
used to cover some of the openings. Usually the amount of glass 
surface should be about 1 square foot per bird provided muslin 
curtains are also used. The area for the latter should be about

  2 square feet per bird, depending, as does also the glass area, upon 
the size, location, and style of the poultry house. 
Do not place openings where they are likely to produce a draft on 
the roosts, or where sunlight through them will fall upon the roosts, 
as this would tend to cause the birds to sun themselves idly on the 
roosts. °  
-P-A-G-E-148
    138 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
7. Roof. By the pitch of a roof is meant the rise divided by the span. 
(See Fig. 197.) If the roof has less than % pitch, shingles will not 
prove satisfactory. Prepared roofing or tar-paper is better. 
Fasten the same with roofing tacks and make the joints water- 
proof with asphalt or with roofing cement. Fig. 195 illustrates 
various types of roofs that are used for poultry houses.

8. Fixtures. 
a. Roosts. Roosts should be about 2’” in diameter. Strips of

wise. In either case the surface should be smooth and the 
corners should be rounded off about 1’. 
Place the roosts so that they are level and firm. They should 
be 14” from the back wall, 12” apart, and from 3’ to 5’ from the

floor. They should not be closer than 14” from the ceiling. 
Allow from 8” to 14” of roost per bird. 
b. Broody coop. A broody coop should be provided in the poultry 
house. It may be located near the back or on the side, wherever 
it is least in the way. It can be made out of 1” X 2” slats or out 
of netting with a bottom of wooden slats. A coop 2’ wide by 3’ 
deep is satisfactory. It should be hung or placed off the ground 
so as to permit the air to circulate under the hen. This breaks up 
broodiness. 
c. Feed hoppers. Various forms of feed hoppers are shown in this 
book. Scratch feed such as grain should be strewn among litter 
such as straw or leaves in order to make the hens exercise to 
get it. 
d. Drinking fountains. Their design depends to quite an extent 
upon the size and age of the birds. Young chicks may drown in 
a deep drinking vessel. The vessel should be arranged so that 
the water cannot easily be spilled or polluted. 
e. Nests. Nests should usually be from 10” to 12” wide, 12’ deep 
and 10” or 12” high. It is not well to make nests too large as 
two hens may try to crowd into a single nest at the same time. 
Hens prefer nests that are darkened. 
f. Muslin curtains. A light grade of unbleached muslin is best. 
The frames can be made out of 1” X 2” or 1’ X 3” material 
depending upon the size of the curtain. Hinge the curtains
-P-A-G-E-151
  
RELATING TO POULTRY HUSBANDRY 142 
from the top and draw them up and down with a piece of clothes- 
line running over a pulley. 
The method of fastening the corners of curtain frames is the 
same as that illustrated for window screens, Fig. 206. It is 
better to make two or more separate curtains than a single 
curtain that is much larger than 4’ X 5’ as the frames are likely 
to get racked or broken if they are too large. 
g. Doors. Outside doors should open outward. If interior doors 
are used, hang them 12” or 14’’ from the floor so that they will 
clear straw or other litter.

-P-A-G-E-152
142 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
A standard-sized door is 2’ 6” x 6’ 8’. The door of the 
poultry house does not always need to be that large. Some- 
times the door may want to be wider so that a wheelbarrow or 
other objects can pass through it. 
If the door is to be home-made, place the cross-strips so that the 
hinges will catch it. The top hinge should be so placed that 
there are 5’ or 6” from the top of the door to the top of the hinge. 
The upper edge of the lower hinge should be about 10 inches 
from the bottom of the door. 
The Shed-Roof, Open Type, of Laying House 
1. Description. By open type is meant a house having a relatively 
large opening which is closed only when necessary by means of 
muslin curtains or glass. This type of house is very popular among 
poultrymen in the North Atlantic States as well as elsewhere. 
Fig. 79 shows such a house. The working drawings and specifica- 
tions relating to this poultry house are adapted from Bulletin 
325, entitled ‘Poultry Buildings,” issued by H. R. Lewis, Pro- 
fessor of Poultry Husbandry at the New Jersey Agricultural Ex- 
periment Station. : 
The house is planned for the average farm flock. The house is 
12’ wide, 14’ deep, and has a capacity of from forty to fifty birds.

ment of the straw-filled attic and the distance above the ceiling 
joists or collar-beams. The foundation is of concrete, and the floor 
is made of well-tamped clay over a bed of cinders. Where cinders 
cannot be obtained stone should be substituted. 
The capacity of the house is from 120 to 175 hens. The cost on 
the basis of pre-war prices is about $120.

CHAPTER VII 
RELATING TO FIELD CROPS 
Tue projects given in this chapter are such as are used in connection with 
growing or harvesting the common field crops. Other projects related 
to this as well as to other phases of agriculture, as, for example, the con- 
struction or repair of fences, gates, wagon boxes, wagon jacks, and drag 
sleds, are found in the chapter dealing with “general” projects. 
Seed Potato Tray 
1. Purpose. A convenient and very satisfactory way to store seed 
potatoes is in trays. (See Fig. 85.) This tray is of convenient 
size for handling and is made in such a way as to insure good ventila- 
tion. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Cypress and cedar are especially good for this purpose, 
but other woods may be used.

nailed securely. 
b. Lumber }4’’ thick may be substituted for the 1%«’’ material used 
in the ends and sides. Crating material can serve the purpose. 
Potato Crate 
1. Purpose. Potato crates offer several advantages. They may be 
used to advantage as lug or field boxes and later as storage crates. 
They are made of box or crating material and will hold one bushel.

Fig. 85. Step Potato Tray, AND Potato CraTE 
Such fencing material, having wires 4’ apart vertically and 2” apart 
horizontally, is recommended. The method of cutting such fencing 
is shown in Fig. 86. The fencing wire may be suspended from raft- 
ers so that mice and rats cannot get at the corn. The cost of the wire 
is very nominal, and the racks may be used for a number of years. 
B. Mouse-proof seed corn crate. 
1. Purpose. Seed corn may also be stored to advantage in a simple 
crate such as shown in Fig. 87. This may be made in any desired 
size.

3. Directions. 
a. Saw kerfs 6’’ deep are to be cut into all the slats for the vertical 
wires. This can be done to best advantage in a miter box. 
b. Saw off one slat so that the wires will come 234’” apart except at 
the middle, where allowance is made for the upright post. 
ce. With this slat as a pattern, mark the others, lay six or a dozen: of 
them side by side, and square the lines across with a framing 
square. They are then ready to cut in the miter box. A home- 
made box is good enough for the purpose. (See Index.) 
d. The slats are kept from sagging by fastening the vertical wires 
first to the '%e"’ X 3%” boards at the top of the rack, and then by 
occasionally driving staples into the lower slats and over the 
wires in such a way that the weight is carried from the top 
boards of the rack. 
e. The slats are either screwed or nailed to the upright posts so as to 
leave 2’’ spaces between them. This makes spaces 2’” square \ for the corn. 
f. Slats and wires are fastened on the front and back of the rack as 
shown in Fig. 89. 
Plank Drag 
1. Purpose. <A plank drag such as shown in Fig. 90 is extensively 
used by farmers and gardeners in preparing seed beds, and for 
leveling and compacting soil when necessary.

and yet the cutting is “hand” cutting as distinguished from the 
less desirable ‘‘machine” cutting. 
2. Principles involved. Proper selection and cutting of the seed mean 
increased production. Hand cutting is therefore to be preferred to 
machine cutting. Since the knife is held firmly in place, the opera-

  tor can use both hands to draw the seed across the knife so that 
each piece will have the proper size and number of eyes. 
In order to prevent the spread of Fusarium wilt and other diseases 
affecting potatoes, the knife is disinfected occasionally, and always 
after cutting a potato with dark spots or streaks in the flesh. A 
good disinfectant is made of two large teaspoonsful of formalin to 
one pint of water. This is applied to the knife with a rag or sponge.

  CHAPTER VIII 
RELATING TO HORTICULTURE 
Horticuiturs is carried on in all sections of the United States. In some 
States, it is carried on as a highly developed enterprise. Too frequently 
it does not receive the attention necessary to insure success. A more 
general culture of fruits in the home gardens, and in orchards, coupled 
with better methods and care, will amply repay effort expended in terms 
of pleasure and health, and will prove profitable from an economic 
standpoint as well. The projects offered in this chapter are such as will 
assist the farmer and fruit-grower in caring for berries and fruit trees. 
Planting orchards. Two systems of planting orchards are in common 
use, the “square” system, and the “diagonal” or equilateral triangle 
method. - In planting large orchards, the latter method will allow about 
15 per cent more trees to the acre than the square method of planting. 
The following distances are considered satisfactory in many localities. 
Sometimes special conditions, as lack of moisture, excessive sunlight, or 
special methods of cultivation or harvesting, make variations from these 
distances desirable.

The Planting Board 
1. Purpose. The planting board is a simple device that is of assistance 
in placing shrubs or trees in a given exact position. In laying out 
orchards, for example, stakes are usually driven where the trees are 
to go. When the hole is to be dug, the planting board is placed so 
that the notch fits around the stake representing the tree. Two 
other stakes are placed at the ends of the board (Number 2). The 
board is then removed, the central stake is withdrawn, and the hole 
is dug. When the tree is to be planted, the board is again placed in 
position over the end guide stakes and the tree takes the place of the 
central peg as shown in Fig. 96.

Orchard Ladder 
1. Purpose. Another type of orchard ladder that combines many 
desirable characteristics is shown in Fig. 105. A ladder having but 
one leg on the swinging portion can be placed in positions where 
certain other ladders cannot be placed. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Should be of the best quality, light and strong; as, for 
example, Douglas fir, ash, or yellow pine.

2 doz. 3d. common wire nails. 
1 doz. 1%’ No. 8 flat head bright screws. 
3. Directions. 
a. Find the exact length and cut the proper bevels on the rigid legs 
by using the framing square as shown at “E.”’ This also gives 
the bevels for the dado cuts in the rigid legs. 
b. In marking off the rigid legs, one may be marked off with a 
square, and the other then brought alongside so that the marks 
can be scribed across, either with a bevel square or with a framing 
square. 
c. The true lengths of all steps except the top one may be obtained 
by the method shown at “F.” The pieces are first cut at lengths 
a little longer than needed, or short ends are utilized. They are 
then placed side by side. A distance equal to the length of the 
smallest step is laid off on one end piece equidistant from a 
center line, and a distance equal to that of the longest step is laid 
off on the piece farthest from the first in the same manner. A 
straight edge (a piece of straight lumber) is used to connect the 
points as shown. Each piece is then squared at its ends, and is 
cut true to length. Another method is to calculate the lengths 
of the steps. This is apt to lead to errors. 
d. The cross-piece ‘‘B”’ should be fastened securely to the swinging 
leg, and must be placed in its final position before the top steps of 
the ladder with its reénforcing brackets is put in place. The

brackets are fastened before the top step is nailed or screwed 
down. 
e. The ladder should be given several coats of boiled linseed oil, or 
good exterior paint.

Prop for Fruit Trees 
1. Purpose. Heavily laden fruit trees frequently need to have their 
branches supported in order to avoid their breaking. Several 
methods are employed. One is to drive screw eyes into branches 
on opposite sides of the tree, and connect these screw eyes (or eye- 
bolts if the branches are large) with heavy wire in such a way that 
one branch counterbalances the other. A second method is to use 
saplings having crotches at the ends. A third method is to use a 
prop made of sawed lumber, with a burlap or rag cushion to prevent 
injury to the limb. arse

Material required. Any available kind of lumber may be used. 
Smooth lumber free from bark is to be preferred. ; 
Directions. The props should usually vary in length. Fold burlap 
or rags into a smooth cushion and fasten with a shingle nail. Drive 
the nail well in. 
At the end of the season and in the early summer dip the burlap- 
covered ends into boiling hot water or into standard arsenate of 
lead spray to kill any codling moth or other insects that may be 
harbored there. Store props in neat piles when not in use. 
Hod for Wrapping Paper 
. Purpose. Apples, pears, and oranges are usually wrapped in paper 
when packed in boxes. The hod shown in Fig. 106 is one that is 
hooked on to the side of the box into which the fruit is pached and 
provides a handy container for the wrapping paper.

b. Adapt size of hod to size of paper to be used. 
Jig for making Apple Boxes 
. Purpose. Apple boxes are usually purchased in “knock-down” 
condition by fruit-growers. An easy way of “nailing up”’ the boxes 
is by using a simple home-made jig as shown in Fig. 107. This 
may be made in any convenient length so that one or more boxes 
can be made at the same time.

where the cleats are to be nailed. The spacing of the cleats 
depends on the size of the boxes to be made. 
. The space between each pair of cleats should be such that the 
end boards of the box to be made will fit in snugly without 
binding. 
. The cleats should be slightly shorter than the width of the end 
boards of the boxes to be nailed. This permits the box to rest 
directly on the plank when the bottom boards are nailed on. 
. A place for the box nails to be used can be made by fastening a 
small cigar box or similar object to the plank at the left end.

a. Set the posts 2’ into the ground, nail on the cross arms, and saw 
off the top of the post at the right distance from the ground. If 
care is taken to dig the hole exactly the right depth, it will not be 
necessary to saw the post for length after it is up. 
b. The trellis work should be nailed to the cross arms edgewise as 
shown, as they will not sag so much that way. 
ce. It will be well to place “spacers’’ between the four top trellis 
bars at distances of three or four feet. Use '%o’’ X 2%!’ X 11%6”

Grape Arbor 
1. Purpose. Grape arbors serve a useful as well as ornamental pur- 
pose. The one shown herewith is simple and substantial. The main 
branches may be tied or wired to the arbor. Posts are set about 
6 feet apart between rows, and 6 to 8 feet within the rows.

CHAPTER IX 
RELATING TO SWINE HUSBANDRY 
Iv is usually worth while to keep a limited number of hogs on the farm. 
Prices of pork rise and fall; money is made and lost in producing it, 
depending upon several variable factors, but the hog still retains his 
nickname, “the mortgage lifter.” This is due in part to the fact that he 
is a user of by-products, such as small potatoes, skim milk, buttermilk, 
whey, and kitchen refuse. 
In order to make the production of market hogs or of pure-bred stock a 
profitable business enterprise, it is desirable to take advantage of labor- 
saving devices, and conveniences such as are presented in this chapter. 
Hog Trough and Chute 
1. Purpose. The trough and chute illustrated in Fig. 115 are designed 
so that kitchen refuse and other by-products can be fed to the pigs 
or hogs from the “opposite” side of the fence. In this way there 
is no inconvenience from hungry hogs trying to get close to the 
source of their supply of food. 
The trough may be varied in length to suit the number of hogs. 
A trough 3’ long is large enough for one hog. Add at least one 
additional foot for each hog above that number.

b. Nail the joints every 4’ to 6”. 
c. The long end boards are necessary in order to keep the hogs 
from turning the trough over. Set the nails about 2” apart that 
go through the end pieces into the sides of the trough. 
Concrete Hog Trough 
1. Purpose. The hog trough shown in Fig. 116 is one that is per- 
manent, and more sanitary than a wooden trough. It has the dis- 
advantage of being heavy, and in this respect harder to clean than a 
wooden trough, but is well suited for a feeding floor or a hog house.

Concrete Feeding Floor 
1. Purpose. Concrete feeding floors have many advantages. Hogs 
and cattle fed on concrete floors do not waste food as is true in 
muddy barnyards. The animals are kept in a more sanitary condi- 
tion. Another saving is effected by having a drainage gutter in 
connection with the feeding floor which runs directly to a concrete 
manure pit. In this way the loss which ordinarily results in the 
average barnyard from the leaching of manure is prevented. 
2. Location. The feeding floor may well be located on the protected 
side (opposite to side from which severe winter storms come) of a SECTION Ar 
4-8" Fig.

should have sufficient fall to ensure good drainage. _A slope of %’” 
per foot is sufficient.

Photograph, courtesy of the Portland Cement Association. 3. Size and shape of feeding 
floor. Feeding floors may 
be built in any desired 
shape, but the square 
floors are preferred by 
most farmers. 
A projecting curb and 
gutter, as shown in Fig. 
120, is desirable. The 
curb keeps hogs from 
pushing their food into 
the mud. Each 10 lineal 
feet of curb requires 24 
sacks of cement, 4% cu- 
bic feet of sand, and 6% 
cubic feet of stone or peb- 
bles. 
4. Directions. 
a. Concrete feeding floors 
are not difficult to 
build. The construc- 
tion is similar to a se- 
ries of concrete side- 
walks. Fig. 120 shows 
how the forms are 
placed so that alter- 
nate squares or rec- 
tangles are laid. 
b. General directions 
about mixing concrete 
are given in Chapter 
Ill. By referring to 
Fig. 120 it will be seen 
that the forms are laid 
in place, and that each 
section is then struck 
off with a straight edge 
which is shoved in a 
zigzag fashion across 
the forms. 
c. The floor should be 
laid off into squares as shown in Fig. 120. These may be as
-P-A-G-E-201
  RELATING TO SWINE HUSBANDRY IQI 
large as 10’ X 10’, and the joints should extend all the way through 
the concrete. This allows for expansion. The joints are filled 
with sand or asphalt. Strips of felt paper are also used. 
d. Finish the top of the floor with a wooden float (see Fig. 187) 
instead of using a steel trowel. The wooden float gives a rougher 
finish which prevents animals from slipping on the concrete. 
e. Several hours after the concrete has been laid, the surface should 
be protected with straw or litter to prevent the sun from drying 
it out too quickly. The surface should be kept moist by sprink- ” 
ling it occasionally. Animals and wagons should be kept off the 
floor for three weeks. 
The following table, taken from Concrete on the Farm, published 
by the Portland Cement Association, gives the size of the floor 
required for various numbers of hogs, and the amount of material ' 
required for a 1: 2: 3 mixture, and a slab 4” thick.

Portable ‘‘ A’’-Shaped Hog House 
. Purpose. The ‘‘A’’-shaped house is one that is easy to build, and 
relatively cheap. It is especially good where it can be moved from 
place to place so as to keep the surroundings clean, and give pigs 
or hogs free range. This type of house has proved very satisfactory, 
and is endorsed by practical swine raisers. 
The house shown in Fig. 122 has double doors, each cut into two 
parts. This makes the house easy to clean and the lower portions 
of the doors may be closed so as to facilitate the proper handling of 
sows and pigs. The house is so placed that prevailing storms meet 
the house on the closed side. 
. Material required.

The Iowa Gable-Roof House ! 
1. Purpose. This hog house is of the movable type. It has been 
successfully used by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station 
for many years. It is substantial, attractive, and well designed. 
Fig. 127 shows the house as it is used for summer service, and Fig. 
128 gives a rear view showing the ventilator that is used at times. 
The general construction can be seen from these views and from the 
drawings. 
2. Construction details. 
a. Runners should be of fir, cypress, chestnut, or other durable 
wood.

b. Two-inch flooring is better than flooring 1” thick. The flooring 
can be omitted if desired. 
¢. Ship-lap makes a satisfactory covering for the house. 
d. The entrance door may be placed in the gable end or near one 
corner at the side, the latter position being preferable, as it 
protects the swine more from drafts. The door may have to be 
made 6” higher than specified. 
e. The roof doors should have an east exposure if the entrance door 
is on the south end. When the entrance door is in the east 
corner of the south side wall, the roof doors should be on the same 
           side.

d. Prepared roofing may be put on the roof if desired. 
Smokehouse 
1. Type of structure. The construction of smokehouses varies greatly. 
Persons who have only small quantities of meat to cure may hang 
it in a barrel into which smoke is introduced by a stovepipe from a 
fire built near by. 
On farms where considerable meat is cured, it pays to build a 
. permanent building such as shown in Fig. 135. 
2. Essential features. A good smokehouse should be fireproof and 
vermin and insect proof. It should be high enough so that the meat 
may be hung 6’ or 8’ above the fire.

  CHAPTER X 
RELATING TO CATTLE HUSBANDRY 
Many farmers find it profitable to raise a certain number of beef cattle, 
or to keep such cattle at certain seasons of the year. Thousands of 
young beef cattle are taken from the ranges of the United States and 
Canada, and are sold to farmers in more densely settled sections who buy 
them for ‘winter feeders.” They dispose of by-products, such as straw 
and corn fodder, by feeding them, and utilize their time more fully during 
the winter months. Such a practice also helps to maintain soil fertility. 
The projects given herewith are widely used in cattle husbandry. 
Feed Trough for Cattle 
1. Purpose. The feed trough shown in Fig. 136 is built for feeding 
corn or other concentrates to cattle. The trough is built in a sub- 
stantial manner, as cattle are inclined to push or crowd against it: 
The division boards running lengthwise of the center are a desirable 
feature. The troughis portable so that its location can be changed 
as desired. 
2. Material required.

3. Directions. 
a. Select lumber with vertical or comb grain for the trough, as such 
lumber will not splinter readily, and wears better than flat or 
slash grained lumber. 
b. Nail all parts securely. 
Bracing may be used 
lengthwise as well as 
crosswise. 
ce. Use surfaced lumber 
throughout.   
Stock-Loading Chute 
1. Purpose. Many farmers 
have occasion to load and 
unload stock ranging in 
size from young pigs and 
lambs to mature cattle 
into wagons, trucks, or 
cattle cars. The stock- 
loading chute shown in   
  Fig. 138. Loaptna CuuTe ror Hogs, SHEEP, Fig. 139 serves as a gen-

   CHAPTER XI 
RELATING TO SHEEP HUSBANDRY 
Suesp raising, like other branches of animal: husbandry, is getting to 
be more and more of a science. A number of labor-saving devices and 
profit-producing conveniences for sheep husbandry are herewith given. 
Every one of them has been tested, and has the approval of experienced 
shepherds. 
Portable Feed Trough for Lambs 
1. Purpose. The portable feed trough shown in Fig. 142 is one that 
may be used for young lambs. The trough is placed in a creep 
where it is not accessible to the older stock. Various grain rations 
may thus be used to supplement ewe’s milk and pasture. 
The special features of this trough are: 
a. Simple, light construction. 
b. Wide base to prevent upsetting. 
ce. Top rail to prevent animals getting into trough. 
d. Hinged side to make cleaning easy. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Sound, smooth lumber, preferably of a decay-resisting 
variety, such as cypress.

b. Hardware. 
3 dozen 8d. common wire nails. 
1 dozen 8d. finishing nails. 
1 dozen 6d. finishing nails. 
2 or 3 narrow butt hinges 3” long with screws. 
2 galvanized hooks and screw eyes. 
. Directions. The project involves no, difficult operation. Care 
should be taken to make sure that the notch cut in the top of each 
end is not made wider than the top rail. Use a saw and chisel to 
make the notches, and fasten the top rail in place with finishing 
nails or screws. 
Creep for Lambs and Pigs 
. Purpose. A creep is an enclosure or a part of a fence or partition 
that has openings through which young stock such as lambs or pigs 
can readily go, but which excludes the older and larger animals of 
the same breed. By the use of a creep, young stock may be fed 
special rations not accessible to the mature animals. Creeps may 
be built in portable as well as stationary form.

b. Hardware. 5 dozen 8d. common wire nails. 
. Directions. Nail the various parts together securely. Clinch all 
nails well that protrude, and round off corners slightly against 
which the young animals are likely to rub in going through the 
openings. 
Portable Feed Trough for Sheep 
. Purpose. The portable trough shown in Fig. 145 is used in feeding 
roots and grain rations to sheep. It is similar in design to the one 
shown for lambs, and is proportionately larger. It is very easy to 
clean because one side is hinged.

later that is built fast to 
the sides of the sheep 
barn. 
Special features of this 
rack are the wide boards 
at the top of the rack, 
which keep chaff from get- 
ting into the fleeces, and 
the hinged sides of the 
grain troughs which facil- 
itate cleaning.

Stationary Hay and Grain Rack 
1. Purpose. The stationary hay and grain rack shown in Fig. 151 
may be built directly against the walls of the barn or against feed- 
pen partitions. It thus saves considerable floor space. The size of 
the floor and other considerations will govern the location and the 
length of such feed racks. 
Instead of the hinged side of the feed trough some persons prefer 
to have this side nailed fast and to use separate feed trays that are 
placed into the trough.

Draining Pen 
1. Purpose. Since ticks and other skin parasites annoy and retard the 
growth of lambs and sheep, it is desirable to dip them in standard 
solutions that will rid the animals of the pests. For this purpose 
various forms of dipping troughs are used, some being built out of 
concrete. For the small flock it is cheaper to buy a sheet-metal 
dipping vat such as is shown in Fig. 152, than it is to build a per- 
manent concrete vat. Draining pens are a necessary accessory to a 
    
Fic. 156. Portasie Feepine Rack ror SHEEP

dipping vat. The draining pen shown herewith is designed to hold 
about four sheep at one time. The purpose of the draining pen is to 
save the dipping solution by making it flow back into the vat. 
No matter what solution is used it is advisable to shade the drain- 
ing pen during hot weather. A shorn sheep will readily sunburn if 
wet with pure water and allowed to stand in the hot sun. Therefore, 
precaution needs to be taken with solutions containing insect 
destroying ingredients. Sheep likewise should not be allowed to go 
in the rain immediately after being dipped as heavy rains would 
wash the dip out of the fleece before it has dried and become set.

2. Directions. 
a. Give the floor a pitch of about 6” in 7’. 
b. The flooring should be laid tight, and should be free of knots. 
It may be nailed to cleats and only tacked to the 2” X 4” cross- 
ties, thus making it possible to take it up in one section for 
storage. 
c. One man standing at the low point of the pen where it meets the 
dipping vat, can control both ends of the pen by using a pole 
which is fastened to the end gate in such a way that pulling on it 
closes, and pushing opens the end gate. 
d. The pickets or slats on the end gate may be fastened on with 6d. 
nails. The floor likewise can be nailed with 6d. common wire 
nails. 
e. A run-way of varying length may need to be built from the high 
end of the draining pen to the ground.

trees, and wagon racks. The latter are shown elsewhere in this book. 
Harness Hooks 
1. Purpose. Simple and substantial hooks for harness may be made 
as shown in Fig. 157. The length of the plank into which the pegs 
or hooks are driven may be varied to suit given requirements, as 
may also the distance between hooks. The purpose of the drawing 
is to bring out the principle of construction. Its adaptation to local 
requirements is not attempted by the author. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Soft wood, such as yellow pine or fir, for the plank, and 
hard wood, such as oak or maple, for the pegs. 
No. or Preces DIMENSIONS PURPOSE 
+ 234" KX 9%" X Plank 
3 Be XK Dg! Ke 15" Large hooks 
2: %" diameter X 10” Small hooks 
b. Glue. A small quantity of liquid glue. 
3. Directions. 
a. The small pegs are intended for the bridle or accessories; the 
remainder of the harness may be hung on the large pegs. 
b. A convenient way to make the smaller pegs is by using pieces of 
an old broom, hoe, or pitchfork handle. Saw a kerf into one 
end, make a white pine wedge and drive it into place after a little 
glue has been applied. 
ce. If the peg is to be driven into a timber, the wedge is placed in the 
kerf before the peg is driven in. It will tighten up as it comes in 
contact with the bottom of the hole. 
d. The large pegs can be split out of larger sticks, and may be shaped 
to suit. They are fastened the same way as the smaller ones. 
e. Select pegs with straight grain, and place them so that the grain 
is vertical, or nearly so. 
Harness Hook 
1. Purpose. Another type of harness hook is shown in Fig. 158. 
This hook likewise is substantial and can be adapted to various 
positions and kinds of lumber available. It may, for example, be 
built directly on posts or studdings that stand in the barn.

spreading the sides is that when ice forms it will push upward in- 
stead of outward, and thereby save the trough from breaking. 
The trough should have a slope lengthwise of about 4” per foot of 
length, so that it will drain readily through the hole provided for the 
purpose. 
. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Cypress, western red cedar, red wood, chestnut oak, 
and other woods may be used to advantage.

d. It is well to provide an overflow either in the form of a hole with 
a small piece of pipe screwed into it, or in the form of a standard 
waste pipe connection. 
Manger and Stall for Horse Stable 
. Purpose. Horses are usually kept in stables having some form of 
partition and a manger at one end. The one shown in Fig. 160 
shows proper proportions and typical construction. 
. General proportions. 
a. Length. Horse stalls of the type shown should be about 10’ long 
from the back of the manger (as the horse faces it) to the end of 
the partition. 
b. Width. From 5’ to 6’ center to center of partitions gives space 
enough. 
c. Pitch of floor. The floor should have a fall of %’’ per foot of

d. Manger. The bottom of the manger should be from 12’ to 16” 
above the floor. It is well.to have the bottom of the manger 
built of slats 4” or 1” apart so that dust, dirt, and disease germs 
do not accumulate. 
Place a feed box at one end of the manger, and make it re-  
-P-A-G-E-244
234 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
movable. The manger should be 3’ 6’ high and 24” wide at the 
top. It is best to board up the manger so that the horse cannot 
get his feet caught under the manger. 
e. Partitions. These vary from a simple swinging beam supported 
from the ceiling to ‘‘solid”’ partitions. The nature of the parti- 
tions desired will depend upon the characteristics of the horses to 
be kept there. For horses that are likely to rear up and kick the 
partition should be such as will permit the horse to slide off in case 
he gets a leg over the partition. For this reason it is best to have 
the end post of the partition no higher than the planking. Slats 
may be run from the planking to the ceiling so that horses cannot 
possibly get astride a partition. 
f. Box stalls. Should be 10’ X 12’ or larger. They should not be 
boarded up solid. Stallions, brood-mares, or other animals 
should not be imprisoned in a box stall that resembles a dungeon, 
but should be quartered where they can see other animals. 
3. Material required. 
a. Lumber. The stall shown in Fig. 160 may be built of Georgia 
pine, Douglas fir, or other lumber.

4. Directions. 
a. Note the slatted bottom in the manger, and the provision in feed 
alley for gathering up particles that drop through the manger. 
b. Use surfaced lumber throughout, and round off all corners 
where horses are likely to rub. 
c. A piece of band iron may be nailed along the top of the manger 
to keep it from being chewed. 
d. Allow at least 4 feet behind the stalls for a passageway. 
e. If a gutter is built it should be shallow. It is not essential.
-P-A-G-E-245
  RELATING TO HORSE HUSBANDRY 235 
f. A dirt floor is commonly used in horse barns, though a plank 
floor or a concrete floor is usually preferred. 
g. Horses do not need as much protection against cold weather as do 
dairy cows, so horse barns are frequently built of only one thick- 
ness of lumber.

CHAPTER XIII 
RELATING TO DAIRY HUSBANDRY . 
Ir has been said that ‘‘the dairy cow is the foster-mother of the human 
race.” The projects given in this chapter have been selected with a 
view toward being of service to dairymen and farmers in general who 
keep dairy stock. Space is given, among other things, to stanchion and 
feed rack construction because improvements of this kind can often be

in new farm structures. 
Butter Paddle 
1. Purpose. A simple and yet very useful article on almost all farms 
is a butter paddle, such as is used in working and handling butter. 
Various sizes and styles are in common use. The one shown here- 
with is typical, and satisfactory. : 
2. Material required. : 
a. Lumber. Non-resinous wood should be used, such as maple, 
beech, or tideland spruce.

8. Directions. 
a. Lay out the pattern on the piece of wood. 
b. Saw close to the lines, but leave them visible. 
ce. Taper the paddle to the required thickness, by first roughing off 
the piece with a draw-knife, chisel, or spoke-shave followed by a 
smooth-plane or jointer. 
d. No oil or paint should be applied. 
. Milking Stool.(No. 1) 
1. Purpose. The stool shown herewith is a favorite. It is light, easy 
to keep clean, and difficult to upset. At the same time it is small 
enough so that the milk pail can easily be withdrawn in case the 
cow starts to kick. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Hard wood, such as maple or oak, is best. The legs 
may be made of old broom or hoe handles.

ce. Paint. A small amount of white paint. 
3. Directions. 
a. While the top may be made of two separate boards, one placed 
crosswise of the other, and screwed together in a secure manner, 
the top may also be made of one piece of plank 1%” thick. 
b. The legs may be made of broom handles, of squared stock, or of 
pieces split out of a larger block in which case they may be worked 
into six-sided shapes, with the use of a draw-knife and plane. 
c. Note that each leg has a saw-kerf at its top for the wedge which 
is inserted before the leg is driven into place. 
d. Use a little glue on the legs where they fit into the top.

Calf Stanchions 
. Purpose. Calf stanchions such as shown in Figs. 165 and 166 
provide a cheap and effective way for confining calves while they 
are being fed. After their meals they are released and given the 
freedom of their pasture or yard.

  2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Moderate-priced lumber will serve the purpose. It 
should be planed. The amount of the material required for a set 
of four stanchions is as follows.

3. Directions. 
a. The construction should be adapted to the place where stan- 
chions are to be placed, and will necessarily vary somewhat 
depending upon the number to be built. They may be put up in 
sections in school shops to be assembled on the home farms. 
b. The swinging parts are pivoted on 4” bolts. Nails might be used 
but are not as permanent. 
ce. All lumber should be surfaced. 
d. If the stanchions are to be built in places having no floor, it will 
be advisable to place cleats under the trough. 
Cow Stanchions and Manger 
1. Purpose. Cows are usually arranged in two rows in the barn as 
this is a labor-saving arrangement. The animals may be faced 
toward a central feed alley, or may face outward. In either case 
some form of stanchion which gives the cows as much freedom of 
movement as is consistent with other requirements is desirable. 
The stanchions shown in Fig. 167 are of a type that farmers can 
easily make, and they are not expensive.

Milk Record Case 
1. Purpose. The milk record case shown in Fig. 169 has been de- 
signed by J. D. McVean, Director of Vocational Agriculture, 
Edinboro, Pennsylvania. Its purpose is to provide a convenient 
means of keeping milk records clean, and in a convenient place. 
2. Method of using the case. 
a. The milk record is attached with thumb tacks to a sliding board 
which is adjustable for height by means of wing-nuts at the sides 
of the case. A piece of window pane protects the record as it 
moves upward.

b. The lower part of the front of the case is protected with a board 
which may be hinged in position, or may be held by screws. The 
latter method is simpler, but more time is required when the 
records are placed in the case. 
. The case may be hung on the wall at a convenient height, by 
means of padlock eyes, or screw-eyes attached near the top of the 
case. ©

c. Glass. 
1 piece of double strength window glass, 10%’ X 174’’. 
. Directions. 
a. The cross-section shown in Fig. 169 shows how much space should 
be allowed to assure freedom of movement for the slide. 
b. The slots in the sides of the case should be %’’ wider than the 
diameter of the bolts with wing-nut attached that work in these 
slots. 
ce. Bore %”’ holes from the back of the slide, and %’’ deep as indicated 
at ““X.” Next bore 4’ holes from the edges of the slide directly 
into the first holes and insert bolts. 
d. Cut off the heads of the bolts, and thread ends for wing-nut. 
Insert other end into \’’ holes, put nut in the 4%” X %’” holes and 
turn the bolts into the nuts. 
e. Fasten the glass between stops as shown in the cross-section. 
Fasten stops with %’’ wire brads. 
f. Bevel the board covering lower half of the front of the case at the 
top edge at an angle of about 30 degrees. This makes it easier 
to record on the sheet that is exposed at that point. 
Silage or Feed Cart 
. Purpose. The cart shown in Fig. 170 is such as can be built by 
farmers and by pupils studying agriculture. It is a great labor 
saver in the feeding process. The size will vary with the size of the 
herd to be fed. Various forms of wheels may also be adapted to 
such home-made carts. For example 2 large wheels may be used, 
something on the order of the wheels on push-carts, or the cart can 
be placed on four wheels. The drawing shows 2 wheels and 2 
swivel caster wheels. This permits the cart to be turned around 
easily. 
. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Old crating material may be used.’ Light lumber such

b. The top or main surface with its two adjacent sides should be 
water-tight and smooth. To avoid nail holes as much as possible 
in these surfaces use screws for the cross-cleats. Nails driven 
through the top into the legs should be set and the holes 
should be puttied. 
c. Paint is to be used only on such parts of the butter worker as do 
not come in direct contact with the butter. The lever is not to 
be painted or finished in any way with oils or varnish. 
Water Tank 
Pure cold water is appreciated by animals quite as much as by human 
beings. An inexpensive and yet very effective protection for a water 
trough used in connection with dairy husbandry is shown in Fig. 173. 
Milk Cooling Vat 
Another very desirable project, likewise of concrete, and for use in 
connection with the dairy business is a milk cooling tank such as is shown 
in Fig. 174. The construction is practically the same as is required for a 
concrete watering trough. The dimensions, of course, should be worked 
out in conformity with specific local needs. See the Index for directions 
concerning the concrete work.

‘CHAPTER XIV 
RELATING TO GENERAL FARM PROJECTS 
A NUMBER of appliances, pieces of equipment, and certain farm structures 
are general in nature in the sense that they are used in connection with 
more than one phase of agriculture such as dairy husbandry and field 
crop production. A rigid classification has not been attempted as local 
requirement and conditions vary. Projects presented in this chapter 
may well be used to supplement those in other chapters. For example, 
farm gate construction may be taught in connection with field crops, 
animal husbandry, or dairy husbandry. 
Singletree 
1. Purpose. Singletrees vary somewhat in length, thickness and 
method of construction depending upon the use for which they are 
designed. Plow singletrees are 26’ and 30’ long while wagon 
singletrees are made in lengths of 30’, 36’, and 38”. 
2. Material required. Straight grained hickory should be used. A 
piece of hickory 134’’ X 2%’” X 36’ will serve the purpose. The iron 
fittings may be purchased, made, or can be taken from another 
singletree. 
8. Directions. 
a. Bring the singletree to the desired shape by the use of a drawing 
knife, spoke shave, and plane. 
b. Fit the steel parts such as ferrules or clips. 
ec. Finish with several coats of boiled linseed oil. 
Neckyoke 
1. Purpose. Ordinary wagon neckyokes for horges are made in 38’’ 
and 42” lengths. The rings and ferrules can be purchased more 
cheaply than they can be made by hand, hence they are not shown 
in Fig. 176. 
2. Material required. A piece of straight-grained hickory 1%’ x 3” 
X 38”, 
3. Directions. 
a. Work the piece to the desired shape as in the case of the single- 
tree. 
b. Fit the ferrules and plates. 
c. Finish with boiled linseed oil, or paint to match wagon. 
Doubletree 
1. Purpose. A doubletree set is made up of a doubletree and two 
singletrees. The doubletree serves as a beam to distribute the

pulling load between the two horses. Doubletrees are made in 
lengths of 36’, 40’, 42’, and 48”. They are sometimes bound 
with light band iron. 
Material required. The steel clevises and bearing plates used on 
doubletrees can be purchased for a nominal sum. The lumber 
required consists of a piece of straight-grained hickory 1%’ x 44” 
Xx 48”. 
. Directions. 
a. Bring the doubletree to proper dimensions by use of a saw and 
plane. 
b. Bore holes where indicated. 
c. Fit plates and clevises. 
_d. Finish with linseed oil, or paint. 
Three-Horse Evener 
. Purpose. Occasionally it is desired to drive three horses abreast. 
For this purpose a three-horse evener is used in connection with a 
doubletree and three singletrees. 
Material required. For the evener a piece of straight-grained 
hickory, 1%” x 5%” X 53)’ will serve the purpose. 
. Directions. 
a. Bring the evener to the desired shape with a saw and plane. 
b. Bore the end holes where shown. This distributes the pulling 
load in the ratio of 1 to 2. 
Wagon Jack 
. Purpose. A wagon jackis a labor-saving appliance used to raise up 
wagons and buggy axles for any purpose; as, for example, when 
they are to be greased, or when the wheels are to be soaked in hot 
linseed oil.

2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. The runners should be made of hard wood. The top 
be made of less durable wood. If hard wood runners cannot 
be secured readily it may be possible to shoe the runners either 
iron or with hard wood saplings that are split and worked 
out so as to make a half-round shoe.

usage. 
Farm Gate (No. 1) 
1. Purpose. Farm gates are usually made 14’ or 16’ between posts. 
The wider gate is better if wide farm machinery is to pass through 
it. Farm gates should be as light in weight as is consistent with 
rigidity. They should be so braced as to prevent sagging, and the 
latch should be of a kind that cattle and horses cannot open.

Directions. 
a. Use a framing square in assembling the gate. 
b. Bolts, though more expensive than nails, will be found more 
satisfactory than the latter. 
¢. Set the gate posts 2’ or more into the ground, and tamp them in 
well. 
d. By using a shoulder hook that runs all the way through the post 
for the top hinge it is possible to adjust the gate occasionally 
if it should sag. 
e. The lower shoulder hook is simply driven into the post after a 
hole slightly smaller than the hook has been bored.

3. Directions. 
. Assemble the ends and the partitions as units. 
. Make the back and the front. 
. Assemble the parts. 
. Nail the roof on. 
. Assemble the bottom, nailing the floor boards to the cleats but 
not to the sides or ends. 
f. In hanging the doors, strips of leather may be used for hinges, 
but steel hinges are best. 
g. Use a fairly large mesh wire for the bottom of the screen floor, 
so that grass will go through it when it is set on it. 
h. Let roofing paper lie exposed to the sun for several hours before 
nailing it in place. This tends to minimize buckling. Bend the 
roofing over the edges, and place tacks along the edges of the 
roof boards. 
i. A coat of paint will add to the attractiveness and durability of 
the hutch. .

Measuring Box 
1. Purpose. The measuring box shown in Fig. 186 is made to hold 4 
cubic feet of sand or gravel. It is a home-made device that is used 
in concrete work. The box has no bottom. It is placed on a mixing 
platform or on the ground and filled up. Then the box is lifted out 
of the way. 
2. Material required.

or tongued and grooved lumber if the box is to be used much. A 
sheet metal bottom is still better. 
b. Nail all parts well. 
Mixing Platform 
. Purpose. Mixing platforms are made in various sizes, and are used 
in mixing concrete. The platform keeps soil from being mixed with 
the concrete, and helps to retain the more liquid parts of the con- 
crete mixture.

b. The legs are best fastened to the frame with bolts. If nails have 
to be used, drill for them as for the bolts, and clinch the ends to 
keep them from drawing out easily. 
c. The wire netting should go above the bottom board, and should 
be tacked to it. 
Concrete Fence Posts 
i. Purpose. Concrete fence posts are permanent, if properly made. 
Their construction is not difficult. Farmers as well as large corpora- 
tions are using them in increasing numbers. On the basis of pre- 
war prices the material for a concrete fence post costs about 25 cents. 
2. Material required for the concrete. A mixture of 1 part of cement 
to 3 parts of sand is satisfactory. A quaky mixture, which is wet 
enough so that it does not need to be tamped, is used. 
The reénforcement that is used in posts should be four rods 
varying from 4’ to 3’ diameter for ordinary posts and four %e"’ rods

d. All lumber should be 
planed smooth, and 
should be given sev-

keep the lumber from 
warping and makes it 
easier to get a smooth 
surface on the fence 
posts. 
e. Chamfered corners are 
made on fence posts 
by fastening three- 
cornered strips to 
the sides or parti- 
tions as shown in Fig.

Forms for Concrete 
Foundations 
1. Purpose. Concrete foundations for farm structures are usually 
placed in position by means of forms. Typical construction is

RELATING TO GENERAL FARM PROJECTS 275 
shown in Fig. 192. This figure also shows that the earth may 
sometimes be used to take the place of a wooden form. This is 
particularly true of foundations built in trenches. 
2. Material required. Forms should be water-tight. Ship-lap is good 
for the purpose, common unmatched lumber is also used. 
8. Directions. 
a. It is impossible to give general directions that will apply in all 
eases. The fundamental principle involved is to build the forms 
water-tight, and so that they cannot bulge.

Dimensions given are exact, so that in buying fence, sufficient allowance should be made 
to cover fence taken up in wrapping around end and corner posts. 
For rectangular or oblong fields with square corners, twice the length of one short side 
added to twice the length of one long side, with addition for wrapping around posts, will 
give total approximate length of fence under conditions stated above. 
For square fields four times the length of one side, with at least three feet added for 
wrapping around each corner, end or gate post will give the approximate length of fence 
required if stretched properly.

  CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
Concrete Sidewalk 
. Purpose. Permanent sidewalks are most commonly built of con- 
crete. The various stages in sidewalk construction are well shown 
in Fig. 193. The work is essentially the same as building feeding 
floors of concrete which is described elsewhere in this book. 
. Material required. Use a1: 2:3 mixture as explained under ‘“Feed- 
ing Floors” for one course work. The slab should be 4’ thick. 
For two course construction use a 1:2:5 mixture for the first 
course and finish with a mixture of 1 part of cement to 2 parts of 
sand for the second coat. 
. Directions. 
a. In most soils where the ground freezes to any extent it is advis- 
able to place a sub-base of cinders, broken stone, or other porous 
material of that sort, under the concrete walk. The purpose of 
the sub-base is to assure good drainage, as water might other- 
wise accumulate under the walk with the result that the walk 
might be broken. A sub-base 12” thick is ample in most places. 
In some sections of the United States, particularly in sandy soils 
and in sections not visited by heavy frosts it is not necessary to 
use a sub-base. 
b. When sidewalks are built without a curb 2” X 4’ scantlings are 
used for forms. If a curb is to be built continuous with the walk 
and flush with its top an 8” or 10’ plank serves as a form on the 
gutter side and a 2” xX 4” on the opposite side. 
c. These forms should be staked down so that they cannot bulge, 
and so that the outer form is 1’’ lower than the inner one. This 
gives enough pitch outward to shed water properly. 
d. Provide for expansion joints by laying off rectangles or squares 
from 3’ to 6’ long. If the walk is to be a two course job put 
strips of tar or of felt paper after each block or rectangle when 
the first course is laid, and mark the location on the side forms so 
that the top coat may be cut through with a groover directly 
above the lower expansion joints. 
e. In case the sidewalk is to be one-course construction, expansion 
joints are also used. They are put in 20’ to 50’ apart by placing 
a greased board across the walk where the joint is to be. The 
concrete is poured against one side of the board only. The 
board is withdrawn when the next block is poured, several thick- 
nesses of felt paper or other compressible material being placed 
where the board was before the adjoining block is laid. Joints 
are cut with a groover at distances not over six feet apart, as in 
two-course construction. A straight edge is used for a guide in 
this operation. 
f. To level up the top surface use a straight edge as shown in Fig.

zigzag fashion over the top edges of the forms. 
g. The surface is finished with a steel trowel and sand floated with 
a wooden float as shown in Fig. 187, if a somewhat rough finish 
is desired.

h. The walk should be protected against extreme temperatures 
while “curing.” In the summer cover the top with paper, straw, 
or soil, and keep it damp. Do not use the walk heavily for three 
weeks. 
i. Persons with relatively little experience in sidewalk construction 
are likely to get best results by using the one-course type of 
construction. The amount of material required is shown in

Roof Framing 
Roof types. A number of types of roofs that are used on farm struc- 
tures are shown in Fig. 195. If the principles governing the laying out of 
common rafters is understood it will be possible to frame any of these 
roof types, as they involve only modifications of common rafter construc- 
tion. 
Framing common rafters. If the rise and the span of a building is 
known it is possible to figure out the length of the common rafters re- 
quired by arithmetic. This, however, is not the way it is done in actual 
practice. The first thing to determine is the pitch. This is the ratio of 
the rise to the span (Fig. 197), and is usually “4, 4, or %. Fig. 196 shows 
that a rise of 6” in 12” is called a % pitch, and a rise of 12’ in 12’ is 
called a “‘half-pitch.” This is true because the pitch is equal to the rise 
divided by the span. 
The half-span is called the ‘‘run.” In laying off rafters the constant of 
run is taken as 12”, and on the tongue of the square. The rise per foot of 
run is taken along the blade, as in Fig. 197. 
One practical way to get the length of a common rafter is to apply 
the square along the edge of a rafter as many times as there are feet in 
the half-span, using the proper rise with the constant 12’ of run as shown 
in Fig. 197. The length of the tail is added to the rafter length, and the 
rafter length is shortened at the ridge by half the thickness of the ridge 
board if one is used. 
The length of common rafters for varying pitches per foot of run can 
be taken from Fig. 196. For example, what is the length per foot of run 
for a rafter having a pitch, or a rise of 12” in a run of 12’? The answer 
17” is given on the diagonal line. 
The length of common rafters may also be taken from the framing 
square or from the following table: :

Suggestions. Select a straight piece of rafter material for the pattern. 
Cut one pair of rafters, and try them out to see if they fit perfectly. Lay 
off all rafters so that the crowned or convex edges will be upward when 
the rafters are nailed in position.

RELATING TO GENERAL FARM PROJECTS 285 
An easy way to “‘raise” rafters for a gable roof is to toe-nail them at 
the apex before they are swung up into their final position; two men are 
required for this method, each standing where the rafters are to be nailed — 
to the plates.

CHAPTER XV 
RELATING TO THE FARM HOME 
Tur projects given in this chapter deal with repair and construction work 
related to the farm home. It is often possible to arrange shelves, here 
and there, or to make objects such as a home-made fireless cooker, that 
will add to the comforts and conveniences of the home. There is con- 
siderable satisfaction in using objects that have been constructed by 
members of the family.

Wash Bench 
1. Purpose. If washing is done in an ordinary wash-tub, the height 
of the tub from the floor is an important factor. One way to make 
the work as easy as possible is to have a wash bench of the height 
one likes best. This usually varies from 18’ to 22”.

the ends of the legs. 
ce. Finish the bench with several coats of linseed oil. 
Fireless Cooker 
1. Purpose. Fireless cookers are a convenience in any home, but the 
cost of the manufactured ones is prohibitive to many. The drawing 
shown herewith represents a home-made fireless cooker that gives 
satisfaction. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. White pine, basswood, yellow poplar, and other woods 
can be used. Non-resinous woods are best.

  296 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
Window Screens 
1. Purpose. Farmers frequently need to repair and to make window 
screens. Sometimes pieces of netting are tacked directly to window 
casings, which disfigures the latter, and the screening soon rusts or 
rots if left up the year round. It is much better, and in the end 
cheaper, to have removable screens that can be placed easily, and 
that may be stored away during the winter season. Several simple 
methods of construction are shown, such as may be used to ad- 
vantage by farmers and others having but a limited number of 
tools with which to do such work. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. White pine, fir, cypress, or cedar. The material needs 
to be as thick as the window casings. This is usually 1%’ 
1%’. Use lumber 2” wide for the top and sides and 3” wide for 
the bottom piece. Cross-bars may be made from %’’ to 1%” 
Molding to fasten down the netting may be purchased or can 
be made out of laths. 
b. Hardware. Wire netting is made in black and galvanized wire, 
and in copper and brass. Galvanized wire netting is moderately 
priced, and lasts well. Number 6 flat-head tacks are used to 
tack the netting to the frame. 
c. Paint. 
3. Directions. 
a. The joints may be made in a number of ways as shown in the 
drawing. 
b. Use 8d. finishing nails and set them well. 
c. Assemble the window screens and fit them to the openings before 
the wire is nailed in place. 
d. Paint all the woodwork before the netting is nailed on. Touch 
up with paint the nail heads in the moldings after these are 
nailed in place.

CHAPTER XVI 
SELF-MADE EQUIPMENT FOR THE SCHOOL SHOP OR FOR 
HOME CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK 
Tuts chapter is given over to a description of how to make a number 
of useful objects that fit in with the needs for equipment in school shops 
in which construction and repair work are taught. Many of them are 
equally well adapted to the needs on the home farm. Except where 
otherwise indicated, these objects were built under the direction of the 
author by students at the Pennsylvania State College. 
Base for Oilstone 
1. Purpose. If oil or carborundum stones are to be carried around, 
as in a tool box, such 
stones should be pro- 
tected by a box. For 
stones that are kept 
in a shop, it is suffi- 
cient to place them in 
a base or half-box. 
This may be perma- 
nently fastened on a 
work bench or table. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. White pine, or other soft, close-grained wood. Fig. 207. Basr ror OIsTonE

b. With a sharp chisel remove the stock within this rectangle to a 
uniform depth of }4’. 
c. Plane'a chamfer around the upper edge of the base as shown. 
d. Finish with several coats of boiled linseed oil. 
File Handles 
1. Purpose. Instead of a corn cob, or a piece of buggy spoke, or fork 
handle, it is better to use file handles such as shown in Fig. 209. 
The various steps in making file handles with and without ferrules 
is shown.

crosswise or in the way of the path of the saw as the miter box is 
used. Through use the bottom of the box may get deep saw- 
kerfs along the lines in which the saw travels, and nails should not 
be in the way. 
c. Lay out the saw-kerfs on the box with a framing square, very 
carefully, and watch the saw to make sure it does not “run” 
when cutting these guide-kerfs. If the saw does run reverse the 
box and cut the same kerf from the opposite side.

Saw Filing Clamp 
. Purpose. Two home-made saw filing clamps are shown in Fig. 
219. They differ principally in the construction of the jaws that 
hold the saw blade. Clamp No. 1 is made with the back of the file 
box lower than the bottom, so that it can be slipped into a work- 
bench vise as shown in Fig. 218.

c. Draw bolts are placed 7” from the top ends of the uprights to 
prevent the pieces from splitting in case the wedges a are driven 
too tightly. 
4. Clamp No. 2. 
a. Material required. The material required for this clamp is 
the same as for clamp No. 1, except that the bolts are 4” longer, 
and have wing nuts, and a pair of 4” strap hinges are also re- 
quired. 
Clamp No. 2 is a little harder to make, but is also somewhat 
more satisfactory because the saws are more easily adjusted than 
in clamp No. 1. 
b. Directions. The method of construction is essentially the same 
as for clamp No. 1. The difference in the construction is shown 
in the detail drawing.

Mallet 
1. Purpose. If much chiseling is to be done, a mallet is desirable. 
It is not as hard on chisel handles as a hammer is. If a hammer is 
used, it should be used flat-wise. 
The mallet shown herewith is made without the use of machinery 
of any kind. It is of nice weight and makes a satisfactory tool.

b. With a spoke shave or cabinet rasp next bring the handle to the 
required oval outline. 
c. In boring the hole through the head, bore from both ends. 
d. With a half-round file widen the hole at the outer end of the head 
+ into oval shape, so that the handle cannot pull out if wedged 
tightly. 
e. The outline for the head may be marked from a cardboard 
template. The outer curve is planed to shape with a smooth 
plane. 
f. The inner curve is made by cutting saw-kerfs of proper depth, 
and by chiseling out the material to the depth of the saw-kerfs. 
Finish, with sandpaper placed on a curved block. 
g. Give the mallet several coats of boiled linseed oil. 
Sawhorse 
. Purpose. Sawhorses are widely used in.connection with repair and 
construction work involving lumber. Their proportions are fairly 
well standardized. The drawing shows how to get the proper 
lengths of the legs and the bevels by means of a framing square. 
In the average school shop the pupils do too much sawing on bench 
tops and not enough on sawhorses. Every school shop ought to be 
equipped with two or three pairs of horses.

Lumber Rack 
1. Purpose. This rack is particularly useful where it is desired to take 
the lumber from the side of the rack, because of lack of space at the
-P-A-G-E-325
  
SELF-MADE EQUIPMENT 315 
ends. It offers a large storage capacity for the amount of floor 
space occupied. The rack is so designed that it will stand without 
being fastened to wall or ceiling, but it is safer to fasten it, as boys 
are likely to climb on it and tip it over. A good way to fasten it 
without bolts or straps is to make it ceiling height and then wedge 
it between floor and ceiling. 
. Material required for three bents. 
a. Lumber. Yellow pine, or any kind of soft or hard wood.

3. Directions. 
a. The method of construction is merely suggestive. For example, 
instead of bolting on the cross-arms, they might be spiked on. 
b. The principle of obtaining the lengths of the cross-arms is the 
same as finding the lengths of a series of rungs or steps in a ladder 
having a narrower top than bottom. Cut the cross-arms to 
approximate lengths, or gather up a number of short ends of 
scantlings and lay them side by side. Arrange them in order of 
length keeping one end flush. Lay off 134’ on the shortest piece 
and 2’ 7” on the longest one. Connect these points with a 
straight edge. The true length of each cross-arm is thus given 
graphically. 
c. The bevel for the end cuts can be found with a framing square or 
with a T bevel. 
d. Space the bents about four feet apart. 
e. Spike plates to bents before raising the framework, or spike top 
plate to bents and toe-nail to lower plates. 
Work Bench 
1. Purpose. Farmers do not find it profitable to own elaborate work 
benches with glued-up tops and rapid acting steel vises, such as are 
found in cabinet shops and other industrial establishments. The 
vast majority of farmers build their own benches. The bench de- 
scribed herewith is typical of good home-made bench construction, 
such as can be built by farmers and others without the use of power 
machinery of any kind. 
While the school shop may be equipped with some of the factory- 
made benches, it should not be overlooked that some of the home- 
made variety, such as described herewith, ought also to find a place 
in the shop so that the boys may know from first-hand experience 
how to build work benches on their home farms. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. The top and the lumber used in the vises should

    preferably be of hard wood. The body can be made of yellow 
pine, or similar lumber. The bench ought to be from 6’ to 8’ 
long, and about two feet wide, with two vises. For the home 
farm one may well be for wood, and the other a blacksmith’s or a 
machinist’s vise. 
For a work bench as shown in Fig. 228, exclusive of bench stop 
and of drawers, the following material is required:

3. Directions. 
a. Cut all material for a certain kind such as legs, cross-ties, top 
planks, etc., from one pattern so that the respective parts will 
match up. 
A twist drill may prove more satisfactory than an auger bit for 
boring holes through the top cross-ties, and through the legs. 
The holes can be bored from opposite sides of the pieces if it is 
found that the grain of the wood deflects the auger bit. 
Place the bolts in the legs so that they will not interfere with the 
vise. (See Fig. 229.) = S

In fastening the top planks, first bore holes %’’ deep with a 34” or 
%'’ bit (use the same diameter bit as the diameter of some hard 
wood broom handle that is to be used to plug these holes as shown 
in Fig. 231). Bore these holes where shown in the drawing. 
. Continue these holes with a %’’ bit all the way through the upper 
cross-ties. Remove the top planks to do this. 
. The guides for the drawers should be placed before the top is 
fastened down. 
. To assemble the vise, first bore a hole with an expansive bit so
-P-A-G-E-331
  
  er 
SELF-MADE EQUIPMENT 321 
that the front washer will fit snugly up against the vise. Then 
continue this hole, which is 8” from the top of the vise, and equi- 
distant from the sides, with an auger bit Mo’ or %” larger than 
the diameter of the screw to be used. (In this case %’’.) 
h. Fit all the joints but assemble only at the half-lap joint “A.” 
(Fig. 230.) Insert the parts through the holes in the aprons of 
the bench and fasten the remaining joints of the vise. 
. The holes in the aprons through which the vise works should be 
Ye" larger all around than the '%6’’ X 2” pieces in order to work 
freely. They should be bored and mortised out before they are 
screwed to the sides of the bench. 
. Be sure not to place a flat-head screw in the apron where the hole 
for the vise screw is to be bored. 
k. The method of plugging the bolt holes in the bench top is shown 
in Fig. 231. Apply a little liquid glue and drive in the hard wood 
broom handle snug up against the bolt heads. Next saw off the 
handle by passing a saw over the bench top without scratching 
the latter. Smooth up the places with a plane. 
. Dry out the top planks thoroughly before bolting them down. 
m. Apply several coats of boiled linseed oil to the whole bench. 
n. The drawer construction, and the bench stop are shown sepa- 
rately.

Bench Drawer 
. Purpose. This bench drawer (Fig. 232) is made to fit into the 
work bench just described. Trays may be fitted into the drawer. 
These may hold screws, brads, and small tools. Notice the simple 
handle — simply a hole made so that the hand can be inserted to 
pull the drawer. An ordinary drawer pull would be in the way as 
one works alongside of the bench. 
. Material required (for 1 drawer). 
a. Lumber. Front to match aprons of bench. Cypress can be 
used to match yellow pine. Sides, back, and bottom of the 
drawer should be of white pine or similar wood.

b. Glue up the bottom boards in the rough, then smooth them down 
to suit, and saw to dimensions. 
c. Do not nail the bottom boards fast to the sides if the construc- 
tion as shown in the drawing is used, but simply tack it in place 
with a single brad driven into the back end piece of the drawer. 
d. Nail the joints with 6d. or 8d. finishing nails, placing the nails so 
that they will not show when the drawer is closed.

1. Purpose. Most persons familiar with work-bench construction 
have seen the old-fashioned bench stop, made by cutting a V notch 
into a 6” X 8” board, used widely to-day. The stop shown is an 
improvement that holds stock edgewise much better than the old 
V block.

placed in the stop and is then pushed back so as to hold the board 
from slipping while it is being planed. 
c. Note that the sliding wedge ‘‘B” has one side beveled. This 
keeps it from bulging out of place. 
d. Countersink the screws so that they will be %”’ or more below the 
surface. This keeps planes and other cutting tools from being 
dulled on them. 
e. Finish with boiled linseed oil.

c. The box can be attractively fastened together by using round- 
head screws either in the blue finish, or in solid brass. A satis- 
factory job can also be made by using nails. These are set and 
the holes puttied. 
d. A removable till can also be placed in the bottom of the tool box. 
e. Brass corners would add to the strength and appearance of the 
box. 
f. Stain the box, and finish with two coats of spar varnish. Apply 
this in a room having a temperature of about 70 degrees, and 
where there is no dust.          
          
              
          
      
  Tool Chest 
1. Purpose. This tool chest is for use around the farmstead. It is 
somewhat smaller than carpenters usually build. If one has, or 
expects to have, a large kit of tools it will be well to make the chest 
2" higher, 4’” wider, and 6” longer. 
2. Material required. 
a. Lumber. Hither soft or hard wood of good quality.

1. Purpose. Many times, especially in rural schools, there are no 
separate drawing tables, nor is there space for such tables. The 
drawing-board support shown herewith is made so that it will fit 
into any ordinary bench vise. This makes it possible to do shop 
sketching and mechanical drawing right in the shop. 
_ The support may be adjusted for height to suit the pupils, and

  CHAPTER XVII 
SKETCHING AND MECHANICAL DRAWING 
SKETCHING is a universal language that is helpful to all who deal directly 
and indirectly with tools and materials. If a farmer can make a sketch 
of a part of a tool or machine that needs to be repaired or of some object 
that needs to be made, let us say in a garage or a machine shop, he can 
send the sketch there and the object can be made without difficulty. It 
is likewise desirable that farmers know how to read working drawings of 
any kind. The extent to which mechanical drawing should be taught to 
agricultural students is debatable. It is felt that the following abilities 
should be developed in agricultural students in the approximate order in 
which they follow: 
1. To read working sketches and blue-prints. 
2. To make working sketches. (These not to be to scale, but must 
show all necessary views, dimensions, and explanatory notes.) 
3. To make out bills of material, and write simple, accurate specifica- 
tions to accompany and amplify the sketches. 
4. To make working drawings to scale, in pencil. 
5. To make working drawings to scale, in ink, to make tracings, and 
blue-prints. 
It may not be advisable to carry all pupils studying vocational 
agriculture through each of the five steps enumerated. 
Reading Working Drawings 
1. Purpose. It is sometimes advisable to learn to read blue-prints and 
other forms of working drawings without actually doing any draw- 
ing. This can easily be done by learning a few fundamental facts 
about how objects are represented on paper by draftsmen. 
2. Lettering. Several standard styles of letters are used. Fig. 241 
shows one of the best styles used by mechanical draftsmen. It is 
called the “inclined single-line Gothic.’’ The same figure shows 
the directions and sequence of the various strokes that make up the 
letters and numerals. 
The same style of letter is shown in Fig. 242. Notice the slope, 
and the proportions of the letters. 
3. Conventional lines. Six different kinds of lines are shown in Fig. 248. 
Each line is made in a special way and has a standard use and inter- 
pretation. The conventions shown are widely used. By learning 
what each kind of line stands for, one may easily read drawings that 
are made in conformity with standard conventions. The conven- 
tions used by persons in various sections of the country are so

nearly the same that little difficulty is experienced in reading 
drawings. 
4. Conventional sectioning. In order that it may be easy to distinguish 
the kinds of materials used, there have been evolved certain stand- 
ard ways of representing these materials. The conventional sec-
-P-A-G-E-345
SKETCHING AND MECHANICAL DRAWING 335 
tioning shown in Fig. 244 shows how to represent a number of kinds 
of materials. 
5. Orthographic projections. By projection is meant the way the ob- 
ject is represented on the paper. Probably over ninety per cent of 
all working drawings that are used are made in accordance with the 
principles of what is technically called orthographic projection.

  Fic. 244. ConvENTIONAL SECTIONS 
Orthographic drawings show only one side of an object in each 
view. Two or three different views are used to represent the same 
object. These views usually have fixed relationship to each other, 
though circumstances may call for a different arrangement. In 
standard orthographic drawings, as made in the United States, the 
top view is shown above the front view and the side view or end |
-P-A-G-E-347

view is usually shown to the right of, and the same height as the 
front view, as in Fig. 245. 
Most of the drawings in this book are examples of orthographic 
projection. 
6. Isometric projections. Isometric drawings show three sides or 
planes in one view. ‘This is of advantage, especially to laymen not

familiar with the principles underlying orthographic projection. 
Isometric projection approximates true perspective, but is made so 
that actual distances can be measured on the drawn object, along 
certain lines if the drawing is made to scale. Figs. 144 and 145 
illustrate isometric drawings. Such drawings are easier to make 
than true perspectives, and are better than the latter when a work- 
ing drawing is wanted.
-P-A-G-E-349
  SKETCHING AND MECHANICAL DRAWING 339 
7. Standard sizes of drawings. Practice differs considerably in the 
sizes used for drawing plates. Fig. 246 shows how a standard 
18’ x 24” paper may be laid off into three sizes, each a multiple of 
the other. The plates are laid off with the widest margin at the 
left hand side, for purposes of binding. 
For class work it is well to require one or more standard sizes for 
drawings, and a standard title space as shown in Fig. 247. 
8. Pencil or ink. The time that can be devoted to sketching and to 
mechanical drawing is so limited in amount that best results can 
probably be attained by limiting all such work to pencil rendering. 
Individual pupils who show exceptional interest and capacity may 
be encouraged to render drawings and tracings in ink. r

          9. Technique not the major aim. While it is desirable to develop in 
agricultural pupils a reasonable amount of skill to make pencil 
sketches and drawings, it should be kept in mind that they are 
preparing for farming and not drafting as-a vocation. Hence they 
should not be held up to the same standard of technique that is 
expected of pupils that are preparing to become draftsmen.

CHAPTER XVIII 
USES OF ROPE ON THE FARM 
1. Purpose. Rope is used in so many different ways in connection 
with farm shop work that a working knowledge of the characteristics 
of rope, and an understanding of how to make a limited number of 
knots, hitches, and splices, is essential to efficient farming. 
2. Kinds of rope. The two materials most commonly used in the 
manufacture of ropes used on the farm are manila hemp and sisal. 
The latter is cheaper than good grade manila hemp, is harsher, and 
not so strong. Most of the binder twine is made of sisal fiber. For 
the heavier ropes manila hemp is strongest and best. 
3. Standard size, weight, and strength of rope. Rope is usually sold by 
the pound, and purchased by farmers by the foot. Table 18 shows 
the weights of given lengths of rope, and also shows the breaking 
strength as well as the safe working strength. The latter is much 
less as the safe working strength is only about % of the actual 
breaking strength of good quality rope. Such factors of safety 
must always be allowed in order to provide for possible defects in 
workmanship and for variations in the strength of fiber.

upon rope. When not in use, ropes should be dried thoroughly, and 
should be kept in a dry place.

Whipping the End of a Rope 
1. Purpose. In order to keep the ends of ropes from fraying, and in 
order that they may readily pass through pulleys, rings, or other 
small openings, the ends are wrapped as shown in Figs. 249 and 
    Fic. 250. Wuuippine THE Enp or A Roper (F1nat Steps)

250. This is technically called ‘‘whipping.” Another method of 
whipping the end of a rope is shown in Fig. 251. 
2. Directions. 
a. Take a piece of string about 3’ long and wax it with shoemaker’s 
wax or beeswax. 
b. Lay a loop along the end of the A a 
rope as shown at No. 1, letting 
the short end of the cord “A” iA 
extend about 3” from the rope. 3 
c. Wrap the long end ‘“‘B”’ tightly Nae 
around the rope in such a way A 
that there is no space between amme<cccrcoccssees No3 
the cord wrappings. Continue Fig. 251. Onn Merson or Wur- 
until only 4’ of the end of the PING THE Enp or A RopE 
rope remains unwrapped. 
d. Pass the end “B”’ through the loop at the end of the cord. 
e. Grasp the end ‘‘A”’ and pull the end “B”’ as far as possible under 
the wrapping. 
f. What remains of ends “A” and ““B”’ may be cut off close to the 
rope. 
3 Knots 
1. Characteristics. Knots differ greatly in the following respects: 
a. Speed with which they can be tied. 
b. Speed with which they can be untied. 
c. Holding power. 
2. Elements. Knots are made up of loop, bights, and turns. In Fig. 
252 “A” represents a loop or open 
bight. It is made by turning the rope 
back upon itself. A bight is shown 
at “B,” and a round turn at “C.” 
The part of the rope ‘‘D” opposite to 
Fie. 252. the end “A” is called the “standing 
A End. B. Loop. © ight. D.Stand- part.” As these terms are used in de- 
scribing the construction of knots and 
hitches it is advisable to be familiar with them. 
  The Overhand Knot 
1. Purpose. The overhand knot is the simplest that can be made. It 
is used at the end of ropes to keep 
the ends from unlaying, and is also 
used in other parts of the rope as a 
stopper knot. The overhand knot 
forms a part of many other knots. ‘Fig. 253. Tam Oversanp Knor 
2. Directions. The standing part “B” : 
is held in the left hand. The end “A” is passed through the loop 
thus formed, and is pulled tight. 
   
-P-A-G-E-356
  ‘ 346 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
The Square Knot 
1. Purpose. The square knot is used more frequently than any other 
for tying together two ropes, cords, or strings of equal diameter; the 
knot will hold well and is easy to untie. Variations of it, such as 
the square knot with a single bow, and the square knot with the 
double bow are used in tying shoe-laces. 
2. Directions. 
a. Tie the right-hand form of the 
overhand knot. 
b. Cross the ends “A” and “B” and 
tie the left-hand overhand knot. 
Fic. 254. Tue Squarn Knor c. Notice that the standing part and 
the end of each rope is passed 
through the loop formed by the other rope. (Fig. 254.) 
d. A false and unsatisfactory form of the square knot is called the 
“granny” or ‘“lubber’s” knot. Notice the construction care- 
fully so that the true square knot shown in Fig. 254 will be made. 
  The Weaver's Knot 
1. Purpose. This knot derives its name from the fact that weavers 
use it in tying yarn or threads that break in the loom. It is used by 
  Fig. 255. Snowrne One Way or Ty1nc THE WEAVER’S KNoT 
Reproduced by permission of P. G. Holden, International Harvester Co., Chicago, Ill. 
farmers in tying binder twine because the knot can be made easily 
so that both ends of the knot point in the same direction. This is

USES OF ROPE ON THE FARM 347 
useful when the knot has to pass through openings such as the eye 
of a needle. 
2. Directions. 
a. Make the bight ‘‘ B” (Fig. 255) at the end of one of the ropes. 
b. Take the end “A” of the other rope and pass it through the 
bight formed with the end “B.” 
c. Complete the knot by throwing the loop “C.” 
Slip Knot 
1. Purpose, The slip knot is the most common form of an eye knot. 
It is used where a loop is wanted 
that will slip out tight against an 
object. This knot is difficult to 
untie if it is pulled tight. 
2. Directions. ’ ‘Fig. 258. Tae Sure Knor 
a. Form a bight “C” (Fig. 258). 
b. With the end “A” make an overhand knot around the standing 
part “B.” 
  The Bowline Knot 
1. Purpose. The bowline knot is one of the most useful, and at the 
same time least understood knots 
among laymen. It derives its name 
from the fact that sailors use it in 
mooring their ships by means of a 
line from the bow of the vessel. 
The bowline is sometimes called 
“the king of knots.” It is easily 
x tied, it will not slip or draw tight, 
Y and can be untied easily. It is used 
~ in various kinds of construction work. 
Farmers find it an excellent knot

back through the bight “C.” 
The Double Bowline 
1. Purpose. The double bowline is used when a loop is wanted in 
some part of rope other than at the end. It is also used in tying 
loops at the ends of thin ropes when they are used double. 
2. Directions. The same method is used as with the single bowline 
knot, the difference being that the double bowline is tied after the 
“rope has been doubled. | 
Halter Tie 
1. Purpose. This knot is used to tie farm animals to posts, or to 
rings. The knot can be untied easily by jerking the end of the 
rope, and yet may be made tight 
enough to keep it from slipping 
_ down the post to which it may 
be tied. This is essential, as the 
animal might otherwise get a foot 
_ over the halter rope. 
2. Directions. 
_ a. Pass the rope around the post.

BELT AND HARNESS REPAIRING 
Practical Information about Belting 
LEATHER belting is made up of many short pieces of leather, each being 
perhaps four feet long in the rough. These are cemented together, end 
toend. The ends are scarfed or beveled, so as to produce a lap of from 
4” to 7” in belts up to 8” wide. In order that the belting may wear as 
long as possible, belts of single thickness should be placed so that the 
inside points of the laps run toward the pulleys as shown herewith. 
It is desirable to run the grain or 
hair side of single thickness belting 
on the pulleys as better friction, 
more strength, and maximum wear 
is secured in this way. Kia. 270. Tue Ricut Way To RUN 
Mineral and vegetable oils injure Learser Bexts 
belting, and result in loss of power 
by causing the belt to slip. Rosin should never be used to make a belt 
“stick” better. Its effect is only temporary. It combines with dust 
and dirt and collects in lumps that result in excessive wear on the belt. 
If a belt dressing is wanted that will serve in case of an emergency by 
increasing the friction between the belt and the pulleys, it should be one 
that causes no harmful effects. 
Neat’s-foot oil is a good belt dressing that increases the life of belting if 
it is properly applied. Most persons apply it too freely. A little should 
be applied on the side of the belt next to the pulleys, and more should be 
used on the opposite side. This enables it to soak through to the wearing 
surface gradually. Too much oil will weaken the fibers of the leather. 
Good belt dressings are also made by reliable manufacturers. Follow 
directions closely when using any product of this kind. 
Dampness is injurious to ordinary leather belting unless it is water- 
proofed. If laps should become loose, they should be cemented together 
again. Rivets are not so satisfactory. 
Pulleys should be at least 4” wider than the belt in order to allow for 
irregularity in the belt. Crowned pulleys are to be preferred where they 
can be used, but the crown should not be too high. 
In lacing belts care should be used to obtain ends that are square, and 
the lacing should be put in with equal tension all the way across the belt.

How to Figure the Length of a Belt ! 
1. When both pulleys are nearly the same size. Multiply one half of the 
sum of the diameters of the two pulleys by 3.14. To this number 
add twice the distance between the centers of the shafts, giving the 
required length. 
2. When the two pulleys are of quite different diameters. To obtain the 
desired length, add tegether the numbers resulting from a, b, and c. 
a. Multiply one half of the sum of the diameters of the two pulleys by 
3.14. 
b. Multiply the distance between the centers of the shafts by 2. 
c. Square the difference in the diameters of the two pulleys, and di- 
vide by four times the center distance. 
3. For crossed belts. To obtain the desired length, add together the 
results of a and b. 
a. Multiply one half of the sum of the diameters of the two pulleys 
by 3.14. 
b. Square one half the sum of the diameters of the two pulleys. Add 
to this result the square of the center distance. Extract the 
square root of the sum and multiply by 2. 
Rules for Calculating the Speed of Pulleys? 
Problem 1— The diameters of both pulleys and the revolutions of one 
being given, to find the number of revolutions of the other: Multiply the 
diameter of the one by its number of revolutions and divide the product 
by the diameter of the other. The result will be the number of revolu- 
tions. 
Problem 2 — The diameter and revolutions of one pulley being given, to 
find the required diameter of the other to procure any given number of tts 
revolutions: Multiply the diameter of the one by the number of its revolu- 
tions and divide the product by the number of revolutions of the other; 
the result will be its diameter. 
Problem 3 — To ascertain the size of the driver: Multiply the diameter 
of the driven pulley by the number of revolutions you wish to make and 
divide the product by the revolutions of the driver shaft; the result will 
be the size of the driver. 
The above rules are practically correct, though owing to the slip, 
elasticity, and thickness of the belt, the circumference of the driven 
pulley seldom runs as fast as the driver. 
Methods of Lacing Belts 
1. Metallic belt lacing (composition wire). Information regarding the 
size of metallic lacing that is suited to various widths of belts is

given in Chapter IV under “Belt Lacing.” This type of lacing is 
used chiefly on narrow belts. 
2. Patent belt hooks and 
plate fasteners. There 
are many kinds on 
themarket. The steel 
belt lacing shown 
  herewith is one of the Fie. 271. Sreen Bert Lactna 
effective fasteners of From Catalogue of the Chicago Belting Co. 
this type. 
3. Leather and rawhide lacing. Leather and rawhide lacing is widely 
used. The following general directions need to be observed: 
a. Use a square to make sure ends of belt are cut off squarely. 
b. Punch the holes as shown in the following illustrations so that 
they are exactly opposite each other. 
c. Use a belt punch for leather, and an awl for making holes in 
fabric belts.

Tools 
Ir will be seen from the description given in Chapter II, under “Tools 
used in harness and leather repair work,” that very few tools are ab- 
solutely required for repair work in leather. For example, stitching can 
be done with harness thread, needle, and an awl. If a knife needs to be 
used, a sharp pocket knife, or a kitchen knife, may serve the purpose. 
There are several inexpensive tools that are convenient and that 
facilitate good work. A pricking wheel may be used to lay off the spaces 
for the stitches. If only a minimum number of tools are to be purchased, 
it is better to buy a finishing wheel instead of a pricking wheel. The 
finishing wheel can be used to lay off the stitches, and after they are 
made, the tool is run over them so as to make them appear as uni- 
form as possible. 
Similarly a common edging tool is of service in giving additional finish

Materials 
A brief description of materials used in leather repair work is found 
in Chapter IV under the caption of ‘Materials used in harness and 
leather repair work.’”’ A more detailed description of those materials 
that are essential to harness repair work is herewith given. 
Leather. The term “leather” is given to the skins of animals such as 
cattle after the skins have undergone several processes. After the hide is

  taken from the animal it is usually heavily salted on the flesh side so as 
to preserve it until it may be tanned. Tanning involves several proc- 
esses. The first of these removes the hair from the hides and prepares 
them for the second step which is the actual process of tanning. Hides 
are tanned by means of tannic acid that is found in hemlock bark, in oak 
bark, and in other substances. Oak tanned leather, other things being 
equal, is usually preferred. After the hides are tanned they go through 
the last process known as the finishing process. This consists in a 
number of operations that produce the proper color, flexibility, and 
thickness of the leather. The quality of leather depends upon the

nature or characteristics of the hide, the tanning solution used, and the 
process of manufacture. In most leather it is easy to distinguish the hair 
side from the flesh side. This is desirable, as harness leather is usually 
faced with the hair side outward. 
Thread. Good, strong thread is needed to make repairs that will 
“stand up” under hard usage. Flax thread las been found to be most 
useful for the purpose because of its high tensile strength and excellent 
wearing qualities. 
Wax. Ordinary shoemaker’s or harness-maker’s wax is used in forming 
the flax strands into thread. This wax holds the strands together to 
some extent, and thereby increases the strength of the thread. 
Another kind of wax, common beeswax, is also used whenever thread 
needs to be made “‘slicker” so that it will pull through the holes easier. 
Harness oil. Neat’s-foot oil is recommended. If it is to be darkened 
this may be done by stirring common powdered lamp-black into the oil 
until the latter has a glossy appearance.
-P-A-G-E-371
  BELT AND HARNESS REPAIRING 361 
Harness repair parts. Harness repairing is greatly simplified by vari- 
ous repair parts, such as buckles, snaps, loops, links, ete., that are usually 
carried in local stores, or that are purchased from mail order houses. It 
is desirable to have a limited supply of essential repair parts on hand at 
all times. See Fig. 280. 
Making a Harness Thread 
Four processes are involved in making a harness thread. These are as 
follows: 
1. Measuring the thread. 
2. Tearing the thread. 
3. Assembling the threads into a harness thread. 
4. Waxing the harness thread. 
Measuring. A Number 10 flax thread is satisfactory for harness 
stitching. In order to obtain a thread of sufficient length cut the thread 
six inches longer than what is required for the stitching to be done. 
Lengths up to five feet long may be handled advantageously. 
  
    
Fic. 278. MATERIALS USED TO MAKE A HARNESS THREAD 
Ball of No. 10 linen thread; needles; shoemaker’s wax. (Figs. 278, 281-284 from Harness 
Repairing, F. G. Behrends. Cornell Reading Course for the Farm, Lesson 160.) 
Tearing the strands. Threads should not be cut to length, nor should 
they be broken without first untwisting the threads, as this would result 
in a blunt end that would not pass through the eye of the needle. In or- 
der to untwist a thread hold the thread between the thumb and first fin- 
ger of the left hand with the latter six inches away from, and to the left of, 
the right thigh. With the palm of the right hand roll the thread down- 
ward over the right thigh until the fibers are separated. Then break 
them with a quick jerk. This will give a torn thread with a long, taper- 
ing point. 
Assembling the threads. The assembled harness thread is made up of 
a number of separate flax threads. For stitching light leather three 
threads may be used to form the harness thread; for heavy stitching as 
on traces and hame tugs six or seven flax threads may be assembled to 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  362 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR WORK FOR THE FARM 
form a harness thread of sufficient strength. Stagger the ends of the 
threads, that is, let each thread extend an inch or so beyond the next, 
so that the end of the completed harness thread will be in the form of a 
slender taper that can readily be drawn through the eye of a needle. 
Wawing the thread. The final process of making a harness thread con- 
sists in waxing the thread. This is done in the following manner. Wind 
one end of the thread around the end of the first finger of the left hand, 
and the other end around the second finger of the same hand. Throw the 
middle of the thread over a nail or hook so that the thread can be pulled 
taut. Take the wax in the right hand and apply it to the thread by rub- 
bing it briskly over a short part of the thread at a time. This generates 
heat and causes the wax to adhere to the thread. When the entire thread 
has been waxed, continue to rub the wax into the thread by passing it be- 
tween the thumb and first finger. In order to make the waxed thread 
pull as easily as possible, apply beeswax over the harness-maker’s wax but 
be careful not to put beeswax on the end near the needle, as this would 
cause the thread to pull out of the eye too easily because of lack of stick- 
ing quality on the thread near the needle. 
How to thread a Harness-Maker’s Needle 
Hold the needle in the left hand. With one tapered end of the thread 
in the right hand pass it through the needle. When the thread has 
passed several inches through the eye of the needle double the thread 
back upon itself by using the thumb 
and first finger of the left hand. 
With the thumb and first finger of 
the right hand roll the needle in a 
clockwise direction, and at the same 
time draw it forward so as to cause 
the end of the thread to form a 
neat spiral around the main thread, 
thus holding the needle in place. 
Stitching 
If a strap isto be spliced by stitch- 
ing, first cut the two ends off square. 
Next bevel the two ends with a 
knife. The bevels should be from the 
flesh side to the hair side, and should 
be several inches in length. Place 
Fig. 279. Srrrcuinc Horse the two ends so that the hair side of 
both pieces will be on the same side 
when they are stitched. In order to facilitate good work use two small 
tacks to hold the ends temporarily in position. Take a rule and a 
pointed tool such as the leg of a pair of dividers, and mark off the spac-

ings for the stitches, or if a pricking or finishing wheel is at hand use this 
on the hair side of the strap. Next place the ends in a stitching clamp 
or a vise. 
The following method is frequently used in stitching: pass the awl 
through the leather at a point just beyond the lap; place the left needle 
in this hole and place the right needle in the hole above the left needle; 
pull both needles through, and tighten up on the threads; continue the

process without laying down either needles or the awl between stitches 
until a point just beyond the end of the lap is reached; reverse the strap 
in the clamp and proceed as before. The threads may be crossed on the 
flesh side of the leather. When the stitching is completed, the thread can 
be fastened by turning back one stitch. Cut the ends of the threads off 
flush with the surface of the leather. 
In order to give the work a more finished appearance, run a finishing 
wheel over the stitching. Next lay the hair side of the splice on a smooth 
surface and pound down the stitches on the flesh side with a hammer.

One half of the staple is placed in the corner of a vise. Moving the hame back and forth will break the staple. 
Riveting 
A broken strap may be spliced by the use of several types of rivets, such 
as solid, split, and tubular rivets. Solid copper rivets and burrs are fre- 
quently used. A hole is punched or drilled through the leather, a rivet of 
proper size is inserted, and the burr is riveted fast with a riveting ham- 
mer, a ball pene hammer, or similar tool. 
Split rivets are simply driven through the lapped ends, and the ends of 
the rivets are clinched.

-P-A-G-E-375
  BELT AND HARNESS REPAIRING 365 
A comparatively inexpensive machine is required if tubular rivets are 
to be used. 
Replacing a Hame Staple 
Occasionally the hame staple (Fig. 280, Miscellaneous Repair Parts, 
No. 10) needs to be replaced. The method of doing this is illustrated 
in the figures shown herewith which are reproduced by permission from 
Mr. F. G. Behrends’s excellent bulletin: Harness Repairing, Lesson 
160, Cornell Reading Course for the Farm. 
The following processes are involved: 
1. Break the worn staple by placing one leg of the staple in a metal 
vise, and move the hame backward and forward until the staple is 
broken. In case a metal vise is not: at hand, the staple may be 
broken with a cold chisel, a hack saw, or with a file. 
2. Break or cut the exposed part of the staple off close to the hame. 
3. If the hame staple is tapered (as shown in Fig. 280, Miscellaneous 
Repair Parts, No. 10) drive the staple in far enough so that the 
burrs or washers may be cut away from the ends of the staple. 
Then remove the staple with a punch. 
4. If the hame staple has points or legs that do not taper the staple can 
be punched out without removing the burrs or washers. 
5. Insert the new rivet through the hold-back plate and hame, cut the 
extra length from the staple, place the burrs or washers in position, 
and rivet as shown in the accompanying illustration. | 
Harness Clamp 
1. Purpose. The harness stitching clamp illustrated in the accom- 
panying drawing (Fig. 285) is intended for use in a steel bench 
  
    
    
Fig. 283. Removine A Hamer Stapie 
Moving the hame up and down breaks the half of the staple off. Half of the staple isseen, 
broken close to the hame and below the shoulder.

Suggestions on Care of Harness 
In order to make a harness last as long as possible, it is advisable to 
observe the following precautions:

. Clean the harness whenever it gets dirty. 
. Use water to wash off dirt or mud, but do not let the leather soak 
in water. 
. Never use hot water on leather. 
. After washing, dry the leather slowly in the shade — not in the sun 
or near a stove. 
. Keep it well oiled. Oil a harness at least twice a month when it is 
in use. 
If possible adjust buckles so that they will not wear in the same hole 
all of the time. This will help to retard rotting, and will make the 
parts wear longer.

Strength of Cement 
The tensile strength of Portland cement should be: 
175 lbs. per sq. in. for neat cement 24 hours old 
500 Ibs. per sq. in. for neat cement 7 days old 
600 Ibs. per sq. in. for neat cement 28 days old 
The compressive strength of cement when it is thoroughly hardened 
should equal at least 3000 lbs. per square inch for a 1: 2%: 5 mixture, and 
2000 Ibs. per square inch for a 1: 3:5 mixture. 
Strength of Steel 
The ultimate tensile strength, or the breaking strength of structural steel 
is from 55,000 to 65,000 lbs. per square inch. The safe working stress is fre- 
quently taken to be 16,000 lbs. per square inch. The safe working stresses 
are taken to be about % the breaking stress. 
Strength of Manila Rope 
The strength of three-strand manila rope is shown in Table 18. American 
two-strand hemp rope is rated by the United States Navy Department as 
being 85 per cent as strong as the three-strand rope.

PREFACE 
OuR age, as has been truly said, is so 
strongly characterized by “a _ stupendous 
reliance upon the trustworthiness of ma- 
chinery” that one can hardly doubt that 
there is constant need of emphasis upon 
the personal and ideal elements of life. 
Both the scientific and the industrial expan- 
sion of our time, which involve such uni- 
versal use of the mechanical as to both 
means and point of view, are so impressive 
that we are unconsciously drawn into an 
overestimation of mere mechanism. And we 
are thus in danger of forgetting that in edu- 
cation, in ethics, in religion, and in all true 
living, it is still true that the most impor- 
tant facts are persons; and that “a‘ man’s 
life consisteth not in the abundance of the 
things which he possesseth.” Not in one- 
sided reaction against the mechanical view, 
then, but in full recognition of the indis- 
(v)

pensableness of mechanism everywhere, we 
yet have great need to insist that mechanism 
is to be completely subordinated to the per- 
sonal and ideal interests of life; that in the 
making of men we must take into account 
the entire man in the whole range of his 
interests, and must see that the personal 
factor is of supreme importance. 
These convictions underlie all the ad- 
dresses which make up this book, and may 
serve to justify its title; and the addresses 
are here brought together, thus,+ because 
it is hoped that they will be found to have 
some real unity, pertinence, and sugges- 
tion. At the same time, this very fact 
involves some repeated use of similar lines 
of thought. 
The addresses can hardly fail to have the 
unity that arises from an emphasis upon the 
same great principles applied to related but 
different important problems: the problem 
of college education; the problem of the 
fundamental relation of religion to educa- 
tion, ethics, and life; the problem of the ed-

ucational side of religion; the problem of a 
psychological comparison of educational and 
evangelistic methods in religious work; and 
the problem of the conditions of individual 
ethical attainment. In these varied discus- 
sions | express my conviction that college 
education cannot hope either to retain or 
regain, as the case may be, its important 
place in the national life, except as it recog- 
nizes itself as giving preéminently the supreme 
training of the entire man for living; that 
our life, individual and national, must suffer 
if we do not recognize the essentially fun- 
damental nature of religion; that religious 
education itself can only count as it ought, 
when its breadth and its preéminently per- 
sonal character are clearly recognized; that 
real justice can be done to the different 
methods naturally used in religious work only 
by a careful psychological study; and that, 
as the mechanical view everywhere requires 
an ideal view to complete it, so, on the other 
hand, in the attainment of high character,

ditions involved in our natures cannot be 
overlooked. The immediate practical nature 
of the last address will be pardoned. 
All the discussions, I trust, may be found 
to have, also, some special pertinence at the 
present time, in view of the serious ques- 
tions raised concerning the precise function 
of college education, and in view of the 
awakened interest in religious needs, and in 
the educational side of religion. 
For the very reason that the problems 
discussed are in no case without some 
special difficulty, and because the attempt is 
made to apply, in their discussion, principles 
that seem in real danger of being too much 
overlooked, it may be hoped that the treat- 
ment of the problems may have, too, some 
real suggestiveness.

  PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS 
IN EDUCATION 
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON IN 
COLLEGE EDUCATION 
THE numerous inaugurations of college 
presidents in the last three or four years 
have necessarily called out extended discus- 
sions of educational aims. A late-comer in 
the field hardly feels at liberty to ignore, 
and he certainly does not wish merely to 
repeat, what has been already well said. To 
a certain extent he must probably do both; 
for he can hardly contribute more than his 
individual viewpoint, and may, perhaps, count 
himself fortunate if, taking advantage of the 
discussions of his predecessors, he can by a 
single degree advance to greater clearness 
the exact problem of college education. 
But he may still find encouragement to 
A (1)
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
believe that the task naturally set him is not 
wholly useless, when he remembers that, in 
spite of a considerable consensus of opinion 
on the part of college presidents as to what 
a college education in general ought to be, 
the problem of the precise place of the col- 
lege in our actual educational system has 
perhaps never been at a more critical stage 
than now. That at least an increasing num- 
ber of thoughtful observers feel this to be 
the case, there can be no doubt. President 
Butler only voices the fear of many when he 
says: “The American college hardly exists 
nowadays, and, unless all signs mislead, those 
who want to get it back in all its useful 
excellence will have to fight for it pretty 
vigorously. The milk-and-water substitutes, 
and the fiat universities that have taken the 
place of the colleges, are a pretty poor 
return for what we have lost.” 
For the rapid changes that have taken 
place in college education in the last 
twenty-five years have carried with them, in 
many quarters at least, unforeseen and far- 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 3 
reaching consequences. The study of these 
consequences has brought to some of the 
most careful students of education, with what- 
ever recognition of gain, a distinct sense of 
loss, most definitely expressed, perhaps, by 
Dean Briggs in his “Old-fashioned Doubts 
Concerning New-fashioned Education.” 
Other changes in other departments of 
education have greatly complicated the prob- 
lem of the relation of the different members 
of our educational system. Revolutionary 
changes, that seem almost if not quite to 
involve the elimination of the college, are 
soberly, even if reluctantly, suggested by dis- 
tinguished educators. And other changes of 
relations that appear at first sight less serious, 
in which the colleges themselves are acqui- 
escing, may in the end make any adequate 
attainment of the older college ideal equally 
impossible. The result of the entire situation, 
therefore, is to press today upon American 
educators, as never before, these questions: 
Has the American college a real function, a 
logical and vital place in a comprehensive
-P-A-G-E-16
4 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
system of education? or is it the blunder of a 
crude time and a crude people, an illogical 
hybrid between the secondary school and the 
university, that ought to hand over a part of 
its work to the secondary school and the rest 
to the university, and to retire promptly from 
the scene with such grace as it can muster? 
or, at best, is its older function now incapable 
of realization? 
I. THE FUNCTION OF COLLEGE EDUCATION 
Just because these questions concern the 
place of college education in a system of edu- 
cation, they can be answered only in the light 
of a comprehensive survey of the entire 
problem of education. 
The problem of education in its broadest 
scope may perhaps be said to be the problem 
of preparation for meeting the needs of the 
world’s life and work. Much of the training 
belongs necessarily to the home and to the 
interactions of the inevitable relations of life. 
Much of it, probably, can never be brought 
         
-P-A-G-E-17
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 5 
into any organized system. But organized 
education must do what it can to insure, 
first, that no men shall lack that elementary 
training and knowledge without which they 
are hardly fitted at all for ordinary human 
intercourse, or for intelligent work of any 
kind in society, still less for growing and 
happy lives; second, that there shall be those 
who can carry on the various occupations 
demanded by our complex civilization, in the 
trades, in business, and in the professions; 
third, that there shall be investigators, scien- 
tific specialists, extenders of human knowl- 
edge, in all spheres. None of these needs 
are likely to be denied—not even the last; for 
our age has had so many demonstrations of 
the practical value of scientific discoveries 
that it is even ready to grant the value of the 
extension of knowledge for its own sake. 
That, then, every man should have the edu- 
cation necessary to render him a useful mem- 
ber of society; that the necessary occupations 
should be provided for; that there should be 
a class of scientific specialists constantly push- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
ing out the boundaries of human knowledge, 
—we are all agreed. And to this extent, at 
least, the problems, first of the elementary 
schools; second, of the trade, technical and 
professional schools; and third, of the univer- 
sity proper, are recognized and justified. 
Our difficulties begin when we try to de- 
fine more narrowly just what is to be included 
in our first group of schools. Exactly what 
education is indispensable that one may be- 
come a useful member of society? Virtually, 
we seem to have decided that that indis- 
pensable education is covered in our primary 
and grammar grades; for the majority do not 
go further, and compulsory education does 
not require more. And yet, with practical 
unanimity, the United States have decided 
that the State is justified in furnishing, and, 
indeed, is bound to furnish, that smaller 
number of its children who are willing and 
able to take further schooling, opportunity 
to continue for three or four years longer in 
studies of so-called “secondary” grade. The 
State can justify this procedure only upon the
-P-A-G-E-19
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 7 
ground that such further study prepares still 
better for citizenship, and that it is of value 
to the State that even a much smaller number 
should have this better preparation; or, also, 
and perhaps more commonly, upon the prac- 
tical ground that the secondary education 
furnishes the knowledge and training which, 
if not indispensable to citizenship, is indis- 
pensable to many of the higher occupations 
and forms of service to the State. No sharp 
line, certainly, can be drawn between the 
studies of the grammar school and those of 
the high school. And we all recognize and 
justify the secondary school, and _ unhesita- 
tingly include it, as practically indispensable 
to the State, if not to all its citizens, in our 
first group of schools, to form the unified 
public-school system. 
But it needs to be borne clearly in mind, 
that if the true justification of elementary and 
secondary education is the preparation of use- 
ful members of society, it cannot be regarded 
as merely intellectual. The moral side of 
the matter is, if there is any difference, even
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
more important—the learning of order, of 
obedience, of integrity in one’s work, of 
steadfastness in spite of moods, of the demo- 
cratic spirit, of a real sense of justice, and of 
the rightful demand of the whole upon the 
individual. If these are not given in some 
good measure, then, whatever the intellectual 
results, in just so far, from the point of view 
of the State, public-school education is a 
failure. And yet no doubt it must be said, 
that since in America the school children are 
all in homes, the American public-school 
teacher has, quite naturally, not regarded 
himself as primarily charged with anything 
but the intellectual training of the child. 
Other training has been largely incidental— 
taken up only so far as the order of the school 
demanded, or as it was inevitably involved in 
the situation. Even so, the moral training 
has been by no means unimportant. But it 
may be doubted if there is any change in 
public-school education so important today 
as that the teacher should plainly recognize 
that his real responsibility is to train his 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 9 
charges to be useful members of society, 
with all that that implies. Let the child and 
the parent and the teacher all alike understand 
that the State undertakes the free education 
of all its children just because it hopes thus 
to prepare them to be valuable members of 
a free people; and that whatever is necessary 
to that end, provided it does not violate indi- 
vidual consciences, is within the function of 
the public school. This means, of course, 
that it is the business of the public school to 
teach /iving, as well as studies. 
But with this recognition of the broader 
function of the public schools, with the nec- 
essary acknowledgement of a real broaden- 
ing even on the intellectual side of technical 
and professional courses, and with the pres- 
ent common admission of the danger of a 
specialism not broadly based, is the distinct 
function of the college clearer, or has it 
rather been taken on by the other members 
of the educational system? To a certain ex- 
tent, no doubt, the latter is true and ought 
to be true,
-P-A-G-E-22
  I0 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
But we might well argue for college edu- 
cation, in line with the more practical argu- 
ment already made for secondary education, 
that the highest success in the great occupa- 
tions of the world’s work, including scientific 
specialism, requires an education preliminary 
to the technical training, more extended not 
only, but of a broader type than secondary 
education can furnish. This seems commonly 
granted now by the technical schools them- 
selves. And this position is no doubt correct. 
But is this the chief reason for college edu- 
cation? It is not merely for the purpose of 
carrying on the world’s work in this external 
sense that college education exists, nor does 
this sufficiently define its function. The col- 
lege does not look beyond to the technical 
or professional school, or to the university 
proper for its justification; but rather is 
itself the culmination of the work that at 
least ought to be undertaken by the public 
schools. 
We might, therefore, argue again and more 
truly, probably, for college education, in line
-P-A-G-E-23
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON II 
with the other argument for secondary edu- 
cation: that the world needs preeminently 
the leadership of a few of greater social 
efficiency than any of the other types of 
education by their necessary limitations are 
able to offer. For when all is said that can 
possibly be said for elementary, secondary, 
technical, professional, and specialized train- 
ing, what still do the world’s life and work 
need? All these are necessary, but obviously, 
for the highest life of society, much more, 
and much that is greater, is demanded. 
Here are instruction and discipline, technical 
skill and professional training, and heights 
of specialized knowledge. “But where shall 
wisdom be found, and where is the place of 
understanding?” The elementary school saith, 
“Tt is not in me”; and the secondary school 
saith, “It is not with me.” It cannot be 
gotten for technical skill, nor shall profes- 
sional success be weighed for the _ price 
thereof; it cannot be valued with the gain 
of the specialist, with his enlarged knowledge 
or his discovery. “Whence then cometh 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  I2 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
wisdom, and where is the place of under- 
standing ?” 
One cannot answer that question by rais- 
ing small inquiries of immediately appre- 
ciable gain. Let us ask, then, the largest 
questions and note their generally admitted 
answers. Assuming that the world and life 
are not wholly irrational, what is the best we 
can say concerning the meaning of the 
earthly life? What is the goal of civilization? 
What is the danger of the American nation? 
What are the greatest needs of the indi- 
vidual manp 
The wisdom of the centuries has not 
been able to suggest a better meaning for 
the earthly life, than that it is a preliminary 
training in living itself. The goal of civili- 
zation, our sociologists tell us, is a rational, 
ethical democracy. Our political students 
insist that the foremost danger of the nation 
is the lack of the spirit of social service. 
The greatest needs of the individual man 
are always character, happiness and _ social 
efficiency. If these are even approximately
-P-A-G-E-25
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 13 
correct answers to our questions, then the 
deepest demands to be made upon an edu- 
cational system are that, so far as it may, it 
should give such wisdom in living as should 
insure character and happiness to the indi- 
vidual, and that spirit of social service that 
should make men efficient factors in bring- 
ing on the coming rational and_ ethical 
democracy. 
This requires that somewhere in our edu- 
cational system we should attack the problem 
of living itself and of social service in the 
broadest possible way, and in a way that is 
broader than is possible to either the ele- 
mentary or secondary school, though neither 
of these may legitimately shirk this task. 
Just this, then, 1s the function of the college: to 
teach in the broadest way the fine art of living, 
to give the best preparation that organized edu- 
cation can give for entering wisely and unselfishly 
into the complex personal relations of life, and for 
furthering unselfishly and efficiently social prog- 
ress. As distinguished from the other forms 
of education, it has no primary reference to 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  I4. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
the earning of a living, or to the perform- 
ance of some specific task; it faces the 
problem of living in a much broader and 
more thoroughgoing fashion; it does not 
specifically aim or expect to reach all, but 
seeks to train a comparatively small self- 
selected number who shall be the social 
leaven of the nation. 
If the task so set the college seems too 
large, let us remember not only that the ad- 
mitted individual and social goals require no 
less, but also that the outcome of the maturest 
thinking upon man and his relation to the 
world, indicates that the best anywhere can 
be attained only through such breadth of aim. 
For if we seek light from psychology, we are 
confronted at once with its insistence upon 
the complexity of life—the relatedness of all— 
and upon the unity of man. But these prin- 
ciples deny point-blank the wisdom of an 
education exclusively intellectual, and require 
rather, that, for the sake of the intellect itself, 
the rest of life and the rest of man be not 
ignored. Positively, they call for an educa-
-P-A-G-E-27
  
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 15 
tion that shall be broadly inclusive in its 
interests, and that shall appeal to the entire 
man. 
If we turn to sociology, we meet, if possible, 
an even stronger emphasis upon the com- 
plexity of life, and a clear demand that, back 
of whatever power the individual may have, 
there should lie the great convictions of the 
social consciousness, that imply the highest 
moral training, and set one face to face with 
the widest social and political questions. No 
narrow education can meet the sociological 
test. 
And if we ask for the evidence of pbhr- 
losophy, we have to note that its most charac- 
teristic positions today in metaphysics and 
theory of knowledge—its teleological view 
of essence, its insistence that the function of 
knowledge is transitional, and that the key to 
reality is the whole person—all refute a purely 
intellectual conception of education and logi- 
cally require a broader view of education than 
has anywhere commonly prevailed. 
And if as a Christian people, professing to
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
find our highest ideals in the CAristian relt- 
gion, we seek guidance from its goal—that all 
men should live as obedient sons of the 
Heavenly Father and as brothers one of 
another—we are face to face again with that 
problem of the complex world of personal 
relations, that cannot be solved except 
through the training of the entire man. 
In all these lines of psychological, socio- 
logical, philosophical and Christian thinking, 
our theories are right; our practice in edu- 
cation at best lags far behind. Every line of 
modern thinking is a fresh insistence upon 
the concrete complexity of life and upon the 
unity of man, and demands an education 
broad enough to meet both. Nothing justi- 
fies the common extraordinary emphasis on 
the intellectual as the one aim of education. 
It is not, then, by accident that we speak 
of the necessity of a liberal education. For 
let us notice that even on the intellectual 
side, the most valuable and vital qualities 
cannot be given by rule or by any narrow 
technique. The supreme demand is for what
-P-A-G-E-29
  
ee 
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 17 
we call sanity, Judgment, common sense, 
adaptability—all different names, perhaps, 
for the same thing, namely, ability to know 
whether a given case is to be treated accord- 
ing to general precedent—by appeal to a 
general principle—or decided upon its indi- 
vidual merits; to know whether our prob- 
lem is one of classification, or one of more 
thorough acquaintance with the particular. 
No rules or methods of procedure can make 
a reasoner or an investigator; for the vital 
point is to pick out of a new situation the 
exact element in it which is significant for 
the purpose in hand. The case cannot have 
been anticipated; the only help that educa- 
tion can give is through much practice in 
discrimination and assimilation, and through 
the bestowal of a wide circle of interests, 
esthetic and practical, even more than intel- 
lectual. Interpretive power is similarly con- 
ditioned, and calls for the richest life in the 
interpreter. Even the scientific spirit, then,— 
the most valuable gift of a scientific train- 
ing,—is not merely intellectual. Still less 
B
-P-A-G-E-30
18 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
are the historical spirit and the philosophical 
spirit intellectually conferred; they require 
at every turn the use of the key of the 
whole man. 
And we certainly have a right to ask of 
education that it bring men to appreciation 
of the great values of life—what else does 
- culture mean?—to esthetic taste and appre- 
ciation, to moral judgment and character, to 
the capacity for friendship, to religious ap- 
preciation and response. 
But if we have a right to demand from an 
educational system in any measure these qual- 
ities—judgment, adaptability, discernment, 
interpretive power, the scientific, historical 
and philosophical spirit, and the culture ade- 
quate to enter into the great spheres of value 
—esthetic, personal, moral and religious,—it 
is evident that they can be given only indi- 
rectly and through the most liberal training. 
Do they not lie, in the nature of the case, 
quite beyond the limits of elementary, sec- 
ondary, professional, or specialistic training, 
and constitute the great aims of college edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 19 
cation? Is there anything else likely to take 
the place of the college in performing this 
greatest educational work? 
It will hardly be contended by any, I 
judge, that technical or professional training, 
for the very reason that it does and must aim 
primarily at direct preparation for a particular 
calling, can give with any adequacy this 
indirect and liberal education. 
And it is difficult to believe that any one 
who has measured with seriousness the great- 
ness of the need of which we have just 
spoken, and the breadth of the education 
required to meet the need, will be able to 
think that the secondary school, even if ex- 
tended two years, is, or can be made, sufh- 
cient to the task. For, in the first place, it 
is only reasonable that our educational system 
should somewhere recognize the special sig- 
nificance of the transitional character of the 
period of later youth, and definitely provide 
for it. That period peculiarly needs the 
kind of separate training given by the col- 
lege, with its increased call for independent 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
action, and (as compared with the high 
school) its greater possibility of bringing all 
sides of the life of the student under some 
common and unified training. Is it too 
much to claim that the college, at its best, 
has proved an almost ideal transition from 
the stricter supervision of the secondary 
school to the complete individual liberty of 
the university proper? 
Moreover, it is quite wide of the mark to 
argue, as against the need of the college, that 
the high-school graduate of today has often 
done as much work in many lines as the 
college graduate of fifty years ago. That 
may be true, but the real question is this: Is 
he proportionally as well prepared to meet 
the complex demands of modern life, as the 
college graduate of the older time, the con- 
ditions of the much simpler life he con- 
fronted? The question, in other words, is 
not one of absolute attainment, but of pro- 
portional preparation for life; nor one of 
amount of knowledge merely, but of adaptive 
power. In education, we are least of all at 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 21 
liberty to ignore the increasing complexity 
of modern civilization. 
But the decisive reason, after all, why the 
secondary school cannot take the place of the 
college is this: that one has only to review 
the list of qualities required for the com- 
pletest training for living, to see that the 
deepest of the interests involved simply can- 
not be appreciated at the secondary school 
age, even if extended two years. I have no 
desire to underrate the attainments of the 
secondary school graduate, but I cannot for- 
get that the true scientific spirit, the historical 
spirit, the philosophical spirit, power of wise 
adaptation, and appreciation of the greatest 
spheres of value, are all plants of slow growth, 
and necessarily pre-suppose a certain maturity 
of mind. What does the whole principle of 
psychological adaptation in education mean 
but just this, that you cannot wisely over- 
hasten life’s own contribution? It seems to 
me too often forgotten, that the two later 
years, which it is sometimes proposed to cut 
off from the college course, are precisely the
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
years which, from the broader and deeper 
point of view, can least of all be spared. 
Generally speaking, you simply cannot make 
a philosopher of a sophomore. He has not 
lived enough. In like manner, the key to 
the greatest values of life is simply not yet 
held before the dawning, at least, of some 
real maturity. 
Nor do statistics as to age seem to me 
greatly to affect the problem. With an ad- 
vancing civilization, the period of youth for 
women certainly has been generally extended 
with real gain; probably it is wisely ex- 
tended for both men and women. In any 
case, I see no reason for believing that the 
average sophomore is relatively maturer to- 
day than his compeer of the earlier time. 
These considerations seem to me sufficient 
to show that we have no good reason to ex- 
pect the secondary school to take the place 
of the college. 
And we have still less reason to expect 
the university to take the place of the col- 
lege, unless college and university are re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 23 
garded as essentially interchangeable terms. 
If the university proper has any really dis- 
tinctive function, so far as I am able to see, 
that must be regarded as the training of the 
scientific specialist. I am quite ready to ad- 
mit, and to assert, that even the university 
cannot wisely ignore the claims of citizen- 
ship; but just because its primary aim is 
specific and limited, its recognition of these 
claims must be almost wholly incidental —in 
spirit and atmosphere rather than in its 
proper training. 
The university, then, properly so-called, 
cannot do the work of the college; first, be- 
cause its aim is distinctly and entirely intel- 
lectual; and, second, because it assumes, with 
some reason, that it is dealing with fully 
mature men, in whose case any imposition 
of conduct and ideals would be out of place, 
and this assumption accentuates still further 
its strictly intellectual aim. But besides this, 
in the very nature of the case, in its exclu- 
sive specialism, the university lacks, necessa- 
rily, the breadth of aim required in the full-
-P-A-G-E-36
24. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
est training for living, and quite fails to make 
its appeal to the entire man; and so shuts 
out both indispensable interests and indispen- 
sable training. Even on the purely intellec- 
tual side, for the very reason that it looks to 
specialism in each line, it is likely quite to 
lack those general courses that even the spe- 
cialist needs in other lines than his own. 
These three essential differences, then,—the 
purely intellectual aim, the assumption of the 
maturity of its students, and its exclusive 
specialism,—make the atmosphere of the 
university distinctly different from that of the 
college, and make it impossible that it should 
ever do the work of the older college. 
In fact, it is hardly too much to say that 
the greatest losses that college education has 
suffered are due to the fact that the attempt 
has been mistakenly made to carry over the 
spirit of the university into the college. As 
American educators awakened only slowly to 
the true conception of the university proper, 
and then, with the natural enthusiasm of a 
new-found ideal, exaggerated the value of
-P-A-G-E-37
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 25 
the university’s function, the college and uni- 
versity ideals were naturally confused, and the 
true college ideal almost lost in the process. 
Many circumstances have favored this ten- 
dency. The confusion was real and honest. 
Colleges were growing into. universities. 
Many changes in college education itself 
were necessary. But the greatest damage 
was done, simply because the colleges were 
cowardly in the face of unwise and ill- 
founded criticism made from the standpoint 
of the university, and were either ashamed 
to resist the exclusively intellectual trend, or 
lazily unwilling to keep the increasingly dif- 
ficult responsibility of the broader college 
training. 
As a natural consequence, many of our 
colleges and universities have presented the 
anomalous condition of being filled with stu- 
dents who claimed both the liberty of men 
and the irresponsibility of boys. Naturally, 
too, aside from sham universities, those col- 
leges have been in most danger in this re- 
spect of losing true college ideals, that have
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
been in closest connection with the univer- 
sity, especially where the same courses and 
instructors and methods and discipline and 
aims have served both college and uni- 
versity. Courses admirably adapted for the 
exclusive specialist may be quite unprofitable 
as the chief pabulum of a college course; 
and a method of treatment, not only justified, 
but almost demanded in dealing with really 
mature men, may be quite inadequate and 
unwarranted for the student whose ideals 
are in flux, and the appeal of whose entire 
personality no instructor has a right to ig- 
nore. “Is not the life more than meat? and 
the body than raiment?” The college needs 
much more than a highly trained specialist 
in the teacher’s chair; it can never spare, 
without disastrous loss, the close personal 
touch of mature men of marked interest in 
the wide range of the life of others, and 
with character-begetting power. And it can- 
not spare a real training that is far more 
than intellectual. Indeed, if I understand 
President Butler aright, in his tentative sug-
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 27 
gestion of halving the college course, it is 
exactly the state of the universitized college 
that has made him regard the halving of its 
course as no great disaster. The suggestion 
would seem warranted, however, only if we 
must regard the cause of the college as 
already lost, and count it hopeless that 
either educators or the public should be 
again awakened to the priceless value of the 
work of the true college. 
Nor do I believe that, with whatever 
losses, the college has quite failed to give 
the liberal training required. Many a col- 
lege teacher can confirm from his own re- 
peated observation President Wilson’s words: 
“Raw lads are made men of by the mere 
sweep of their lives through the various 
schools of experience. It is this very sweep 
of life that we wish to bring to the con- 
sciousness of young men by the shorter pro- 
cesses of the college. We have seen the 
adaptation take place; we have seen crude 
boys made fit in four years to become men 
of the world.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Mistakes, no doubt, have been made, 
serious losses sustained, and there are grave 
dangers to be guarded against in all our 
colleges. The utilities have been over-insist- 
ent; the aim has been too merely intellec- 
tual; specialism has claimed too much; the 
standpoint and method of the university 
have prevailed to an extent quite beyond 
reasonable defense; and, in consequence, at 
multiplied places the rights of the entire 
personality have been ignored. 
But, on the other hand, no mere reaction 
to the older college is either desirable or 
possible. Men came to see that they were 
in a new world that required for wise and 
fruitful living a broader curriculum than the 
older college ever afforded. A change here 
was inevitable. 
So, too, it can hardly be doubted that 
there was needed greater emphasis on a 
close and living and practical relation to the 
actual world; fuller recognition of the 
meaning of hard, honest, intellectual work, 
and of the sound psychological basis of the 
f
-P-A-G-E-41
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 29 
laboratory and seminar methods; a better 
adaptation to differing individuals; and, for 
the very sake of greater power in the more 
general courses, a real approach to some- 
thing like specialism in at least one line of 
study. In all these important respects, the 
changes toward the newer college have 
been not only practically justified but 
thoroughly right. 
Now, is it possible to combine the gains 
of the new with the indisputable advantages 
of the old? What changes in the present 
situation are demanded, if the true function 
of the college is to be completely fulfilled? 
The present lack seems to me plainly to lie 
in the comparative neglect of the entire 
personality. How are these needs of the 
complete personality to be met in education? 
What are the means and what is the spirit 
required P 
The direct study of human nature in its 
constitution and in the relations of society 
ought to enable one to answer these ques- 
tions with some precision. In other words, 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
30 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
if college education has really the broad 
function that has been ascribed to it, it 
ought to be able to meet a psychological 
and sociological test. Modern psychology— 
with what seems to me its preéminent four- 
fold insistence, upon the complexity of life, 
the unity of man, the central importance of 
will and action, and the concreteness of the 
real, involving a personal and a social em- 
phasis—has its clear suggestions. And mod- 
ern sociology, too, with its demand for a 
social consciousness that shall be character- 
ized by the threefold conviction of the 
essential likeness of men, of the mutual in- 
fluence of men, and of the value and sacred- 
ness of the person, has its definite counsel. 
The proper fulfilment of the function of 
the college, this seems to indicate, requires 
as its great means, first, a life sufficiently 
complex to give acquaintance with the great 
fundamental facts of the world, and to call 
out the entire man; second, the completest 
possible expressive activity on the part of 
the student; and, third, personal association
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 31 
with broad and wise and noble lives. And 
the corresponding spirit demanded in college 
education must be, first, broad and catholic 
in both senses,—as responding to a wide 
range of interests, and looking to the all- 
round development of the individual; sec- 
ond, objective rather than self-centered and 
introspective; and, third, imbued with the 
fundamental convictions of the social con- 
sciousness. These are always the greatest and 
the alone indispensable means and conditions 
in a complete education, and they contain 
in themselves the great sources of character, 
of happiness, and of social efficiency. The 
supreme opportunity, in other words, that a col- 
lege education should offer, is opportunity to use 
one’s full powers in a wisely chosen complex 
environment, in association with the best ;—and 
all this in an atmosphere, catholic in tts interests, 
objective in spirit and method, and democratic, 
unselfish and finely reverent in its personal 
relations. Such an ideal definitely combines 
the best of both the older and the newer 
college. And the colleges that most com-
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
pletely fulfil this ideal have, I judge, a work 
which is beyond price, and without possible 
substitute. 
Before passing to the discussion of the 
means and spirit demanded in a true college 
education, a word further concerning the 
relation of the college to the professional 
training seems desirable. In this whole 
problem of the possible shortening of the 
college course for the sake of students look- 
ing to professional studies, several things 
need to be kept closely in mind if confusion 
is to be avoided. 
In the first place, if the professional 
course is a full rigorous four-year course, 
this ought to mean, and usually does mean, 
that it has been laid out on somewhat broad 
and liberal lines, and not with reference to 
mere narrow technique. And the student 
who is to continue his study through such 
a course can more easily afford to abridge 
the time given to the two courses. 
This same broadening of the professional 
course, moreover, makes possible an entirely
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 33 
legitimate adjustment to the coming profes- 
sional study on the part of the college. In 
every broadly planned professional course of 
four years, there is quite certain to be at 
least a year of work of so liberal a charac- 
ter that it may be justly counted toward 
both the college and the professional degree. 
And the colleges which can offer such work 
of first quality for the different professions 
can meet squarely and strongly every legiti- 
mate demand for abridging the entire period 
of study and can then, in all probability, in 
the great majority of cases, render a better 
service to the student himself, to the profes- 
sional school, and to society, by retaining 
the student in the atmosphere of the college 
through his full four years. 
It is further to be noted that, in any case, 
this reason for shortening college courses 
holds only for such professional students. 
For the majority of college students, includ- 
ing almost all the women, such shortening is 
not called for; and would be only a calamity. 
Even the smallest real colleges, therefore, 
c
-P-A-G-E-46
34 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
that can do very little in the way of adjust- 
ment to professional courses, and that may 
have to lose many, perhaps most, of those 
looking to professional work, would still have 
their former most important service to render 
for the majority of their students. 
Moreover, it seems to me wholly probable 
that a good proportion of the very ablest and 
clearest-sighted of those going into the pro- 
fessions will still choose not to deprive them- 
selves of the very best the college can give 
them, and will therefore prefer not to spe- 
cialize in college in precisely those subjects to 
which the larger part of all their later study, 
in any case, must be devoted. And, through 
specialization in other lines, such exceptional 
students will look forward confidently to a 
larger life and a higher professional success 
than could otherwise come to them. These 
wisest students will certainly not wish to sac- 
rifice acquaintance with the natural great 
broad human subjects of the last year in col- 
lege to professional specialization. And even 
those students who feel compelled to abridge 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 35 
their entire period of study, if they are wise, 
will so scatter their preliminary professional 
study through their college course, as to in- 
sure that at least a part of their maturest time 
in college may be given to those great sub- 
jects, like philosophy, that require some real 
maturity of mind to be most profitably taken. 
I do not believe that the proper demands of - 
both liberal and professional training can be 
met where it is attempted to cover both 
courses in six years. Even where the requi- 
site subjects are all covered by brilliant stu- 
dents the value of the outcome may well be 
doubted. The work is likely to be done 
under such a sense of hurry and pressure as 
quite to preclude results of the highest kind. 
Haste is nowhere more certainly waste than 
in education. For it is not to be forgotten 
that it is time, and some real sense of leisure 
and opportunity to take in the full signi- 
ficance of one’s studies and to knit them 
up with the rest of one’s thinking and livy- 
ing—it is just these things that distinguish 
real education from cramming. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    36 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
II. THE GREAT MEANS IN COLLEGE EDUCATION 
1. A Complex Life.—And, first, the college 
must furnish a life sufficiently complex to 
insure to the student a wide circle of in- 
terests, and to call out his entire personality. 
Aside from its psychological basis, justifi- 
cation for this prime emphasis on breadth in 
college education is everywhere at hand. For 
philosophy has practically to recognize, even 
when it does not theoretically and directly 
assert, that “to be is to be in relations.” 
Science cannot forget that, as the scale of life 
rises, there must be correspondence to a more 
complex environment. The _ philosophical 
historian finds the main safeguard against the 
retrogression of the race in an increasing self- 
control, due to the steady pressure of great 
and many-sided objective forces organized 
in institutions, laws, customs and education. 
The supreme educational counsel and the 
secret of full mental wakefulness both seem 
often to be found in concentration upon re- 
lations. Our follies usually go back to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 37 
ignoring of some relation or other of the 
matter in hand. And it is not difficult to 
show that our world, our experience, our 
sanity, our freedom and our influence,—all 
depend in no small degree on the largeness 
of our circle of interests; while simple un- 
derstanding of our complex modern civi- 
lization alone requires great breadth in 
training. 
It cannot be denied that such breadth of 
education is attended by serious dangers of 
over-sophistication and pessimism through 
loss of convictions and ideals. And yet the 
breadth is to be welcomed; for the remedy 
is not in less breadth, but in more breadth. 
For breadth certainly does not mean the nar- 
rowness of ignoring the results of experience. 
It is a false liberality that treats with equal 
respect exploded and verified hypotheses. 
The entire lack of prejudice upon which 
some so pride themselves is curiously akin 
to stupid and obstinate folly. Some things 
have been proved in the history of the race. 
Nor does breadth mean the abandonment
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of all discrimination in values—putting all 
values on a dead level. It is a strange re- 
versal of scientific estimates, that turns unsci- 
entific lack of discrimination into science’s 
broad openness to light. There are many 
points of view, but they are not therefore all 
of equal importance. The noble virtue of 
tolerance is not possible to such cheap and 
easy indifferentism. Only the man of con- 
victions and ideals, with a strong sense of the 
difference of values, can be tolerant, for only 
he cares. The view of any single individual 
is no doubt limited; but the point of view 
which results from the gradual and careful 
cancellation of the limitations of many minds, 
is.more than an individual view. 
Nor, once more, does breadth mean a nar- 
row intellectualism, for, if we can trust the 
indications of our intellect, we ought to be 
able to trust the indications of the rest of our 
nature ; and, in any case, the only possible key 
and standard of truth and reality are in our- 
selves—the whole self—and the so-called “ne- 
cessities of thought” become, thus, necessities 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 39 
of a reason which means loyally to take 
account of all the data of the entire man. 
Obviously, then, no attempt at mere re- 
action to simpler conditions will avail in ed- 
ucation. Indeed, we cannot return to them 
if we would; though the temptation to do 
so is often real enough. But, even if the 
return were possible, it would mean nothing 
less than a declaration that our Christian 
ideals cannot conquer a complex situation. 
This would be really to give up the whole 
battle; for we have not only found reason 
fully to justify the greatest breadth on gen- 
eral grounds, but the ideal interests them- 
selves suffer from any spirit of exclusiveness. 
Human nature certainly avenges itself for 
any attempted disregard of the wide range 
of its interests; and, in truth, the denial of 
legitimate worldly interests only limits the 
possible sphere of morality and religion. It 
is for just this reason that the separation of the 
sacred and the secular is the heresy of here- 
sies. The simplicity to be sought lies—not 
in environment— but in a spirit that, having
-P-A-G-E-52
40 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
great convictions and great ideals, clearly 
discriminates the greater from the less, and 
unhesitatingly subordinates all relative goods. 
This insures that singleness of aim that makes 
the genuinely simple and transparent life. 
It is a spirit that can recognize the full value 
of the material in its place, but, with the 
clear vision that “a man’s life consisteth not 
in the abundance of the things which he 
possesseth,” will not allow itself to be ab- 
sorbed in the “passion for material comfort.” 
The simplicity of high ideals, consistently and 
resolutely pursued, is possible to any college 
in the very midst of the most varied interests. 
And only such a simplicity can conquer in 
the end. 
The college, of course, must meet these 
demands for breadth of training by the wide 
range of its studies and of its interests. In 
its studies it aims to let the student share in 
the world’s best inheritance in each of the 
great realms of human thinking. I need not re- 
peat the often-given argument for the differ- 
ent studies to be recognized in a liberal train-
-P-A-G-E-53
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 4!I 
ing. It will include the older and the newer 
studies, mathematics, ancient and modern 
languages and literatures, natural science, 
history, economics and sociology, philosophy 
and physical training. And it seems to me 
hardly open to question that it ought to 
provide courses that shall prove valuable 
introductions to the intelligent appreciation 
of music and of art, as well as of literature. 
These studies will represent all the great 
classes of facts in the midst of which every 
man must live, and afford the full range of 
fundamental educational values. But liberal 
training need not mean necessarily, I think, 
large numbers of greatly detailed courses; 
nor for any one man acquaintance with all 
branches of natural science. The scientific 
spirit it must give, with the involved some- 
what thorough knowledge of at least one 
science. The study of material objects has 
great advantages for the scientific spirit and 
method; but we are not at liberty to forget 
that our primary relation in /ife is, never- 
theless, not to things but to persons.
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
But, in any case, the interests of the college 
must be wider than the curriculum. It is 
only a part of our excessive intellectualism 
that it is so often assumed that the curriculum 
makes the college. Some of the most impor- 
tant interests in a liberal education can be 
best met only indirectly. Surroundings, or- 
ganization, discipline and atmosphere may 
here count for more than definite instruction. 
We have the needs of the entire man—phys- 
ical, intellectual, esthetic, social, moral and 
religious—to meet in a truly liberal education. 
The intellectual needs can doubtless be met 
more easily and directly in the curriculum 
than any of the others; but none of them 
may be ignored without serious loss. 
Physical education makes its rightful claim 
upon the college. The college must not only 
talk about the sound mind in the sound body, 
but do something really to secure that sound 
body for its students. It must not only thor- 
oughly recognize in its psychological teaching 
the intimate way in which body and mind are 
knit up together, the physical basis of habit,
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 43 
the critical importance of surplus nervous 
energy, the influence of physical training 
upon the brain centers, and the close connec- 
tion of the will with muscular activity; but, 
if it really believes these things, it must 
practically recognize them in the organization 
of its work. This means, not only, that there 
must be scrupulous care about sanitary con- 
ditions, careful supervision of the health of 
students by thoroughly trained physicians, and 
general hygienic instruction, but such scien- 
tifically planned and graded courses in physi- 
cal training as shall deserve to count as real 
education on the same basis as laboratory 
courses. Unless our modern psychology is 
wholly wrong, such physical education that 
can be applied to all students has a great 
contribution to make, not only in health and 
in the systematic development of the body, 
but intellectually and volitionally as well. 
If athletics are to make their true contri- 
bution to the college life—and a most valuable 
contribution that may be—a wide range of 
sports must be encouraged that shall enlist 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
a great portion of the students, and not 
merely a small number of specially athletic 
men; and the spirit of genuine play must 
be brought back into all college so-called 
sports. They have their most valuable office, 
it should never be forgotten, not as serious 
business or money-making enterprises, but 
simply as play. A relative good becomes a 
serious evil when it is allowed to overtop 
greater values; but zm its place it contributes 
to the sanity and health of all other interests. 
Such a contribution, I have no doubt, ath- 
letics have it in their power to make, and toa 
considerable extent do make even now; and 
physical education, as a whole, demands 
greater attention from the college. 
The universally recognized demand of the 
intellectual in college education needs no 
argument. 
The fact that man is as truly an aesthetic 
being as physical and intellectual, the col- 
lege has less often sufficiently recognized. 
But if it is the mission of a liberal training 
to produce the man of culture, it can hardly
-P-A-G-E-57
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 45 
refuse to furnish, in some form, ability to 
appreciate the great esthetic realms of litera- 
ture, music and art. What it already does 
in large measure for literature, it ought also 
to do for music and art. We must not forget 
the kinship of the esthetic with the still 
higher values, and its own large contribution 
to the sanity and happiness of life. The col- 
lege cannot wisely ignore this need of man. 
Doubtless, the real need cannot be fully nor 
perhaps chiefly met in courses or in their 
equipment. The college needs to be able 
to put its students to such extent as is pos- 
sible in the presence of the best in these 
realms, and to permeate the common life of 
each student with something of the beautiful. 
It is no small service which is so rendered. 
Music has certain great advantages in this 
respect, especially in a coeducational insti- 
tution. 
And certainly, unless one denies the legiti- 
macy of the very aim—social efiiciency—with 
which either the State or the Church enters 
upon the work of education at all, the place
-P-A-G-E-58
    46 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of the social and moral in college education 
cannot be questioned. Men may differ as to 
the best way of meeting these needs; they 
can hardly differ as to their imperative claim 
upon any education that is to be called lib- 
eral. No let-alone policy here is enough. 
The moral in its broadest scope should be a 
clearly recognized part of college education— 
to be most wisely and considerately done, no 
doubt, with all possible recognition of the 
moral initiative of the pupil—but to be done, 
nevertheless. Much talk upon this point 
seems to make the most singular assumption 
that the only real necessity in that finest and 
most delicate of all worlds, the world of per- 
sonal relations, is moral backbone; and that 
a situation that tends to develop that is doing 
all that can be asked for moral education. 
But what of aims and ideals and wisest means 
in all this? What of that sensitive moral 
judgment, and creative imagination, and deep 
sense of the meaning of life, without which 
no high moral attainment can be made? 
What right have we indifferently to let things
-P-A-G-E-59
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 47 
take their course here? This is nothing less 
than to give the student a shove downward; 
for other influences do not keep their hands 
off in the meantime. What else is the object 
of education but to make a man all around 
a better man than he would have otherwise 
naturally become? 
And, once more, unless one is ready to 
deny altogether the value of the function of 
religion in the life of men, the re/igzous need 
also deserves recognition in some way in any 
education that is to be called complete. Any 
ideal view of life, such as a broad education 
must itself assume, virtually implies a faith in 
the rationality of the world which is practi- 
cally religious. It is shallow thinking that im- 
agines that religious faith is a matter of small 
concern, and easily to be set aside. If, as 
Emerson tells us, any high friendship transfig- 
ures the world for us, certainly there is no 
such contributor to peace and joy as a real 
faith in God. And ethical earnestness and so- 
cial efficiency, no less than happiness, surely 
find their strongest support in a religious 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
faith. Why should the man of ethical earnest- 
ness believe that he is more in earnest to be 
honest and kind than the Source of all whence 
he has come? Is man indeed himself the High- 
est? And what rational defense has any man 
for the enthusiasm with which he throws him- 
self, either into his own calling, or into work 
for social progress, who cannot believe that in 
both he is working in line with the eternal 
forces, and that a plan greater than his own 
encircles all his plans and makes effective all 
the bits of his striving? None of us are going 
seriously and enthusiastically to attempt to dip 
out the ocean with a cup. And if we really 
believe in the value of our calling, or of our 
own social endeavor, whether we recognize 
it or not, our belief is at bottom a genuinely 
religious faith. Man is inevitably a religious 
being. For this very reason, too, a peculiar 
responsibility is laid upon education. For this 
means that some kind of religious life and 
thought every man is bound to have; the only 
question is, whether that religious life and 
thought shall be well considered and adequate.
-P-A-G-E-61
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 49 
Either the function of religion is much less 
than the great majority of the more thought- 
ful of mankind have always thought, or the 
religious need of men deserves to be met in 
education without apology and with an effec- 
tiveness seldom found. It concerns a people 
to know whether its educational system is 
helping to an intelligent and genuine relig- 
ious life. So great a need as this will not take 
care of itself. Where is it being adequately 
met today? Few things are more discourag- 
ing than the large amount of surprisingly un- 
intelligent Christianity in supposedly educated 
men. How many of our college graduates 
have really awakened, for example, to the 
significance of the serious self-limitation of 
philosophy in its setting outside its field the 
great facts of Christian history? 
It is a chief aim of a liberal education—is 
it not?—to bring a man to true culture—to 
ability to enter into all values with apprecia- 
tion and conviction. And all values—all the 
marvelous content of literature and music and 
art—we may not forget, are but the revelation 
D
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of the riches of some personal life. All values 
go back ultimately to persons. And the 
highest achievement of culture is the under- 
standing and appreciation of the great per- 
sonalities. And the Christian religion, there- 
fore, makes its rightful appeal to the truly 
cultivated man in the transcendent person of 
its Founder. May not the college be asked 
to send out men sufficiently cultured to be 
able to appreciate that transcendent person 
of history? 
Doubtless, in many of our institutions the 
use of anything like definite religious in- 
struction and motive by the institution itself 
is necessarily excluded. Even so, it means a 
limitation in the education, which is to be 
made good so far as possible by other agen- 
cies. The necessity of these situations is, 
however, by no means to be made into a 
prescription for all others. And the teacher 
may well rejoice who, in the midst of: his 
teaching, is free to give utterance to his 
deepest and most significant convictions. 
In general, those colleges will best meet 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 5I 
the demands for breadth of education, that 
are most free and best organized to meet 
the entire range of human interests. The 
advantage here lies in part with the larger 
and in part with the smaller institutions. 
In all cases, with whatever inevitable limi- 
tations of situation, it must at least be de- 
manded that the spirit pervading the college 
should be heartily, though discriminatingly, 
catholic. There should be, certainly, no 
vaunting of our limitations. And this dis- 
criminating breadth of view, it should be 
noticed, in its recognition of the complexity 
of life, and of the unity of man, if truly in- 
terpreted, itself affords moral support; for it 
furnishes a motive against mere impulse, and 
helps directly to that deliberation which is 
the secret of self-control; and, because it 
believes that all life is so knit up together, 
is also strenuous counsel against deteriora- 
tion at any point. 
Beyond this breadth in interest and ap- 
peal, the great reliance of an education that 
is to meet the needs of the entire man must 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 PERSONAL AND IDEAL EELMENTS IN EDUCATION 
be, as we have seen, upon making all pos- 
sible use of expressive activity on the part 
of the student, and of personal association. 
2. Expressive Activityx—And, first, if the 
“voluntaristic trend” in modern psychology 
has any justification, if in body and mind we 
are really made for action, if for the very sake 
of thought and feeling we must act, then 
any soundly based education must every- 
where make much of the will and of action, 
must in all departments of its training of 
the individual—physical, intellectual, esthetic, 
social, moral and religious—specifically seek 
expressive activity. 
This goes without saying in physical edu- 
cation, and it is just at that point that 
physical education has its greatest contribution 
to make to all other training. And the edu- 
cational value of earning one’s way in college 
is not to be overlooked just here. It is easy 
to overdo the amount of direct financial aid 
to students. It is not the ministry alone, as 
seems often gratuitously assumed, that suf- 
fers in this respect. In spite of the tempta- 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 53 
tion of a short-sighted competition that sets 
colleges to bidding against one another for 
students, it remains true that no college that 
aims at the highest results can afford to ig- 
nore social axioms in giving its beneficiary 
aid. Care by the college in providing op- 
portunities for self-help is the very best 
form of aid. For such aid does not pauper- 
ize, but calls out useful active service from 
the student himself. But the possibilities of 
development in this direction depend very 
largely on the fidelity of students. Each stu- 
dent generation holds a trust in this respect 
for the next generation. 
The principle has already been widely 
recognized in infe/lectual training in many 
of the changes of the newer education—in 
the introduction of laboratory and seminar 
methods, and in the extension of these 
methods so far as possible to all subjects of 
study, and specifically in the revolution of the 
teaching of English composition. But this 
principle of the fundamental need of expres- 
sive activity deserves ever-widening recogni- 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
tion, as a real guiding principle even in 
intellectual teaching. The pupil’s own ac- 
tivity is to be called out at-every point; the 
fullest, clearest and most accurate expression 
of his thought in speech, in writing, and, 
wherever possible, in action, is to be sought. 
Even our ideas are not ours until we have 
expressed them, and they are more perfectly 
ours, the more perfect the expression. The 
old-fashioned recitation, when well con- 
ducted, had a real ground of justification, 
and no lecturing by the teacher can fully 
replace it. | 
In a@sthetic education the same principle 
holds. Some actual attainment in each of 
the arts is no doubt a real aid to intelligent 
appreciation. And no art lends itself more 
easily than music to such attainment, even 
quite outside the work of the regular cur- 
riculum. No doubt the main dependence in 
this matter of esthetic education must be 
upon the molding influence of the best in 
these realms, so far as the college can tur- 
nish this. To a considerable extent this is
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 55 
possible in all the arts, if the necessary 
means are granted. But if these influences 
are to do their full work, it should be noted, 
there must be some real response on the 
part of the student, made possible directly 
through courses intended to introduce to the 
arts, and indirectly through the less system- 
atic but not less stimulating suggestion of a 
wide-spread interest in the atmosphere of 
_ the college. 
And esthetic education has not done its 
full work until it has brought the student to 
the recognition of the demands of the beau- 
tiful in all his work and in all his surround- 
ings, and to the cherishing, as a perma- 
nent aim, of the ideal expression of the 
ideal life. 
But it is in the realms of the soctal, 
moral and religious that expressive activity 
is most imperatively demanded. If men are 
to be saved from mere passive sentimentalism, 
they must put their desires, aspirations and 
ideals into act. The very employment of the 
student in bringing him continually face to 
i
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
face with noble sentiments, peculiarly sub- 
jects him to this danger. That which is not 
expressed dies. A man can be best prepared 
for moral earnestness, social efficiency and 
a genuine religious response in life only 
through active expression in each of these 
spheres. Men are best trained for society by 
acting in society, for the responsibilities of a 
democracy by taking their part in a really 
democratic community, for the best fulfilment 
of personal relations by honest answer to the 
varied personal demands—human and divine. 
The student life should not be a hermit nor 
cloistered nor exclusive life. The more nat- 
ural and normal the personal relations, both 
to men and women, in the midst of which 
the student lives, the better the preparation 
for the actual life that awaits him. And let 
his relations to the community life, civic 
and religious, so far as possible, be those of 
an ordinary law-abiding citizen, and let him 
act as such a citizen, so far as such action 
is open to him. 
Wherever the college calls for the attain-
-P-A-G-E-69
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 57 
ment of definite ends, wherever it sets tasks 
to be faithfully done at given times, wherever 
it calls out the will of the student in the larger 
liberty its life affords him, it is doing some- 
thing for the development of his moral and 
religious character. But its responsibility can- 
not end with these means. The atmosphere 
of a college should be such as to enlist the 
enthusiasm of the students in valuable causes 
—and there are a great variety of them—in 
which they may already have some share. 
The naturally self-cen‘ered life of the student 
peculiarly needs such enlistment in objective 
causes. In the midst of a life permeated with 
a democratic, unselfish and reverent spirit, 
he should find increasingly such a spirit called 
out from him. Living in personal relations 
which may well be among the closest and 
richest of his life, he is to learn the capacity 
for friendship in the only way it can be 
learned, through some form of actual useful 
service. So far as college traditions are in 
conflict with such an ideal, they lag behind 
any really Christian civilization. Certainly the
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
college should itself afford the best opportu- 
nities for the students’ own initiative and 
expression in both the moral and religious 
life. And as—apart from personal association 
—it can best help the moral life by an at- 
mosphere permeated with the convictions of 
the social consciousness, so it can best help 
the religious life by making dominant a con- 
ception of religion that shall make it real 
and rational and vital for the mind that really 
gives it attention. By such a conception, the 
student’s own response is most naturally 
called out. 
3. Personal Association.—But it is called 
out even so, not so much by the teaching as 
by the spirit of the men back of the teach- 
ing. And we are thus brought to the greatest 
of all the means available in an all-round 
education—personal association—already nec- 
essarily anticipated in part. I make no doubt 
that the prime factors in a complete educa- 
tion are always persons, not things, not even 
books. It would not be difficult to show 
how powerful is personal association in all
-P-A-G-E-71
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 59 
the lines of education, even in scientific © 
work; but it is, of course, most indispensable 
in moral and religious training. 
The inevitable interactions of the members 
of a cosmopolitan student body are them- 
selves of the greatest intrinsic value. The 
great fundamental social convictions—of the 
likeness of men, of the mutual influence of 
men, of the sacredness of the person—are 
developed in a true college life almost per- 
force. And the more genuinely democratic 
the college, the more certain is its ability to 
make socially efficient citizens. For the sake 
of its own highest mission, it can afford to 
stand against the aristocracy of sex, against 
the aristocracy of color, against the aristoc- 
racy of wealth, against the aristocracy of the 
clique, against the aristocracy of mere intel- 
lectual brilliancy. And it can safely carry 
this democratic spirit very far into all its 
organization and working. 
Beyond these inevitable social interactions 
of the college life, it isa great thing for the 
development of a man to be surprised into
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
really unselfish friendships. And the college, 
by its great community of interests and its 
natural atmosphere of trust, has peculiar 
power in bringing about just such unselfish 
friendships. The contribution which it so 
makes not only to character but also to 
happiness, the college man knows well. 
But either in morals or in religion we 
know but one royal road to the highest life 
—through personal association with those 
who possess such a life as we ought to have, 
to whom we can look in admiration and love, 
and who give themselves unstintedly to us. 
There is no cheaper way. Even so high a 
service is often rendered to one student by 
another student; but it is a wholly just de- 
mand to make upon a college that that ser- 
vice should be rendered in preeminent degree 
by its teachers. Whatever may be true in 
other parts of the educational system, the 
college teacher must be one from whom the 
highest living can be readily caught. In the 
interests of simple honesty, the college 
teacher must be thoroughly prepared to teach
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 61 
what he professes to teach. We cannot begin 
in character-making with a fraud. And for 
the same reasons, professing to teach he 
should be able to teach. He must have sanity, 
too, and tact—real wisdom, for the insights of 
only such a man will be sure to count with 
others. And, as a man who must stand as a 
convincing witness for the best, he cannot 
be excused from the requisites of the effec- 
tive witness—undoubted character and con- 
viction, genuine interest in the deepest life 
of others, and that power in putting the 
great things home that should belong to his 
teaching ability. His highest qualification is 
character-begetting _power—power to inspire 
other men to their absolute best. When one 
tries to measure the power of even one or 
two such men in a college community, he 
begins to see at last what the one indispen- 
sable factor in a college is, and how much is 
at stake in the choice of a faculty. 
Nothing, let us be sure, so certainly brings 
about the deterioration of the college as care- 
lessness in the selection of its teachers. A few
-P-A-G-E-74
62 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
compromising appointments here may easily 
make impossible the maintenance of the col- 
lege’s highest ideals or best traditions. ‘The 
spirit of a college cannot go down in its build- 
ings or grounds or forms of organization. 
Even on the intellectual side of the college, 
the supreme factors are persons, never things 
or machinery; how much more when we are 
thinking of the whole man. If a college’s 
best continues at all and grows, it must con- 
tinue and grow in persons; and the petty 
and ignoble cannot carry on the work of the 
great and worthy. 
We seem to be in the midst of a great 
awakening to the overweighting importance 
of moral and religious education, and the 
movement comes none too soon; but let us 
not for a moment imagine that any change 
in courses or methods or organization can 
ever take the place of the one great indis- 
pensable means—the personal touch of great 
and high personalities. And if they are not 
found in our colleges, where may they be 
sought?
-P-A-G-E-75
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 63 
III. THE REQUISITE SPIRIT IN COLLEGE EDUCATION 
And when one turns to characterize the 
spirit of the true college he must parallel, as 
we have seen, the great means of a complex 
life, of expressive activity, and of personal 
association, with the demand for a spirit— 
heartily but discriminatingly catholic, thor- 
oughly objective, and marked by the great 
convictions of the social consciousness. In 
the discussion of the means, the spirit needed 
has been in no small part implied. I certainly 
need not say more concerning the catholicity 
that must unmistakably mark the true college. 
But it does deserve to be emphasized that, 
if psychology’s insistence upon the impor- 
tance of action is at all justified, then our nor- 
mal mood, the mood of the best work, of the 
best associations, and of happiness itself, is the 
objective mood. ‘The great means in education, 
of using one’s powers in an interesting and 
complex environment, even for the very sake 
of the ideal, itself demands the mood of 
work. And this needs to be particularly re-
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
membered in moral and religious training. 
The student life, in any case, is quite too 
prone to be self-centered, and therefore needs 
all the more the objective emphasis. But aside 
from this peculiar need of the student life, 
the introspective mood itself has a smaller 
contribution to make to the moral and reli- 
gious life than has been commonly assumed. 
Just so much introspection is needed as to 
make sure that one has put himself in the 
presence of the great objective forces that 
lead to character and to God. When this is 
determined, the work of introspection is prac- 
tically done. The dominant mood should be 
objective through and through. 
And one chief and good cause of reaction, 
no doubt, from some of the older methods of 
moral and religious training in college, has 
been the lack of this objective spirit. This 
does not mean any underestimation of the sig- 
nificance of personal religion, but a whole- 
some sense that no man may come into right 
personal relations with God without sharing 
the life of God; and that life is love; and love
-P-A-G-E-77
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 65 
cannot be cultivated in selfishness and self- 
absorption. 
But if the college looks preéminently to 
social efficiency, and if its greatest means is 
personal association, its spirit must be, above 
all, permeated with the great convictions of 
the soczal consciousness. Nowhere should the 
atmosphere be more genuinely and _thor- 
oughly democratic, charged with the strong 
sense of the likeness of men in the great 
essentials; nowhere a more evident setting 
aside of all artificial and merely conventional 
standards in the estimate of men. No small 
part of the value of the college education lies 
in bringing a man steadily to the test of the 
worth of his naked personality. And when 
convention rules, the very life of the college 
has gone out. 
And the college must add to its demo- 
cratic spirit the spirit of responsibility and 
service. Its life must be permeated with the 
conviction that men are inevitably members 
one of another, and that responsibility for 
others, therefore, is inescapable; that, more- 
E
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
over, much of the best of life comes through 
this knitting up with humanity in many-sided 
personal relations, and, in consequence, this 
mutual influence of men is not merely inevi- 
table, but desirable and indispensable. Surely, 
a true cosmopolitan college must be able to 
send out men marked by the sense of respon- 
sibility and of the obligation of service. 
But no high development is possible in 
personal friendship or in society without a 
deep sense of the value and sacredness of the 
person. What even the golden rule really 
demands of a man, depends upon his sense of 
the significance of life, of the value of his own 
personality. And if even the sense of the like- 
ness and of the mutual influence of men is to 
bear satisfying fruit, it must be informed 
throughout by reverent regard for the liberty 
and the person of others. 
And nowhere is this reverence for the per- 
son more needed than in moral and religious 
education. For the very aim of such educa- 
tion is to bring a man to a faith and a life of 
his own. This requires at every point the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
    THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 67 
careful guarding of the other’s liberty, the 
calling out everywhere of his own initiative. 
There can be, therefore, in the nature of the 
case, no mere impositioa upon another of any 
genuine moral and religious life. And more 
than this is true. What you will do, what you 
can do for another, will be measured by your 
sense of his value. If men are for you mere 
creatures of a day with but meager possibili- 
ties, nothing can call out from you the largest 
service in their behalf. Nor is this all. With 
the sense of the value, the preciousness of the 
person, comes a genuine reverence, that not 
only sacredly guards the other’s moral initia- 
tive, but understands that the inner life of 
another is rightly inviolate; that in any high 
friendship, nay, in any true personal relation, 
there can be only request, never demand. 
The highest man stands with Christ at the 
door of the heart of the other, only knocking 
that he may come in by the other’s full 
consent alone. 
And, if the college is to grapple in any 
effective way with moral and religious educa-   
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
tion, it must, beyond all else, have a spirit 
instinct with such reverence for the person. 
On this very account, indirect methods here 
may be really more effective than direct 
methods. Some wise instruction undoubt- 
edly is desirable, and even imperative, but 
it must be given by men who have.a delicate 
sense of what personality means; and the 
spirit that pervades the college is here more 
effective even than the instruction; and it 
would not be difficult to overdo definite 
instruction in this field. Character and 
religion are always rather caught than taught. 
I cannot doubt, then, that a second impor- 
tant reason for reaction from the older college 
in its moral and religious education has been 
because it too often forgot the supreme need 
of reverence for the person of the pupil. 
The disrepute into which the so-called “pa- 
ternal” methods have fallen implies as much. 
But is it not worth our while to remember 
that the name—paternal—is falsely given in 
such a case? The highest characteristic of 
the true father is a deep sense of the value
-P-A-G-E-81
THE PRIMACY OF THE PERSON 69 
and sacredness of the person of his child, 
not the desire to dominate. And no moral 
and religious education worthy of the name 
is possible in a college where such reverence 
for the person does not prevail; for that 
reverence, deep-seated and all-pervading, is 
the finest ‘test of culture, the highest attain- 
ment in character, and the surest warrant for 
social efficiency. | 
And these great ends—culture, character 
and social eficiency—the true college must 
set before itself. The great means to these 
ends are unmistakable: an environment sufh- 
ciently complex to give acquaintance with 
the great fundamental facts of the world and 
to call out the entire man; the completest 
possible expressive activity on the part of the 
student; and personal association with broad 
and wise and noble lives. The spirit de- 
manded is equally indisputable—broadly but 
discriminatingly catholic in its interests; ob- 
jective in mood and method; democratic, 
unselfish and finely reverent in its personal 
relations, 
 
-P-A-G-E-82

In all—means and spirit—the primacy of 
the person is to be steadfastly maintained.

exists only in living men. “God give us men.”

THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE 
OF RELIGION 
Is religion of really fundamental impor- 
tance, or can we easily dispense with itr? Is 
the real trend of the scientific and educa- 
tional and ethical life of the world away from 
religion, or toward a deeper recognition of 
it? Is religion something external, to be 
merely tacked or pasted on to life, or is it 
absolutely fundamental to life, touching every 
part of ite No questions can be more im- 
portant than these questions; the answer to 
none concerns us more deeply. 
But a satisfactory answer here must be 
thoroughgoing. No shallow investigation 
can suffice. And we can hardly expect to 
come to any profound conviction of the fun- 
damental nature of religion, without careful © 
consideration of its relation to education, to 
ethics, and to life. If religion is of funda- 
mental importance, such a_ consideration 
ought to make that clear.

I. RELIGION AND EDUCATION 
And if we ask first as to the relation of 
religion and education (so far as education 
is not merely technical or professional), we 
seem bound to say that the relation 1s here so 
intimate that we cannot separate either at its best 
from the essential spirit of the other. The mod- 
ern world believes in education as it believes 
in almost nothing else. Let us see, then, the 
inevitable outcome of a comparison of relig- 
ion and education.as to aim, as to means and 
spirit, as to method, and as to results. 
1. In the first place, I think it must be 
said that the ultimate aims of religion and 
education are essentially the same. For, on 
the one hand, the best education seeks to_ 
call out the whole man in his highest har- 
monious development. That education often 
falls short of this highest aim, must of course 
be granted; but to this ideal it must never- 
theless be held, and any education must be 
regarded as defective in just the degree in 
which it fails to accomplish this aim, _ 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 73 
Religion, too, at its highest, as looking 
always to the fulfilment of the supreme per- 
sonal relation, involves everywhere the full 
personality in, its highest possible response; 
and, just so far as it attains its aim, must 
touch and quicken every faculty, must call 
out the entire man—volitionally, emotionally, | 
intellectually. In the concrete case, doubt- 
Tess, religion also fails all too often to reach 
its final goal; but the power of the gen- 
uine religious experience to quicken to its 
best the entire personality of the man, can- 
not be doubted. The ideal aims, therefore, 
both of education and religion, surely fall 
together. 
2. If one compares religion and education, 
in the second place, as to means and spirit, 
a similar result is obtained. For, on the one 
hand, true education must offer, as I have 
elsewhere said, “the opportunity to use one’s 
full powers in a wisely chosen complex 
environment, in association with the best; 
and all this in an atmosphere catholic in its 
interests, objective in spirit and method, and
-P-A-G-E-86
  74. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
finely reverent in its personal relations.” 
That is, the great means in the truest educa- 
tion are broad environment, work calling out 
the whole man, and personal association. 
The spirit demanded is catholic, objective 
and loving. 
Now, if these means and this spirit are 
those properly demanded in true education, 
just these means and just this spirit, it must 
be said, in like manner hold throughout for 
religion also. That this is for the most part 
true would probably hardly be questioned 
by any; and it may be maintained that the 
parallel holds even as to the catholic and the 
objective spirit, where perhaps most question 
would arise. 
For, as to the first, we are coming to see 
with increasing clearness that the true spirit 
of the life of religion, as of the life of cul- 
ture, must be that of a broad catholictty. 
As Wundt says, “the dangers that come with 
civilization can be met only by the further 
advance of civilization.” \ Psychological in- 
/“ vestigation, in its insistence upon the neces-
-P-A-G-E-87
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 75 
sity of a wide range of interests for the 
large and free and sane life, is forcing 
upon us everywhere the conviction that no 
ideal interest has anything to gain by exclu- 
siveness; that it is not in the true interest of 
the sacred to attempt to draw a sharp line 
between the sacred and the secular; that, 
in point of fact, the denial of legitimate 
worldly interests only limits the possible 
sphere of morality and religion. Every at- 
tempt to preserve something as especially 
sacred by setting it apart from all the rest 
of life, results inevitably in leaving it apart— 
out of vital contact with the rest of life, in 
failing to permeate life with its power. This 
has happened, for example, again and again, 
in false attempts to exalt the Bible. Religion 
must, rather, believe in itself so profoundly 
as to be certain that no part of the life and 
work of the world can come to its best 
except as it is permeated with the religious 
spirit. Religion, therefore, equally with edu- 
cation, must be catholic in its spirit. 
Not less earnest must be the insistence 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
76 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
that, equally with education, the spirit of reli- 
gion must be predominantly objective. It is 
indeed true that men have very commonly 
believed that the sphere of religion was pre- 
eminently a sphere for introspection; but, 
unless the whole modern study of man is mis- 
taken in its clear conviction that in body and 
mind we are made for action, the sphere of 
introspection, even in religion, must be de- 
cidedly limited, and much more limited than 
has often been conceived to be the case. 
There is no doubt a place for a certain amount 
of self-examination, and it can be clearly indi- 
cated just what that place is. There should 
be, namely, just so much introspection as may 
make a man certain that he is really putting 
himself in the presence of the great objective 
forces that make for character and godliness. 
Having determined that, the less a man’s gaze 
is turned in upon himself, the better both for 
his character and for his religion. It is not 
less true, then, in religion than in education, 
that the prevailing mood must be everywhere 
the objective mood. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION aT 
As to both means and spirit, then, we may 
unhesitatingly conclude that the ideals, both 
of religion and of education, are in agree- 
ment. An education, thoroughgoing in the 
use of these means and completely informed 
by such a spirit, cannot be really “godless.” 
It is only shallow insight that can so see it. 
We need to insist only that the education 
shall be real education—education of the 
entire man. And religion, too, is so seen 
not to be some simply external thing that 
can be merely spliced on to life, but an 
essential factor, implying the greatest means 
and moved.by the highest spirit. 
3. If, in the third place, we compare re- 
ligion and education as to method, it must be 
said that the ruling method in both is the 
same,—staying persistently in the presence 
of the best in each sphere of value. 
For education, conceived as_ culture, 
should give especially ability to enter into 
all values with appreciation and conviction, 
—conviction strong enough to be ready to 
pass into act. We can hardly ask less than
-P-A-G-E-90
478 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
this in any well-rounded education. No 
man can be called fully cultured to whom 
are closed the doors of any of the great 
kingdoms of worth. 
And religion, in like manner, asks that 
men should become sufficiently cultured to 
be able to appreciate Christianity — religion 
at its best. For all values finally go back 
to the riches of some personal life. We 
cannot be too often reminded that the best 
the world has ever shown us in literature, 
Or music, or art, is but a partial revelatron 
of the inner riches of some personal life. 
So Kaftan is in the habit of saying in his 
lectures at the University of Berlin, that the 
greatest problem of life is the problem of 
appreciative understanding of the great per- 
sonalities of history. The highest conceivable 
culture, therefore, would be the culture 
that should enable a man to enter with 
appreciation and conviction into the deepest 
and most significant personal life of history; 
and the world is coming to see with greater 
clearness every day that that life is the life
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 79 
of Jesus Christ. The world of the beautiful 
and of art, therefore, one may properly hold 
with Browning, is but the ante-chamber of the 
temple of the full sharing of the life of God. 
“The wise who waited there could tell 
By these, what royalties in store 
Lay one step past the entrance door. 
All partial beauty was a pledge 
Of beauty in its plentitude.” 
“And all thou dost enumerate 
Of power and beauty in the world, 
The mightiness of love was curled 
Inextricably about. 
Love lay within it and without, 
To clasp thee.” 
All the world of the beautiful and of art 
is but a single rose thrown over the garden 
wall, as but a little hint of the infinite riches 
of the life of God. 
It is no accident that, for the most part, 
the best in sculpture, in architecture, in 
painting, in literature, and in music has been 
most closely connected with religion, and 
has found its highest inspiration there. And,
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
where this is not the case, it must still often 
force itself upon the feeling of the thought- 
ful man that in any one of the arts, indeed, 
but especially in music at its greatest, the 
medium is too great for small passions. I 
suspect that I only voice the inner feeling 
and conviction of many another when I say 
that the music of the best love-songs, for 
example, manifestly goes far beyond them- 
selves; the music tells far more than the 
sentiment itself will bear. 
Nor can this seem strange to the man 
who can think as well as feel. For, after all, 
in the first place, in much we all live alone, 
a solitary life, shut up to ourselves and God. 
There is much, both of good and evil, in us 
that no other has ever known, that we could 
hardly conceivably reveal to any other. Only 
o God is the deepest in us “naked and laid 
open.” And that means that only unto God 
can that complete revelation of ourselves be 
made that must underlie the deepest per- 
sonal relation of which we are capable. 
Moreover, men are mastered in different 
   
-P-A-G-E-93
    THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 81 
degrees by two great contrary instincts—the 
instinct, on the one hand, to self-devotion; 
the instinct, on the other, of an insatiate thirst 
for love; and there is only one relation in 
which a man can give himself with absolute 
devotion, only one in which the response can 
wholly satisfy, if a man is fully awake to the 
real and ultimate meaning of his experiences. 
And this means that we are helpless in the 
face of the deepest instincts in us apart from 
God. “I came from God,” George Mac- 
Donald makes one of his characters say, “and 
I’m going back to God, and I won’t have 
any gaps of death in the middle of my life.” 
It is natural, therefore, that only under the 
great motives of religion should the artistic 
medium be felt to be fully filled by the senti- 
ment it carries. Even the esthetic power of 
our natures is swept in its full compass only 
by the undying religious appeal; because, 
only a conviction essentially religious can 
assure us of the final and complete worth- 
fulness of life. We need to be able to 
respond with some real conviction to the
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
prophetic appeal: “Arise, shine, for thy light 
is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen 
upon thee.” “Lift up your heads, O ye 
gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting 
doors, and the King of glory shall come in.” 
4. Once more, religion and education are 
most closely akin in the final resu/ts attained. 
The highest results of a true education are 
convictions and ideals. The danger, no doubt, 
of a shallow education is over - sophistication 
—the false tolerance that is essentially indif- 
ferentism, because the great fundamental con- 
victions and ideals have lost their hold on the 
man. Nevertheless, if it is the business of a 
true education to fit for high and rational 
living, then it must still be true that the 
highest results to be demanded from such an 
education are convictions and ideals; and the 
deepest convictions and the highest ideals, it 
should be remembered, are those of religion. 
For no convictions go deeper, and none are 
more vital than religion’s great assertions of 
the love of God and the life of love; they 
are practically all-inclusive. And even edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 83 
cation would have reached its highest con- 
ceivable result only in the establishment of 
these convictions and their implied ideals. 
The real forces in education are persons, 
even on the intellectual side. The greatest 
results of education are convictions and 
ideals. And the supreme persons, convic- 
tions and ideals are those of religion—are 
Christian. 
We may, then, reasonably conclude that in 
aim, in means and spirit, in method, and in 
results, religion and education may be said 
essentially to agree. And that is to say: It is 
not possible for us to stand strongly for edu- 
cation in its full modern sense, and not find 
ourselves driven to the recognition of essential 
religion. 
II. RELIGION AND ETHICS 
From this comparison, now, of religion 
and education, let us turn to the comparison 
of religion and ethics, and see here, too, how 
impossible it is to conceive either at its best 
apart from the other.
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
1. For, on the.one hand, if; the true 
ethical life is the fulfilment of all personal 
relations, then an impartial and thorough- 
going ethics must involve religion. For the 
spirit of the life that means to throw itself 
with impartial loyalty into the fulfilment of 
all personal relations in which it finds itself, 
certainly cannot logically leave out the most 
fundamental and significant relation of all. 
And, if there is a God at all, the relation in 
which we stand to Him must be just that most 
fundamental and significant relation. Not to 
fulfil that relation is, then, not merely to 
have failed on the religious side, but to have 
failed in any consistent fulfilment of our 
acknowledged ethical aim. From this point 
of view, ethics involves religion. 
2. Or if, on the other hand, we look at 
the matter from the point of view of reli- 
gion, we have here, too, to recognize that 
religion is the fulfilment of exactly that per- 
sonal relation which gives reality and mean- 
ing and value to all other relations. These 
owe the very fact of their existence to the
-P-A-G-E-97
    THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 85 
purpose of God; they owe their meaning to 
what He has put into them; and they have 
the value that is theirs only because He has 
so established it. To the man of religious 
conviction, therefore, the religious position 
of one whom he loves becomes inevitably 
the most important of all matters; because 
he knows that, in very fact, this relation to 
God is the one essential relation which, itself 
set right, sets all others right. The religious 
man believes, not without full warrant, that 
the man who has come into a true relation 
to the God of character revealed in Jesus 
Christ, must thereby have put himself, in 
just that degree, into absolutely right rela- 
tions with other men. The first and second 
commandments are indissoluble; and religion 
is here seen to involve ethics, as, before, ethics 
involved religion. 
3. Indeed, if we strive to take the ethical 
laws simply as laws of our own nature, even 
so we can hardly help connecting them 
with the great ongoing righteous trend of 
the universe, else we could not reverence
-P-A-G-E-98
86 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
them; and this is an essentially religious 
conviction. For we must take the laws of 
our own being as at least a partial manifes- 
tation of the essential nature of things. We 
have not conferred our nature upon our- 
selves, and the laws which we find revealed 
in it are not of our own creation. We can- 
not, therefore, recognize them as carrying 
in any degree the consent of our reason and 
conscience without thereby rendering the 
tribute of our deepest reverence to this 
essential nature of things in its highest reve- 
lation in ourselves. Here, too, then, a con- 
viction essentially religious underlies the 
ethical. 
Wundt’s thoroughgoing study of The Facts 
of the Moral Life may be taken as confirm- 
ing this result, in his insistence that “the 
whole development of human morality rests 
on the expression of these two fundamental 
impulses of human nature”—“the feelings of 
reverence and affection.” Of these, one, at 
least, is distinctly religious. And how im- 
portant the religious element is, Wundt 
       
-P-A-G-E-99
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 87 
bears witness when, in speaking earlier even 
of the development of the forms of human 
society, he says: “Here, again, it is the re/i- 
gious factors that constitute the most impor- 
tant of all aids to moral evolution, whether 
found within or without the sphere of 
morality itself.”? 
4. For us Americans, too, there is a his- 
torical reason why we can hardly separate 
the ethical and the religious without a denial 
of ourselves. For our national character has 
had a religious basis, and has been plainly 
glorified thereby. When William Stoughton, 
in 1688, in words that John Fiske asserts 
must be taken as literally true, said of our 
Puritan ancestors, “God sifted a whole nation 
that he might send choice grain into the 
wilderness,” he reminds us how great these 
founders of our national life were, and how 
transcendent was their service. And their 
greatness lay in their convictions and their 
conscience. And any “new Puritanism” in 
life needs beneath it the old Puritan reli- 
1Op. cit., pp. 328, 226.
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
gious convictions in their seership, in their 
prophet’s sense of God and the spiritual 
world as the realest of all realities, in their 
consequent sense of commission, vocation, 
divine calling—the apostle’s sense of being 
called to an “imperishable work in the 
world”—and in their resulting conviction of 
responsibility and accountability. This tre- 
mendous sense of the significance and value 
of life in the doing of the will of God as 
co-partners with him,—this sense had power, — 
and must ever have power, to lift‘men above 
the petty and the prejudiced and the par- 
tisan. Macaulay was certainly no eulogist of 
the Puritans, but Macaulay saw that their 
“coolness of judgment and immutability of 
purpose” were “the necessary effects of their 
religious zeal.” And, if we are to be worthy 
successors of worthy sires, we must bind our 
ethical life up indissolubly with their great 
religious convictions. 
In truth, from whatever point of view we 
choose to consider them, if we look deeply 
into both, we can hardly fail to find that,
-P-A-G-E-101
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 89 
in Wundt’s words, “religion and morality 
tend more and more to blend in an insepa- 
rable unity.” Religion is the sharing of the 
life of God, and no man may share the life 
of the God of character without character. 
III. RELIGION AND LIFE 
If there is any one emphasis of our time 
more powerful than the emphases upon edu- 
cation and the ethical, it is the emphasis on 
life. The demand for life, real, full, and sat- 
isfying, is the deepest instinct of our time. 
*»*'Tis life whereof our nerves are scant; 
‘ More life and fuller, that I want.” 
So far is this true, that Professor Leuba feels 
justified in saying, as the result of his study 
of the religious consciousness of the Protes- 
tant Anglo-Saxon: “The preservation and in- 
crease of life is the moving impulse as well 
of religion as of secular activity.” In our 
search, then, for the fundamental nature 
of religion, let us turn from this compari- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
    90 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
son of religion and education, and of relig- 
ion and ethics, to the comparison of re- 
ligion and life, and let us see how surely 
a faith that is essentially religious logically 
underlies all our reasoning, all work worth 
doing, all strenuous moral endeavor, all 
earnest social service; how permeated with 
the religious, therefore, all life at its highest 
must be. 
1. For, in the first place, a faith essen- 
tially religious logically underlies a// our rea- 
soning. For every argument that we can pos- 
sibly make, especially concerning any of the 
| greater interests of life, must go forward 
upon the double assumption of the consis- 
tency and the worth of the world. We can 
reason at all, only so far as we have already 
virtually asserted that the world is a world 
in which we can rationally think; and our 
most significant arguments require, as well, 
that we should add the faith that the world 
is a world in which we can rationally /ve. 
That, in other words, there is the unity and 
consistency of one truth and of a unified 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION gI 
reason in the world, and an essential love at 
its heart that makes life abundantly worth 
living. And these two fundamental assump- 
tions of all our reasoning are essentially 
religious convictions. 
That men often do not recognize these 
logical implications of their reasoning, and 
may use with great complacency impersonal 
and irreligious language concerning their ex- 
perience that will not bear thinking through 
—this is all too true; but this does not alter 
the fact of the ultimate logical implications 
of their deepest thinking and living. The 
mere report, therefore, of the psychological, 
facts of a man’s religious experience, as he 
conceives it, is by no means the final step in 
any fundamental religious inquiry. 
2. In the same way, a faith essentially 
religious underlies all work worth doing. For, 
as Paulsen says, speaking simply as a philos- 
opher, “Whoever devotes his life to a cause 
believes in that cause; and this belief, be his 
creed what it may, has always something of 
the form of religion.” “Hence,” he adds,
-P-A-G-E-104
92 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
“faith infers that an inner connection exists 
between the real and the valuable within the 
domain of history, and believes that in history 
something like an immanent principle of rea- 
son or justice favors the right and the good 
and leads it to victory over all resisting 
forces.”’ It is impossible, that is, for a man 
with full consciousness to throw himself en- 
thusiastically into a work which he regards 
from the start as absolutely hopeless. When, 
then, he takes up the work of his life calling, 
or the cause to which he devotes himseif, 
as work really worth while, in which he can 
lose himself with joy, whether consciously 
or not, he is virtually asserting his faith in a 
plan larger than his own plan, the all-embrac- 
ing plan of the on-going providence of God, 
which shall catch up the little fragments of 
his work into a larger whole and make them 
contribute, thus, to a goal greater than any 
that the man himself may set. To believe 
in the final worth of one’s own work, then, 
logically implies a real belief in God. For 
2 Introduction to Philosophy, pp. 8, 9. 
   
-P-A-G-E-105
THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 93 
’ so far “principles” and “plans” and “laws,’ 
as I am able to see, have no real existence, 
that will bear thorough thinking, and can 
do nothing, apart from Being that must be 
conceived ultimately in essentially personal 
terms. A fully religious conviction logically 
underlies all enthusiastic work. 
3. In all strenuous moral endeavor, in the 
fight for character for one’s self, a faith es- 
sentially religious is in like manner involved. 
So Martineau asserts: “Nothing less than the 
majesty of God, and the power of the world 
to come, can maintain the place and sanctity 
of our homes, the order and serenity of our 
minds, the spirit of patience and tender mercy 
” For here, once more, we shall in our hearts. 
not earnestly attempt a hopeless task. And 
if, in the surrender to the highest in us, 
we cannot believe that we thereby at the 
same time link ourselves to the highest in 
the universe, we shall not be able to reach 
that courage which gives promise of any 
high attainment. Only the highest motives 
are finally sufficient here. If our faith in
-P-A-G-E-106
94 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
the ultimate ethical trend of the great power 
back of the universe really breaks down, 
we shall hardly be able to keep our faith 
even in our own ideals. 
That this faith in the ethical trend of the 
universe is always consciously present, or 
even the need of it definitely felt in any 
recognized religious way, I am far from 
affirming. There may even be such a kind 
of intoxication with life itself, as should lead 
one, as in a recorded case, on the one hand, 
to deny any relation to God, and yet, on the 
other hand, to assert in the most varied and 
ardent ways,—“I trust the laws that govern 
my destiny.”* And the emotional and general 
volitional state of such a one might con- 
ceivably be almost ideal; for she expresses 
so deep a faith in the universe as fairly to 
rival the old calvinistic test of willingness 
to be damned for the glory of God. But 
her intellectual perception of the real im- 
plications of her “faith-state,” I confess, does 
not seem to me all that is to be desired.

That a successful business man should even 
report to Professor Leuba—“I have no relig- 
ious need; I am devoid of religious feel- 
ing”—this is entirely conceivable. But the 
fact by no means proves that there zs no 
such need, if the man is to be thoroughly 
and consistently rational in his thinking and 
living. There are great temperamental dif- 
ferences here, doubtless, and the very force 
of life in us may carry us over many thin 
places in our reasoning, without misgiving; 
but the fact remains that hopeful, courage- 
ous, moral endeavor logically requires the 
faith that we are not here at war with the 
ultimate purpose of things. 
4. And, once more, a faith essentially 
religious logically underlies, in like manner, 
all earnest social service. I do not forget that 
in the inconsistency of our natures men may 
often go on in forgetfulness of the real 
significance of their actions, and in the 
strength of motives which they have at least 
formally denied. Nor do I forget that it is 
possible for social service itself to become, 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
96 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
for the time being, even a kind of fad, and 
for the phrases of the new social consciousness 
of our time to become only a new cant. 
Nor do I forget that men in such unselfish 
service may honestly think of themselves, 
for a time, as not needing in any degree 
either the convictions or the consolations of 
religion. 
Nevertheless, when I try really to think 
the situation through, I am not able to doubt 
that Nash is right when he says: “Nothing 
save a settled and fervid conviction that the 
universe is on the side of the will 
can give the will the force and edge suit- 
able.” For here, also, we shall not throw 
ourselves with all abandon into a task that 
we think either hopeless or worthless. And 
that means that we must have back of our 
social service the great religious convictions 
of the love of God and the worth of men. 
We shall not attempt to dip out the ocean 
with a cup, and we shall not enter on a 
boundless social task in which there is no 
hope of accomplishing any permanent and 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
    THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 97 
large result. We must believe here that 
we work with God, in line with his own 
purpose, and that the mighty will of the 
living God is pledged to our attempt. 
So, too, must we believe that we ourselves 
and those for whom we work have a person- 
ality great enough to make the sacrifice 
rational. Let religious faith in the immortality 
of men be once thoroughly sapped, let men 
be once fully persuaded that man is not a 
creature of the endless life, that he is not 
capable of an absolutely endless development, 
and that there is in his constitution no pledge 
of the eternal years, and the immortal hope 
dies down not only in us, but the value of 
all those for whom we labor is essentially 
lowered. It is not merely that our lives have 
lost value; the life of the other, also, has 
become comparatively worthless, and our 
self-sacrificing altruistic service becomes vain 
and irrational. We shall not ultimately be 
capable of acts of supreme self-sacrifice on 
behalf of a creature merely of a day. And 
faith essentially religious, therefore, is neces- 
G

sitated, and, whether consciously or not, logi- 
cally implied in all earnest social service. 
And when we have thus said that a relig- 
ious faith logically underlies all our rea- 
soning, all work worth doing, all strenuous 
moral endeavor, and all earnest social ser- 
vice, we have already asserted that religion 
is inseparable from life. Benjamin Kidd, in 
his study of social evolution, insists that “the 
evolution which is slowly proceeding in 
human society is not primarily intellectual, 
but religious in character.” And though he 
uses the term “religious” in the sense rather 
of the altruistic, his contention may surely 
be regarded as essentially correct; for, as 
have we just seen, this spirit of willing self- 
sacrifice for others builds on a faith really 
religious. Fairbairn’s conclusion is, thus, 
thrust upon us: “Religion is the supreme 
factor in the organizing and regulating of 
our personal and collective life.” We can 
hardly take a step in any direction that we 
can regard as really significant, without a

-P-A-G-E-111
  THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 99 
virtual assertion of God, of the sanctity of 
his will, and of the worth of men. 
It is but an illustration of this inevitable- 
ness of religion, that, in an introduction to 
a recent edition of Wesley's Journal, Hugh 
Price Hughes should say: “He who desires 
to understand the real history of the Eng- 
lish people during the seventeenth, eigh- 
teenth and nineteenth centuries should read 
most carefully three books: George Fox’s 
Journal, John Wesley’s Journal, and John 
Henry Newman’s Apologia pro Vita Sua. 
., The Religious Question cannot be 
ignored. It is the Question; in the deepest 
sense it is the only Question. It has always 
determined the course of history every- 
where.” ‘To similar import, Brierley says in 
the preface to his Problems of Living: “Spite 
of the modern assertion to the contrary, our 
problems of living are finally religious, and 
look to religion for their solution.” 
Nor can this seem to the thoughtful man 
strange, when he thinks that, if religion is 
really communion with God, the fulfilment
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of that personal relation most essential to 
man, then religion can hardly fail to give 
the ideal conditions of the richest life. It is 
the great claim and challenge of Christ 
that He is come that men “may have life, 
and may have it abundantly.” He welcomes 
just this test, and is willing to abide the 
issue. He brings, He says, not limitation of 
life, but life itself, the fullest, richest, larg- 
est life. 
Or if, in harmony with the social con- 
sciousness of our time, we think of life as 
love, we have only struck the note of Chris- 
tianity’s most fundamental conviction. Or if, 
with Kaftan, we find the great problem and 
joy of lifein the appreciative understand- 
ing of the great personalities of history, 
then in Christianity we are confronted again 
with the one great central supreme per- 
sonality of Jesus Christ. Or, if we try to 
think of the highest conceivable goal of life, 
we can hardly set before ourselves anything 
greater than the possible sharing of the life 
of the infinite God. Compared with the
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION IOI 
infinity of the religious outlook, all other 
aims and goals are poor indeed. 
Or if, once more, we ask from psychology 
a statement of those ideal conditions of the 
richest life, and get its answer— Reverent 
association, and work in which one can for- 
get himself; we can then hardly fail to see 
that exactly these greatest means and greatest 
conditions are given in religion. For here 
alone are the most intimate and unobtrusive 
association with the Spirit of the Highest, 
and work for the Kingdom of God—God- 
given and large enough for a man to lose 
himself in it with joy. 
We are thus unavoidably brought to our 
conclusion, and to Christ’s great insistence: 
Religion is life. “This is life eternal, that 
they should know Thee, the only true God, 
and Him whom thou didst send, even Jesus 
Christ.” 
No doubt, the depth of a man’s religion 
must depend on the depth of his conviction 
as to the significance of life; and his felt need 
of religion, on the claim he makes on life.
-P-A-G-E-114
  I02 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
The man who requires little from life will 
have little conscious need of religion. But in 
just the proportion in which he awakes to the 
real meaning of the life into which he is called 
and of the true greatness of his own nature, 
in just that degree must he awake to the need 
of more than the finite can give —to the need 
of religion and to its indispensable contribu- 
tion to life. What religion requires, above all, 
is not credulity, but simply that a man should 
be really awake. “Man’s unhappiness,” Car- 
lyle says, “as I construe, comes from his great- 
ness; it is because there is an Infinite in him, 
which with all his cunning he cannot quite 
bury under the Finite.” He cannot satisfy 
the infinite though unconscious thirst of his 
nature with finite things. 
It is no new heresy, then, though it has 
been so called, to assert that in this sense 
religion grows out of the claim on life. For 
it is, after all, only a modern echo of that 
great sentence of Augustine that has voiced 
the heart of the Church through the centuries: 
“Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF RELIGION 103 
hearts are restless until they find rest in 
Thee.” In our deepest nature, then, we are 
religious, and we cannot escape it. We were 
never meant to come to our best in inde- 
pendence either of our neighbor or of God. 
Man is alone the religious animal, and he 
cannot escape the demand of religion until 
he escapes from his deepest self. No won- 
der that Sabatier should say: “Man is in- 
curably religious.” Or that Royce should 
give “the highest worth to religion among 
the interests of humanity.” Or that Coe 
should affirm: “Worship is so wrought into 
the fiber of our minds that we need only 
come to ourselves to find God.”! Or that 
Granger should say, even in arguing for the 
right of free thought in matters of religion: 
“The religious sentiment needs no adventi- 
tious. aids, for. it is. safe here to trust the 
unbiased instincts of mankind. So far as 
prophecy can reach, it seems certain that 
man will always worship, and that the sym- 
bols of the Christian tradition will afford the 
1 The Religion of a Mature Mind, p. 250. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  104. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
ultimate vehicle of his devotion.”' We can 
hardly do less, therefore, than to confess with 
George Macdonald: “Life and religion are 
one, or neither is anything. Religion is no 
way of life, no show of life, no observance 
of any sort. It is neither the food nor the 
medicine of being. It is life essential.” 
Is religion of really fundamental impor- 
tance, or can we easily dispense with it? 
No age ever believed more than our own 
in education, in the ethical, in life. No age 
ever demanded more imperiously the best 
that education, ethical living, and the rich- 
est experiences of life can give. And the 
truest thinking of our time indicates that 
into this best no age and no man may come 
without religion. We cannot dispense with 
religion; it is absolutely fundamental in its 
nature.

  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AS CONDITIONED 
BY MODERN PSYCHOLOGY 
AND PEDAGOGY 
IT is not proposed in this discussion to 
expound or to justify the psychological and 
pedagogical principles involved in religious 
education; the attempt is rather to apply 
those principles as directly as possible to 
the problem of religious education. More- 
over, even in the application of the psycho- 
logical and pedagogical principles, though 
somewhat distinct periods in religious edu- 
cation must be recognized, I shall not aim 
to take up the question of the progressive 
adaptation to these periods, but confine the 
discussion to those great fundamental prin- 
ciples which have almost equal application 
in all periods. And even of those four prin- 
ciples which often seem to me the greatest 
inferences from modern psychology (though 
they are not absolutely exclusive one of 
another)—the complexity of life, the unity 
(105) 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of man, the central importance of will and 
action, and the conviction that the real is 
always concrete—the first two may be but 
very briefly treated. And yet, even the brief- 
est discussion of religious education ought 
not to fail to point out how greatly religion 
has suffered from failure clearly to recognize 
the complexity of life and the unity of the 
nature of man. 
And, first, it concerns the religious teacher 
to see that psychology’s emphasis upon the 
complexity of life, upon the relatedness of 
all, is a virtual denial of the possible separa- 
tion of the sacred and the secular. The very 
constitution of the mind demands, for the 
sake of the higher interests themselves, that 
they do not receive exclusive attention. And 
the reaction certain to follow exclusive atten- 
tion to any subject is only disastrous to the 
interests which it was sought thus exclusively 
to conserve. Human nature revenges itself 
for any lack of reasonable regard for the 
wide range of its interests. No ideal interest 
can conquer by simple negation, and no
-P-A-G-E-119
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 107 
ideal interest has anything to gain by mere 
exclusiveness. For the denial of legitimate 
worldly interests only narrows the possible 
sphere of both morals and religion; it makes 
the ethical and religious life, not more, but 
less significant. And the entire movement, of 
which the Religious Education Association is 
a part, roots, I suppose, in a similar conviction. 
Religion is life or neither is anything, it has 
been said; so that religious education cannot 
wisely be carried on as an isolated fragment. 
Moreover, it is of peculiar moment to the 
religious teacher to take account of the unity 
of man. Because he ought to face the exact 
facts and to know and obey the laws of his 
divinely given nature, the religious teacher 
least of all can afford to ignore either the 
physical or the psychical conditions involved 
in the unity of human nature. On the phys- 
ical side, he should not forget, for example, 
the effects of fatigue—that surplus nervous 
energy is the chief physical condition of self- 
control—nor the close connection of muscu- 
lar activity and will, nor the physical basis
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of habit. On the psychical side, the religious 
teacher needs to consider the possible help- 
ing or hindering influence of intellectual and 
emotional conditions. The moral dangers of 
_ intellectual vagueness and of strained and 
sham emotions may be taken as illustrations. 
Passing thus with briefest reference these 
important principles, it is still possible to put 
with reasonable brevity the great essentials 
of religious education. They will be found 
to connect themselves closely with the two 
other great inferences from modern psychol- 
ogy— the conviction that the real is always 
concrete, ending in supreme emphasis on 
the personal, and the recognition of the 
central importance of will and action. 
Christianity assumes, I take it, that the 
end of religious education is never mere 
knowledge or learning, but to bring the in- 
dividual into life—the largest, richest, highest 
life; and that life it conceives to be the 
sharing of the life of God—his character and 
joy. John thus reports Christ as saying: “I 
came that they may have life, and may have
-P-A-G-E-121
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 109 
it abundantly.” “This is life eternal, that 
they should know Thee, the only true God, 
and Him whom thou didst send, even Jesus 
Christ.” With the Christian conception of 
the character of God, this makes the reli- 
gious life, just so far as it is developed, at 
once and inevitably ethical. In Christian 
thought, then, religious education and moral 
education cannot be dissociated. The goal 
sought may be considered to be, therefore, 
either bringing men into a real acquaintance 
with God—making this relation to God a 
real relation not only, but the dominating 
relation of life; or the attainment of the 
largest life—a life of character, of happiness 
and of influence. In either case, the supreme 
conditions and means are the same. 
For, if one thinks of the goal, for ex- 
ample, as the attainment of character, he 
must recognize at once that to any attain- 
ment of character self-control is necessary. 
But self-control, our psychologists insist, is 
never negative, but always positive—not mere 
self-restraint, but the control of self through 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  II10 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
positive replacing of the evil tempting con- 
siderations by attention to the other interests 
and considerations that ought to prevail. The 
power of self-control, then, goes back to the 
power to recognize, to appreciate and to re- 
spond to certain great interests and forces. 
The end of moral education thus becomes to 
bring the individual, on the one hand, into 
the possession of great and valuable interests ; 
and, on the other hand, to foster habits of 
persistent response to those interests. The 
great claim of religion, and peculiarly of the 
Christian religion, is, that it offers to men 
the absolutely supreme interests and is able 
to make these permanent and commanding 
in life. The very end of religious education 
is to make men see the greatest realities and 
values—above all and summing up all, to 
make men see Christ. 
What, then, are the chief means by which 
men are to be brought into the possession 
of these great objective interests as abiding 
and commanding? The answer of modern 
psychology seems to me to be by no means 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION II! 
doubtful: through personal association and 
work,—character through contagion and ex- 
pression. The prodigious emphasis laid by 
Professor Baldwin and Professor Royce upon 
imitative activity in the development of the 
child is really an emphasis upon both per- 
sonal association and work. The great 
means to the largest life—to character, to 
happiness and to influence—and to a shar- 
ing of the life of God as the greatest of all 
realities and values, are personal association 
and active expression. And the really su- 
preme conditions of the highest association 
and work are reverence for the person and 
the mood of objectivity. These means and 
conditions, I judge, modern psychology 
insists, must rule in all religious education. 
Our problem, then, becomes simply this: 
How can the religious teacher most effec- 
tually use these great means, and best fulfil 
these essential conditions? How can we 
bring personal association and active expres- 
sion most effectually into religious educa- 
tionr How can we best insure that the
-P-A-G-E-124
    II2 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
spirit which pervades it shall be one of 
sacred respect for the person and of the 
mood of objectivity—the mood of work and 
of a self-forgetting love, rather than the 
mood of self-absorbed introspection? 
I. ASSOCIATION 
How can the religious teacher make most 
effective the factor of personal association? 
The very meaning of that life of God, 
which men are to share in religion, Christ 
taught, is love; and it is consequently a life 
of unselfish, loving service into which, above 
all, he seeks to bring men. The social self 
of the child must be awakened. To this 
end, personal association is self-evidently the 
great means. 
1. In the first place, this shows that 
religious teaching must clearly recognize 
that the child needs society as such. No one 
can learn to love in solitude. If really un- 
selfish service is to be called out, there 
must come to the child some real convic-
-P-A-G-E-125
    RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 113 
tion of the essential likeness of others to 
himself, of the inevitable way in which the 
lives of all are knit together, and of the 
value and sacredness of the person of others. 
The very first step to these essential convic- 
tions is some real knowledge of others 
through association with them. Not even 
the associations of the family, it should be 
noted, are sufficient here to give the sense 
of what is due to a person simply as such. 
The religious teacher may well recognize, 
therefore, the very great service rendered 
in just this respect by the public schools. 
In this broad sense, it is a genuine religious 
service—a service that cannot be rendered 
with anything like the same effectiveness by 
any select private school, however religious. 
For in the public school the child meets 
those of all classes, finds a common standard 
applied to all, and much the same response 
made by all; and so learns to think of him- 
self as really one of many who are essen- 
tially alike. He must thus get some notion 
of real justice—of what is due to a person 
H
-P-A-G-E-126
  II47 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
simply as such. I am not able to see how 
more safely than in our public schools this 
absolutely vital contact with men as men 
could be afforded. It is not merely of 
exceptional importance for our democracy, 
but it also has an essential contribution to 
make to the development of the true social 
self, to the true moral and religious life. 
The vital breath of Christianity is demo- 
cratic—the recognition of a real brotherhood 
of men. An agency that so completely em- 
bodies and teaches the democratic spirit 
as do our public schools, with whatever 
defects, is in this broadest sense soundly 
religious and even Christian. Let the reli- 
gious teacher, then, recognize the contribu- 
tion here of the common schools, and abhor 
in all his own plans the spirit of snobbishness. 
2. Let us notice, in the second place, that 
the initial awakening to the sense that a 
given interest has value at all, comes almost 
uniformly through association with those to 
whom the interest means most. It is indeed 
through the discernment that in character 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
    RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IIl5 
or peace or joy another has what we have 
not, that. we are led to give attention to 
those interests that have so counted for this 
other person. This primary law, which holds 
for all other values, cannot be set aside in 
religion. Close association with a few simple 
people, who may not be technically trained 
religiously, but who really know God, will 
quicken the child’s spiritual consciousness 
as nothing else will, and that, too, without 
any precocious forcing. Have we practically 
and sufficiently recognized that the child 
must be much in the society of truly Christian 
people to find the great Christian aims 
of growing interest? Is not the religious 
development of the child sought quite too 
often in virtual abandonment of the associa- 
tion of older Christians? Let us be sure 
that no brilliant pedagogical devices will take 
the place of these living forces. 
3. But the child not only has his first 
awakening to moral and religious conscious- 
ness in association with others; no force is 
so powerful in bringing him on into an
-P-A-G-E-128
    116 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
assured faith and life of his own. The law 
is clear. We tend to grow inevitably like 
those with whom we most constantly are, to 
whom we look in admiration and love, and 
who give themselves most devotedly to us. 
Granted such association, the worst pedagog- 
ical methods cannot destroy its reasonable 
efficiency; and without such association the 
most approved methods will miserably fail. 
4. In the last analysis, the two greatest 
services that we can possibly render another 
are really to be such persons as we ought 
to be, and to bear witness to those greater 
persons in whom are the chief sources of 
our life. The fourth way, therefore, in which 
personal association may be made to count 
is in such witnessing to the highest perso- 
nalities, and in bringing home to others in 
the most objective way possible those reali- 
ties and persons that have revealed to us 
most of God. If the aim of all religious 
education is to bring the individual into his 
own living relation to God, then the primary 
service to be rendered here is to be able,
-P-A-G-E-129
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION aay 
on the one hand, to bring a convincing 
witness of what the great historical self- 
manifestations of God, culminating in Christ, 
have meant to us; and, on the other hand, 
to be able so to set these forth that they 
shall be real and commanding to others. 
On the strictly teaching side, therefore, the 
power most to be coveted by the religious 
teacher is power to make real, to make 
rational, and to make vital these greatest 
facts. This power culminates in the power 
to bring home to others the real glory of 
the inner life of Christ. He who can do that 
renders to men the highest conceivable 
service, for he puts them into touch with 
the supreme source of life—of inspiration, of 
hope, and of courage. He makes it possible 
for God to touch them with his own life, 
and with convincing power. Absolute trust 
and humility are called out spontaneously 
by a real vision of the inner spirit of Jesus. 
Christ himself built his kingdom on twelve 
men and their personal association with Him. 
Facing the whole problem of character for
-P-A-G-E-130
    118 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
all his disciples in all time, He deliberately 
makes the one great means personal relation 
to Himself, not the acceptance of certain 
machinery, or methods, or principles, or 
ideas. The most conserving and inspiring of 
all influences is love for a holy person. 
No man should lose sight just here of 
the tremendous and special opportunity given 
to our time by the coming of a historical 
spirit into Bible study. Into this theme the 
present discussion cannot enter; but I may 
simply record. my conviction that, on this 
account alone, it is a reasonable expectation 
that the best religious teaching and the best 
response to religious teaching that the world 
has ever seen lie just ahead of us. The his- 
torical method is soundly based psychologi- 
cally, for it makes, as no other can, the 
definite personal appeal. 
In trying to make real these great histori- 
cal manifestations of God, it may be worth 
remarking that a special value is to be at- 
tached, not only to the ordinary analogical 
use of the imagination and to the rarer his- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IIg 
torical imagination, but particularly to what 
might be called a psychological use of the 
imagination —a clear discernment of the 
mental states involved in a historical situa- 
tion, and bringing out their parallels in our 
modern individual and social life. 
Il. WORK 
The second great means which modern 
psychology most emphasizes in religious and 
moral education is expressive activity. The 
psychologist insists that in mind and body 
we are made for action. If even thought 
and feeling tend to action, and are normally 
complete only when the act follows, much 
more must this be true of the mind’s voli- 
tions and, most of all, of the highest voli- 
tions—moral and religious purposes. One 
inexorable law rules throughout: That which 
is not expressed dies. 
Since the very sphere of the religious life 
is in the ethical, and it is hardly possible 
that it should have any true expression at 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
I20 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
all that does not directly involve the moral 
life, we are not likely to over-emphasize the 
demand for active expression in religious 
education. How, then, can this need of 
work, of expression, best be met in reli- 
gious educationre 
1. In the first place, it is of course true, 
because of the close connection of the will 
and muscular activity, that almost any vig- 
orous work is not without its value, in 
will- strengthening, for the religious life. 
2. To aim, further, to develop a healthy 
body, in the spirit of fidelity to a God-given 
trust, and because health is a vital condition 
of character, is itself of great value. And 
all well-ordered physical exercise may be- 
come, thus, a direct help in_ religious 
education. 
3. Moreover, as character continually in- 
volves the working out of certain aims and 
ideals, the embodying through work of any 
ideal can hardly fail to be a real assistance 
in the ethical and religious life. All manual 
training, for example, is here a real con-
-P-A-G-E-133
  RELIGIOUS EDUCATION I2I 
tributor to religious education, as are also 
any societies that involve the carrying out 
of some ideal. 
4. But, as the Christian spirit is preémi- 
nently the spirit of unselfish love, and as 
love to God can be shown chiefly in service 
to man, the kind of expression specially called 
for in religious education is active service 
for others. Any really useful work here 
has its religious value. To avoid pride and 
priggishness and introspection, especially in 
the case of younger children, it is probably 
distinctly better that this attempted service 
for others should not be in lines that could 
be thought to be peculiarly religious in the 
narrower sense. The simplest self-forgetful 
work for some practical cause—the cup of 
cold water in the name of a disciple —will 
meet the case. It is not unnatural, therefore, 
that societies and clubs and committees of 
various sorts should find here their legiti- 
mate place in religious education. Getting 
children thus to take an interest, for example, 
in the protection of animals, in the protec-

tion of the defenseless, in the cleanliness 
and beautifying of the town, in the cultiva- 
tion and giving of flowers, is not without 
its value. The training of the clubs them- 
selves is, moreover, some direct preparation 
for complex life in society. 
5. But, after all, even though there are 
no societies, or clubs, or committees (and 
I have some feeling that these have been 
overdone by zealous reformers, to the exclu- 
sion of something better, and to the fostering 
of pride and the need of public recognition), 
still the one great necessity in the expression 
of the Christian life remains: the doing, in 
the common every-day ways, the really unsel- 
fish thing. “By this shall all men know that 
ye are my disciples, because ye have love

times driven to devising more or less artificial 
ways of service because the home training, 
especially in well-to-do homes, is too often 
a training in idleness and selfishness? The 
best place of all for the child to express the 
Christian spirit is in obedient, faithful work
-P-A-G-E-135
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 123 
at home, and in the unselfish spirit shown 
in the home relations. To allow a child to 
grow up in idleness and selfishness at home 
is a hideous wrong, that even the most scien- 
tific analysis of his needs, and the most peda- 
gogic meeting of them by a teacher, can 
never make good. A reasonable return to 
the use of home “chores,” of which Charles 
Dudley Warner writes so feelingly in his 
Being a Boy, would be a very distinct contri- 
bution to the real religious education of 
countless children. I doubt if there is any 
greater single need today, in religious edu- 
cation, in the broad sense, than the need 
that parents should take pains to see that 
children have some useful service to render 
daily in the home, and learn there some 
thoughtful, unselfish consideration of others. 
6. As to the peculiarly religious expres- 
sion of the Christian life—in prayer, Bible 
study, speaking to others either privately or 
publicly on religious themes, and taking part 
in the membership and activities of the 
Church—if the Christian fellowship has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
124 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
what it ought to be, and if an objective his- 
torical method has been followed in the 
teaching of the Bible, much of this, I believe, 
will follow in time, in the most natural and 
wholesome way, almost as a matter of course. 
The child will find himself drawn out toward 
God in some natural expression of his own 
life in prayer and in Bible study. Some ele- 
mentary instruction in the real meaning of 
prayer, Bible study, so-called “testimony,” 
and church membership, that will enable 
the child to see how exactly analogous these 
all are to what he does in other spheres of 
his life, may greatly help his sense of reality 
here, and save him: from formality and sham. 
One caution seems to me important as to 
prayer. Children’s prayers should be directed 
much more to the easily understood demands 
of duty, and less to mere asking for things. 
And, as the relation to God in Christ 
comes to have some real meaning to the 
child, some expression in speech will tend 
to follow. At first, if the child’s life is nor- 
mal, such expression will quite certainly be 
   
-P-A-G-E-137
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 125 
along ethical lines, and may be thus of real 
value. The religious life is primarily, for a 
child, a call to do the right thing. The re- 
lation to God, in its deeper bearing on the 
very springs of living, and the glory of the 
inner life of Christ, the child can hardly ap- 
preciate at first; and he should not be forced 
to any expression here. That will come in 
due time. It is perilous to crowd children 
to peculiarly religious expression in meetings; 
for expression before conscious experience 
is a direct training in dishonest cant. 
Still less is formal doctrine to be thrust 
on the child. The only value of a doctrinal 
statement is that it is an honest expression 
of a truth which has become real and vital 
for one in his own experience. Such state- 
ments of doctrine can grow only with one’s 
growing life; they cannot be learned out of 
a book. The one imperative thing, then, for 
the child, is to bring him into a genuine 
religious life of his own. Life first, and then 
its expression; not the expression of some- 
one else in order to life. The danger of the
-P-A-G-E-138
126 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
dogmatic catechetical method here is real 
and great. It is perhaps not unimportant for 
us to note, too, that Christ’s method in bring- 
ing his disciples to the confession of his 
Messiahship, was one of punctilious avoid- 
ance of all dogmatic statements upon the 
matter. 
III. THE SPIRIT OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 
The true spirit of religious education has 
been already implied. The wise use of these 
greatest means of personal association and 
expressive activity certainly requires scrupu- 
lous respect for the personality of the pupil, 
and a prevailing mood of objectivity. 
1. On the one hand, we may never forget 
that the whole aim of moral and religious 
education is to bring the individual to a faith 
and life of his own; and this requires at 
every step the greatest pains to guard the 
other’s own moral initiative. The very high- 
est mark, I believe, of the moral and re- 
ligious life, is a deep sense of the value and 
sacredness of the individual person. No one
-P-A-G-E-139
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 127 
can be brought to that by the overriding 
of his own personality by others. I may not 
dwell upon it, but it seems to me that the 
one absolutely indispensable requirement in 
a true religious education is, that it should 
be pervaded through and through with a 
deep reverence for the person of the pupil; 
and this often has a decisive bearing upon 
methods. 
2. On the other hand, if, as modern psy- 
chology insists, we are made for action, and 
no experience is normally completed until it 
issues in action, then the normal mood, it 
would seem, must be the mood of activity, 
of work, not of passivity or brooding —ob- 
jectivity, not subjectivity or introspection. 
All personal relations and all work suffer 
from undue. preoccupation with our own 
states. Only so much introspection as to be 
sure that one is really fulfilling the objective 
conditions of life, is either needed or wise. 
We are to fulfil the conditions, and count 
upon the results. Here, too, I may not stop 
for ampler justification and application of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
128 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
principle, but can only declare my conviction - 
that the clear teaching of psychology indicates 
that the prevailing mood in religious edu- 
cation must be one of objectivity, not, as has 
been perhaps most often the case, one of 
introspection. This principle will plainly 
affect the methods used. 
In a word, then, modern psychology and 
pedagogy seem to me to demand that re- 
ligious teachers should constantly recognize 
the complexity of life and the unity of the 
nature of man, that they should use as their 
greatest means, personal association and ex- 
pressive activity; and that they should per- 
meate all their work with the spirit of deep 
reverence for the person, and with the 
prevailingly objective mood.

AS METHODS OF CONVERTING MEN: 
A HISTORICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
STUDY. 
I. THE PRESSURE OF THE QUESTION 
THE difficulty involved in our question is 
felt today by many of the most thoughtful, 
not only in the Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciation, but in all branches of the Church. 
And I have therefore felt that I should make 
the discussion not less but more valuable it 
I dealt with it in its larger bearings, and 
not merely within the lines of Association 
work. The question presses upon every 
earnest Christian man. For men cannot fail 
to see that in the history of the Church great 
numbers have been added to its member- 
ship in times of revival. With whatever 
qualifications he may choose to make, it is 
impossible for a thoughtful, honest Christian 
man to question the immense service ren- 
dered to mankind by such movements as 
I (129)
-P-A-G-E-142
  I30 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
those of Wesley, Whitefield, Edwards, Fin- 
ney and Moody. And the Christian turns 
with sorrow to the comparatively small 
additions to the churches made in recent 
years, and naturally asks if the trouble be 
not wholly in the abandonment of revival 
methods. 
But this practically general abandonment 
of revival methods is itself a phenomenon 
demanding explanation, and seems to imply 
that conscientious Christian men feel some 
serious difficulty in the use of the older 
revival methods. The comparatively small 
success in recent years of such efforts in our 
own country, where they have been contin- 
ued on the old lines, points to the same 
explanation. 
The thoughtful, candid man finds himself, 
therefore, on this theme drawn in two direc- 
tions and honestly perplexed. Can we wisely 
continue the older revival methods? Are 
effective modifications possible? What is the 
relation in which the revival method stands 
to the method of Christian training? Are 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL I3I 
they different methods for doing the same 
thing? Ought they to be or can they be 
mutually exclusive of one another? Are they 
supplementary, one of the other? Such 
questions as these are being seriously asked 
by many in most of the churches. 
Even in the most evangelical churches, 
then, we seem to have to recognize a chang- 
ing feeling, whether justified or not, con- 
cerning revival methods. Some have adopted 
methods of education as consciously and 
definitely exclusive of revival methods. Some 
are urging and defending revival methods, 
but somewhat apologetically and with greater 
or less consciousness of reacting against a 
tendency and not with the sure abandon of 
earlier days, and yet believing that only 
such methods are adequate to the end sought. 
Some, seeing certain large results from both 
methods, are trying to feel their way to an 
adjustment that may enable them to avoid 
the dangers of both, and to preserve the best 
fruits of both. 
In the sacerdotal churches, on the other
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
hand, it is to be noted there has been some 
change toward something very like the 
revival method, in the so-called “retreats” 
and “missions.” 
Il. THE CAUSES OF THE CHANGED FEELING 
CONCERNING REVIVAL METHODS 
Granted, now, that there is some real 
change in feeling concerning revivals, even 
in the most evangelical churches, can we 
point out any of the causes that have brought 
it about? 
1. In the first place, I think it can be said 
that the difficulties felt do not arise from the 
old unevangelical, or old-school, objections 
to revivals. The misgivings are felt by those 
who are not at all sacramentarian in their 
views, and who believe fully in man’s moral 
freedom and responsibility, and are in gen- 
eral of thoroughly evangelical temper. The 
present common misgiving concerning revi- 
val methods is due, then, to something other 
than the objections which the earlier revi- 
valists had to meet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
    
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 133 
2. No doubt, a part of the difficulty felt 
is due to a sense of disappointment in a care- 
ful estimate of the results of revival work, 
especially in the last few years. A larger 
number of the church than formerly seem 
not at all helped but even estranged by the 
revival effort; the positive results seem less 
significant, and the reaction following more 
benumbing. All, of course, would not agree 
in this judgment in any community; but this 
certainly does not misstate the belief of many 
honest men, who are sincerely seeking the 
progress of the Kingdom of God. 
3. For many, too, it can hardly be 
doubted, there is in ordinary: revival meth- 
ods a disagreeable sense, however reluctantly 
confessed, of an artificial and not wholly 
worthy attempt to work men up to a certain 
state of feeling. This jars upon something 
of the best in their own religious instinct, 
though they may not be able to state the 
precise point of objection. 
4. Moreover, besides the opposition that 
any aggressive movement for righteousness
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
must expect from all carelessness and selfish- 
ness and sin, any such means as the revival, 
however justified, must reckon with the often 
unconscious but very heavy trammel of the 
moderate and half-bored temper of so-called 
“good society,” that shows an inordinate fear 
of all that is unconventional and of all enthu- 
siasms, and a better based and equally strong 
fear of crankiness and all extremes. Few of 
us probably recognize how powerful an 
inhibition the customary and conventional 
lay upon us. And the “normal” and “sane” 
may easily come to mean simply conventional 
and monotonous mediocrity. Doubtless even 
conscientious Christians are unconsciously not 
wholly unaffected by this motive in the diffi- 
culty they feel concerning revival efforts. 
But I cannot think that the serious ques- 
tioning raised concerning revivals is most 
largely due to any of the causes mentioned, 
or to mere deadness in the church. The 
earnest and conscientious are too evidently 
not upon one side of this question. Some 
wide-working and deep- going causes have
-P-A-G-E-147
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 135 
been in action that have affected practically 
the entire church in its thought and feel- 
ing. Can we discern those probable causes? 
5. In the first place, among the strong 
and deeply underlying reasons both why 
revival effort is entered upon with greater 
hesitancy, and why when used it is often 
less effective, is the unquestionable fact that, 
because of such an influx of new and impor- 
tant ideas as was probably never before 
concentered upon any single generation, our 
age has been in peculiar degree a transition age. 
It is worth while to remind you of John 
Fiske’s forcible words upon this point: “In 
their mental habits, in their methods of 
inquiry, and in the data at their command, 
the men of the present day who have fully 
kept pace with the scientific movement are 
separated from the men whose education 
ended in 1830 by an immeasurably wider 
gulf than has ever before divided one pro- 
gressive generation of men from their prede- 
991 
cessors.”' QOur points of view, our modes 
1 The Idea of God, pp. 56, 57. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  136 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of conception, our favorite analogies, our 
methods of argument, our very language, 
have all been inevitably affected. To keep, 
now, the same great Christian truths real 
to ourselves, and to be able to make them 
real to others, we must have some degree 
of restatement. Questions, too, often very 
far-reaching, have been inevitably raised by 
the new ideas for great multitudes of minds. 
Now, invective and condemnation do not 
answer questions, nor does mere dogmatic 
repetition of old forms of statement. “The 
wounds of knowledge,” said Julius Miller 
profoundly, “can be healed only by knowl- 
edec.” 
by these new ideas in greatly differing de- Of course, men have been affected 
gree; but in most intelligent communities 
the period of the recent years in religious 
thought has been distinctly one of more or 
less conscious questioning, and of the felt 
need of transition from older to newer state- 
ments of the great Christian truths. This 
simply means that, in the providence of God, 
many lines of progress outside of religion
-P-A-G-E-149
  
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 137 
concentered upon this age, and so gave to 
this generation in religion preéminently the 
task of facing and solving the problems of 
a transition age, with the involved effective 
restating of the great Christian truths. This 
is no mean task, and it may ultimately mean 
as much for the life and growth of the church 
as the immediate addition of great numbers 
to its membership. 
We may not proudly assume that we have 
already made an exhaustive study of the 
hearts of men, or that we have already pene- 
trated the full meaning of the Gospel and 
mastered beyond improvement the teaching 
of Jesus, and so reached the ideal statement 
of the Gospel for all time, even supposing 
that to be ever possible. Are we. quite sure 
that this profound satisfaction with exactly 
the old forms of statement does not mean a 
degree of unteachableness concerning the 
present teaching of the Spirit? Ought we 
not to hope for and to expect increasing 
grasp of Christian truth, and increasing 
power in putting ite? And, if this is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
138 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
peculiar providential task of our time, let 
us not underrate it, and let us not shirk it, 
and, above all, let us not decry it. Our gen- 
eration needs to give special and solemn 
heed to these deep sentences of Fairbairn, 
if we are really to meet the duty God lays 
upon us: “The Church, so long as it believes 
in the divinity of its Founder, is bound to 
have a history which shall consist of succes- 
sive and progressively successful attempts to 
return to Him. He can never be transcended ; 
all it can ever be is contained in Him; but 
its ability to interpret Him and realize his 
religion ought to be a developing ability.”? 
But such a period of transition and such 
a task of restatement necessarily preclude 
quite the same results in evangelistic efforts. 
For, in the first place, the preachers are 
feeling their way only gradually into the most 
effective modes of putting the truth in this 
new generation. And, in the second place, 
the inevitable questionings of the hearers 
prevent an easy and positive assent to the 
\The Place of Christ in Modern Theology, p. 152.
-P-A-G-E-151
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 139 
truth. This is especially the case in revival 
work, since it has very commonly gone for- 
ward, in much of its preaching and method, 
upon presuppositions now called in question 
by many. Now, though every bit of the 
preaching were true, and every piece of the 
method were fully justified in the abstract, 
this psychological state of mind of the hearers 
would be certain to affect the result. If the 
questioning and feeling of transition existed 
only in sporadic cases, they might leave re- 
vival effort comparatively unaffected; but 
touching, as they do, a large proportion of 
the most thoughtful and influential in the 
church, the fundamental conditions of revi- 
val work are strikingly changed. The fact, 
then, that this is, in the most marked degree, 
a transition age, at least for very many of the 
most thoughtful in the church, is one of the 
greatest reasons for the difficulty felt con- 
cerning revival methods, as well as for the 
comparatively small accessions to the mem- 
bership of the church in the recent years. 
Even our best revivalists have very com-
-P-A-G-E-152
_ 140 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
monly recognized something like this in 
their sense of the need of giving themselves 
in late years more especially to the building 
up of the life of Christians rather than to 
the bringing of larger numbers into the 
Christian life. 
6. But some of the very ideas, the coming 
in of which has made this a peculiarly transi- 
tion age, have tended directly to affect our 
feeling concerning revival methods. As a 
scientific age we have been studying, as no 
preceding age has ever studied, God’s 
method of working in the external world, 
and we have become deeply impressed with 
the way in which /aw and growth prevail in 
the divine method. Now, this is well-nigh 
revolutionary of .much of our religious think- 
ing and feeling. It simply means that, almost 
unconsciously to ourselves, we have, to a con- 
siderable extent, changed our view of what 
constitutes the characteristic marks of the divine 
working. Whereas, earlier, it was exactly the 
sudden, the unaccountable, the lawless, that 
seemed to us most surely assignable to the
-P-A-G-E-153
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL I4I 
  Divine; now, under the influence of the 
strong conviction of the prevalence of law 
and of growth in all God’s working, we have 
come to fear, in all sudden, mysterious, 
tumultuous experiences, the presence of the 
magical and superstitious in religion, and to 
fear all lawless upheavals as abnormal and 
unhelpful to the real goal of life. This great 
change in point of view makes us estimate 
the most striking phenomena of a revival 
very differently than our fathers estimated 
them. At the best, permeated, as we cannot 
help being, if we have been awake at all to 
the great scientific movements of our time— 
permeated with these ideas of law and of 
growth, we are forced to raise serious ques- 
tions concerning the meaning and value of 
the revival method. This is not the result 
of any premeditated wilfulness in religious 
matters; it is rather simply an inevitable 
change in point of view that in most cases, 
probably, has taken place almost uncon- 
sciously and even against their own desire. 
The persistent influence of the ideas of
-P-A-G-E-154
  I42 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
law and of growth, then, is another strong 
cause of the change in feeling concerning 
revival methods, though we may later find 
that this change is not wholly justified. 
7. Furthermore, for various reasons, into 
which I need not here go, there has come 
into all the churches a much more ethical con- 
ception of Christianity, that tends to make 
much less of emotional “frames of mind” and 
looks everywhere mainly to fruit in life. 
This temper of mind necessarily sets small 
store by great experiences simply as such; 
and it is, perhaps, likely sometimes short- 
sightedly to undervalue them even as means. 
The trend toward this thoroughly ethical 
conception of religion has been, on the 
whole, undoubtedly most wholesome; but 
it has, quite as certainly, naturally tended to 
count less important than the earlier con- 
ception, the marked experiences of revivals. 
8. Once more, the so-called “voluntaristic 
trend” in modern psychology, the vast devel- 
opment in the line of organization in our 
time, and, in general, what has been well
-P-A-G-E-155
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 143 
called our “stupendous reliance upon ma- 
chinery”—all tend, no doubt, to lay emphasis 
upon external action, organization and product, 
rather than upon any inner state; and just 
so far tend to make seem less important to 
us the revival’s plain aim to deepen the inner 
religious life. Rightly impatient of a selfish, 
sentimental and benumbing occupation with 
one’s own states of mind, rightly insistent 
that feeling or meditation that is to mean 
anything to us or to men must be put into 
act, the trend of which we are here speaking, 
which is powerfully at work upon us all, 
no doubt tends to raise serious questions 
concerning the value of the revival—ques- 
tions in part justified, in part not justified. 
These, then, seem to me to be among the 
most important causes of the changed feel- 
ing concerning revivals that has passed over 
the evangelical churches: the fact that this 
is, in peculiar degree, a transitional and ques- 
tioning period; the powerful influence of 
the ideas of law and of growth; the increas- 
ingly ethical conception of Christianity; and
-P-A-G-E-156
144 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
the immense emphasis of our time upon 
action. It is probably possible for a wise 
evangelism to give due weight to all these 
considerations. 
III. OUR PROBLEM 
Our title implies the recognition of the 
need of conversion, of bringing all men into 
some really new life. It assumes that both 
the methods of religious training and the 
methods of the revival look to essentially the 
same goal—the bringing about of the con- 
verted state, and of the development of that 
state. And it asks us to compare the methods 
as to their value in bringing about conversion. 
Now, from the point of view of the psy- 
chological process, James defines conversion 
to be “the process, gradual or sudden, by 
which a self hitherto divided, and consciously 
wrong, inferior and unhappy, becomes uni- 
fied and consciously right, superior and 
happy, in consequence of its firmer hold 
upon religious realities.” I think we may 
‘The Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 189. 
   
-P-A-G-E-157
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 145 
well accept this as an essentially correct 
definition of the psychological process in- 
volved, where the change has taken place 
in practically adult life. And from this point 
of view we should be led to compare Chris- 
tian training and the revival as to their 
power to give men firmer hold upon the 
“religious realities,” so as to bring them 
some consciousness of unity, rightness, con- 
quest and joy. No doubt, this definition, as 
an induction from many striking cases of 
conversion, will be, if there is any differ- 
ence, rather favorable than otherwise to the 
method of the revival. 
From the definitely Christian view of the 
goal of the religious life, we should probably 
prefer to say that the end of all religious effort 
for men must be to bring them into actual 
communion with the living God in Christ— 
into sharing his character and joy. That is a 
tremendous goal. We can well afford to lay 
aside all prejudice and to give willing heed 
to anything that will make the attainment of 
that goal more certain. Here a comparison 
J
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of the methods of Christian training and of 
the revival leads us to ask: How can a man 
come most certainly into an actual sharing 
of the life of God? How can that life in 
relation to God be made to him most real, 
most rational, most vital? 
IV. OPPOSING SOLUTIONS 
Many, now, feel that only through the 
essential methods of the revival can real 
conversion ever be obtained. They lay em- 
phasis on the fact that the change must be 
wrought by God, and so demand an experi- 
ence that seems to come from something 
plainly beyond the man himself. Where such 
an experience is wanting, they feel that they 
must deny the presence of the divine life in 
the soul. To such it is likely to seem im- 
possible that any training or educational 
process could take the place of such an 
experience as a revival may give. They 
would say with Herrmann, “The certainty 
of God is not the product of human
-P-A-G-E-159
    
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 147 
strivings”; and that would seem to them to 
mean the necessity of some marked, prob- 
ably sudden, experience. To depend wholly 
upon an educational process seems to them 
to leave out the vital divine element alto- 
gether. 
Others, just as earnest in their desire to 
build up the Kingdom of God, are, for one 
reason or another, afraid of all methods that 
look to the production of such marked 
experiences. They feel that at best such 
experiences involve great dangers of various 
kinds; and that the insistence upon such 
methods as indispensable is a virtual denial 
of God in the larger part of life; and they, 
consequently, would use only educational 
processes—the method of careful, prayerful, 
all-round scientific Christian training—con- 
forming the whole man, body and mind, 
more and more to the Christian ideal. Such 
lay emphasis upon the fact that, however 
marked the religious experience that comes 
to a man, if it is to be of any real value to 
him he must put it patiently, steadily into
-P-A-G-E-160
148 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
act. He must go down from his mount of 
vision to make all things according to the 
pattern shown him in the mount. That is, 
they would say, the steady conforming of 
the man to the Christian ideal is the real 
goal in any case; and, if that is done, the 
experience is, at least, unnecessary; and, con- 
sidering the attendant dangers, had better 
not be sought.   
V. TEMPERAMENTAL DIFFERENCES 
Now, in comparing these two views and 
methods, one can hardly avoid being influ- 
enced by his own predominant type of expe- 
rience. Almost inevitably we are all likely to 
make our own expertence the norm, and to 
conclude that the precise way in which we 
have been led into our best life and vision of 
God is the way in which every one should 
travel. We are all liable to a good deal of 
intolerance here; and all the more liable, 
because the interests at stake seem to us so 
great. 
1. Illustrated in Other Spheres.—It may 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 149 
help us to charity and patience with one 
another here, to remind ourselves that 
one of the things that modern psychology 
has been making most clear is that, along 
with great likeness in the fundamental char- 
acteristics, men differ very greatly in many 
temperamental qualities; and that these differ- 
ences affect very much the direction and 
color of their mental life, their predominant 
temptations, their particular needs. In minor 
matters, perhaps, most of us understand this 
well and act upon the knowledge. We under- 
stand that, for successful living, we need to 
know ourselves. As to our bodies we have 
come to see, according to the proverb, that 
“what is one man’s meat is another’s poison.” 
But men have been much less quick to see 
that no single prescription of some particular 
mental process could be a universal panacea. 
For example, some men are predominantly 
intellectual in their temper; some predom- 
inantly emotional; and some predominantly 
volitional. It takes little thought to see 
that the prevailing temptations of these
-P-A-G-E-162
    
  150 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
men will be quite different. The first is 
tempted to hard, cold dogmatism; the second 
to simple sentimentalism; and the third to 
pure obstinacy. And any precise counsel, that 
would meet the need of one, would be quite 
beside the mark and might even prove 
injurious with the others. 
So, again, men differ greatly in their 
natural estimate of themselves. Some, of 
course, habitually overestimate themselves; 
but others, just as clearly, are persistently 
self-depreciative. An experience that would 
help one of these classes would be likely to 
be distinctly harmful to the other. 
Once more, men differ greatly as to kind 
of memory. To take a single illustration, 
bearing directly upon the moral and spiritual 
life. Some men have what might be called 
an Indian memory: they have a very vivid 
remembrance of all the ills and injuries of 
their lives; these things they seem unable to 
forget. For the good things of their experi- 
ence, on the other hand, their memory is 
correspondingly bad. Other men_ exactly 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL I5I 
reverse this condition, and show a most 
retentive memory for the pleasant and_ suc- 
cessful experiences of life, and but the slightest 
memory of failures and injuries. How diver- 
gent are the weaknesses and temptations of 
these two classes! how different a matter, for 
example, is the duty of forgiveness for the 
two! 
Perhaps these illustrations of mental dif- 
ferences may suffice to show that, particularly 
in all that concerns vital interests, we cannot 
afford to ignore or forget the mental dif- 
ferences of men, and that we may well be 
particularly patient with one another in con- 
sidering the varieties of religious experience. 
And when we turn to the marked dif- 
ferences in religious experiences, we may 
be, perhaps, still further helped by recalling 
that we have probably all had some experi- 
ence in common life of the fact that there 
are two ways in which we may come into the 
appreciation of any great interest or value: (1) 
we may be surprised into it, and then choose 
it for its own sake, though we should not
-P-A-G-E-164
152 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
have chosen it before; or, (2) in trust in the 
testimony of others, we may go ahead and 
of deliberate purpose venture all in the faith 
that the value shall be ours. Probably most 
of us take habitually one of these ways in 
most things of value; but, perhaps, none of 
us are entirely without some experience in 
both ways, that may give us the key to under- 
stand the most marked differences in religious 
experiences. 
For example, probably most of us were 
rather surprised into our experience of the 
joy of a really unselfish love. We waked up 
with a kind of start to the fact that we really 
did love some one unselfishly, and that it 
was a great joy. [Then we could choose such 
a love for its own sake, though from the 
previous selfish point of view it would have 
been impossible for us to conceive how an 
unselfish love could bring joy. 
But, occasionally, a man, say under some 
great bereavement or loss, quite benumbed 
in his relations to others and almost dis- 
tracted, may say to himself in cold blood: “I
-P-A-G-E-165
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 153 
simply must throw myself into some unselfish 
work for others; I know, either from my 
own previous experience or through the testi- 
mony of others whom I cannot doubt, that 
I shall find in such service new life and joy.” 
And without feeling and without any im- 
mediate experience he goes steadily forward, 
to find in the end his bold voluntary venture 
justified, and unselfish love proving a joy. 
The final experience is much the same in 
both cases, but the way to it quite dif- 
ferent. In one case the whole experience 
seems like a sudden out-and-out gift from 
something outside the individual’s own life; 
in the other case it seems like the plain 
reward of a hard-won battle of his own. 
So, too, in the matter of the value of a 
college course, there are those who, in some 
previous study or experience, have waked 
up to warm appreciation of the value of a 
college course and choose it, from the start, 
in the light of such an experience, heartily 
and gladly for its own sake. But many seem 
unable to get any such previous vision that
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
makes the value of the course seem real. 
They enter upon their college study some- 
what doggedly, even if in good spirit, relying 
upon the testimony of parents and teachers 
and college men, that they will find that the 
course will richly repay them. They have to 
go forward in faith, with set will. And some 
come only very gradually, in later life, to 
‘any real appreciation of what the college 
course meant to them. These two classes of 
cases came into their first appreciation of 
the value of a college course in very different 
ways. 
Or, to take one more example, sometimes 
we come upon.an idea in our reading that 
we recognize at once is most important, per- 
haps revolutionary for us, the momentous 
‘bearing of which upon our previous think- 
ing stands out immediately as in vision; and 
we mark the day of its discovery as a day of 
crisis in our intellectual life. But our expe- 
rience may be quite different. We note the 
idea as, indeed, of passing interest, but seem 
little touched by it. But little by little we
-P-A-G-E-167
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 155 
find ourselves continually recurring to it, 
until it forces itself finally upon our attention 
as a master-idea in our thinking. A little 
experience in newspaper-clipping would per- 
haps suffice to convince a man of these dif- 
ferent ways in which ideas strike him. How 
often we painfully clip and file the thing we 
never use, and leave all unclipped the thing 
we discover later we wanted most of all. 
Why is there this difference in the appre- 
ciation of ideas? Why is the significance of 
one idea appreciated at once, and of another 
only very gradually? The answer seems to 
be that the preparation for the appreciation 
of one idea has been going on for some time 
quite unconsciously ; when the idea appeared, 
you were ready for it; its full significance 
was manifest at once. It served to complete 
the little that was lacking in the electric 
circuit, and the light appeared forthwith. In 
the case of the other idea there was no such 
adequate previous preparation, and the sig- 
nificance of the idea for our thinking could 
not be immediately discerned. Here we had,
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
gradually and with more or less conscious- 
ness, to work out our fuller preparation for 
an appreciation of the idea; it grew upon us 
somewhat steadily, until we came to see how 
commanding a place it really held in our 
thinking. In both cases the discernment of 
the full significance of the idea for our life 
required preparation; in the one case that 
preparation had been made beforehand un- 
consciously; in the other case, in consid- 
erable part, it had to be made afterward 
and much more consciously. But it should 
be noted that in either way an idea may 
become for a man absolutely commanding. 
Its significance for his life does not depend 
upon the way in which he reaches it. His 
habitual way of coming to his ideas is likely 
to depend upon his temperament, though 
the same man may: use different ways in 
different cases. 
2. Temperamental ‘Differences in Religion.— 
From these illustrations, now, of the two 
different ways in which men seem to come 
into the appreciation of great interests and
-P-A-G-E-169
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 157 
values, let us turn directly to note the differ- 
ences in the religious experience itself. Our 
illustrations may help us to recognize the 
same two ways in conversion. 
Thus James says:' “There is thus a con- 
scious and voluntary way and an involuntary 
and unconscious way in which mental results 
may get accomplished; and we find both 
ways exemplified in the history of conversion, 
giving us two types, which Starbuck calls 
the volitional type and the type by self-surrender 
respectively. In the volitional type the regen- 
erative change is usually gradual, and con- 
sists in the building up, piece by piece, of a 
new set of moral and spiritual habits.”? In 
the self-surrender type the change seems sud- 
den, and the effects in life immediate. 
It seems also wholly probable, as in our 
previous illustrations, that the differences in 
the method of conversion are primarily due 
'In this part of the discussion, I use freely James’ The Varieties 
of Religious Experience, because it is the fullest inductive study we 
have of religious phenomena, and is made with great psychological 
insight. 
2 Op. cit., p. 206.
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
to psychological differences in men. As 
James says again, we are led “to suspect that 
what makes the difference between a sudden 
and a gradual convert is not necessarily the 
presence of divine miracle in the case of 
one and something less divine in that of the. 
other, but rather a simple psychological pecu- 
liarity, the fact, namely, that in the recipient 
of the more instantaneous grace we have one 
of those Subjects who are in possession of 
a large region in which mental work can 
go on subliminally, and from which invasive 
experiences, abruptly upsetting the equi- 
librium of the primary consciousness, may 
come.”? 
And this psychological explanation may 
well bring real relief to many a conscientious 
Christian worker in revival seasons, who has 
seen expected marked experiences come to 
one, and not come to another who had 
manifestly met with equal completeness all 
the moral conditions. If we will speak 
with entire frankness, is it not simply true 
+ Op. cit., pii237.
-P-A-G-E-171
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 159 
that, in more than one such case, where the 
expected experience did not come, we have 
simply not been able honestly to convince 
ourselves that the difficulty was a moral one? 
We may not wisely shut our eyes to the 
plain fact that, where marked experiences are 
insisted upon as indispensable, while, on the 
one hand, the revival is the scene of many 
joyful and delivering experiences, it is, also, 
on the other hand, the scene of painful 
despairing disappointments. Given equal 
honesty of moral purpose in surrender to 
God, and the only natural explanation of 
these facts is to be found in psychological 
differences. 
I do not see that religion need to shrink 
at all from this conclusion. For, as in our 
previous illustrations, we have good reason 
to believe that the different ways of reaching 
the result do not affect the value of the result. 
And the two methods of conversion—the 
sudden and the gradual—are not, after all, 
so far apart. Intelligent revivalism might be 
called a hastened evolutionary process. And
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
the method of Christian training only intro- 
duces more gradually much the same motives 
that an intelligent revivalism employs. Both 
methods seek to produce a change in the 
man. Both have much the same ultimate 
ideal of life. Both need some preparation, 
conscious or unconscious. In neither is the 
process absolutely continuous. In neither is 
the process absolutely sudden. For, as James 
says, “even in the most voluntarily built up 
sort of regeneration there are passages of 
partial self-surrender interposed.”? Or, as it 
may be put, “there are always critical points 
here at which the movement forward seems 
much more rapid.” So, “our education in 
any practical accomplishment proceeds appar- 
ently by jerks and starts, just as the growth 
of our physical bodies does.”? 
That is, the most normal and gradual 
growth has its crises large or small, its 
moments of special insight, its sober and 
strenuous moods, the birth-times of great 
convictions and decisions. No growth, ap- 
' Op. cit., p. 208. 7 Op. cit., p. 206.
-P-A-G-E-173
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 161 
parently, proceeds at a perfectly uniform rate. 
The opposition to critical moments may, thus, 
become quite chimerical—an opposition that 
that is at war with all the facts. And the most 
sudden and dazzling moments of insight, on 
the other hand, have really had long prepara- 
tion, and require preceding and succeeding 
experience to bring out their full meaning; 
and their real value can be tested only in 
life. The two methods of conversion, then, 
we may well believe, are neither psychologi- 
cally nor logically absolutely disparate; they 
are simply methods, probably, that fit two 
different types of mind. And from this point 
of view, as James suggests, the contrasts 
between these types of mind “cease to be 
the radical antagonisms which many think 
them.” “The final consciousness which each 
‘type reaches of union with the divine has 
the same practical significance for the indi- 
vidual; and individuals may well be allowed 
to get it by the channels which are most open 
to their several temperaments.”?

VI. IS SUDDENNESS A SURE MARK OF THE 
DIVINE WORKING? 
1. Why Suddenness 1s not to be Emphasized. 
—The only objection which can well be 
made to this conclusion is the reiterated claim 
that only the sudden experiences by reason 
of their very suddenness bear the mark of 
the divine. And we may well face still more 
explicitly this objection. James puts the 
question very clearly: “Is an instantaneous 
conversion a miracle in which God is present 
as He is present in no change of heart less 
strikingly abrupte Are there two classes of 
human beings, even among the apparently 
regenerate, of which the one class really 
partakes of Christ’s nature while the other 
merely seems to do so?”? 
(1) Now, in the first place, it is to be 
noted, as we have just seen, that the two 
methods or classes of conversion cannot be   
absolutely separated from each other even 
in this matter of suddenness. The most 
1 Op. cit., p. 230.
-P-A-G-E-175
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 163 
gradual conversion has its marked and sig- 
nificant crises. 
(2) In the second place, if the compara- 
tively greater suddenness of the one class of 
experiences is due to temperamental differ-— 
ences in men, as we have seen that psycho- 
logical study has made probable, it is difficult 
to count the suddenness as such more a mark 
of the divine working than the _ gradual 
change. Thus, for example, the results of 
Professor Coe’s inquiries, Professor James 
believes, “strikingly confirm the view that 
sudden conversion is connected with the 
possession of an active subliminal self.”? 
(3) In the third place, no truly religious 
man who believes that God is creator of 
him—body and mind—can doubt that God 
makes a most significant revelation of Him- 
self in the very laws of man’s being. And 
certainly no genuinely Christian man, who 
believes Christ’s teaching and revelation of 
God as the seeking Father, can call in 
question God’s continuous working with us. 
‘Op. cit., p. 240.
-P-A-G-E-176
    164. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
(4) Moreover, we may not forget that 
to so exclusively emphasize the divineness 
of the sudden is a virtual denial of God’s 
presence in the rest of life, that is ultimately 
really irreligious in its tendency; for such 
exclusive emphasis seems tacitly to imply 
that God is at work only at the points so 
emphasized. 
(s) And, once more, religion, like any 
ideal view, is never primarily interested in 
the mechanism of the process, whether 
gradual or sudden—but in the significance 
of the process. Its question is never, How 
did the thing come to be? but, What does it 
mean? What is its end? The change itself 
is the vital and the significant thing; z¢ must 
be the witness of the divineness of the work. 
2. The True Tests of Religious Experience.— 
In other words, we can never safely set up 
certain external or psychological tests of the 
divine life in man. We can only make our 
appeal to Christ’s test—“By their fruits ye 
shall know them.” The only certain evidence 
of God’s presence in the life of a man is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 165 
be seen in his spirit and conduct. “By this 
shall all men know that ye are my disciples, 
if ye have love one for another.” “The fruit 
of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, 
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, 
temperance.” 
Or, to state the matter in more philosoph- 
ical terms, we may say, with James, that the 
value of religious opinions and experiences 
“can only be ascertained by spiritual judg- 
ments directly passed upon them, judgments 
based on our own immediate feeling pri- 
marily; and secondarily on what we can 
ascertain of their experimental relations to our 
moral needs and to the rest of what we hold 
as true. Immediate luminousness, in short, phil- 
osophical reasonableness, and moral helpfulness 
are the only available criteria.”? 
I have been myself in the habit of stating 
essentially the same three tests, in saying 
that the value of any religious teaching or 
method or experience for any given person 
depended on its power to make the spiritual 
‘Op. cit., p. 18. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
166 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
world and the religious life real, rational 
and vital—to make them seem to the man 
(1) undoubted realities, (2) knit up with his 
best thinking in other spheres, and (3) with 
clear significance for life, as appeal and im- 
pulse to character, and as bringing enlarge- 
ment and enrichment into life. 
Now, when we so test the two methods 
of conversion, each may be seen to have 
certain advantages. 
That a thing should be rea/ for us, in the 
first place, depends on two things: on the 
one hand, it should be like enough to the 
rest of life to seem inevitably knit up with 
it; but, on the other hand, it should be dif- 
ferent enough to be felt to have a valuable 
and distinct contribution to make to life. 
Conversion through a sudden and striking 
experience, no doubt, more easily meets the 
second condition; the method of Christian 
training and growth more easily meets the 
first condition. For the sudden conversion 
gives undoubtedly a more intense and im- 
mediate sense of reality—a sense of reality so
-P-A-G-E-179
   CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 167 
strong that the impression of it may abide 
as a permanent source of conviction for life. 
But, on the other hand, it is less easy to 
connect convincingly such experiences with 
the common daily life, and here the gradual 
conversion has the advantage. 
The same fact makes it easier for the 
method of Christian training to show the 
rationality of the religious life. Its processes 
are everywhere closely akin to those ration- 
ally approved in other spheres of life. And 
it is guided by the same sober judgment, 
chastened by long experience. It can appeal, 
also, to more common and constant analogies. 
In the direct appeal to the ethical result 
in life, to the moral helpfulness of the change, 
the sudden conversion is naturally likely to 
show more immediate and striking results, 
but also shows more disappointing reactions. 
And the appeal to experience in the long 
run can hardly be held to evince the supe- 
riority of the method of sudden conversion. 
Once, again, the best method to be used 
seems to depend largely upon temperament.
-P-A-G-E-180
    168 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
The facts, as shown by the wide inductive 
inquiries of Professors James, Starbuck and 
Coe, seem to indicate simply that both 
methods have given great and beneficent 
changes. Characters of the highest type are 
to be found in both classes. If I may appeal 
to the history of my own community, Oberlin 
has had a remarkable example of each type 
in two of its successive Presidents—President 
Finney and President Fairchild. Though so 
different in natural temperament, one would 
hardly dare to say that either was superior 
to the other in his own personal character, 
or in the impress of that character upon 
others. In very different ways both did pro- 
digious work for the progress of righteousness 
and the Kingdom of God in the world. The 
immediate strength and intensity of appeal 
of the one was paralleled by the quiet all- 
round undiscounted and permanent appeal 
of the other. 
It seems only fair, then, to conclude that 
neither type or method of conversion has all 
the advantages. Both methods fairly meet
-P-A-G-E-181
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 169 
the best tests we can apply, but not always 
in equal degree. 
3. Why Suddenness Still Seems Significant.— 
But when all this has been said, there 
remains still, probably, in most minds a 
misgiving that, nevertheless, the sudden ex- 
perience is, for some reason, more manifestly 
divine. And the reason that underlies this 
misgiving, it is important for us fully to face. 
That reason, I suppose, is this: The sudden 
experience, it seems less possible to refer to 
simply human causes; we are less able to 
trace its causal connections with preceding 
human states and conditions, and, thus, are 
led to refer it more confidently to God’s direct 
work. And the religious life needs to believe 
in the reality of God’s working in and for us. 
Now, I cannot help believing that there 
is a sound instinct back of the reason so 
given. Certainly it is useless to talk about a 
religious life at all, if God cannot and does 
not come into some real effective relation to 
our inner life, and a relation, too, that means 
something more than the mere on- going of
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
our own mental processes, though our whole 
being be regarded as bestowed by God. We 
need imperatively, for the very possibility of 
genuine religion, faith in a power who is 
more and other than ourselves, and with 
whom we can come into a relation that can 
mean something practical for our life. The 
emphasis upon sudden and marked experi- 
ences, therefore, arises naturally from this 
desire and necessity of religion to believe in 
a truly living God. 
I need not argue, in this paper, for the 
reality of such an effective relation to God. 
I need not even remind you of Lotze’s words, 
spoken as a philosopher, in full view of all 
possible scientific and philosophical objec- 
tions: “There is nothing whatever that stands 
in opposition to the further conviction that 
God, at particular moments and in particular 
persons, may have stood nearer to humanity, 
or may have revealed himself at such moments 
and in such persons in a more eminent way 
than at other moments and in other persons. 
It is even without doubt legitimate to regard
-P-A-G-E-183
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 171 
the relation in which He (Christ) stood to 
God as absolutely unique, not only as to 
degree, but also as to its essential quality.” 
I need not remind you that even so radical 
a thinker as Pfleiderer can say: “And why 
should it be less possible for God to enter 
into loving fellowship with us than for men 
to do so with each other? I should be in- 
clined to think that He is even more capable 
of doing so.” 
I need not now adduce any of these gen- 
eral considerations; for between those who 
defend especially the two types of conversion 
and the two methods of Christian training 
and of revival, there is really no difference of 
opinion upon this point. Both believe and 
must believe fully in the reality of God’s 
working in and for them. Both know that 
religion is no mere human product, and are 
interested in anything that adds clearness to 
their conception of God’s relation to them.

PP- 149, 150. 
"Quoted by Orr, The Christian View of God and the World, 
. 63. 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
172 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Jn the end, I suspect, both appeal to 
essentially the same considerations. Both, that 
is, note results in their experience and life, 
which they do not see how they can ascribe 
simply to themselves, and which, because of 
the quality of the results (already considered), 
they believe may be reverently and rationally 
ascribed to God. In the one case, the results 
appealed to have probably come in one or 
a few sudden and marked experiences. In 
the other case the appeal is made to certain 
trends and leadings in the long sweep of their 
lives, that seem to them, manifestly, no part 
of their own direct planning. But in both 
cases, where there is any strong: sense of liv- 
ing relation to God day by day, appeal will 
be pretty certainly made to certain serious 
moods, moments of insight, times of high 
resolve, comparatively sudden in their appear- 
ance, and that seemed to lift them quite above 
their ordinary selves. If they believe in a 
living God at all, they can hardly fail to con- 
nect such times with God. And there is no 
good reason why they should not do so.
-P-A-G-E-185
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 173 
Experiences of this kind, that will stand the 
rational and ethical test in life, may well be 
referred to God, unless one is willing to 
believe that there is nothing higher than 
one’s self. 
In carrying out this line of thought, one 
may appeal to the analogy of other personal 
relations. The significance of all such re- 
lations seems to come upon us chiefly in 
scattered moments of sudden insight. We 
say accurately that what such a friendship 
means suddenly “came over us,” or, that 
we “awakened” to it. Moreover, it is at 
points somewhat critical that our friendships 
count most. No doubt, in both the human 
and the divine relations, the personal relation 
is exerting its steady hourly unconscious 
pressure, but what it really means to us, how 
much it can do and is doing for us, comes 
only occasionally and briefly into full con- 
sciousness. It would be difficult at each com- 
mon step to see just what definite contribution 
our friend is making to our living and think- 
ing; we can see it more clearly at the critical
-P-A-G-E-186
174. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
moments. So in our relation to God. We 
are right in inferring the real help of our 
friend and of God at these times of crisis; 
but we are not justified thereby in denying 
their influence all along; in fact, it is to this 
steady influence that we ought to awaken. 
God’s greatest work for us, no doubt, like 
that of any significant personal relation, is 
done for us chiefly in comparative uncon- 
sciousness upon our part. Probably in both 
types of conversion this is true; but in the 
abrupt type the times of crisis are fewer and 
more striking; in the gradual type they are 
comparatively frequent and so less striking. 
The psychological inquiry, as we have seen, 
naturally refers the divine working to the 
subliminal region of our minds. 
Now, there is a further ethical reason 
why God’s working for us and upon us 
should largely go on in unconsciousness in 
the subliminal sphere. Since God is trying 
to bring us to a life and character of our 
own, that shall be the result of our own 
choosing, it is of the highest importance 
   
-P-A-G-E-187
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 175 
that his relation to us should be unobtrusive, 
marked by the most delicate consideration 
for our own personality and moral initiative. 
Like a wise and loving father in relation to 
a growing child, his choices for us will not 
be forced upon us, but his activity will be 
rather in the background of our life. Because 
the life and character are to be our own, God 
seems definitely to intend that we shall not 
be able wholly to disentangle his working 
from ours. He is at work, and yet it is our 
choice; every step in our Christian life is to 
be both human and divine. 
While, then, the question of suddenness in 
religious experience is not in itself vital, and 
while our appeal must always be made to the 
tests of the real, the rational, and the ethical, 
we can still see why men have naturally made 
much of the mysterious and sudden in re- 
ligion, and why God should do much of his 
work for us in unconsciousness. And we can 
also see that both types of conversion make 
their appeal alike to phenomena essentially 
the same in their nature, because the sense
-P-A-G-E-188
  
  176 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of a living God in real effective relation to 
us is absolutely vital to religion. 
Our discussion thus far makes it probable 
that both types of conversion, and by in- 
ference both methods of religious effort, 
have their relative psychological justification. 
At the same time it has inevitably suggested 
dangers in both methods and the need of 
both. And, first, let us consider more defi- 
nitely the dangers both of the method of all- 
round Christian training, and of the method 
of the revival. Both methods agree that the 
final aim must be to bring the man into 
living communion with the living God. 
VII. THE DANGERS OF MERELY EDUCATIONAL 
METHODS 
If this is the real aim in all religious 
effort, what are the dangers of the purely 
educational methods of Christian training? 
1. The first danger seems to me to be 
that of over-emphasis upon the intellectual side. 
The almost inevitable tendency of all kinds 
of education is in this direction. A protest is
-P-A-G-E-189
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 177 
continually needed in all education in favor 
of the whole man. But the exclusively intel- 
lectual tendency is peculiarly powerful and 
peculiarly dangerous in religion. It is pecu- 
liarly powerful, because a true religious ex- 
perience that brings one really into the 
presence of God in Christ involves much 
that is searching, revolutionary, and uncom- 
fortable. It is far easier to accept from others 
proper opinions and theories of the Christian 
life, than to come into that life for ourselves. 
The tendency is peculiarly dangerous in re- 
ligion, because nowhere is so much at stake. 
But a true education is never the mere giv- 
ing of instruction. Knowledge about a thing 
can never alone give acquaintance with it. 
Knowledge about God is not acquaintance 
with him. One might conceivably have had 
the most perfectly ordered course of instruc- 
tion in religious themes, and have no part in 
any sound religious life for himself. Ger- 
many clearly shows that the most thorough- 
going religious instruction by no means in- 
sures a truly religious people. Indeed, some of 
L
-P-A-G-E-190
178 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Germany’s clearest-sighted religious teachers 
recognize the grave temptation and danger 
of substituting this religious instruction for 
religious life. And, as we try to systematize 
and perfect our religious education, as we 
surely ought to do, we must not shut our 
eyes to the danger which steadily confronts 
us, of over-emphasis upon the intellectual 
side. [he whole man must be called out in 
a living personal relation to God. The end 
is life, not a body of opinion, not a book. 
“And this is life eternal, that they should 
know Thee, the only true God, and Him 
whom Thou didst send, even Jesus Christ.” 
2. The second danger in purely edu- 
cational methods grows out of the first, and 
is the danger of Jack of a powerful grip through 
feeling upon the life of the man. We must not 
forget that it is preéminently through feeling 
that the sense of reality of all things comes. 
Feeling differs greatly, no doubt, in different 
temperaments; but only in serious patho- 
logical states is there a comparatively total 
lack of feeling that gives an awful sense of
-P-A-G-E-191
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 179 
hollowness and meaninglessness to life. We 
cannot afford to ignore or underestimate feel- 
ing in the religious life, much as we may 
deplore its excesses and all undue appeal to 
it. Feeling has its large, legitimate, and im- 
portant place in religion, as in all life. Let 
us only remember that the very possibility of 
any self-consciousness, of any moral life, and 
of any sense of reality depends upon it. Our 
motives, too, get strong hold upon us com- 
monly only through some feeling. And, above 
all, in religious education, let us not make 
the mistake of the mere drill-master. A man 
may be an admirable drill-master in Greek 
forms and constructions, and quite fail to 
awaken any real appreciative interest in Greek 
life and literature. And one may set forth 
the most orthodox theological system, and 
give no single touch of life in and with 
God. 
3. A third danger, to which the edu- 
cational method is liable, is /osing the sense of 
God in it all. Where we are doing and plan- 
ning so much as in a fully elaborated system
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of religious education, it is easy for us to 
come to think that we are virtually doing 
all. We too readily forget that, as in any 
personal relation, the knowledge of God de- 
pends upon his own personal self-revelation. 
Let me remind you once more of that deep 
word of Herrmann’s: “ The certainty of God 
is not the product of human strivings.” In 
our multiplication of means and methods 
and organizations and conventions, we easily 
come to depend too much on one another 
and too little upon God himself. It is quite 
true and most important that we are “mem- 
bers one of another,” and that many of the 
best revelations of God we get may come 
through our brethren; but if we are none 
of us anywhere in direct relation to God 
himself, our religion is of merely human 
manufacture. It gives us no such hold as it 
ought to give, upon the spiritual and eternal. 
It is to be noted that there is the same 
danger in all over-organized revival work. 
We seem to leave, as it were, no opportunity 
for any spontaneous work of God in our 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 181 
hearts. All is prescribed by our methods 
and directions. 
_ 4. Perhaps all the dangers, thus far con- 
sidered, of the training method may be 
summed up, in spite of large intellectual 
enrichment, in the danger of losing a deep 
significant inner life as the support of all outer 
activity. ‘There is no sure road to such 
depth of inner life, except through personal 
experience. The help that others can give 
must be in doing something to put one in 
the presence of the great realities whose 
power they themselves have felt. Beyond 
that, the man must go alone, to be met of 
God. There cannot be the slightest doubt 
that where religion comes to seem to men 
chiefly a matter of learning of others, there 
personal religious relation to God tends to 
drop away, and independent spiritual power 
terids to decline. Doubtless, great mistakes 
have been made in the definite seeking of 
marked religious experiences, but the attempt 
at least has kept alive the primal truth, that 
no man can live his religious life by proxy.
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
5. Once more, our entire discussion sug- 
gests, as perhaps the greatest danger of a 
purely educational method in religion, that 
it shall make, only in the opposite direction, 
the great mistake of the revival method—the 
mistake of ignoring basic temperamental dif- 
ferences between men, and insisting that the 
religious experience of all shall be upon the 
same pattern. It peculiarly concerns the 
man who wishes to base his methods of 
dealing with men upon sound psychological 
study, to bear continually in mind that the 
great truths and interests and motives simply 
do not. come to us all in the same way. 
And it is, probably, as real a mistake to 
prescribe for all men the method of gradual 
conversion as to prescribe for all the method 
of sudden conversion. We must learn, if we 
are ever to deal justly and charitably with 
another in religion, that we are not all made 
upon the same plan, nor led in the same 
way; and that we have no right to erect our 
special type of experience forthwith into a 
norm, by which all others are to be cen-
-P-A-G-E-195
  
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 183 
soriously judged by us. There is no one 
ideal method of preaching, or of religious 
appeal. God uses quite different agencies to 
appeal to different men. There is no dif- 
ficulty in these agencies working harmo- 
niously side by side, if each does not erect 
itself censoriously into the one only right 
and valuable agency. 
The man whose natural tendency is strongly 
toward educational methods in religion, must 
be especially careful not to underestimate 
the value of marked experiences, simply on | 
the ground that it seems to him that the 
immediate change in life is not particularly 
great, or because the immediate change 
produced tends somewhat to diminish. He 
must not forget that his own insights do not 
give their full result at once, and often 
diminish in direct effectiveness; and yet, it 
remains true, that the time of vision of an 
ideal, the sudden sense of one’s own possi- 
bilities, may remain a gift of permanent 
value, and of steadily lifting power.
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
VIII. THE DANGERS OF THE REVIVAL METHOD 
1. Turning, now, to the dangers of the 
revival method, let me say at once that 
probably no danger has been so great in the 
history of revivals as just this danger of 
demanding one type of experience from all men, 
insisting that where the prescribed experi- 
ence did not come, there was some deep 
moral failure in the individual. This insis- 
tence has wrought evil in three ways: First, 
it has tended to lay a quite unwholesome 
emphasis upon the form of religious experi- 
ence, instead of upon the real fundamental 
ethical relation to God and to men; second, it 
has tended to lead men to more or less super- 
ficial and self-deceived imitation of others’ 
experiences; third, it has tended to throw 
into deep darkness and almost despair some 
of the most conscientious and clear-sighted 
men and women, whose temperament hardly 
allowed the experience sought, and who 
could not deceive themselves as to the form 
of their experience, but knew that they had 
   
-P-A-G-E-197
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 185 
not come into an experience of the pre- 
scribed type. 
These three mistakes are still being re- 
peated again and again by many most ear- 
nest and conscientious religious leaders. They 
have had, themselves, some special experience 
that has been most real and vital to them; 
about that experience they have gathered, 
naturally, certain specific theories of the reli- 
gious life that seem best to fit their type 
of experience and so seem authoritative, and 
then in all honesty—not meaning to walk in 
either pride or censoriousness—they proceed 
absolutely to prescribe just this type of ex- 
perience and just these theories as alone 
admissible in a truly Christian life. All of us 
are liable in some degree to the same mis- 
take; but it peculiarly besets those whose 
experiences are marked. And so we see the 
church cut up into little sections, each one 
of which seems to itself to have alone the 
true Christian experience. But let us at least 
be sure that the unteachable and censorious 
spirit is no true fruit of the Spirit of God.
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
2. The peculiar dangers of the revival 
method, then, are the dangers that naturally 
attend sudden and marked experiences. It is 
worth while to point these dangers out still 
more specifically. 
(1) For those upon whom these marked 
experiences have come with greatest power, 
I have already indicated, there is the danger 
of resting in these experiences as an end in 
themselves, and so carrying them to plain 
excess—a danger repeatedly evident in reli- 
gious history; and the danger of making their 
individual experience an authoritative type 
for all, and so becoming finally very censori- 
ous. And these dangers are not slight, nor 
uncommon. 
Besides these dangers, there is the natural 
danger of reaction which follows any intense 
emotional experience—a reaction that inter- 
feres with the expected results in life. Where 
such results do not follow, there is then 
great danger of either self-deception, or of 
comparative despair; i. e., the man either 
persuades himself that the sin into which
-P-A-G-E-199
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 187 
he may have fallen after his great experience 
is not a sin, but at most only a mistake, and 
so begins to juggle with his conscience with 
the most serious results for his life; or, he 
says to himself, in despairing mood, “Surely, 
if such an experience as this that I have 
had has not delivered me from the life of 
sin, it is useless to attempt further.” 
(2) For those, in the second place, to 
whom these intense experiences did not come 
so naturally, but who yet felt that they were 
necessary and so persistently strained after 
them until at least some semblance of them 
was attained, there is the danger that attends 
all straining after feeling—the danger of a 
more or less forced and abnormal state, that 
has to be somewhat artificially maintained, 
and that is quite sure to give finally either 
a morbidly tense or a hollow aspect to the 
whole religious life. Neither result would 
have followed a reasonable regard for their 
natural temperament. 
(3) Just because striking experiences 
seem so significant and important, the revival
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
worker himself will be tempted also to 
underestimate the long preceding time of 
preparation by others for the harvest hour, 
and to fail to recognize as well how impera- 
tively the times of great experience require 
to be followed up with careful, thoughtful 
teaching and training, that shall not allow 
their high resolves to be dissipated in mere 
sentiment, but shall insure a broadly de- 
veloped, growing Christian life. 
The wise revival worker, therefore, must 
be peculiarly on his guard against the dangers 
that naturally attend sudden and marked 
experiences. 
3. Moreover, the emphasis of revival 
workers upon the value of great experiences 
has naturally, though unconsciously, tended 
to a somewhat mechanical and practically super- 
stitious view of the work of the Spirit of God 
in the hearts of men. Just because they 
have thought so much of the form of the 
experience itself, they have tended to identify 
it with the coming of the Spirit of God into 
the life, and to count it forthwith what they
-P-A-G-E-201
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 189 
have by preference called the baptism or 
the enduement of the Holy Spirit. In choos- 
ing out of the many New Testament ex- 
pressions just these impersonal terms, they 
unconsciously show how impersonally they 
conceive the whole process. And it is per- 
ilous to conceive a relation so_ intensely 
personal as religion ought to be, in this 
impersonal, mechanical, magical fashion. 
The sublime vital fact in conversion surely 
is that we have now entered upon a vol- 
untary, life-long, personal relation to God, 
and so thrown ourselves open to the presence 
and power in our lives of the personal Spirit 
of the loving, mighty God. The Holy Spirit 
is not a thing like water that brings some 
mechanical cleansing; but the coming of the 
Spirit is the beginning of a great new 
powerful personal association that is increas- 
ingly to dominate our lives. Christ promises 
the Comforter, that he may “be with us 
forever.” 
The preference for the term “the baptism 
of the Spirit” seems to me to overlook the
-P-A-G-E-202
190 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
fact that, with a single possible exception, 
the New Testament never uses this or 
kindred terms, except where there is a com- 
parison, expressed or implied, of Christ’s 
work with John’s baptism. And the whole 
impersonal conception seems to me further 
to forget the more important fact that the 
prevalent New Testament conception in this 
matter is that of an indwelling personal 
Spirit—a personal relation. And this prev- 
alent New Testament usage is much to be 
preferred; for it turns the attention away 
from the magical and sudden, from the mere 
experience or feeling side, to the vital fact 
of the great new powerful personal associa- 
tion with God. Even in the Acts, it is to be 
noted, the coming of the Spirit zs not any 
of the accompanying signs or experiences. 
And Paul had later to guard his converts 
very carefully against this mischievous over- 
estimation of marked experiences as such, as 
his letters to the Corinthians plainly show. 
It is not an unimportant matter, in a 
thing so vital as religion, that our language
-P-A-G-E-203
    
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL IgI 
should reflect as accurately as possible the 
best conception we can get of the religious 
life; and if we really believe that we do 
come into a personal communion with a 
personal God, let our chosen language show 
it. I cannot doubt that the prevalent lan- 
guage in the church concerning the Holy 
Spirit, plainly fostered by the insistence upon 
the necessity of abrupt and striking experi- 
ences for all temperaments alike, has been 
distinctly unfortunate in its influence, and 
has certainly tended to a mechanical and 
virtually superstitious conception of the work 
of the Spirit on the part of the great body 
of the church, though the religious leaders 
who have given the language vogue doubt- 
less can have intended no such result. 
4. There remains one further serious dan- 
ger to which the revival method is exposed— 
the fundamental danger of failure in sensitive, 
delicate reverence for the. personality and the 
moral inttiative of men. 
Probably, it is this not uncommon lack 
in revivals of reverent regard for the personal
-P-A-G-E-204
192 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
life of other men, that has really been the 
greatest cause of stumbling to many in the 
common methods of the revival, leading not 
a few to abjure the revival altogether, and 
causing many others who have entered into 
the work serious disturbance of mind, if not 
real misgiving. 
The relation of a man to God is so deep, . 
personal, intimate, and sacred, that we cannot 
help shrinking, even if unconsciously, when 
in all kinds of ways it is dragged out into 
the common gaze of men. No man of high 
feelings wishes to wear his heart upon 
his coat-sleeve, to reveal unnecessarily the 
most sacred things in his own life, or to 
demand such revelation from others. And 
the more deeply sensitive he is to the price- 
less value of the soul and to the eternal 
significance of its personal relations to others, 
the less will he be inclined to force his way 
into the secret recesses of another’s life. As 
he goes forward into a deepening life of his 
own, he comes to see how sacred a thing a 
personal relation may be, and comes espe- 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 193 
cially to dread in himself and in others this 
ruthless overriding of the personality of an- 
other. He sees that there can be no high, fit 
relation of man to man or of man to God, 
where there is not plainly present on both 
sides this reverence for the person; and with 
increasing strength he feels that methods 
that are lacking in this reverence cannot be 
best adapted to establish those highest rela- 
tions with God and men for which religion 
calls. 
Moreover, where the aim is, as in all 
religious work, to bring a man to a choice 
that shall be absolutely and fully his own, it 
is peculiarly necessary that the will of the 
other should never be overridden. Strong 
personalities are always tempted to dominate 
in this way the lives and choices of others. 
They see so clearly and feel so strongly the 
course the other ought to take, that they 
practically force that. course upon him, leav- 
ing him no fair opportunity to exercise his 
own will. It is especially easy to do this with 
children, and we need in such cases to be 
M
-P-A-G-E-206
    
  194 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
doubly on our guard; for forced choices make 
not strong, but weak character. This is prob- 
ably the prime reason why God’s relation to 
us is so persistently unobtrusive. We are to 
be disciples of a Master whom the New 
Testament represents, though he is rightful 
Lord of all, as standing at the door of 
these hearts of ours and only knocking— 
he will not force the door. In such rever- 
ence for the human personality we have too 
often followed him but afar off. And cer- 
tainly one of the greatest of all the dangers 
of an ordinary revival is this lack of rever- 
ence for the human personality. 
I have myself made so much in different 
places of this fundamental need of reverence 
for the person, that it may possibly seem to 
some that I overestimate its importance. Let 
me, therefore, ask you simply to note the 
corroborative testimony of two others, though 
I count most upon the corroboration that 
comes from my readers themselves, in the 
witness of their own spiritual sense. 
Forbush, for example, in his careful study 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
    
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 195 
of the religious life of the boy, is led to say: 
“It is a cowardly thing to say personal 
things and ask searching questions of a boy 
in the midst of his fellows which you would 
not dare to ask that boy privately in ordi- 
nary conversation. It is to protect these re- 
serves thus rudely assaulted that a boy puts 
on with his Sunday suit a disguise which he 
carries to the hand-to-hand encounters of the 
Sunday-school and Junior Society.” 
And Drummond, speaking of the most 
notable spiritual analysts in the history of the 
church, still feels compelled to say: “They 
were most of them wanting in that deli- 
cacy of handling which makes analysis eftec- 
tive instead of insulting; and many of the 
Puritans were quite destitute of the foremost 
quality which distinguishes the successful 
diagnosist—respect, veneration even, for the 
soul of another. A man may be ever so 
gross and vulgar, but when you come to 
deal with the deepest that is in him he 
becomes sensitive and feminine. Brusqueness 
1 The Boy Problem, p. 166.
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
and an impolite familiarity may do very 
well when dealing with his brains, but with- 
out tenderness and courtesy you can only 
approach his heart to shock it. The whole’ 
of etiquette is founded on respect; and by 
far the highest and tenderest etiquette is the 
etiquette of soul and soul. To know and 
remember the surpassing dignity of the 
human soul—for its own sake, for its God- 
like elements, for its immortality, above all 
for his sake who made it and gave Him- 
self for it—this is the first axiom to be 
remembered.” ? 
The methods of the constantly improving 
evangelism which is to come will, then, 
earnestly seek to avoid these greatest 
dangers to which it is liable, and which, 
even under the greatest evangelists of the 
past, have unnecessarily alienated and thrown 
into darkness many whom a different treat- 
ment would have reached. For, as another 
has said, “every method or agency used in 
Christian work must give account to God 
1The New Evangelism, pp. 280, 281. 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 197 
not only for the souls whom it wins and 
saves, but also for all whom it alienates and 
_ destroys.” ! 
The best evangelism, that seems to me to 
mean, will carefully avoid the mistake of in- 
sisting upon one type of experience for all 
men; it will especially guard itself against 
those dangers which naturally attend sudden 
and marked experiences; it will substitute 
a clearly personal conception of the work of 
the Spirit of God for the prevalent imper- 
sonal conception, which is so _ liable to 
become mechanical, if not positively supersti- 
tious; and it will cultivate in every bit of 
its procedure a spirit of deep reverence for 
the sacredness of the human personality. In 
so doing it will fairly meet the difficulties 
that have caused the rather common misgiv- 
ings concerning the revival method, which 
were earlier pointed out. 
But we need to see not only the dangers 
of the methods of Christian training and 
1 Rev. Charles E. McKinley, quoted by Forbush, The Boy Prob- 
lem, p. 169.
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
of the revival, but the positive reasons which 
may be urged for the need of both, if we 
are fully to meet the problem set us. 
IX. THE NEED OF CHRISTIAN TRAINING 
In Christian training I mean to include 
all methods of Christian nurture as applied 
to children, and all methods of progressive 
conformation of men, body and mind, to 
the Christian ideal—the all-round education 
that aims to call out the entire man in a full 
and habitual response to Christ’s purpose 
for him—to give him a body that shall be 
the best medium and instrument for the 
spirit, to insure growing intellectual grasp 
upon all Christian truth, a quick sensitive- 
ness to the finest implications of Christian 
faith in the emotional life, and a sure 
response in will and deed to the highest 
Christian motives. 
1. I have already indicated, in my paper 
before the Religious Education Association, 
that in carrying out this aim our main
-P-A-G-E-211
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 199 
reliance must be upon personal association 
with men of high Christian character and 
attainment, and upon expressive activity. 
(1) The highest service we can do for 
another is first to be what he ought to be- 
come, and, second, to bear honest witness 
to that in which we ourselves most live—to 
those great realities in which God most 
surely finds us. And the preéminent quali- 
ties which make a man’s witness count with 
us go right back to himself again; for they 
are his own manifest deep conviction, our 
faith in his character and judgment, and 
our faith in his disinterested love for us. 
There is, thus, no way in which any effec- 
tive religious education can dispense with 
high personal association as its prime factor. 
The results of Mr. Goodman’s wide inquiry 
into the special needs of the religious work 
of the Young Men’s Christian Association, 
he believed, primarily indicated just this 
preéminent need of “strong, progressive, 
_ spiritual leadership.” 
(2) And, in the second place, it is only 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
200 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
‘as our ideas and sentiments and ideals are 
put into some expressive activity that we 
come into real appreciation of them, or that 
they get their full hold upon us. It is this 
sound psychological principle which lies 
back of the whole aim to conform the man, 
body and mind, increasingly to the Chris- 
tian ideal. It is believed with reason that 
such expressive activity will be followed 
inevitably by deepening feeling and deepen- 
ing intellectual appreciation. All the so- 
called secular agencies of the Young Men’s 
Christian Association have here their full 
psychological and religious justification. 
Surely the finest of all fine arts is the 
fine art of living, and no man will drift into 
high attainment here. Obviously, we need 
to carry out, in the light of the most careful 
study of human nature, the broadest educa- 
tion of men religiously. Drummond makes 
a strong plea in one chapter of his The New 
Evangelism for this careful study of human 
nature for distinctly religious ends. And 
such books as Starbuck’s Psychology of Re-

ligion, Coe’s The Spiritual Life, Granger’s 
The Soul of a Christian, Forbush’s The Boy 
Problem, and James’ The Varieties of Religious 
Experience, and the work of the new Re- 
ligious Education Association, must help 
decidedly in giving better knowledge of our 
problem. But it should be noticed that 
James’ book, by intention, confines itself 
almost exclusively to cases rather out of the 
ordinary; and that everywhere we need a 
wider induction than has yet been made. 
2. Moreover, even if sudden and marked 
experiences were regarded as in all cases 
absolutely indispensable, it would still be 
true that, if they were to be really significant 
for high and broad living, they would re- 
quire careful Christian education both for 
preparation and for appreciation. There is 
no way in which the times of vision can 
dispense with preceding training and later 
thinking, if the vision is to mean most to us. 
Any really valuable revivalism, therefore, 
requires broad Christian education to supple- 
ment it; and our best evangelists are increas- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
ingly recognizing this even in the very 
midst of their revival work. 
3. But the need of Christian training is 
much more broadly based. For we have 
already seen that, in meeting the aim of all 
religious effort, to bring the man into actual 
communion with God, the religious teacher 
is practically shut up to witnessing to those 
realities that have most surely revealed God 
to him. And we have also seen that, aside 
from the indispensable personal qualities of 
the effective witness—conviction, character 
and judgment, and love—our witnessing 
needs power to make God and the spiritual 
life real, rational, and vital. This power 
requires both a deep acquaintance with 
Christ, and a deep acquaintance with our own 
time. And these needs hold both for the 
Christian teacher and for the Christian evan- 
gelist.' For we may not hope to make the 
Christian message real, rational, and vital, 
without a knowledge of the consciousness to

certain portions of some articles on The New Evangelism, written

-P-A-G-E-215
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 203 
which we appeal. The two needs inter- 
penetrate each other; for certain marked 
characteristics of our time bring us in a 
peculiar way face to face with the historical 
Christ. 
Let us see, then, first of all, the great 
advantage which our age, by what it has 
accomplished, offers to us in the opportunity 
to deepen our knowledge of Christ and the 
Christian message, and so to increase the 
power of our witness. Because Christianity 
is a historical religion, to know Christ means, 
to begin with, direct, first-hand, inductive, 
historical Bible study, book by book. For 
here in the Bible is the record of the pre- 
eminent meetings of God with men, and the 
direct reflections of the supreme revelation 
in Christ. The Bible, then, must be to the 
Christian witness, above all, a real book, 
alive with real characters, permeated with 
real and powerful personal influences, and 
there must grow upon him the conviction 
that in that great line of God’s historical 
self-revelation to Israel, through the prophets
-P-A-G-E-216
  204. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
and culminating in Christ, we have to do with 
far the greatest movement of all history. No 
season of revival effort can accomplish that 
aim; it needs the broadest Christian education. 
(1) The Historical Spirit in Bible Study.— 
For no man should lose sight of the special 
opportunity given to our time by the progress 
of historical criticism. We are now able to 
put the different books of Scripture into 
their historical setting to an extent and with 
a certainty never before possible. It is prob- 
ably within the truth to say, for example, that 
for the first time since the books were 
written men are able to read the prophets as 
a whole with an understanding of the real 
historical meaning of all essential portions. 
Such books as George Adam Smith’s The 
Book of the Twelve Prophets and Sanders and 
Kent’s Messages of the Prophets put that 
result within reach of even the ordinary 
reader. Have we considered how much that 
ought to mean in making the prophets alive 
and real to us, and in putting us in living 
possession of their message?
-P-A-G-E-217
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 205 
So, too, have we felt the tremendous sig- 
nificance of the fact that every life of Christ 
worth reading, outside the Gospels, has been 
written since 1835? That is, this generation 
has given to the life of Christ such direct, 
painstaking, historical study as the world has 
never before seen; and as a consequence we 
are able, to an extent not true of any pre- 
ceding generation, to put the life of Christ 
into its real historical setting—political, intel- 
lectual, social, moral, and religious—and so 
to understand more certainly the precise 
meaning of his acts and of his teaching. That 
result can seem unimportant only to a man 
who refuses to believe that the most signifi- 
cant fact in the world’s history is the. earthly 
life of Jesus Christ. 
Nor can a thoughtful man overlook this 
further most significant fact, that biblical 
theology can be said to be scarcely more 
than fifty years old. The inductive, historical, 
systematic presentation of the teaching of 
the different prophets, of Jesus, and of his 
apostles is a distinctly modern phenomenon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Its results are now within reach of any 
reasonably diligent Christian student, though 
the mere reading of another man’s presen- 
tation is by no means enough. Who can 
estimate the significance for the kingdom 
of God of the first-hand and comprehensive 
knowledge of the teaching of Jesus and his 
apostles that might come to the body of the 
church through the careful study of such an 
introductory book as Professor Bosworth’s 
Studies in the Teaching of Jesus and Hts 
Apostles, issued by the International Com- 
mittee of the Young Men’s Christian 
Associations? 
Neither the church nor its ministry or 
teachers can be said yet to have faced the 
full responsibility that is upon every disciple 
of Christ to know intelligently and _ thor- 
oughly the life and teaching of Christ. So 
that Dr. Horton can say, “It is the un- 
happy delusion of the church that it knows 
the teaching of Jesus.” 
serve the name of disciples of Christ at all, 
in Dr. Van Dyke’s words, “we must count But, plainly, to de-
-P-A-G-E-219
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 207 
no pains too great to spend upon the study 
of that teaching as it les in the records, 
and no effort too severe to make in order 
that it may be restored in its integrity and 
entirety, rounded and harmonized, within 
the very center of our minds.” 
We profess to believe that the supreme 
revelation of God was made in the earthly 
life of Jesus; but are we using the new 
great opportunity of our time, historically to 
know that lifer It must mean great things 
for Christian teaching and preaching and 
for the life of the church when tthe results 
of the modern return on the part of scholars 
to the historical Christ are fully recognized. 
This return to the very sources of our faith 
cannot be in vain. It is a reasonable expec- 
tation that the best teaching and preaching 
and the best response to both that the 
world has ever seen lie just ahead of us. 
But that result can come, as has been said, 
only through direct, first-hand, inductive, 
historical study of the Bible, book by book. 
It is here that a man ought to find his own 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
communion with God most real; his surest 
sense of God’s personal revelation to him, 
that will enable him in his teaching and 
preaching to speak out of his own experi- 
ence and life. Intellectual study alone is, of 
course, not enough; but without it the 
inspiration of the fullest vision of Christ 
cannot come. Christianity is a historical re- 
ligion. I need not say how fully such results 
as these require Christian training of high 
. quality. 
Aside from the wonderful return to the 
historical Christ, and the clear recognition of 
the historical spirit in Bible study generally, 
the characteristics of our time that ought most 
to affect our putting of the truth probably 
are that it is a questioning and undogmatic 
age, and a scientific age. These concern both 
the Christian teacher and the evangelist; but 
the full appreciation of the phenomena is 
preéminently the task of Christian education. 
(2) A Questioning and Undogmatic Age.— 
In a questioning and undogmatic age it con- 
cerns every Christian witness, first of all, to
-P-A-G-E-221
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 209 
see clearly that all truths are not of equal 
importance or of equal certainty, and to be 
sure that, in his message to his time, the 
really essential and certain are not weighted 
down with the subsidiary and doubtful. It 
is quite possible to be so anxious to press 
some minor truth as seriously to obscure for 
many the really vital things. No theory 
about Adam, ancient or modern, can ever 
deserve to be coédrdinate with the revelation 
of God in Christ. 
The same consideration may well lead a 
man to draw a sharp line between the 
direct and unmistakable teachings of Jesus, 
and his own or any other’s added inferences 
and speculations. For his own intellectual 
peace one may need the added speculations; 
but authority belongs not to them but only 
to the teaching of Jesus. To carry a man 
to the discipleship of Christ it is not neces- 
sary to carry him to all the intricacies of 
any theological or philosophical system. 
Many things are important, but only a few 
are of prime importance. This means, of 
N
-P-A-G-E-222
210 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
course, large liberty of individual interpreta- 
tion; but from that a living church has no 
cause to shrink, and it must shrink from 
any lowering of the authority of its Lord. 
(3) A Scientific Age.—But the most di- 
rect suggestions in this line for the man 
who wishes to be an effective witness for 
Christ today connect themselves with the 
peculiarly scientific temper of our times. 
This temper probably affects all minds today 
more or less consciously. And no man who 
wishes to reach men may wisely ignore the 
essential demands of the scientific spirit. It 
is not meant at all that the Christian teacher 
or preacher must be widely informed in 
science; but he must know scientifically his 
own great themes. And there is the more 
need of insistence upon this point, because 
the natural temperament of the spiritual 
witness tends to theoretical vagueness and 
to an unwillingness to use practical means; 
whereas the very spirit of science is found 
in the recognition of the universality of law, 
and in the determination strictly to trace all 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 211 
effects back to their precise elementary 
conditions. 
If the Christian witness now is to be able 
to meet this scientific temper, he must know 
and be able to state the great laws of the 
spiritual world, remembering that his prob- 
lem lies in the sphere of personal relations. 
He must see with some clearness and defi- 
niteness the precise conditions upon which 
the sense of reality of the spiritual world 
depends, be they personal, ethical, psycho- 
logical, or physiological; above all, never for- 
getting that self-control is always positive. 
(And the educational work of the Associations 
has made real contributions in all these 
respects.) He must get some real appreci- 
ation, as he will then be sure to do, of the 
complexity of life and of the indispensable 
need of time and of growth in the spiritual 
life. And he will then discern that strain has 
no rightful place in the religious life; that 
the business of the religious teacher or 
preacher is, not to stir men to a _ hysterical 
strain, but to bring them to a steady, rational
-P-A-G-E-224
  
212 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
recognition of laws, to a faithful fulfilment 
of conditions, which can be known and 
stated, and which will certainly give results 
in time, in feeling, in intellectual apprecia- 
tion, and in life. 
Emphasis on the Teaching Side.—All this 
means, necessarily, a new emphasis on the 
teaching side in all religious work, for one 
cannot deal chiefly in exhortation and still 
make clear the laws and conditions of a true 
spiritual life. And yet the most effective 
exhortation is often a clear putting of the 
laws under which we must live out our life. 
These laws, it should be noted, are primarily 
those of personal relations, and contain in 
themselves the strongest appeal. And it is 
just here that the religious worker—whether 
teacher or evangelist—will be best able fully 
to meet the scientific demand for the recog- 
nition of law and growth, earlier noticed, 
and at the same time do full justice to a 
deep inner religious life. But I feel certain 
that commonly the feeling and will of men 
are stirred by preaching and Sunday-school 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
    CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 213 
teaching beyond the point where they know 
how to act intelligently. More or less con- 
sciously they are crying out for definite in- 
struction. They are exhorted vaguely to some 
course of conduct; but no definite statement 
is given them of the precise steps through 
which they are to enter upon that course. 
Such vague exhortation is almost worse than 
useless, for feeling and desire have been 
aroused only to be fruitlessly dissipated. And 
we need to remember that it is as true of 
the Sunday-school lesson or the sermon as 
of the theater, that the stirring of emotion 
that gets no expression, that is not put into 
act, tends only to a weak sentimentalism. It 
is of the highest importance, therefore, that 
the way to the expressive act shall be made 
unmistakably clear. 
A moment’s consideration of the need of 
the young, moreover, should make it plain 
that the extreme reaction from expository 
and proper doctrinal teaching and preach- 
ing cannot be justified, but that the teaching 
side constantly deserves a large place. The
-P-A-G-E-226
  214. PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
comparatively young constitute not only a 
large, but by far the most hopeful portion 
of the field of any religious worker. And 
it is vain to expect to make of them intel- 
ligent and reliable Christians without much 
clear and definite instruction. The ease with 
which great numbers of Christians are swept 
into Christian Science and other exegetical 
and religious extravagancies and _ vagaries 
surely betrays the lack of earlier well-grounded 
Christian instruction. Nor is a revival of the 
catechetical class, however wisely conducted, 
enough; the Sunday-school work and the 
preaching must contain more real teaching. 
A Historical Catechism.—If we are not 
quite to fail in our real duty—especially to 
the young, but not to the young alone—we 
must face, more seriously than most Protestant 
churches have recently done, the work of the 
Christian teacher. There should be, no doubt, 
something like real catechetical instruction of 
the young, though for the very reason that 
Christianity is a historical, and ethical, and 
spiritual religion, this should be primarily 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 215 
and mainly historical, such as is illustrated, 
for example, in Dr. Bruce’s With Open Face. 
Careful Discussion of Elements.— Besides 
this, there is crying need of much more 
clear exposition of the elements of moral and 
spiritual and definitely Christian teaching— 
a careful going over of such questions as: 
What is it to be a Christian? How does one 
become a Christiane Why should one be a 
Christian? A wise and Biblical treatment of 
these elementary questions, that aims at clear- 
ing up misconceptions and reaching a plain, 
positive and tangible result, takes one really 
into the deepest and most vital themes, and 
would help not only those not Christians, 
but tone up the lives of Christians them- 
selves and make them in turn intelligent, 
helpful witnesses to others. Even mature and 
thoughtful Christians are often grateful for 
a simple, clear, but suggestive putting of 
these very elements of the Christian life. 
The Right Kind of Repetition In our re- 
ligious work, too, we must not shrink from the 
entirely conscious purposed repetition of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
216 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
teacher. The great themes are to be returned 
to, without apology and with clear purpose, 
again and again, to get and to give the steadily 
deepening view which can only so come. It 
is absurd to expect a miscellaneous class or 
audience, not primarily students, to get to 
the bottom of any great theme through a 
single presentation of it, however able and 
skilful that presentation may be. And, more- 
over, this rather small pride of not repeat- 
ing himself makes a man ingenious in hunt- 
ing up much smaller themes than those that 
ought to occupy the attention of himself and 
of his pupils or people. It is more impor- 
tant to have a great theme than a novel 
theme. And, in truth, the most engrossing 
things are to be found in delving into the 
great rather than in pursuing the new. 
Psychologically, I do not see what right 
we have to expect people to be steadily 
built up in Christian truth and grace, where 
the Sunday-school teaching and the preach- 
ing do not definitely build from week to 
week on what has preceded, where there is
-P-A-G-E-229
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 217 
not some clear plan and some real progress. 
The most brilliant set of miscellaneous dis- 
courses ever spoken could not possibly have 
the building power for either pastor or 
people of such works as Dr. Horton’s The 
Teaching of Jesus, or Dr. Dale’s Christian 
Doctrine, both of which were originally pre- 
pared as series of sermons for their people. 
Surely one cannot face these broad needs 
of Christian living and thinking without a 
new sense of the indispensableness of the 
broadest and most thorough religious train- 
ing. These highest interests cannot be 
studied too deeply or met too fully in sys- 
tematic education. 
X. THE NEED OF THE REVIVAL 
Is there a like, real and permanent need 
for some form of revival effort? 
Assuming, above all, a wise leadership, 
and assuming that the revival is carefully 
guarded, as I believe it can be, against the 
dangers in revivalism that have been noted, 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
218 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
and assuming that the pressure of it is not 
put upon young children, it seems to me 
that our answer must be clearly and frankly 
in the affirmative. 
No doubt, with such guarding certain 
somewhat familiar features would be either 
entirely dropped or greatly modified; the 
points of emphasis would change, in some 
cases considerably; the appeal would be 
broader in its range, and individual adap- 
tation would be much more accurate and 
delicate; and great care would be taken in 
line with the suggestions of the last section 
to give the message special effectiveness for 
our own time. It seems to me also prob- 
able,—in order to avoid, on the one hand, 
excessive emotional appeal, and, on the 
other hand, to get into closer, more intelli- 
gent and more effective touch with men,— 
that less effort will be made to gather im- 
mense audiences; but rather that smaller, 
more thoughtful gatherings will be pre- 
ferred, and the work become more individ- 
ual and proportionately quieter, deeper, 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 219 
more significant, and more permanent. In 
all lines of attempts to stir public interest I 
judge there is a growing feeling that the 
immense convention has been rather over- 
done. The aim now is, rather, thoroughly 
to enlist a much smaller number of strong, 
thoughtful men and work out upon the 
community through them. Some such change 
may occur in the use of the revival. But it 
will, I must think, still have its real and 
important place. 
1. The drift of our entire discussion cer- 
tainly leads us to anticipate such a result. 
The temperamental differences between men, 
that we have been obliged to recognize, 
themselves make it highly probable that at 
least a considerable proportion in any com- 
munity will most easily respond to some 
special effort, to some appeal out of the 
ordinary, in some season that gives oppor- 
tunity for their subconscious life to break 
through into consciousness and power. For 
those whose temperament preéminently fits 
them for sudden and marked experiences 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
220 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
some kind of a crisis is needed; and a 
revival season is probably likely to furnish 
the best, if not the only hopeful, time for 
their entering definitely upon the Christian 
life. Such a time seems almost required for 
such, if the religious life is to be to them 
thoroughly real and vital. And the church 
must not repeat its old mistake of meeting 
the needs of those of but a single tempera- 
ment; though it must meet the needs of 
those of the one temperament in such a way 
as not to repel and endanger those of the 
other. 
2. But more than this is true. It is not 
merely a single temperament that needs the 
revival method. A wise revivalism has in all 
probability a real contribution to make to us all. 
The points of contact noted between sudden 
and gradual conversions would themselves 
suggest this. We found that no sharp line 
could be drawn between the two types of 
conversion. Both had their significant crises. 
And these critical points mean much for 
any temperament. Matthew Arnold certainly
-P-A-G-E-233
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 221 
was not given to over-much emotion, but 
even he could say, as though speaking of 
the psychologist’s subconscious self, of the 
“buried life” in us all: 
“Only —but this is rare— 
When a beloved hand is laid in ours, 
When, jaded with the rush and glare 
Of the interminable hours, 
Our eyes can in another’s eyes read clear, 
When our world-deafened ear 
Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed,— 
A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast 
And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again, 
The eye sinks inward and the heart lies plain, 
And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know; 
A man becomes aware of his life’s flow, 
And hears the winding murmur, and he sees 
The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.” 
Probably none of us are wholly insensible 
to the meaning of such an experience. The 
moments of insight, the times of vision, the 
fresh awakening to the significance of life — 
these mean very much to us all. And we 
may be wisely and rationally helped to them; 
and we all need such help. 
Four psychological facts may well have 
weight with us here: 
  
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
(1) In the first place, the way in which 
our character tends to “set like plaster”— 
the comparatively early period at which the 
psychologists tell us the most important life- 
habits tend to establish themselves—all this 
is most earnest emphasis upon the impor- 
tance of right decisions promptly made. We 
cannot wisely ignore any rational means that 
will better insure such decisions. 
(2) Moreover, in his study of the will, 
James says that “all those ‘changes of heart,’ 
‘awakenings of conscience,’ etc., which 
make new men of so many of us may be 
classed” under that form of decision that 
comes “when, in consequence of some outer 
experience or some _ inexplicable inward 
change, we suddenly pass from the easy and 
careless to the sober and strenuous mood.” Now, 
if our greatest decisions do commonly grow 
out of such moods, the presence of such 
moods may be of vital importance. This is 
another psychological fact we may well heed. 
(3) And we can do something to make 
1 Psychology, Briefer Course, p. 432.
-P-A-G-E-235
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 223 
the sober and strenuous mood possible for 
ourselves and others. No feeling or mood 
can be directly produced by willing; but we 
can reach it indirectly through attention. 
Two laws of attention specially concern us 
here. 
In the first place, in an intelligent life 
the attention needs to be selective. Not our 
entire environment makes us, but that part 
of our environment to which we attend 
makes us. Through selective attention, then, 
we may and should determine the elements 
of our environment that are to count most 
with us. If the great religious facts and 
truths are to weigh with us as they ought, 
they must have attention. 
In the second place, the greater the 
number of objects before the attention, the 
less intense can the attention to any one 
object be. Extension prevents intension. 
This means that the mere multiplicity of 
events and interests in our lives, even if 
wholly innocent in themselves, inevitably 
hinders such attention to the great spiritual
-P-A-G-E-236
  224 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
realities as shall give them their legitimate 
power with us. In other words, we cannot 
expect men to get that “firmer hold upon 
religious realities,” of which James speaks, 
that shall give them the sense of deliverance 
which comes with a really unified life, with- 
out prolonged and concentrated attention to 
those realities. The “sober and strenuous 
mood” is most certain to come only so. 
Just that needed opportunity, now, for pro- 
longed and concentrated attention to the 
greatest realities an intelligent revival would 
give. And there is no way in which we can 
escape these primary laws of attention. It is 
vain for us to expect the spiritual life to 
mean much to us while we give it no fair 
chance at us. 
Even in the strictest educational processes 
we know how much persistent staying in the 
presence of the great values means to us; 
how much at times an absorbed attention 
reasonably extended counts, and how impos- 
sible it is to get the same contribution from 
mere scattered bits of attention, however
-P-A-G-E-237
    
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 225 
faithfully given. If we wish, then, religious 
interests really to be among the great inter- 
ests or the supreme interests of our lives, 
it is reasonable and alone reasonable that we 
should give them occasional times of pro- 
longed and concentrated attention, not only 
as individuals but as communities. Such 
times of unusual attention to religious themes, 
just as similar times in other fields, have, of 
course, their natural limits that are to be 
recognized; the same degree of attention 
cannot be wisely long continued, but for a 
reasonable period they have a very distinct 
value. 
(4) One further psychological fact has 
its bearing here. Nowhere more than in the 
determination of spiritual atmosphere do we 
seem members one of another. I think there 
can be no doubt that the fact that many 
others are at a certain time giving attention 
to the deepest questions of life, is itself of 
very real help to the production in one of 
the “sober and strenuous mood” out of which 
great decisions may be born. As I have else- 
0 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
where said: “Apparently there is such a thing, 
for example, as a spiritual atmosphere in an 
audience—not, it may well be supposed, a 
magical matter, but really determined by the 
tone of the minds composing the audience. 
The actual mood of the hearers and of the 
speaker makes a difference. Results, great 
and important, are so changed often quite 
unconsciously. It may well be that God is 
the medium in all this. The attitude of the 
auditors is like unconscious, silent praying 
to God—the praying of their life, of their 
spirit.” If this is true at all, it gives a fur- 
ther reason why an intelligent revival may 
bring valuable results to any one of us. Our 
friends may thus perform for us in peculiar 
degree what Emerson says is the great office 
of a friend—“to make us do what we can.” 
It is very much to be brought into the mood 
in which we are capable of our best. Even 
a passing vision of our real possibilities may 
be a permanent uplift. We certainly cannot 
afford, in the deepest interests of our lives, 
1Theology and the Social Consciousness, pp. 165, 166. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL aa? 
to ignore our membership in one another. 
The “season of special religious interest,” as 
we call it, is in this respect a social oppor- 
tunity of great significance. — 
3. And let me remind you once more of 
the important place of feeling in all life. We 
have already seen that one of the great dan- 
gers of strictly educational methods in relig- 
ion is the ignoring of feeling. So strongly 
does James feel the importance of the place 
of feeling in religion, that near the close of 
his long inductive inquiry into religious 
phenomena he says: “You see now why I 
have been so individualistic throughout these 
lectures, and why I have seemed so bent on 
rehabilitating the element of feeling in re- 
ligion and subordinating its intellectual part. 
Individuality is founded in feeling; and the 
recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata 
in character, are the only places in the 
world in which we catch real fact in the 
making, and directly perceive how events 
91 
happen, and how work is actually done.

We might perhaps feel that James had 
here overestimated the place of feeling; but 
such an estimate by him may at least suggest 
that the fact that the revival tends to bring 
some real feeling into the religious life, if 
this feeling is rationally stirred, is hardly an 
objection, but may rather be a real reason 
for the use of the revival. We do not shrink, 
in other spheres of life—in music, literature, 
art, friendship—from feeling that arises nor- 
mally in the presence of great realities and 
values; we need not shrink from feeling 
similarly arising in religion. And the im- 
portance of feeling for religion as giving the 
sense of reality, and giving powerful motive 
for action cannot be wisely overlooked. 
It may well be true, as Coe says, that “we 
are suffering not from excess of emotion in 
religion, but rather from too little emotion, 
from the narrowness of our emotional 
range.” From this point of view, too, there- 
fore, if the dangers previously noted are 
guarded against, I cannot doubt that the 
revival has real psychological justification.

XI. RELIGION AS A PERSONAL RELATION 
For myself, the conception that best 
brings together all the types of religious 
experience and best enables one to do justice 
to all, that can include the sudden and the 
gradual conversion and the life that seems 
to have lived always in the light, that can 
include the methods of both Christian train- 
ing and the revival, that in particular can do 
full justice to feeling in religion, and yet 
indicate its plain limits; and the conception, 
which at the same time seems to me truest 
to the lines of Christ’s own revelation, is the 
conception of the religious life as a personal 
relation with the personal God. The con- 
ditions and laws of such a life would be 
those of a deepening friendship. And this 
thoroughly personal conception seems to me 
best of all able to do justice to the deepest 
elements of Christian experience, at the 
same time that it guards most delicately 
against all possible excesses. It is able, I 
believe, to take up into itself all the justifi-
-P-A-G-E-242
230 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
able elements of mysticism, and yet avoid 
its errors. It gives, it seems to me, a true 
mysticism in which both the points of view 
and both the methods we have been discuss- 
ing may agree, and, agreeing, keep all the 
very highest in the religious life. 
Let me quote here, then, in conclusion, a 
few paragraphs in which I have elsewhere 
tried to set forth some of the elements of 
this true mysticism.’ These elements imply, 
at the same time, a definition of mysticism 
at its best. 
“The justifiable elements in mysticism may 
be said to include: the insistence on the legiti- 
mate place of feeling in religion as a real 
and vital experience; the emphasis on one’s 
own conviction and faith; the real difficulty 
of expressing the full meaning of the reli- 
gious experience; the demand for a complete 
ethical surrender to God; and the faith in 
the real unity and worth of the world in 
God. Now, if one tries to bring together 
these justifiable elements in mysticism, the 
' Theology and the Social Consciousness, pp. 77 and 82-84
-P-A-G-E-243
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 231 
truly mystical may all be summed up as 
simply a protest in favor of the whole man— 
the entire personality. It says that men can 
experience and live and feel and do much 
more than they can logically formulate, de- 
fine, explain or even fully express. Living is 
more than thinking. 
Moreover, it probably may be fairly 
claimed, not only, as has been already 
pointed out, that this personal conception 
of religion enables us best to point out its 
laws, but also that all of the mystical recog- 
nition of the emotional which is valuable or 
even legitimate is preserved, and far more 
safely and sanely conceived, in a strictly per- 
sonal conception of religion. It may well be 
doubted, if it is possible in any other way, 
both to do justice to feeling in religion and 
at the same time to keep feeling in its 
proper place. Is it possible briefly to indicate 
both the recognition of emotion and the 
control of emotion in religion? 
The true mysticism recognizes that the 
supreme joy is ‘joy in personal life’—joy in
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
entering into the revelation of a person; and it 
believes with reason that a growing acquain- 
tance with God must have such heights and 
depths of meaning as no other personal rela- 
tion can have. It is not, therefore, afraid or 
distrustful of true emotion—of joy or of peace, 
of intense longing or of keen satisfaction— 
in the religious life. 
But the true mysticism knows at the same 
time that deep revelation of a person is made 
only to the reverent, that the conditions are 
in the highest degree ethical, and above all 
must be recognized to be so in religion. It 
does view, then, with deep distrust an emo- 
tional emphasis in religion that ignores the 
ethical. It cannot forget that Christ thought 
that everything must be tested by its fruits 
in life. 
And a true mysticism knows that the spirit, 
reverent of personality, leads to a self-restraint 
that does not seek the emotional experience 
simply as such on any conditions; but, know- 
ing the supreme psychological conditions of 
happiness and character and influence, it
-P-A-G-E-245
CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 233 
loses itself in an unselfish love, and in ab- 
sorbing work, and in rational attention to the 
great spiritual realities, and understands that 
it must simply let the experiences come. It 
will have nothing, therefore, to do with 
strained emotion, or with the working up of 
feeling for its own sake. It seeks health, not 
merely the signs of health. It prizes, therefore, 
the joy that simply proclaims itself as the sign 
of the normal life and so positively strength- 
ens and cheers, but it will have nothing of 
the strain of emotion which is drain. 
It is interesting to notice that it is exactly 
this true psychological attitude concerning the 
emotional life that Phillips Brooks believed 
that he found perfectly reflected in Jesus. 
‘The sensitiveness of Jesus to pain and joy,’ 
he says, ‘never leads him for a moment to 
try to be sad or happy with direct endeavor; 
nor is there any sign that he ever judges 
the real character of himself or any other 
man by the sadness or the happiness that for 
a moment covers his life. He simply lives, 
and joy and sorrow issue from his living, 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  234 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
and cast their brightness and their gloomi- 
ness back upon his life; but there is no 
sorrow and no joy that he ever sought for 
itself, and he always kept a self-knowledge 
underneath the joy or sorrow, undisturbed 
by the moment’s happiness or unhappiness.’ ” 
This strictly personal conception of the 
religious life seems to me to deserve empha- 
sis, then, not only for the special reasons 
implied at different points in our discussion; 
but also, and particularly, because it fur- 
nishes a conception in which those who 
believe most either in Christian training or 
in the revival can heartily agree, and can 
find all their greatest positive contentions in- 
cluded, at the same time that the dangers of 
both methods are carefully guarded against. 
It is a conception that cannot justly be 
called either radical or conservative, but 
belongs to the eternal essence of the high- 
est religion, as Christ reveals it, and so may 
well do its full service for us all, of what- 
ever point of view. I have hoped, especially, 
that it indicated a way in which the Young
-P-A-G-E-247
  CHRISTIAN TRAINING AND THE REVIVAL 235 
Men’s Christian Association might be true 
to its splendid achievements and its best 
traditions in both lines of Christian work, 
and might go forward to still larger achieve- 
ments, through an intelligently guarded and 
intelligently codperative use of both meth- 
ods—Christian training and the revival. 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  HOW TO MAKE A RATIONAL FIGHT 
FOR CHARACTER 
IN trying to point the way to a rational 
fight for character, let it be clear from the 
start, that there is no attempt here to find 
some lower substitute for Christ and the 
great motives of religion, but rather posi- 
tively to state those conditions of all kinds, 
involved in our very natures, which we need 
to heed if Christ and the great Christian 
truths are to have the power with us they 
ought to have. 
Any man who believes that God is the 
Creator of him, body and mind, must also 
believe that in some true sense God has 
expressed himself in the very nature of 
man’s being. God does not mean to ignore 
the conditions involved in our natures, nor 
may we. He has, doubtless, not contra- 
dicted himself in the double revelation of 
himself in our being and in Christ. And 
(236)   
-P-A-G-E-249
A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 237 
the great revelation in Christ will mean most 
to us, only as we heed most carefully the 
laws of our natures. Not through deliberate 
disobedience to those laws, but through 
careful heeding of them, are we to come 
into character and life. We are not to 
forget, then, that the laws of this being 
of ours are laws of God, and, therefore, 
sacredly to be observed. 
In calling careful attention to the consti- 
tutional conditions under which we all have 
to live out our lives, I strive simply to 
answer a question that was brought me 
some time ago by an old pupil of mine, who 
said, “What are we to do in those poorer 
moments when the higher motives have lost 
their appeal?” That is the question. 
1. In the first place, it seems to me, that 
at that lower moment when it looks as if 
everything were failing one, it is well for a 
man to say to himself with all seriousness, 
“Everything is now at stake; it is fight or 
die.” That is the situation. A friend of 
mine, with the marks of a serious disease 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
upon him, consulted a distinguished’ spe- 
cialist. The physician, after going carefully 
over his case, said to him: “I think the 
disease has not gone so far but that, if 
you will rigorously follow this regimen 
which I prescribe for you, you can still pull 
through.” My friend heard him out, and 
said, “Why, doctor, I should simply die if I 
had to live under that regimen.” The doc- 
tor somewhat grufHy turned upon him and 
said, “Well, die then.” He had just that 
one chance. Let a man say to himself, in 
like manner, in one of those lower mo- 
ments when he is likely to be engulfed by 
temptation, “It is fight or die.” 
It is a very significant thing that, in all 
branches of the Christian Church, the old 
shallow talk about sin has ceased, and 
that there is no branch of the Christian 
Church, today, that dreams of sweeping 
multitudes of men, without reference to their 
condition, into heaven and the presence of 
God. Men have come to see that to be 
saved is to share the life of God, and to 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 239 
share the life of God is to share _ his 
character, and so to share his blessedness; 
that God means to save us to character, 
and that there is, therefore, no way out for 
any man except by coming into character. 
There is no other salvation. In his poorer 
moments, then, let a man say to himself, 
“J have simply to let myself go on along 
this line in which I am now tempted, to 
have it all over with me,—to be lost, abso- 
lutely lost.” For men have come to see to- 
day, as they never saw before, that the very 
utmost that any man, by any possible way 
of thinking, could promise anybody in the 
future life is, that, at much greater pains, 
under greater difficulties, traveling a longer 
way back to God, he might have oppor- 
tunity to do just that which now he ought 
to do. There is no escape in the universe 
of God but by character. We are shut up 
to that. Everything, then, is at stake in 
temptation. 
2. Moreover, I think a man ought to ask 
' himself in these lower moments, Why the
-P-A-G-E-252
    240 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
lower moments? And the second suggestion, 
therefore, that I have to make is: Keep 
yourself persistently at your best. You have no 
right to have these lower moments contin- 
ually breaking in upon your life. Just as in 
health that is the secret, so here in character 
it is the secret. You are to guard conditions 
and strive to keep yourself at your very best. 
Not “tolerable” health, but superb health, 
what Emerson called “plus health,” must be 
the aim. In the same way, no man can be 
certain of character who is willing barely to 
keep the breath of moral and spiritual life 
in him, and is not aiming persistently at the 
very best of which he is capable, and there- 
fore conscientiously observing the conditions 
that will keep him at his best. It is the 
subtle gradual deterioration which we are 
to fear as we fear death. 
3. In the third place, if we are to fight 
rationally, we need definitely to constder the 
conditions under which we live,— bodily, pati 
and of assoctation. 
(1). And, first, a rational fight for char-
-P-A-G-E-253
    A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 241 
acter has its bodily conditions. I suppose there 
is hardly a clearer lesson in all modern 
psychology than the unity of man, mind and 
body. One may like it or one may not like 
it; it makes no difference. We are not now 
disembodied spirits, whatever we may be 
hereafter; we are in the body; we have to 
get on with our body; and we have to study 
the conditions of our body, if we expect to 
make such achievements as we ought to 
make in our moral and spiritual life. And 
these conditions are not far off. Let no man 
think that they are unimportant. What is 
the problem of character? The problem of 
character is, ultimately, the problem of self- 
control. That which distinguishes you from 
the animal below you, and that which dis- 
tinguishes you as a sane man from an insane 
man, is, to no small degree, this power of 
self-control. The animal, James says, has a 
“hair-trigger constitution.” What does he 
mean by that? He means simply that the 
animal, having an impulse, must yield to it; 
but as a human being you can hold yourself 
p
-P-A-G-E-254
  242 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
in check, and not yield to impulse, through 
attending to some other considerations. 
Self-control is, then, the root-virtue of 
all: «virtues: » It, is at: the :very) .center,-of 
character. But the center of self-control, 
of course, is will. And the center of will 
is attention. For if this temptation which 
now besets you is not to sweep you off 
your feet, what must be done? You must 
be able in the presence of the temptation 
to hold your attention fixed upon _ those 
higher considerations that ought to prevail, 
but seem now in danger of not prevailing; 
and if you can do that, you are safe; and if 
you can not do it, you are lost. 
The center of character is self-control. 
The center of self-control is will. The 
center of will is attention. Now what has 
all this to do with the body? Just this. The 
greatest cause of fatigue is attention; that is 
what tires more than anything else. It takes 
nervous energy to attend; and the supreme 
condition, therefore, of power of attention, 
so far as the body is concerned, is surplus 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
      
A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 243 
nervous energy. That is the whole problem. 
Character, self-control, will, attention,— its 
supreme physical condition, surplus nervous 
energy. One has no right, then, as a man 
who means to fight an honest moral fight, 
to disregard the conditions through which 
he is to get surplus nervous energy. ‘That 
means that he will definitely plan for it, 
that he is going to see to it that he gets 
sleep enough, to see that he gets exercise 
enough, to see that he attends to all those 
conditions that have to do with surplus 
nervous energy; especially, that he will 
avoid every species of excess, particularly 
emotional excess; and that he will thus 
honestly before God do what he can to 
keep in himself surplus nervous energy. 
Then he will have a margin of capital, 
with power to attend, with power to will, 
with power, therefore, of self-control. The 
danger of fatigue is, then, manifest. The 
record of Saturday nights in this world of 
ours is a tragic record; because that is the 
time when men are run down, at their worst
-P-A-G-E-256
  
  244 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
physically, and when, therefore, they are 
most exposed to every temptation. 
Now, one can not always control the 
conditions. There will be times when, in 
spite of all precautions, a man will find 
himself necessarily and rightly fatigued. 
But one is then to bear in mind that at 
that time he is to be specially on his guard 
against sudden onsets of temptation. There 
is nothing more clear in modern psychology 
than that the weakest in us, bodily, mental, 
moral, tends to come out in these moments 
of fatigue; and that, therefore, at these mo- 
ments we are to guard ourselves with special 
care against sudden temptation. 
Sometimes one comes to the beginning 
of the day with the consciousness that he is 
plainly not at his best, that he is on a low 
physical plane, that it is going to be hard 
for him to be what he ought to be that 
day. That is the day when one can know 
he has a fight on hand. One must prepare 
for it from the very beginning and watch 
it to the end. 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 245 
(2) In the second place, there are men- 
tal conditions to be carefully considered, if 
one is to fight his moral battle rationally. 
For it is not only true that we are one, 
body and mind, but it is also true that this 
mind of ours is in a wonderful degree one; 
and the unity of the mind makes it im- 
perative that there should not be lack at 
any single point. We do not know when 
we are sapping the foundations. Let me 
take simply two or three illustrations of the 
need of heeding this unity of our mind, 
where many might be taken. 
And, first, you can not play with your 
memories and be what you ought to be as 
moral men. There are men, for example, 
who like so well to tell a good story that it 
grows continually on their hands, and they 
simply get where they can not tell the truth 
if they want to. You know what happens 
under such circumstances. These men can- 
not trust their memory. Now, the power of 
holding yourself in the presence of tempta- 
tion often depends upon this: that you are
-P-A-G-E-258
246 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
able to recall vividly and with scrupulous 
accuracy the exact results of your previous 
experience; and, if you have played fast and 
loose with your memory, it will play you 
false in the hour of peril. 
  And note this other danger—vagueness of 
thought. If you allow yourself in it, you are 
not simply interfering with your intellectual 
growth; you are doing something to sap the 
foundation of your moral life; for the moral 
life is made up of a series of volitions that 
involve the definite choice of definite means 
to definite ends; and vagueness of thought, 
vague promises, vague aspirations, do not go 
well with that kind of direct, definite willing 
that belongs to character. 
Especially, in this matter of mental con- 
ditions, do not forget the necessity of the 
power of attention, and remember that any- 
thing that you do at any time really to 
strengthen your power of concentrated 
attention is so much added to your moral 
capital, and anything you do at any time to 
break down your power of attention is so 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 247 
much further preparation for disaster. If, 
then, you form the habit of going into your 
college lectures day after day and dreaming 
of the ends of the earth while you are there, 
you are not merely not doing your work as 
you ought to do it, but you are doing some- 
thing to break down this power of attention 
upon which your character depends. On the 
other hand, every time you hold yourself 
rigorously to the task that is appointed to 
you for the time, definitely attend to it and 
carry it through with concentrated attention, 
you are adding to your power to resist temp- 
tation. /The human spirit is not a bundle, 
but an organic unity, and you cannot break 
down the mental and not affect the moral. 
(3) Character has besides and preémi- 
nently conditions of assoctation. Here we touch 
upon what is really the supreme condition 
of all conditions. We know but one abso- 
lutely certain way to make character, and 
that is, through surrendering, persistent asso- 
ciation with those who have such a char- 
acter as we seek. That is the only way.
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Character is caught, not taught. It can not 
be given in lectures. But if you put your- 
self side by side with the man who has the 
spirit that you want, and surrender yourself 
with open-mindedness to the association 
with him, you will assuredly catch his char- 
acter. But you can get it in no other way. 
We shall need to return to this greatest of 
all conditions later from a little different 
point of view. 
4. Moreover, in our fight for character 
we need to remember that self-control, which 
is at the very center of character, in spite 
of its name, zs always positive, never nega- 
tive. I think many men have made disas- 
trous mistakes at this point. 
(1) That means, first, on account of the 
relation of mind to body, that one is to seek 
positive help from the body. I think Browning 
has that in mind in the Rabbi Ben Ezra 
when he says :— 
“To man propose this test: 
Thy body at its best, 
How far can that project thy soul 
On its lone way?”
-P-A-G-E-261
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 249 
I do not think that this is a skeptical, 
cynical question; but I think it is a chal- 
lenge, “a godlike challenge in the night to 
our too reluctant wills.” Any man who 
means to be the man he can be in character 
must say, “I am going to get positive help 
out of this body of mine.” 
And if that is to be true, he must make 
his body the best instrument that he can 
make it for the spirit, the very best medium 
for the spirit to work out through. I 
suppose that it ought to be true that a series 
of photographs of a man taken from year to 
year through his life ought to show that the 
spirit is increasingly dominating the body, 
and that the light of the spirit, yea, of the 
Spirit of God, is increasingly shining out 
through his face and bearing and mien. 
The man who intends to get the most 
help from his body, will, besides, make his 
body the very best foundation that he knows 
how to make it for the varied demands of 
life, broadly laid, deeply laid and well laid. 
He will further see to it that his bodily
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
exercise is a direct aid, as it may be, to 
intellectual and will training. For all the 
_ higher forms of bodily exercise, Romanes tells 
us, are exercises even more of the higher 
brain centers than of the muscles. Make 
your body help your soul; make your body 
project your soul on its lone way. One can 
sit down passively before nature and regard 
it as a limitation, if he will; or he can say, 
By the study of the laws of nature I will 
learn its secrets, and [ will make nature 
serve me. And one can do just that with 
reference to his body. 
Your body, once more, is an immediate 
trust from God for which you are respon- 
sible; and, in the sight of God, you are to 
cultivate not only, as one says, “the grace of 
a blameless body,” but you are to cultivate 
the grace of a positively helpful body. 
(2). Moreover, if self-control is to be 
positive, one must remember that control of 
the emotions is always indirect. You can not 
directly determine whether you shall feel or 
not. Emotion spontaneously arises in the
-P-A-G-E-263
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 251 
presence of its object. That you can not help; 
but you can direct your attention to another 
object. The small boy, who is looking 
through a fence at a patch of watermelons 
that is not his, can not prevent his mouth 
from watering, but he can run. And you can 
not keep your emotions from arising in 
attention to the exciting object, but you can 
think of something else. You are not clay in 
the hands of your circumstances. You were 
endowed with that which makes you akin 
to God in his creative power—a will. You 
can use that will in attending to something 
other than this object which now works 
upon your emotions. We are often told, 
today, that our environment makes us. That 
is a dangerous half truth. The whole truth 
is this: Not your environment makes you, 
but that part of your environment to which 
you attend makes you. The same environ- 
ment means very different things to different 
men. Why? Because different men are 
attending to different things in it. Let ten 
men travel over exactly the same route in 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  252 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Europe; do they come back with the same 
impressions? By no means. Each man has 
seen and gotten what he attended to. 
You are, then, to control your emo- 
tions indirectly through attention to some 
other object. You may also control your 
emotions by acting in the line of those emo- 
tions that you think you ought to have. At a 
given time, for example, a man may be feel- 
ing far from cheerful and without courage. 
This, at least, he can do: he can take a 
good, long breath, and stiffen up his back- 
bone, and put on the mien of cheer and 
courage, and, so doing, he is far more apt 
to become cheerful and courageous. There 
are two sorts of selves in you, a lower and 
a higher. You can be true to your higher 
self, or you can be true to your lower self. 
But you are bound to be true and loyal to 
your higher self, to the very highest vision 
that is given you. And one of the sensible, 
helpful ways to get the emotions you think 
you ought to have is to act in the line of 
them. It is to no man’s credit to act as ill
-P-A-G-E-265
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 253 
as he feels. He is rather bound often to act 
much better than he feels. And so acting, 
he will be helped to better feeling. 
(3) In the third place, positive self-control 
means that you are to attend, as I have al- 
ready implied, to something else than the temp- 
tation which threatens to engulf you, to re- 
place that tempting thought with some other. 
Do not merely fight a thought. You can not 
get rid of a thought—this envious, foul, 
or hateful idea that is in your mind —by 
simply saying, “I won’t think of that another 
minute.” All the while you are saying this, 
you are persistently keeping it in mind, you 
are thinking of it. You can get rid of it in 
just one way—by thinking of something else. 
~ You must take the positive way out. The 
law is merely this—it is a very simple law: 
You can not have an empty mind, and you 
can not think of two things with concentra- 
ted attention at the same time. As you try 
to follow this suggestion, it may seem to you 
that you can think of two things at the same 
time, but you will be mistaken. The trouble’
-P-A-G-E-266
254 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
is in lack of concentrated attention. When 
you seem to be thinking of two things at 
the same time, you are really thinking first 
of one thing then of another—letting the 
thought you ought to hold be broken in on 
continually by the tempting thought. Only 
keep your attention steadily fixed upon the 
consideration that ought to hold, and it will 
hold you. 
(4) And, in the fourth place, positive self- 
control means that we are to heed that 
principle which the psychologists call the 
impulsiveness of consciousness; that is, that every 
thought, by its very presence in the mind, 
tends to pass into act, and will do so if it is 
not hindered by the presence of some other 
thought leading in some other direction. 
‘That principle is of very great importance 
in all our moral and spiritual life. If you 
are sitting in the parlor of a friend, while 
you are waiting for him, and there is an open 
letter on the table, and you are not think- 
ing particularly of what you are doing, but 
have your eye on the letter, before you know
-P-A-G-E-267
A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 255 
it you will very likely put out your hand 
and take it up ;and begin to read it, until 
you recall yourself with a start. The single 
idea, unchecked for the moment by any 
other, was present in the mind; it passed 
into action almost in spite of you. The 
teaching of modern psychology, then, is 
that a thought in your mind will pass into 
act unless it is checked by some other 
thought; and for our moral life this is 
strenuous counsel to witistand beginnings. Do 
not dally with the temptation. Do not tarry 
in the presence of it. Do not do in thought 
the act to which you are tempted. Avoid 
the least thought of it. The thinking has its 
immediate bodily effect and has its imme- 
diate tendency to pass into act. Consequently, 
when you dally with temptation, when you 
see how far you can go in imagination with- 
out toppling over the precipice of overt sin, 
you are simply heating some brain center, 
and getting a thought ready to discharge 
into act. What is it but playing with sparks 
over a powder mine, nay, putting one’s
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS. IN EDUCATION 
finger on the trigger of a gun and begin- 
ning to press it, and yet expecting it not 
to discharge, when one keeps thinking of 
the thing he ought not to do, and still hopes 
to be kept from it. All this is only in line 
with the Scripture: “Keep thy heart with all 
diligence”; “Resist the devil, and he will 
flee from you”; “Every man is tempted, 
when he is drawn away of his own lust, and 
enticed.” 
But we can withstand the beginnings of 
evil, once more, only by conquering this 
tempting thought that is with us now by 
attending to some other thought. Anything 
that supplants the tempting thought will help, 
if it isn’t anything more than running, or 
saying the multiplication table. There was 
seen some time ago, in the city of Denver, a 
man running as for his life through the 
suburbs of that city. I suppose an onlooker 
would have found it rather hard to explain 
what that man was running for. As a matter 
of fact, he was fighting for his life with the 
liquor habit, and the appetite was strong
-P-A-G-E-269
    
A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 257 
upon him just then. He could not stop to 
consider or argue the matter at all; he knew 
just one thing—he must get out of the 
range of the saloons. It was a help to run. 
Of course, I need not say, it is far better 
and far safer than to trust to the trivial sup- 
planting thought, to be able to bring the 
great considerations before you—the highest 
motives, the inspiring personalities, the great- 
est person, Christ. In fact, the very difficulty 
in temptation is to make the consideration 
which would check the temptation stay in 
mind. It needs the strongest motives and 
interests. The lesser ones seldom avail. Is 
there, then, no person the thought of whom 
will help you in the presence of this tempta- 
tion—your mother, your child, your wife, 
your noblest friend, Christ Jesus himself 
—that can pluck you out of the power of 
this temptation? God has rescued many a 
man in dire temptation through the thought 
of some others whom he loved, and who 
loved him. Sometimes, when one feels des- 
perately that he has no care of the conse- 
Q
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
quences for himself, the thought of another 
who believes in him, who trusts him, though 
it is only a little child, will deliver him as 
from the mouth of the pit. And, let us keep 
it real to our minds that no one cares so 
much, loves so much, or trusts us so fully 
as Christ. 
(5) And positive self-control will mean, 
further, that you are to resist the evil with the 
good, that you are not simply to stop doing 
evil things because they are evil, but that 
you are to get into the attitude that Spinoza 
calls the attitude of the freeman, and have 
done with the evil because you have some- 
thing a great deal better to do. Change 
your negatives into opposite positives. I have 
little hope for a man who goes through his 
life saying, “What is the harm?” What kind 
of attainment can a man make in his moral 
life, if his one great question is, What is 
the harmr and if he does not replace that 
question with this other, What is the very 
best thing that is now open for mer For, 
next to the evil, the good is the worst
-P-A-G-E-271
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 259 
enemy of the best. We must try Chalmers’ 
“expulsive power of a new affection.” 
And that will mean that every temptation 
we shall take as a positive opportunity; and it 
may be just that. And when next you are 
under the pressure of strong temptation, 
remind yourself that you have the opportu- 
nity now to prove your loving loyalty to the 
Lord Jesus Christ. You have your oppor- 
tunity of conquest, of victory. You have 
your opportunity for progress in the direc- 
tion opposite to the temptation. It is an 
opportunity, real and great. I suppose it is 
some such thought as this that St. James 
has back of his words: “Count it all joy, 
my brethren, when ye fall into manifold 
temptations; knowing that the proof of 
your faith worketh patience”—steadfastness. 
“And let patience have its perfect work, 
that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking 
in nothing.” 
5. In the next place, if we are to make 
a truly rational fight for character, we need 
to remember that, body and mind, we are
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
made for action. ‘The body, one of our psy- 
chologists tells us, is only a machine for 
converting stimuli, coming into the brain 
by the afferent nerves, into reactions, go- 
ing out by the efferent nerves. And the 
principle of the impulsiveness of conscious- 
ness shows with equal clearness that in 
mind, too, we are made for action. Every 
idea tends to pass into action. We are 
made, then, for action. This is the real jus- 
tification of the far slower methods of the 
laboratory and seminar in modern education. 
One must do, to know. It is not enough 
passively to receive an idea; if it is really 
to be yours, you must express it in some 
way, you must put it into act. Your idea or 
ideal is not fully yours until you have 
expressed it. The resulting law for character 
is clear and unmistakable: That which 1s not 
expressed dies. If you would kill an idea, 
deny it absolutely all expression; it will die. 
On the other hand, if you have an idea that 
you wish to live, to be a reality, you must 
express it. You may not rest content with 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 261 
fine thoughts, and fancies, and sentiments, 
and feelings, and aspirations. If you are not 
willing to become mere sentimentalists, you 
must put them into act. Some of us have 
been in the habit of speaking of the danger 
from the theater and from novel reading, in 
arousing emotions and sentiments that we 
simply allow idly to be dissipated. We need 
to remind ourselves that the same law holds 
for emotion and sentiment, however aroused, 
whether by theater, or novel, or concert, or 
lecture, or sermon. If you have been stirred 
to moral feeling in any way, as you prize 
your moral life, see to it that your feeling 
gets some real and tangible expression, — put 
it into act. 
This principle of expression has this 
further application of central importance. 
Christ wishes to save you into his own life 
of ministering, self-sacrificing love. The 
character into which you must come, then, 
is that of self-sacrificing love. But you 
cannot live the life of love alone. If you 
are really to love, you must show it, you 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  262 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
must express it; you must yourself enter 
upon some ministering, some redeeming 
activity, of your own for another. You can, 
then, make no hopeful fight for your own 
character, without beginning at once a 
service for others. In some of our asylums, 
I am told, some of the less insane are set 
to care for cases a little more serious; and 
the men find in this responsibility for others 
not only distraction of attention from their 
own cases, but a constant strong motive to 
self-control, and so best win back their own 
sanity. In like manner he will be most 
surely redeemed into the loving character 
who enters most heartily, himself, into loving 
service for others —into real redeeming work. 
This is no doubt one of the chief keeping 
forces for the converts in city mission work. 
6. And, finally, the ease with which, under 
temptation, you can direct attention to the highest 
motives will depend upon your previous interests 
and habits of thought. Consequently, every bit 
of time that a man spends in the positive 
pursuit of higher things, in the presence of 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 263 
the best things, getting Aabituated to them, 
staying persistently, above all, in the atmos- 
phere of the life of Jesus Christ—every bit 
of time so spent is positive preparation for 
temptation. Give the best persistently a 
chance at you. The evil wrought in a man’s 
imagination by a single vile story may well 
illustrate the power that the persistent good ° 
may have. Christ’s apt use of the Scripture 
in his temptations shows that there had 
been habitually deep, earnest dwelling on 
the best things, that stands him now in 
stead. It is no superficial quoting that he 
does. So the Spirit of God, let us be sure, 
will use with us in temptation that part of 
his Word that we have earnestly and prayer- 
fully put beforehand into our thought and 
life. That is the sword of the Spirit in 
temptation. The habitual, earnest use of thé 
Bible, thus, not only gives God a chance at 
us at the time of our study, but also gives 
later help. It is one of our most practicable 
ways of associating with Christ. In the light 
of the principles we are now considering,
-P-A-G-E-276
  
264 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
Paul’s counsel to the Philippians, which . 
seems at first quite lacking in urgency, gets 
its full justification: “Finally, brethren, 
whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
are honorable, whatsoever things are just, 
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things 
are lovely, whatsoever things are of good 
report; if there be any virtue, and if there 
be any praise, think on these things.” Give 
them habitually a place in your thought, and 
it will be enough. The rest will care for 
itself. The mind readily recurs to its habitual 
associations. 
And so we return once more to that 
which is the foundation of all, and the one 
unfailing way to character—persistent asso- 
ciation with Christ. The only effective road 
to character we know, is through personal 
association with the best. The dynamic is 
finally personal always; in it God graciously 
allows the lesser personalities, down to the 
latest Christian, to share; but the fully 
adequate power for the production of the 
highest character is only in the greatest 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 265 
person, Christ. Only as men put themselves 
persistently, habitually, in his presence, is 
character secured. And a man is to do this, 
not vaguely and with mere mystical emotion, 
but with earnest, intelligent determination 
to know with thoroughness and appreciation 
the earthly historical manifestation of God 
in Christ—to become saturated with the 
spirit and teaching of Jesus until he has 
caught his convictions of God and the spiritual 
world, and has come to share his feeling 
toward God and man, and has taken his 
purposes of the Kingdom upon him. Only 
so, do we prove ourselves real learners of 
Christ; only so, are we faithfully fulfilling 
the conditions through which we may abide 
in Christ and Christ in us, and through 
which the Spirit may take the things of 
Christ and show them unto us. Christ 
means, so, personally to deliver us. And a 
man may count, as upon the very laws of 
the universe, upon the certain results of 
persistent association with Christ. 
Under temptation one needs the strong-
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
est motives. Now the most powerful forces 
in life are personal; and ofall personal rela- 
tions, the incomparable one —that which 
gives meaning and value to all the rest, that 
which has the capacity to become for any 
man who enters heartily upon it the mas- 
tering power of his life—is the relation to 
God in Jesus Christ. Here and here alone 
is the greatest dynamic for character and 
life; and so Christ says, “Abide in me 
and I in you.” “Apart from me ye can do 
nothing.” 
Let me summarize briefly a number of 
other considerations that may well weigh 
with a man in his fight for character. 
(1) In the first place, call the temptation 
by its right name. And upon this point hear 
one of our great American psychologists, 
Professor William James, of Harvard Uni- 
versity :-— 
“Where, however, the right conception 
is an anti-impulsive one, the whole intellectual 
ingenuity of the man usually goes to work 
to crowd it out of sight, and to find for
-P-A-G-E-279
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 267 
the emergency names by the help of which 
the dispositions of the moment may sound 
sanctified, and self or passion may reign 
unchecked. How many excuses does the 
drunkard find when each new temptation 
comes! It is a new brand of liquor which 
the interests of intellectual culture in such 
matters oblige him to taste; moreover it is 
poured out and it is a sin to waste it; also, 
others are drinking and it would be churl- 
ishness to refuse. Or it is but to enable him 
to sleep, or just to get through this job of 
work; or it isn’t drinking, it is because he 
feels so cold; or it’s Christmas day; or it is 
a means of stimulating him to make a more 
powerful resolution in favor of abstinence 
than he has hitherto made; or it is just 
this once, and once does not count, etc., etc., 
—ad libitum—it is in fact, anything you 
like, except being a drunkard.” —You would 
not believe that a man could offer such 
excuses to himself, even if a psychologist 
did say it, if you had not been guilty of 
just such unspeakable folly yourself with
-P-A-G-E-280
  268 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
reference to your own temptations.—“ That 
is the conception that will not stay before 
the poor soul’s attention. But if he once 
gets able to pick out that way of conceiving 
from all the other possible ways of conceiv- 
ing the various opportunities which occur, 
if through thick and thin he holds to it that 
this is being a drunkard and is nothing else, 
he is not likely to remain one long. The 
effort by which he succeeds in keeping the 
right name unwaveringly present to his mind 
proves to be his saving moral act.” 
And so, with reference to your tempta- 
tions. If you are a student, have you been 
doing your studying, for example, in a way 
that you know is not right? Then see to it 
yourself. Call it by the right name. Do 
not call it “ponying” and do not call it any- 
thing else but lying, living a lie. There are 
many other things in your college life and 
in all living to which you can apply the 
same line of thought. Call the temptation 
by its right name. 
(2) In the second place, learn yourself,
-P-A-G-E-281
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 269 
and yet without undue introspection. You 
can not go by others. The fact that a thing 
is safe for another man does not prove that 
it is safe for you. Reduce the occasions of 
temptation to a minimum. 
(3) In‘ the” third’ place, ‘fill ““your® tame 
with positive service and good. Do not drift. 
Have definite things on hand to do. 
(4) Remember, in the fourth place, the 
promise of God that you shall not be 
tempted above that you are able. Do not 
make the miserable weakling’s excuse, that 
you can not help it. You can help it. “God 
is faithful who will not suffer you to be 
tempted above that ye are able; but will 
with the temptation make also the way of 
escape.” And I think I may appeal to the 
consciousness of every man that, when under 
strenuous temptation he has still yielded, as 
he looks back upon it, he can see that there 
was a certain point when God, as it were, 
held the temptation in lull and showed 
him a clear way out and he refused to 
take it.
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
(5) And lay solemnly to heart that other 
counsel of Paul: “Let him that thinketh he 
standeth take heed lest he fall.” Few things 
are so stumbling as our conceit of ourselves. 
Keep, I pray you, the sense of constant 
dependence; apart from Christ you can do 
nothing. 
(6) And next, forget the things which are 
behind. It may be failure or it may be 
success that lies back of you; in any case, 
we are not to live in the past; forget the 
things that are behind. Press forward. Dis- 
couragement is of the devil. Sometimes a 
man is likely to feel that he is in a particu- 
larly religious frame of mind when he is 
discouraged. Nevertheless, nobody profits by 
your discouragement but the forces of evil. 
(7) If you do fall, go back at once to 
Christ. Here, again, I think many of us are 
often misled. We think that it is not quite 
respectable and fairly Christian to go directly 
back to the true life in relation to God and 
men; we think we should continue for days, 
perhaps, what is really a false penitence.
-P-A-G-E-283
  A RATIONAL FIGHT FOR CHARACTER 271 
The true penitence is shown in prompt 
surrender to duty. 
(8) And if you even doubt whether you 
are a Christian at all, do not debate it, but 
be one now. That is the whole of the matter, 
so far as you are concerned. 
(9) And remember that other golden 
word of Cecil’s: “Duties are ours; events 
are God’s.” You are not responsible for the 
results; you are responsible for the duties. 
Leave the rest with God. Do not carry his 
burden. 
(10) And do not forget, finally, the help 
of suffering. You will come to praise God 
that at certain times He put you in fiery 
trial. “Ye have not yet resisted,” the writer 
of the Hebrews says, “unto blood, striving 
’ And, sometimes, it seems as against sin.’ 
if it were only through suffering that some 
temptation loses its power over us. “Foras- 
much then as Christ suffered in the flesh, 
arm ye yourselves also with the same mind.” 
And this is life—temptation, trial, struggle, 
conflict, possible victory—the strenuous life!
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 PERSONAL AND IDEAL ELEMENTS IN EDUCATION 
You can not cowardly give up. And you 
need all the help you can have; and the 
only adequate help is Jesus Christ. If there is 
one man in history who, above all other men, 
I think, may be called a man of mighty 
will, it is the apostle Paul—certainly he was 
no weakling; but it was this man of mighty 
will who said, “O wretched man that I am! 
who shall deliver me out of the body of 
this deathr” He found but one deliverer: 
“T thank God through Jesus Christ our 
Lord.”

  Theology and the Social 
Consciousness 
A Study of the Relations of the 
Social Consciousness to Theology 
By HENRY CHURCHILL KING 
President of Oberlin College 
Author of “‘Reconstruction in Theology,” etc. 
CLOTH. 12MO. $1.25 net 
“The strength of Professor King’s eminently sane and help- 
ful book is not in brilliant and suggestive sentences, but in its 
clear unfolding of an elemental truth, and fearless and vigorous 
application of that truth to religious thinking. One cannot read 
it carefully without realizing that his thinking has been cleared 
of much mistiness, and that he has a deepened conception of a 
truth of superlative importance to which he has but to be steadily 
loyal to find a rational interpretation of his spiritual experience, 
and a safe guide amid the mazes of theological speculation.”— 
The Congregationalist. 
“We commend this book, because he who reads it must think 
as he reads, and will get a more vivid conception of the faith 
which he shares with the author.”—Epworth Herald. 
“The spirit of the book is wholly admirable . . . The book 
is a valid and true setting forth of the essential social and ethical 
character of Christianity, as against the metaphysical and falsely 
mystical interpretations of it that have so long prevailed.”— 
Literary Digest.

    Reconstruction in Theology 
By HENRY CHURCHILL KING 
President of Oberlin College 
CLOTH. 12MO. $1.50 
FROM THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
A new constructive period in theology, it may well be 
believed, is at hand. This book has been written with 
the earnest desire and hope that it may contribute some- 
thing toward the forwarding of a movement already going 
on—a really spiritual reconstruction of theology in terms 
that should bring it home to our own day. The book 
aims, first, to show that such a reconstruction is needed 
and demanded, because of the changed intellectual, moral, 
and spiritual world in which we live; and then, to char- 
acterize briefly, but sufficiently, this new world of our day; 
and finally, to indicate the influence which these convic- 
tions of our time ought to have upon theological concep- 
tion and statement, especially in bringing us to a restate- 
ment of theology in terms of personal relation. It has 
been a constant desire of the writer to help intelligent 
laymen, as well as theological students and ministers, to a 
more thorough and sympathetic understanding of the great 
convictions and scholarly movements of the day.

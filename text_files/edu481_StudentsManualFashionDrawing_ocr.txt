INTRODUCTION 
Many young people, who have a desire 
to draw, are much interested in fashion 
drawing and wish to take up the subject 
without any preparatory instruction in 
art. They thus bring to the study prac- 
tically no knowledge of fashions and very 
little knowledge of drawing. Successful 
instruction for such classes must neces- 
sarily follow a very definite and carefully 
worked-out plan. The first steps must be 
very simple, and the succeeding steps must 
follow in a carefully selected order and in 
easy stages, with numerous illustrations 
and ample opportunity for drill on funda- 
mentals. 
The author of this manual has had much 
experience in teaching pupils of the limited 
preparation suggested, in connection with 
her classes in fashion drawing at the Young 
Women’s Christian Association and the 
Albert Business College, Newark, N. J. 
The text sets forth in detail the course 
of instruction which has been followed with 
these classes and which has been found 
to give the quickest and best results. 
Fundamental principles are carefully ex- 
plained, but the author’s aim has been not 
so much to offer a discussion of methods in 
fashion drawing as to provide the means 
for practice in applying these methods. 
The pupil will learn best by carefully 
following directions and by constant prac- 
tice. The manual is to be used as a guide. 
In this connection it should perhaps be 
stated that the plates given in connection 
with the lessons are not supposed to 
be artistic or ‘“ pretty.” They are con- 
ventional charts illustrating the subject. 
As such they are very “set,” because in 
this way the meaning can be made clear with few lines. Merely copying these 
charts will not make the pupil a fashion 
artist. They are illustrations intended 
rather to teach the pupil how to study. 
Every chart is fully explained, and as 
each illustration is important, it must be 
mastered as it is encountered. Any part 
skipped will cause trouble later on. After 
the student has drawn all figures under- 
standingly, in a conventional manner, he 
should make original drawings, using these 
principles and pictures as guides, but put- 
ting feeling and grace into his work. 
After studying each lesson carefully 
until it is fully understood and making 
drawings for the same, study the fashion 
papers and find the subjects that you have 
learned. In this, select only pen and ink 
illustrations, as they are line drawings and 
are clear cut; photos and wash drgyvings 
are too vague for the beginner. 
In the fashion field, the artist may use a 
picture as a model and from it construct an 
original figure which may be dressed in 
any costume. 
Make a collection of pictures. Save all 
fashion papers, newspaper clippings, ad- 
vertisements, cards, etc. Place these in 
boxes, keeping them sorted; that is, 
figures in underclothes and the nude in 
one box, newspaper clippings in another, 
decorative work, such as dealt with in 
Lesson XXX, in another, etc. Begin 
right now to save, then when you get to 
the lessons on the back and on sitting 
figures, you will have something to work 
from. The cry has been so often, “I 
can not find any back figure in under- 
clothes.” Do not let this happen to you. 
In drawing, the pupil is urged to heed  
-P-A-G-E-8
vi INTRODUCTION 
  the following suggestions: When begin- 
ning to draw, use a blunt pencil point with 
plenty of lead exposed, at least one-third 
inch. For fine work, such as faces, hands, 
details, etc., use a very fine point. I can 
not be too emphatic about this. So many 
drawings are poor for the simple reason 
that a dull point is not the proper tool for 
fine lines. To save time, sharpen your 
pencil often on an emery pad. 
For the main part of costumes, a fine 
point is not good; have plenty of lead 
exposed and do not try to draw with the 
wood. 
When you use an eraser, build as you 
rub. . Erase the old lines often, allowing 
them to show, and on these indistinct lines 
make your drawing better. Use a soft 
rag or feather duster to clean off the specks. 
After drawing for a time, rest the eye, as 
the eye becomes stale with close watching. 
View your picture at a distance, reverse 
it in a looking-glass, turn it upside down. A diminishing glass helps in detecting 
errors. : 
Learn to criticise your own work, and 
let others criticise it for you, even if they 
are not artists. A novice will often see a 
defect that you have passed over. Be 
on the lookout for anything that will help 
you in your study, be it a picture, a book, 
or gowns themselves. 
Learn to trust to your eye, but if you are 
not satisfied with results, use the following 
measuring system to true up your work: 
On a piece of cardboard, one inch by four 
or five inches, mark off at the top a meas- 
urement of the model, say one-half head. 
Below this mark make another mark the 
size of one-half the head of your figure. 
See how many times the first measurement 
goes into certain parts on the model. 
Use the second measurement on all corre- 
sponding parts on your drawing.

STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
LESSON I 
THE DRESS FORM 
In taking up this lesson the student 
must remember that a good form is the 
foundation for all succeeding lessons. No 
matter how pretty w dress or design is, 
if it is placed on a “‘dumpy”’ figure, it 
will have no style whatever. 
In this lesson we first learn how to draw 
a layout for the form, which consists of two 
ovals, Fig. A, then how to place the form 
on this layout. In the next lesson we 
dress the same form in a very simple 
dress. 
A form must have good proportion and 
style. A form leaning forward, or making 
a bow, as one might express it, is not 
stylish, neither is one with too large a bust 
and a tiny waist; nor one with high, 
square shoulders. 
In this lesson we learn how to draw a 
form for a long dress, and as the styles 
change, the length of the skirt may be 
shortened. The waist goes into the skirt 
two and one-half times, the shoulders 
are thrown back, the sleeve is thrown out, 
and the skirt hangs straight down from the 
waist, flaring at the bottom. For a scant 
skirt do not. flare as much as for a full one. 
This form is used for dressmaker’s 
sketches, and for any dress to be placed on 
a lay figure. 
When the dress is on the human figure, 
action comes in play and a complete 
understanding of these lessons will enable 
the student to draw the human figure in a 
variety of positions, and also to dress the 
figure in a variety of costumes. The best way to begin the study of this and all 
succeeding lessons, is to read all points 
relating to a certain figure (of course begin- 
ning with Fig. A), without looking at the 
lesson plate; then take a hard pencil, or 
a dull point of some kind, re-read the in- 
structions, going over the lines of the figure 
with the point, according to the directions. 
Make careful note of the direction of the 
lines, and form a mental image of the figure 
by imagining that you are drawing it. 
Next select a sheet of drawing paper, 
and with a soft pencil (medium), draw Fig. 
A as directed below. Follow the way 
explained; the student will find progress 
much easier and quicker by proceeding 
as directed than by trying some other way. 
TO DRAW THE FORM 
Make the drawing somewhat larger than 
the copy, placing the figure in the center 
of the paper. This may be done by getting 
the proportions and measuring to see just 
where to begin the drawing. Leave a 
little more margin at the bottom, than at 
the top. 
Draw line 1, which is a very slight hori- 
zontal curve up, then lines 2, 3, 4, 5, 6and 7 
as marked on the lesson plate. Line 2 is 
thrown out for the bust, and line 3 is 
thrown in at the waist, which throws the 
shoulders back. Lines 4 and 5 cross lines 
2 and 3 at the waist, at first curving out 
for the hips, then curving in to the bottom 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
2 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  LESSON I 
  of the skirt oval. Line 6 (center line of 
waist) follows line 2, not literally, but taking 
the general direction, getting straighter 
as it reaches the waist line. Line 7 (center 
line of skirt) runs straight down from 
line 6. 
Make the drawing a three-quarter view, 
which shows the front, side, and one sleeve 
of the dress. In this position one may 
show a design on the outside of a sleeve 
or on the side of a dress. 
Practice this figure, doing it many times. 
When you feel confident that you un- 
derstand all that has preceded and can 
draw Fig. A with snap, take up Fig. B 
which is the dress form placed on Fig. A. 
Proceed with Fig. B in the same way, 
going over the lines and studying out the 
principles described below. The light 
lines are the lines of Fig. A and must be 
kept until the form is completed. Always 
keep the center line until the dress is 
finished. 
As already pointed out, the waist goes 
into the skirt two and one-half (23) times. 
Put on the collar above line 1, not too high 
and not too low, but just high enough to 
get good curves on the shoulders. Allow 
this distance at the bottom of the skirt 
oval. Be sure to make the collar three- 
quarter view, as is the waist and skirt. 
The center line of the collar is vertical, like 
the sides of the collar. 
The collar goes into the shoulders three 
(3) times and is about the same height. 
The lines of the collar curve down, as does 
the waist line, but the bottom of the sleeve 
curves up. In the back view this order is 
reversed, as is explained in Lesson II. 
The collar and waist lines curve up, and 
the bottom of the sleeve curves down. 
Note how line 2 is cut into for the chest 
(line 8), which comes out to the bust. 
This piece, cut off of line 2, may be used for 
a far sleeve, if a sleeve is to be drawn. 
For a sketch of a dress one sleeve is suf- 
ficient, a sketch being used to show how 
the dress is made. When drawing for reproduction, it is well to have two sleeves 
on a dress. 
Get good curves on the shoulders, con- 
necting the collar with the ends of line 1, 
and do not show too much of the inside 
of the collar and the bottom of the sleeves. 
Make the ellipses graceful, not pointed at 
the ends, and show the thickness of the 
goods by not connecting the lines. 
There are three planes at the waist: 
the front, and two sides. You observe 
but little of the far side in a three-quarter 
view. This is true of the collar also. 
These three planes on the waist run into 
each other, forming a graceful curve. 
The planes on the collar do the same. 
Put the skirt on with a flare, coming 
out at the hips (not in), and be sure to 
make a graceful curve on the bottom of the 
form. Remember that the waist, skirt, 
and collar are all three-quarter view. 
Throw the sleeve out (curving very 
slightly in, to take away the stiffness). 
The upper half of the sleeve is somewhat 
larger than the lower half, the bend coming 
opposite the waist line. This makes the 
length of the upper part of the sleeve equal 
to that of the lower part. 
The armhole has a slight plane on the 
shoulder and from there it curves slightly 
towards the front, but do not hollow the 
armhole too much. Be sure to throw the 
sleeve out. The armhole is not as large 
as one would suppose by the drawing, 
as the sleeve touches the waist after it 
leaves the armhole. Note the cross line 
where the armhole goes under the arm. 
To test the accuracy of your form, drop 
the dotted lines from the center of the near 
shoulder to the end of the waist line. 
This line must be vertical or parallel with 
the edges of your paper. Drop the dotted 
line from the end of the far shoulder to 
the other end of the waist line. This line 
also must be vertical. 
If you have followed all directions care- 
fully, you will have a good form on which 
any costume may be placed.

LESSON II 
TO PUT THE DRESS ON THE FORM 
Study Fig. C by going over it with a 
point, as directed in Lesson I, until it is 
thoroughly understood. Then draw the 
form as directed in Lesson I. When you 
feel confident that your form is good in all 
respects, with light lines, place the dress 
on the form as directed bclow. 
Decide how far down the V in the neck 
opens, and mark off on the center line, 
curving the far side of the V around the 
neck to the center line. The near side 
takes a slight reverse curve around the 
neck to the center line. 
Remember, in dressing up a form that it 
is oval, and the lines must follow the form, 
and not be drawn straight. Draw just as 
few lines as possible, in the right direction. 
Women’s clothing opens from right to 
left. As this dress opens past the center 
line, continue the far side of the V past 
the center line to the opening of the waist, 
which follows the center line of the waist. 
The skirt opens directly under the waist 
opening, and follows the center line of the 
skirt, which hangs straight down. 
Place the belt one-half above and one-half 
below the waist line, curving the lines to 
follow the waist line. The sides of the belt 
are vertical. This belt is flat and does not 
show the opening. 
The waist blouses over the belt in front, 
and extends past the belt at the sides. 
Note the slight change of direction where 
the waist opens and goes under the blouse. 
Tf the waist were not bloused, the lines 
would follow the form and go into the belt, 
showing its full width. 
Place all buttons on the center line, hav- 
ing the buttons the same size and evenly 
spaced. After a while the student’s eye will be able to judge distances; until then 
it might be well to measure from the 
center of one button to the center of the 
next button, marking each center with a 
dot. Around these dots draw the buttons. 
Note the large buttons at the bottom 
of the page. Draw the top of the button 
and then the bottom; in this way the 
student can obtain better-curves. 
A flat round button has a small shadow 
underneath, darkest at the bottom. A 
high, round button casts a shadow like a 
sphere. To obtain this draw the round 
of the button, then draw another round 
the same size through the center of the 
first one, blackening the part underneath 
the button. The buttonholes may be 
drawn with one or two lines, but must 
be opposite the center of the buttons, and 
run straight out to the left of the drawing 
(as you face the figure). 
The turnover collar is sewed on at the 
top of the high collar and flares at the 
bottom. Make the collar open in the center 
and curve it around the neck. The chem- 
isette opens past the center line. Note all 
guide lines drawn through the turnover 
collar, cuffs, and center of pocket, also at 
the ends of the buttonholes and between 
the pockets. 
The cuff, which follows the bottom line 
of the sleeve, curves up. It is sewed on 
at the bottom and flares slightly at the 
top. Do not flare too much. 
Put the pockets on at the right height 
for the hands and keep them the same 
size and about an even distance from the 
center line. As the far side is lost some- 
what, show a little less of it than the near 
side,
-P-A-G-E-15
  LESSON II TO PUT THE DRESS ON THE FORM 5 
  Note how the flaps of the pockets extend 
past the pockets, and how both pocket and 
flap extend past the skirt on the far side. 
Be sure to make the pockets the right size 
for the dress. 
Next comes the fullness of the skirt. A 
skirt cut with no fullness at the top and 
much fullness at the bottom—like the 
lesson plate—must be a flare skirt. How- 
ever, this is not the point to be illus- 
trated. The idea to be grasped by the 
student is how to draw fullness which goes 
in and out of the bottom of the skirt. 
In Lesson III we shall learn how gathers 
at the top of a skirt are drawn. 
XX is the edge of the fold and hangs 
straight down to the bottom of the dress 
form. X is where the fold touches this 
line. O is on a line with X, but the skirt 
being full, O appears farther back. Draw 
so, gradually bringing the bottom line of 
the dress out to the next X, etc. The 
hem follows the bottom line of the dress, 
not of the form. The opening of the skirt 
runs down to X, the nearest point. O is 
back. 
All stitching must be evenly spaced, an 
even distance from the seam, and not too 
near it. On the left of the skirt the stitch- 
ing is drawn on the hem, on the right side 
the way to draw is explained. Until 
the student can judge distances, measure 
from X up to the top of the hem, which is 
the same width as from O to the top of the 
hem. Mark with dots at these points 
and between them, and draw light lines 
through these points. When you are con- 
vinced that the hem follows the bottom 
line of the dress, draw the stitching. 
If the skirt is not as full in places, X and 
O will run together, as illustrated on the 
right side of the skirt. To do this once 
in a while will make a more graceful draw- 
ing. 
Note where the three principal wrinkles 
come on the sleeve. 
As an application of this lesson, cut out 
of a fashion paper a pen and ink drawing (about six inches in height) of a simple 
dress illustrating what you have learned 
in this lesson; a dress with collar, cuffs, 
belt, pockets, stitching, buttons, and full- 
ness at the bottom. Cut off the head, 
feet and hands, as the dress is all you need. 
Draw a three-quarter view form facing 
the same way as the clipping, and dress 
it in this dress, using the principles learned, 
not merely copying the lines. Do not 
bend the arms. Draw like Fig. B. 
Learn how to draw the form facing the 
other way and dress it in a simple dress. 
If you find this difficult, take a sheet of 
tracing paper, trace off Figs. A and B 
of Lesson I, turn this tracing wrong side 
up and you will have the form facing in the 
opposite direction. 
THE BACK FORM 
It is not necessary to repeat in every 
lesson details as to how to study, as the 
student is expected to remember and apply 
all previous lessons on each new lesson. 
Take each lesson slowly, learning it com- 
pletely, then proceed to the next one. 
The back form is drawn sometimes full 
and sometimes three-quarter view. In 
this lesson we take up the full back in 
detail, but a small three-quarter back 
view is illustrated in the upper right- 
hand corner of the lesson plate. The 
center line in this view is vertical and at 
one side of the middle of the drawing. The 
near armhole is hollowed in and the far 
armhole is lost. Study the full back 
(Fig. £) at first and later draw the three- 
quarter view. 
Draw layout D for full back, drawing 
the lines in order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The 
student can see for himself just what these 
lines do. Do not make the waist tco 
small. Remember that the waist goes into 
the skirt two and one-half times and that 
the center line is in the middle of the draw- 
ing, and runs straight down. . 
On layout D draw Fig. £, placing the

  LESSON. II 
  collar above line 1, a little higher than in 
the front view, and connect the ends of 
the collar with the shoulders. The collar 
and waist lines curve up, but the bottom 
of the sleeve curves down. The top of 
the cuff follows the bottom line of the 
sleeve, exposing the inside of the cuff. 
The armholes must be the same size and opposite each other. Do not hollow 
the armholes too much. Throw the sleeve 
out (curving very slightly out, to take away 
the stiffness). This is the reverse of the 
front view, which curves slightly in. 
The waist is full in the front as shown by 
the blouse at the sides, but the back is 
perfectly plain and tight.

  LESSON III 
THE SIDE-PLAITED SKIRT 
Lessons III and IV are devoted to skirts 
and it will be well for the student to 
thoroughly master these, as any part 
slurred over will cause trouble later on. 
Fig. F is a combination of a side-plaited 
and a box-plaited skirt. The student is 
expected to draw two skirts and not combine 
them as done on the lesson plate. 
Begin with the side-plaited skirt (Fig. 
F which is a full front view). Draw the 
form, being sure to make a graceful 
ellipse at the top, and after placing the 
belt as directed in Lesson II, mark off 
at the waist the size of the center box- 
plait, the sides of which are an even 
distance from the center line. Decide 
upon the width of the side plaits, which 
must be in good proportion to the box- 
plait, and on each side of the box plait 
mark them off, being sure to have all the 
plaits the same width. From these points 
draw lines down, flaring slightly until they 
touch the bottom line of the skirt form. 
Each plait will touch this line at X, the 
nearest point O is back, draw so, as in the 
skirt with fullness at the bottom (Lesson 
II), but make each plait a sharper point 
than in the gathered skirt. The deeper 
the plait the farther back O is from X. 
The plaits are wider at the bottom than at 
the top. Not being stitched down, they 
open somewhat after leaving the belt. 
THE BOX-PLAITED SKIRT ora 
After drawing a complete form for this 
skirt and placing the belt as directed 
before, draw the front box-plait, marking 
the size at the waist. On each side of this 
front plait, mark off the distance between it and the next plait, then the size of the 
following box-plait, which must be the 
same width as the first one, until all the 
plaits are marked at the waist. Draw 
all lines down until they touch the bottom 
line of the form, flaring slightly as in the 
side-plaited skirt. You will observe that 
each box-plait has two XX’s, and a very 
gentle curve up between them. The star 
(*) is the distance between the box-plaits, 
and is back, the same as O. This star line 
curves up, and the deeper the plait the 
higher the star line is from X. 
For both box-plaited and side-plaited 
skirts be careful to make the plaits even 
at the bottom and at the top, and if your 
lines are straight the width between the 
top and the bottom will also be even. 
THE OVER-SKIRT (LONGER IN THE BACK) 
To the student with untrained eye the 
lines of an over-skirt,. panier, and puff 
seem very confusing, but after study- 
ing and drawing the three figures G, H, 
and I, the literal meaning of the lines 
will be understood, and the student will 
be abie to use this knowledge to great 
advantage when sketching from a costume. 
In Fig. G, for example, one side of the 
over-skirt is plaited and the other side is 
gathered. It will be well for the student 
to make two drawings and not combine 
them as on the lesson plate, thus deriving 
more practice upon the subject. 
This over-skirt is longer in the back than 
in the front, consequently it shows the 
under part of each plait. 
The under-skirt is sewed on at the waist 
and flares. Note the guide lines of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
10 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON Til 
  under-skirt as they run up to the waist 
line. 
The over-skirt is also sewed on at the 
waist but flares more than the under- 
skirt as it descends. XX is the edge of the 
fold and hangs straight down. The 
“square ” is the inside crease of the fold, 
which also hangs straight down from the 
belt, the lower part only being exposed to 
view. 
Begin with the curved line in the front 
of the skirt (that is, after the form is well 
drawn), then draw XX down from the waist 
and curve it around. It descends as it 
goes until it almost touches the under 
fold (square), where it comes out from 
under the skirt. The under fold hangs 
down, curves around, descends until it 
almost touches the next XX, etc. Note 
the guide lines of one of the plaits as it 
runs up to the waist line. 
The other side of this skirt being 
gathered, the lines of the fullness at the 
top fall down between the lines of the full- ° 
ness which run up from the bottom. 
Note how the over-skirt fits around the 
under-skirt, descending toward the back. 
THE PANIER 
If the student has been successful with 
the lines of Fig. G, the panier will be easy 
to draw. 
The lines of the panier (Fig. H) are the 
same as in the over-skirt (Fig. G), but the 
panier projects at the hips in a ruffle 
effect while the over-skirt hangs straight 
down. 
This skirt is drawn three-quarter view, 
which shows the full panier on the near 
side and but little of it on the far side. 
Note how different the lines look on the 
far side, as you see but little of the under 
surface of the goods. THE PUFFED SKIRT 
The lines for the puff are somewhat dif- 
ferent and yet somewhat the same as in 
Fig. G, as the lines curl around and fit into 
each other. A skirt that is puffed at the 
hips will extend past the nornial skirt 
line. Note these lines as seen through the 
puff, but instead of the ruffle effect, as 
seen on the panier, the goods is drawn in 
again, hence the puff. The puff means 
that the goods is gathered and is very 
full, therefore the goods beneath the puff 
is also very full, as the lines indicate in 
Fig. J. The lines under the puff are 
heavier, caused by the shadow cast by the 
puff. Note the crispness and the sharp- 
ness of the lines as they curl around and 
fit into each other. 
SKIRT WITH YOKE AND TUCKS 
As we learned before ‘ the lines follow 
the form” so the yoke must fit around 
the form, hence it follows that the yoke 
line (if a perfectly plain yoke) will follow 
the waist line. 
If there happens to be a fancy design on 
the yoke, the general direction of the yoke 
will fit the form, but will be broken into 
by the design. 
Place the tucks an even distance from 
the center line the same as the plaits, 
but if stitched down, as they are in Fig. 
J, they will not flare. Note the guide 
lines drawn through the ends of the tucks 
(where they stop) and where the fullness 
begins. 
To test the knowledge acquired from this 
lesson draw numerous forms three-quarter 
view, or full front, and dress them in skirts 
like the ones illustrated in this lesson. 
Use pen-and-ink clippings of skirts.

LESSON IV 
THE TUCKED SKIRT 
In Lesson IV only the bottom of the 
tucked skirt (Fig. K) is illustrated, but 
for practice—and much practice is required 
on each lesson—draw a complete skirt form 
with a graceful ellipse at the top, not show- 
ing too much of the back of the ellipse, 
then place as many XX’s as you think 
will look well. In the figure we have two 
on the near side and one on the far side 
(the skirt being a three-quarter view). 
After getting a good bottom line, place the 
tucks on the skirt according to directions. 
We learned in Lesson II that the hem 
followed the bottom line of the dress, not 
of the form; therefore tucks, bands, 
braiding, or any trimming which goes 
around the bottom of a skirt, must also 
follow this line. 
Place all the X’s and O’s carefully before 
attempting to put the tucks on; because 
when the bottom line is poor, and if the 
tucks follow this poor line, the whole skirt 
will have a peculiar appearance. 
Begin at the front, and after deciding 
how high the first tuck is to be, draw it 
around as you would a hem, being sure to 
follow the bottom line. If you do this 
carefully with the first tuck, there will be 
no difficulty in drawing the remaining 
ones. ; 
A tuck must be the same width in all 
places and appear to go in and out of the 
fullness and go around the edges of the 
skirt at the same height, not down or 
up in the back. 
If all the tucks are of equal width, like 
the ones on the lesson plate, draw so, but 
if different widths are required, gauge 
accordingly. 
The tucks are sewed at the top and ex- 
13 tend a little past the side of the skirt at 
the bottom. Occasionally this will happen 
at XX, but not often. Note the X’s and 
O’s on the first tuck. 
The top of each tuck may be indicated 
by a broken line for stitching, it being 
well to draw the continuous line at first. 
Bias bands are stitched on both edges. 
They cling to the dress. 
THE CIRCULAR OVER-SKIRT 
A circular over-skirt is plain at the top 
and ripples at the bottom. 
Fig. L represents two over-skirts, the 
top one being even all around, the under 
one being pointed on the front, the point 
being on the center line. Observe X 
and O on this skirt. As the skirt is shorter 
on the sides than in front, O is very much 
higher than X. Note the guide lines for 
the bottom of the over-skirt and of the 
under-skirt, where it runs up to the waist. 
THE RUFFLED SKIRT 
Ruffles are hard for a beginner to draw, | 
there being no special rule to go by. They 
must be graceful, and full or scant as 
required. 
A ruffle which is very full will stick out 
at the bottom and expose the under part. 
(See the ruffle at the top of the Lesson 
Plate.) 
On a very full ruffle you will occasionally 
observe a set form, but if repeated too 
often the effect will be a row of autumn 
leaves or sea shells. 
Note the set form marked by the arrow. 
On each side of this form two XX lines
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  LESSON IV 
  curve out, the goods being gathered in at 
the top. The form is narrower where 
sewed on than at the bottom. Notice 
the under part of this set form, the lines 
being somewhat the same as the lines of 
an over-skirt. 
In between these set forms the line of 
the bottom of the ruffle waves in and out, 
the set form being nearer to you than the 
wavy part. 
All lines for the fullness must look as if 
they were pulled together at the top of the 
ruffle. The lines XX at the right side 
curve out to the right, and on the left 
side they curve out to the left. 
A scant ruffle will have somewhat the 
appearance of the bottom of a full skirt, 
but the XX lines are more curved than the 
skirt lines. Materials like taffeta, calico, 
etc., which’are stiff and heavy, will have 
rounding lines like the ruffle at the top 
of the lesson plate. ‘Tulle, which is stiff 
but thin, will have lines which are 
straighter and sharper. (See Example.) 
Draw the ruffle at the top of. the page, 
and when you are convinced that you 
can do this satisfactorily, draw Fig. M. After placing X’s and O’s for the bottom 
line, draw guide lines the width of the ruffle 
on which place the ruffle. 
The ruffle must go in and out of the full- 
ness. 
This skirt (Fig. M) is gathered at the 
top. The lines of the fullness from the 
waist fall down between the lines of the 
fullness which run up from the bottom. 
Study the lines of fullness on other draw- 
ings and notice that some lines are short, 
some long, and some meet in a V near the 
waist line. If the material is heavy, all 
lines of fullness will go under the band, 
but if thin material is used some lines will _ 
fall short of the band and be hooked at 
the top. 
All lines for fullness must be sharp and 
snappy. Practice such lines with bold 
strokes, on a separate piece of paper. 
A ruching has the appearance of two 
ruffles, one turned up and the other down, 
the lines being the same. It is darkest 
where gathered, which is in the middle. 
(See example.) 
Apply this lesson as you did the previous 
ones. ~ :

LESSON V 
Lessons V and VI being devoted to 
waists, the student is expected to pay 
strict attention to all points relating to each 
drawing, as the waist is a very important 
feature. 
If you succeeded with Lessons I and II, 
you will have no difficulty with this lesson, 
as the form is the same, but instead of very 
simple waists being placed upon it, some- 
thing new is to be learned on each new 
figure. 
THE PLAITED WAIST 
After drawing the form for Fig. N, 
place the waist on the form, following all 
previous rules. 
It will not be necessary to repeat all 
instructions as the student is supposed to 
have learned them by this time. All new 
information will be given for each figure, 
and when combined with previous lessons, 
there should be no difficulty in rendering 
Lessons V and VI satisfactorily. 
Fig. N shows a tight waist with deep 
plaits running over the shoulders. They 
follow the center line. It also has a vest, 
the V of which is on the center line and the 
opening under the first plait. 
Follow Lesson II carefully in all details 
when putting on the waists, and note all 
guide lines on the new lesson plates. 
The belt is flat and the buckle is placed 
on the center line, the buckle being merely 
suggested here. The buckle in detail is 
given below. Study it carefully. It is 
oblong *_ .aape and fits over the belt, 
that ‘s, “the belt must run through the 
‘ buckle. See how the buckle curves to fit 
th, waist. Make all widths even and place 
‘ .e hole and fastening over the center line. 
17 The sleeve of Fig. N is tight on the inside 
and bloused on the outside. Note the 
guide lines of the sleeve form seen through 
the sleeve; the normal sleeve form being 
first drawn and the sleeve placed upon 
it afterwards. 
Flare the gauntlet at the bottom, and 
place all buttons at even distances at the 
back of the sleeve. 
The fullness at the top of the sleeve 
follows its form and at the bottom is 
only at the back. 
THE RUFFLED WAIST 
In Fig. P we have a waist with fullness 
but not bloused as in Lesson II. The 
fullness, being gathered at the belt, flares 
in a ruffle effect below it. 
The right side of the belt laps over the 
left, past the center line. Make it definite 
which side of the belt is on top. 
The ruffle is placed around the neck and 
falls in a jabot down the front of the waist, 
the lines being the same as the lines of the 
over-skirt. (Lesson III, Fig. G.) Here, 
as in the over-skirt, you observe the wrong 
side of the material. 
In placing the ruffle and jabot, draw the 
small V for the neck, then the large V 
for the width of the jabot. Note how the 
lines of the large V curve around the form. 
After ascertaining the width of the 
ruffle and jabot, draw them within these 
guide lines, applying the principles of 
Lesson III, Fig. G. 
Like the panier (Lesson III, Fig. H) 
you see but little of the under surface of 
the goods on the far side. 
The band on the sleeve fits tightly 
around the arm and is a continuation of the
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  18 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON V 
  guide lines of the sleeve form, the sleeve 
flaring above and below it. 
THE BENT SLEEVE 
The bending of a sleeve causes it to 
wrinkle. Study the bent sleeve and note 
the wrinkles which lie mainly on the inside. 
At the elbow the wrinkles curve around the 
form toward the outside. 
COLLAR 1 
Collar 1 is a stiff collar turning over and 
standing away from the neck. Be sure 
to fit it around the neck, but do not draw 
the lines too near it. 
COLLAR 2 
Collar 2 is of fine plaiting, standing up 
and down around the neck, being held close 
to the neck by a tight band. 
Draw guide lines for the width of each 
part, and all lines from the band out to these lines, connecting them at the bottom 
and top as described in Lesson III, Fig. F 
(plaited skirt); but if connected sometimes 
sharp and sometimes wavy, it will take 
away the stiff appearance of the set plaits 
and make the goods look soft and thin. 
COLLAR 3 
Collar 3 is made of fluting, being placed 
around a low neck, the lines being very 
regular. Note the XX lines, and where 
the fluting turns up. You would readily 
see the underside of the fluting, but these 
lines may be omitted as too many lines 
cause confusion. 
Apply this lesson and Lesson VI as you 
did the previous ones. You will find many 
kinds of waists to draw, but the main 
principles are given in these lessons, and 
by applying them carefully, you will have 
no difficulty in -drawing any design. 
Always draw understandingly. Do not 
merely copy the lines of a picture.

LESSON VI 
THE TUCKED WAIST 
In Fig. Q is shown not only a waist but 
a sash as well. First draw the waist, 
then the sash. : 
The yoke curves slightly to follow the 
form, the lines for the yoke being directly 
opposite each other. Be careful to make 
the yoke fit into the top of the sleeve and 
not hang over like a collar. This may 
seem unnecessary advice, but students 
have made this mistake. The fullness 
falls from the yoke, the main lines following 
the form, although a few of the smaller 
ones may take the opposite direction. 
The tucks follow the waist line and wave 
slightly (the waist being a full one). 
They extend past the form at the sides. 
The vest lines follow the center line. Be 
particular to draw the tucks directly oppo- 
site each other on both sides of the vest. 
Place the full sleeve on the form, there 
being no fullness at the top, while the bot- 
tom hangs well over the deep gauntlet. 
The cuff, being pointed at the back, 
causes a slight reverse curve at the top. 
The inside of the cuff follows the bottom 
line of the sleeve, gradually changing until 
it takes the opposite direction for the point, 
which is at the back. The cuff being open, 
you observe a little of the wrong side of the 
opposite point. 
The sash is all important. It fits around 
the waist, being crossed in the back, and 
' from there it fits around the hips and is 
tied at the side of the front. 
In placing this full girdle, draw as if it 
were a flat belt, then place the fullness, 
which extends just a little past the normal 
waist line, as does also the part that fits 
the hips, which extends just a little past 
the normal hip line. 
21 After ascertaining the width, realizing 
that it is narrower where tied than at the 
other parts, draw the lines for the fullness, 
all lines fitting between other lines. 
The left-hand side of ‘the sash, after 
going under the right side, hangs over it 
and both ends hang straight down. Note 
XX on the ends. The ends being cut 
diagonally, the lines are like the lines of 
the over-skirt. (Lesson III, Fig. G.) 
THE TIGHT JACKET 
In Fig. R is shown a tight jacket effect 
over a kimona sleeve, the jacket having 
a large armhole and extending past the 
under-waist on the shoulder and under the 
arm. 
As learned in Lesson II, the near side 
of the V neck takes a slight reverse curve, 
therefore in Fig. R, continue this reverse 
curve to the point. This makes the waist 
fit well over the bust. 
The V at the bottom must also be on the 
center line. Draw the guide line to the 
other point, which is a continuation of the 
far side of the V neck. This guide line 
continued still farther will give the V 
opening at the bottom of the jacket. 
The collar turns over, therefore the lines 
for the plaiting will take sharp turns in 
another direction. 
In drawing a kimona sleeve place the 
normal armhole, then make the armhole 
much looser. This causes a deep wrinkle 
when the arm is down. 
COLLAR 4 
In Collar 4 is shown a deep collar with a 
point hanging over the sleeve. Note the
-P-A-G-E-32
22 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION 
change of direction where the collar hangs 
over the sleeve. 
COLLAR 5 
Collar 5 has a ruffle placed evenly around 
the top, extending well past the sides. If 
the student understands the lines of the 
ruffle (Lesson IV), he can easily place the 
same on this collar. : 
COLLAR 6 
Collar 6 is the front of a sailor collar. 
Make the points directly opposite each 
other. In this collar the student will 
observe how the collar is sewed on the edge 
of the neck, extending past it. DRAWING LESSON VI 
COLLAR 7 
Collar 7 happens to be more of a cape 
effect than a collar. It hangs well down 
over the shoulders, rippling slightly at the 
bottom. Note the XX lines, the under 
surface of the goods, and where the cape 
fits around the sleeve. 
Note all the guide lines around the neck, 
as the collar must have the appearance of 
going around the neck at the same height. 
THE POINTED GIRDLE 
In the deep pointed girdle, the lines are 
drawn as explained in Fig. Q. The bottom 
line follows the waist line, and the top, on 
the near side, curves down, while the far 
side takes the opposite curve around the 
form. : 
See application of Lesson V.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
 
-P-A-G-E-34
LESSON VII 
THE LARGE COAT 
A form in a large coat has the appearance 
of being somewhat stouter than a form in 
just a dress, but in reality it is the coat 
that gives this effect. 
Draw the form the same size as for a 
dress. Place the coat upon it according 
to previous instructions, but let the coat 
touch the form on the shoulders, chest, 
and bust only. Elsewhere it hangs well 
away from the form, as designated by the 
guide lines seen through the coat. 
As the collar is high, standing well up 
at the back of the neck, the near side view 
of the V is a straighter line than the reverse 
curve in Lesson II, Fig. C. The large 
collar breaks on the shoulder, but do not 
bring the break below the shoulder line. 
The belt being very wide and standing 
well away from the form, the curve is some- 
what less than a belt which fits the form 
tightly. 
When drawing the near side of the collar 
to the opening, do not touch the line of the 
opening, thus giving the collar the appear- 
ance of being turned over. 
For a double-breasted coat, all buttons 
must be an even distance from the center 
line and evenly spaced, as shown by the 
guide lines. 
As the coat sets away from the form, the 
fullness above and below the belt does not 
cling to it and does not follow the form. as 
in Lesson V, Fig. P, but hangs straight 
up and down, the fullness above and below 
the belt being on a line. 
The bottom of a coat should be drawn the same as the bottom of a dress. Be 
careful to make the opening at X promi- 
nent. 
Study the separate belt at the bottom of 
the lesson plate. Place the point directly 
in the middle, having the diagonal lines 
even. Note the vertical guide line where 
the point ends. Make one side of the belt 
lap well over the other. 
The turn-over point of the belt must 
have the appearance of going over the 
top of the belt, so do not draw this piece 
even with the top of the belt. The butten 
is in the middle of the point and the 
diagonal sides are even. 
Study the back collar. It curves up at 
the top, but being very deep it takes a 
downward curve at the bottom. Note the 
breaks which show that the collar is going 
around the neck toward the front. 
In drawing the collar with the reveres 
make the points of the collar opposite 
each other, also the reveres, and the 
places where the collar and reveres are 
joined. Refer to Lessons V and VI for 
collars. 
24 In drawing the shawl collar, show the 
thickness of the goods by not connecting 
the front lines with the back of the collar. 
Fig. T is a very simple coat illustrating 
the principles of how a large coat should 
fit. The student is expected, however, 
to draw all kinds of coats, and if he keeps 
this lesson and all previous ones in mind, 
there should be no difficulty in rendering 
all coats satisfactorily.

LESSON VIII 
PLAIDS, STRIPES AND FIGURES 
By this time the student should be pro- 
ficient in drawing dresses, and if this is the 
case, plaids, stripes and figures will seem 
very easy. ; 
Around Fig. U will be seen many ex- 
amples of plaids, but. the student should 
pay no attention to them until the prin- 
ciple of all plaids is understood. 
It is assumed that the student has drawn 
the outline of Fig. U, and that a very good 
bottom line has been secured. If not, 
re-draw the outline before attempting to 
plaid it. 
Suppose it is desired to stripe this dress 
up and down. Begin on the skirt by 
placing all stripes at the belt, using the 
instructions given for the plaited skirt, 
Lesson III, Fig. /, and draw directly down 
to the bottom line, but do not flare as you 
did the plaits. Some of the stripes will 
vanish at the sides. 
On the waist the stripes follow the center 
line, fitting nicely over the bust. They 
continue to do this until they reach the 
arm, where they take the opposite direc- 
tion and follow the under-arm line. Re- 
member the instructions given in Lesson 
II, ‘‘The form is oval and the lines follow 
the form.” On the sleeve they follow the 
form up and down. 
On this foundation any kind of a stripe 
may be created. 
To place a plaid on a dress draw all up 
and down stripes, then all stripes going 
around, being careful to make the squares 
as even as possible. 
All stripes running around a skirt should 
be marked on the center line from the 
bottom up to the waist, placing one-half 
of a square on each side of the center line. 
27 The stripes near the bottom follow the 
bottom line of the dress (as did the hem 
and tuck), going in and out of the full- 
ness. They continue to do this, gradually 
changing until, at the waist, they follow 
the waist line. Be particular to make 
the stripes go in and out of the fullness, 
and where the fullness stops, go around the 
skirt in good even plaids. 
When placing the stripes around, do not 
allow them to touch XX on the top, thus 
leaving a high light on top of the fold, 
but underneath draw them close to XX, 
and under stripes being well in the shadow. 
On the edges of plaid pockets, cuffs, col- 
lars, belts, etc., you will also observe this 
high light, which means that the lines of 
the stripes are not drawn to the edge of the 
pockets, cuffs, ete. 
On the waist the stripes running around 
follow the waist line, waving slightly, 
if the waist is full. They change gradually 
at the bust until they follow the shoulder 
line. 
On the sleeve they follow its bottom line, 
changing a little as they approach the 
shoulder. 
On this foundation any kind of a plaid 
may be constructed. 
Study all the examples of plaids, and 
note the guide lines, all guide lines being 
placed in pencil only. 
In placing a texture all over a dress, it 
is well to obtain a foundation for the direc- 
tion of lines. A large plaid in pencil will 
serve this purpose. Keep all broken lines 
for the texture in the direction of this plaid. 
See Example No. 4. 
In Plaid No. 1 draw a simple plaid in 
pencil and the short diagonal lines only in 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  28 
ink. These. diagonal lines must be the 
same length, spaced evenly, and must 
take the same direction. In Plaid No. 2 
we have one heavy line to three fine 
ones. Place all heavy lines first, which 
form a plaid. Cut this plaid in the center 
by a fine line in both directions, then place 
the remaining fine lines on each side of 
the center fine line. Plaid No. 3 is very 
simple, but instead of being straight on 
the goods it is drawn diagonally. Plaids 
No. 5 and 6 are two more examples of 
simple plaids. Plaid No. 7 is more com- 
plicated. After drawing the guide lines 
in pencil, draw the short diagonal ink 
lines on these guide lines, the lines of the 
up and down stripes taking a different 
direction from the lines of the cross 
stripes. When this is finished, connect the 
stripes with longer diagonal lines, thus 
obtaining a wide stripe in both directions, 
which forms a plaid of three different tones 
of squares. 
No. 8 is an illustration of how to 
figure a skirt with roses. Place all roses, 
indicating them by rings, some being lost 
under XX, and some being cut off at the STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON VIII 
bottom or at the side. These may be 
placed by means of squares, or just scat- 
tered over the skirt. When the rings cover 
the skirt to the best advantage, draw the 
roses carefully. 
Study all plaids and stripes and use the 
same by placing them on simple dresses. 
Also try to create new ‘plaids. 
Plaids are very attractive, particularly 
black and white checks. See. the illus- 
tration of the check on the sleeve. When 
drawing the check, always connect the 
black squares from corner to corner like 
a checker board. If you attempt to skip 
about, you will surely come to grief, as one 
mistake will throw all of the checks out. 
Another way to plaid a skirt is to begin 
at the top and work downward. If this 
is done, the plaids will be cut off at the’ 
bottom. This may be more truly the 
way the cloth is cut but it is not as at- 
tractive. ‘ 
When placing a plaid or texture all over 
a dress, it is necessary to strengthen the 
outline of the drawing, as the lines drawn 
for an outline drawing will not show up 
against the texture.

LESSON IX 
SHIRRING, SCALLOPS, LACING, ETC. 
In drawing this figure the student must 
apply the principles of Lesson III (over- 
skirts) and Lesson VI (waist with yoke, 
short sleeve, and vest), but instead of the 
yoke and waist proper being sewed directly 
together, they are joined by a cord, the 
goods being shirred over it. 
You will find that the over-skirt is 
shirred over a cord in three places, the 
goods falling free from the lowest cord. 
The cords cling to the form, while the goods 
between them puffs slighily, extending 
past the normal form line. 
All lines for the shirring are drawn with 
quick snappy strokes. Some lines may 
connect the cords, but most of them reach 
only part way, the lines from above falling 
between the lines going up from below. 
The lines take somewhat the direction of 
the puff, but do not curve them too much. 
Note the guide lines for the cording, and 
the unevenness of the cord where the goods 
is shirred over it. 
If material is shirred without a cord, 
there will be but one line. 
You will notice that the bottom of the 
skirts -are designated by. guide lines, 
only, the width of the scallop. 
All scallops must be the same size, hang 
straight down, and go in and out of the full- 
ness. This effect may be helped by break- 
ing a scallop at XX. If you place the 
whole scallop on top of XX, draw but half 
30 a scallop underneath it, and vice versa. 
Draw the lacing as shown in the large 
example. Here, as on the dress, the open- 
ing is separated, as in this position the idea 
can be more readily explained than if 
the opening were pulled closely together. 
Draw all holes opposite each other, 
then the lacing. Start at the top and run 
the ribbon through as you would do if 
you were lacing your own dress. Notice 
how the ribbon comes out of one hole 
and goes under the edge of the opening . 
and under the next hole on the opposite 
side, comes out of that hole, etc. : 
The easiest way to obtain this effect is 
to draw all the lacing in one direction 
(the. ones on top), then the lacing in the 
opposite direction, which is underneath. 
Draw the guide lines for the cord, 
throwing one:end over the other. The 
ends hang straight down. Study the 
reverse curves which fit over these guide 
lines and form the cord. 
Study and draw the part of the full 
girdle with a frill at the opening, the 
smocking and the tassel. See how the 
lines for the tassel curve, showing that 
it has inside strands as well as the ones 
drawn. : 
As an application of this lesson, draw 
shirred dresses, and also place a scallop 
on the collar, cuffs, and skirt of a simple 
dress. Study different shapes of scallops.

  LESSON X 
BOWS, RIBBONS AND FLOWERS 
A bow must be smart looking and as if 
made of new ribbon, the loops and ends 
fitting well into the knot; that is, the knot 
must wrap around the loops and ends, pull- 
ing them in tightly. 
In Bow No. 1, notice how the knot 
curves around, as also do the wrinkles 
on the knot. The loops stand out, while 
the ends hang straight down. Note the 
XX lines on the ends. “You see inside of 
one of the loops, hence the over-skirt line 
(Lesson ITI, Fig G). 
Bow No. 2 is an example of a stiff- 
pointed bow for the waist, and as in Bow 
No. 1, the knot and wrinkles curve around 
the ends. 
Bow No. 8 is an, example of a four-in- 
hand, the knot and wrinkles curving around 
the ends, but the knot is a different shape, 
caused by the way the ribbon is tied. 
In Bow No. 4 we have the ends only; 
here we have not an outline alone to deal 
with, but an explanation of how to put the 
ink on for black ribbon. Most of this 
drawing is of ink with the paper left for 
the high lights, the heavy parts fitting in 
between other heavy parts. Outline all 
places to be made solid, then ink in with a 
small brush. See Lesson XIX. 
Bow No. 5 is a stiff hat bow and follows 
the principles of loops. Note the inside 
of the loop as in Bow No. 1. 
Bow No. 6 follows the principles of Bow 
No. 1, but being a neck bow with short 
ends, the ends take the direction of the 
loops. 
32 Bow No. 7 is a rosette with ends. 
Watch the direction of the lines to obtain 
this effect. 
At the bottom of the page is illustrated 
a broad ribbon run through holes. Note 
the guide lines at the top and bottom of the 
holes. All holes must. be the same size, 
evenly spaced, and not drawn too near the 
edge of banding. If the ribbon is wide, 
it will bulge at the top and bottom, causing 
the lines to take a rounding shape in-— 
stead of being straight like the openings. 
A ribbon the width of the holes will not 
wrinkle as this wide one does. 
If a ribbon is turned over, the width 
of the ribbon vanishes where it is turned. 
When drawing the patent leather belt, 
outline the place for the black after the 
belt is outlined, then ink in with a brush. 
A belt like this is hard and shiny, therefore 
it will have a few irregular high lights, 
also a line of light around the edge except 
on the dark side. 
Remember the instruction on the buckle 
given in Lesson V, but in outlining a 
buckle on a solid back ground, remember 
that the outline of the buckle where it 
touches the belt will be a part of the back 
ground when it is inked in, so gauge 
accordingly. 
Flowers are expressed with a few lines. 
Draw the full front flower, also the side 
view. Notice how the petals fit into each 
other.

LESSON XI 
TO MAKE A SKETCH 
To make a sketch directly from the dress 
seems a very difficult problem to the in- 
experienced art student; and it would be 
if an attempt were made to draw it as one 
would draw a flower or a vase. But if 
the student has thoroughly mastered all 
previous lessons and applies them as this 
lesson is studied, she will have no diffi- 
culty in sketching any costume in a short 
space of time. 
In sketching a dress directly from the 
model, proceed as follows: 
Let us imagine that we are viewing the 
dress itself which is on a dressmaker’s 
form: After drawing the form, look at 
the dress carefully, taking in everything 
regarding it. Ask yourself these ques- 
tions, and as you answer them, place the 
proportions on your form, using light lines. 
Question. Is the neck high or low? 
Answer. High in the back and low in 
the front. 
Question. What shape is the front open- 
ing? 
Answer. It is V-shaped. 
Question. How low does the, V open? 
Answer. Less than halfway down the 
front. 
Draw so applying principles of Lesson 
1, Bas: C. 
Question. What is the shape of the 
collar? 
Answer. It is a deep sailor collar which 
is sewed on the V neck more than halfway 
down. The collar goes toward the back 
and falls over the normal arm hole. (Les- 
son VI, Collar 4.) 
Question. Is the waist all in one piece? 
Answer.. No. It has an over-waist 
which fits up to the middle of the shoulders 
35 FROM A COSTUME 
(Lesson VI, Fig. R) and is gathered in 
with the under-waist at the belt where 
it blouses over the girdle. (Lesson II, 
Fig. C.) 
Question. What kind of a sleeve has it? 
Answer. A long kimona sleeve (Lesson 
VI, Fig. 2) fulled into a deep gauntlet. 
(Lesson VI, Fig. Q.) 
Question. Of what does the skirt con- 
sist? 
Answer. Three deep flounces, the lower 
two being sewed on the underskirt. 
The two lower flounces are the same 
depth while the top one is longer. The 
latter hangs down as low as the sleeve. 
Question. How wide is the lace inser- 
tion on the sleeve? 
Answer. About one-seventh of the 
depth of the gauntlet. 
Question. How wide is the lace inser- 
tion on the skirt? 
Answer. Twice the width of the in- 
sertion on the sleeves. 
Question. What kind of buttons has it? 
Answer. Three small buttons on each 
side of the over-waist which extend from 
the collar to the bottom of the V. 
Question. What kind of a girdle has it? 
Answer. A crushed girdle as wide as 
two-thirds of the width of the gauntlet. 
(Lesson VI, Fig. Q.) 
When you feel that all these propor- 
tions are placed on your form correctly, 
strengthen them with clean-cut, snappy 
strokes. Compare this plate with Lesson 
II. Note how much easier the bottom 
lines of the flounces are, how some folds 
turn one way, and some the other. Note 
carefully all XX lines and the lines for 
the fullness. You can make a sketch even

  looser than this by breaking some lines in 
the high lights. 
A guide line through the center of the 
insertion will be a help in placing a 
design. 
If it is necessary to record the names 
of the materials used, write them out 
opposite each material, connecting them 
to the material with horizontal lines. 
All dimensions for the back view must 
accord with the front. This front view 
being two and one-half times larger than 
the back, all dimensions on it must be 
two and one-half times larger. Refer to 
Lesson II, Figs. D and EL. If the exact design of the lace or em- 
broidery is required, make a careful sketch 
of it in the corner of your paper. 
It is well to try to remember costumes 
you see in the shops and on people. By 
looking at them closely and asking your- 
self questions you can remember enough 
to draw them afterwards. This is excel- 
lent practicé and will aid you greatly in 
obtaining ideas for original designing. 
Practice sketching from costumes, as the 
art of accurate sketching is worth money, 
and the more you sketch the quicker you 
will become and the more valuable to your 
_ employer.

LESSON XII 
FEATURES 
In studying the human figure, each part 
will be dealt with separately, then the 
figure as a whole will be considered. The 
dressing-up process will then be considered, 
which will be extremely interesting, as 
the principles learned in the first ten les- 
sons will apply. 
In these lessons on anatomy, no attempt 
is made to teach the muscles, bones, and 
planes of the body, as used by artists 
who paint the nude figure from life; 
but a complete understanding of these 
lessons will enable the student to render 
in pen and ink the human figure as needed 
in the fashion field. 
These plates are outline drawings, a 
good outline being a very essential point; 
and when one understands proportion, 
poise, and the outline, he has made great, 
progress. A few of the principal muscles 
and bones which come in contact with the 
outline are mentioned here, and the student 
should become very familiar with them. 
There are many books on anatomy, 
which may be taken from the public 
libraries, and when one understands the 
outline construction as given here, he may 
go into the subject as deeply as he wishes. 
Lesson XII deals with the features which 
are illustrated in the full, three-quarter, 
and profile views. After you understand 
the construction of the features, varia- 
tions of position will not seem difficult. 
THE EYE (FULL FRONT VIEW) 
Begin with the full front eye in the upper 
left-hand corner of the lesson plate. 
I N designates the inner part and is 
slightly lower than the outer part. Note 
the guide line which runs slightly up. The diagonal cross line indicates the widest 
part of the whole eye. 
On the upper lid there are five planes, 
but we will reduce them to three. Note 
the direction of the three planes marked 
above the eye and the two planes below it. 
As the upper lid projects over the lower, 
the eye-ball has a tendency to slant back- 
wards at the bottom, which effect is not 
very noticeable in the front view. 
The ball must fit well under the upper 
lid and not project. 
The deep lashes on the upper lid cause 
a shadow which hides the eye still more, 
giving it a soft expression. By continuing 
the ball through the upper lid one can prove 
if the ball is hidden enough. 
The lower lid is soft and delicate and is 
often omitted in fashions. In pen and 
ink drawings you will observe a few lashes 
suggested on the upper lid, if so, draw them 
on the corresponding sides of both eyes. 
Some artists indicate the lashes all around 
both lids. If done correctly, this is very 
effective. 
The eye-ball moves from’ side to side 
raising the lid as it goes. 
In the front view the ball is ie 
as is also the pupil, the ball occupying 
about one-third of the width of the eye. 
Note the little catch light on the ball, 
which curves around it and gives the eye 
light. 
Make the eye in good proportion, the 
whole length being twice the height. 
THE EYE (THREE-QUARTER VIEW) 
If the construction of the full view of 
the eye is understood, the three-quarter 
view will seem very simple. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 
IN is the inner part. The student will 
observe that this is the other eye. Note 
the slant up to the outer side, also the 
diagonal line through its widest part. 
In this view the eye is turned away from 
the observer, which causes it to be fore- 
shortened. He sees the under side of 
the lashes, which show mostly on the far 
side, hiding part of the upper lid on that 
side. 
In fashions it is customary to show 
lashes on the far side and the lid on the near 
side, one plane being hidden by the lashes. 
Note the three planes on the upper lid 
and the two on the lower, as in the full 
eye. 
If the eye is foreshortened, the ball and 
pupil must also be foreshortened, hence 
the ball is not a perfect round, but slightly 
oval. As the upper lid is over the lower, 
the slant of the ball backward is apparent. 
In the profile view it is still more so, as 
seen by the illustration. 
THE EYE (PROFILE VIEW) 
In the profile view we see but half the 
eye, the lashes being on the far side and the 
lid on the near. 
Be sure to draw the upper lid well over 
the lower, and make the ball an ellipse, 
slanting it backward. You will notice 
that the lid takes the shape of a reverse 
curve, which is illustrated with an exag- 
gerated line above the eye. 
In fashions the upper part of the upper 
lid is often omitted, being indicated at 
the corners only, 
THE LOOKING DOWN EYE (FULL FRONT 
VIEW) 
The full front, looking down eye slants 
slightly downward at the outside. It 
forms a reverse curve. See both eyes at 
the bottom of the lesson plate. A deep 
shadow is cast under the eye by the deep 
lashes, also by the eye being slightly open. STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  LESSON XII 
In the center the shadow is darkest. In 
the sleeping eye the lids are closed, hence 
the shadow is not as heavy. 
The height is about one-half the length, 
the height being mostly on the upper lid, 
which is fully exposed, while the lower lid 
is hidden. Notice the five planes on the 
upper lid; reduce them to three. 
THE LOOKING DOWN EYE (THREE-QUAR- 
TER VIEW) 
Follow all instructions for the full 
looking-down eye but foreshorten as in 
the three-quarter open eye, part of the 
reverse curve being lost. 
THE LOOKING DOWN EYE (PROFILE VIEW) 
In the looking-down profile view the 
reverse curve still remains, but as the lid 
is closed, it slants downward not upward, 
the deepest shadow being on the far side 
where the lashes show more prominently. 
The eyebrow is on the forehead bone, 
being thicker at the inside, from there it 
slants upward, fitting around the fore- 
head bone. It gradually grows thinner 
as it reaches its outer extremity. 
Place the eye a proper distance from the 
nose. Place the eye a little lower than 
where the nose begins. 
THE MOUTH (FULL FRONT VIEW) 
Viewing the mouth directly in front one 
will observe the same shape and distance 
on each side of the center line. 
Study one side carefully, beginning at 
the left, then reproduce the same effect 
on the other side. 
The upper lip has two planes, while the 
lower lip has three. See the lines of direc- 
tion of these planes marked above and 
below the mouth. 
In the center of the upper lip two V’s 
are formed, one at the top and the other at 
the bottom, the top V being deeper and
-P-A-G-E-51
LESSON XII FEATURES 41 
  more pronounced. They are both on the 
center line. Do not separate the points 
of the upper V too far. 
Where the lips meet, two very pretty 
reverse curves are formed. 
The outer extremities of the upper lip 
are much lower than at the center, but after 
drooping these extremities, bring the ends 
up again. This causes the mouth to go 
around the face and also to smile. The 
upper lip fits well over the lower, which is 
more apparent in the three-quarter view 
than in the full view. The whole mouth 
measures about two and one-half times its 
height, having a depression at each cor- 
ner, which causes a shadow. 
Draw this mouth many times; try to 
make it graceful with pretty curves, and 
not “ pointy.” 
THE OPEN MOUTH (FULL FRONT VIEW) 
In the open mouth the upper jaw remains 
stationary while the lower one drops. If 
only this is done there will be a vacant 
appearance to the whole countenance. In 
the open smiling mouth, the jaws may 
be together, but the lips are parted, and 
drawn sideways. This causes them to be 
slightly thinner, making the V’s spread. 
Follow all directions for the closed mouth 
but part the lips. Do not part too far. 
THE MOUTH (THREE-QUARTER VIEW) 
In the closed three-quarter mouth, the 
upper lip extends past the lower, conse- 
quently the center line of the upper lip 
extends past the center line of the lower 
lip. In the open three-quarter mouth the 
lower V on the upper lip is spread, and 
the far side of the lower part of the upper 
lip takes the opposite curve from the near 
side, thus making the mouth on that side 
go around the face. 
THE MOUTH (PROFILE VIEW) 
In this view we see exactly how far the 
upper lip projects over the lower, and how far the outer extremities are drooped. 
This is but one-half of the mouth, there- 
fore it shows but one side of the V’s, the 
reverse curve between the lips being very 
prominent. 
In connection with this mouth study 
the figure at the bottom of the page. Note 
the pretty curve between the nose and the 
upper lip, and how the line below the mouth 
slants back to the chin. 
Study all directions of the lower lip. 
In this view the thickness of the upper lip 
shows. 
THE NOSE (FRONT VIEW) 
A nose viewed directly in front does not 
show all its parts to advantage. Study 
the nose in connection with the looking 
down eyes at the bottom of the page and 
the three planes ofthe nose (below the 
open profile mouth). On the forehead 
between the brows is a diamond shape and 
from its lower part the nose begins. 
D stands for the diamond and B for the 
bridge, this being the bone of the nose. 
The whole nose spreads as it leaves this 
projection. The end of the nose is soft, 
as are also the wings, which are on each 
side of the end. 
In fashions the line for the bridge is often 
omitted. 
Under the nose there are three planes, 
the nostrils being under the wings or in 
the outer planes. 
The nostrils slant backward, being 
thinner in the front; note the lines of 
direction for all planes which are under the 
nose, the piece between the nostrils being 
on the lower plane. If this piece is 
drawn in the three-quarter view of the 
face, it helps to give the effect of the 
under plane of the nose. 
THE NOSE (THREE-QUARTER VIEW) 
In this view the bridge is prominent 
and the far side of the wing and nostril
-P-A-G-E-52
42 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XII 
  are lost, causing the far nostril to touch 
the under piece of the nose. 
In the three-quarter nose tipped side- 
wise, one can see more of these under 
planes. 
In Lesson XTV is given the construction 
lines for placing features. 
THE NOSE (PROFILE VIEW) 
In this view all parts are apparent. 
See the general line of direction for a young nose; an old person’s nose being inclined 
to point downward. 
THE EAR : 
In drawing fashion ladies, the ear is 
hidden -unless the hair is brushed back 
tightly. 
The ear slants backwards and is divided 
into three equal parts, the opening being 
in the center divisions. This is the full 
ear as seen on the profile face. 
Oa the full face less of the ear shows.

  LESSON XIII 
THE HEAD AND HAIR 
Lessons XIII and XIV should be studied 
together, as they bear upon the same 
By studying and ap- 
plying the principles of these lessons, the 
student will be able to use a picture as a 
model and from it construct an original 
head. 
You will find in fashion figures many 
types. of faces, some pretty and some 
freaky; many business houses preferring 
_ the first type while others prefer the second. 
After you have learned to draw a normal 
head with normal features, it is suggested 
that’ you try to create an original head, 
which might make a hit with the public; 
but in order to do this you must thoroughly 
understand the foundation principles of 
drawing for all heads. 
OVALS FOR HEADS 
Begin by drawing the ovals. Here we 
have. three ovals, full, three-quarter, and 
the profile views, on which may be con- 
structed the full, three-quarter and profile 
heads. 
Oval No. 1 is sketched in by beginning 
at the arrow and making a sweep around 
the oval, which is egg shape; that is, it is 
_ widest higher than the center or through 
the eyebrows. Continue this line around 
the oval and down one side of the neck. 
Do not make the space between the arrow 
and the neck line too wide. It is well to 
redraw this oval carefully before placing 
the features. . 
From the top of the head draw the center 
line down through the chin. As this is 
the full front view, this line will be in the 
middle of the drawing. 
45 Oval No. 2 is drawn the same way, but 
as the head is turned partly away from you 
it gives the three-quarter view. This oval 
is not tipped as No. 1 is. 
A head that is turned is moved from 
side to side in an upright position. When 
a head is tipped, the top of it is bent to 
the right, left, back or front. Hence the 
chin takes the opposite direction. 
The center line of oval No. 2 is in the 
middle of the face but not in the middle 
of the drawing. See how it curves around 
the oval. 
Oval No. 3 is quite different, the outline 
of the features giving it its shape. From 
the nose the slant is back to the forehead 
and down to the chin, which is also back. 
Do not slant too much. The oval is full 
at the back. Two lines are drawn for the 
neck, indicating that the head goes slightly 
forward from the shoulders. Note the 
cross line showing that the back of the 
neck begins on a line with the nose. 
In young people the eyes are in the 
middle of the head, so in fashions we want 
the faces to look fresh and new as well as 
the dresses. Place the eyes in the middle 
of the head and have them an eye apart. 
The eyebrows in a woman are higher than 
inaman. Place them high enough. 
The nose is halfway between the eye- 
brows and the chin and the mouth is one- 
third of the way down from the nose to the 
chin. Indicate these proportions by short 
lines as in oval No. 2. 
On these three ovals may be placed the 
three heads below; but before doing so 
take up Lesson XIV and understand the 
construction of a head in its various 
positions.

If the student understands the construc- 
tion of the features and the head as given 
in Lesson XIV, also the few points regard- 
ing the hair, he will be able to render these 
three heads with ease. Remember the 
hair must fit the head and be soft and 
wavy, the lines following the direction of 
the head and hair where rolled. 
THE FULL FRONT HEAD 
On the full front view of the ‘head the 
hair is parted at the side, drops on the fore- 
head, goes toward the back, fits around 
the head at the temples, and goes away 
from the face over the ears. The lines 
should be broken on the edges and fit 
between each other in a soft, curvy effect. 
Draw just a few lines at first, in the right 
direction. 
When dark hair is required, continue 
to fill in between these lines or make the 
lines heavier in the hollows of the hair and 
underneath the puffed out places. 
THE THREE-QUARTER HEAD 
In the three-quarter view, the hair is 
‘brushed directly back, fitting around the 
head toward the back at the temples and 
curling around the cheek bone. Do not 
show too much of the hair on the far side 
of the three-quarter face. 
THE PROFILE HEAD 
In the profile view, the hair, being parted 
at the side, follows the head in all direc- 
tions. 
When the hair is built up, that part will 
project past the normal head line, while 
the flat part will cling closely to it. Light 
hair has black lines indicating the direc- 
tion. Black hair has white lines, taking 
the same direction. STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  ° 
LESSON XIII 
In the lower profile the hair is arranged 
quite differently, consequently the lines 
will fall in a different direction; but observe 
that they fit the head. See Lesson XIX 
on Pen and Ink Lines. 
_Get the direction of all lines, first with 
pencil, then with a pen, then ink in with a 
brush, leaving the direction white (or the 
surface of the paper). As the hair is soft 
at the edge, do not continue the solid ink 
to the extreme’ limit, but draw fine lines 
which extend past the solid mass. 
Study the curl. See how the lines fit 
around to form the curl. ; 
On the dark side the lines are heavy and 
on the light side fine lines are drawn which 
fit between the dark ones. Note the hole 
formed at the bottom. Notice how the 
wrong side of the loose part is exposed to 
view and how the lines fit around this 
part more loosely. When drawing a black 
curl, obtain the general direction of the 
lines, then fill in until dark enough. 
TO PLACE THE HAT ON THE HEAD 
Never draw the hat and place the face 
under it. Always draw a full head and 
put the hat upon it. 
The hat should be placed on the head to 
give stylish effect. Tip it slightly to one 
side. If this is done, one of the eyebrows 
will be hidden. The crown must fit the 
head, and the far side of the brim must be 
continuous. 
After studying these two lessons, study 
pen-and-ink heads in the fashion papers. 
Be sure the heads are normal before 
_ attempting to draw them. Keep all rules 
in mind when copying them, and you will 
find you can create a type of face which is 
strictly original. 
After finishing a drawing of any kind, 
decide just what you have learned on that 
drawing. Be systematic in this and you 
will continue to improve.

LESSON XIV 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAD 
THE FULL FRONT HEAD 
Head No. 1 is a view directly in front, 
in a perfectly straight position. The 
placing of the features was given in Lesson 
XIII. The ears are between the eyebrows 
and the nose. 
After drawing the center lines and the 
cross guide lines at the correct distances, 
draw the features. Remember that there 
is the space of an eye between the eyes, 
and the space of half an eye between 
the eye and the edge of the face. Be care- 
ful to make the eyes mates and have them 
set the same under the lids. 
In the three-quarter view, the far eye 
might be a trifle smaller, but never larger. 
Try to keep them the same size. 
The clavicle (C), or collar bone, extends 
from the pit of the neck (PN), to where 
the arm joins the body. It slants slightly 
backward, which shows that the chest is 
well forward from the shoulders. The 
lines of the neck extend from the ears 
to the middle of these bones. 
The sterno mastoid muscle (M) runs 
from the ears to the pit of the neck. In 
the front view of the neck this muscle gives 
the neck a slight outward curve. In the 
front view the cheek bone is not as appar- 
ent as in the three-quarter view. 
The line of the outline of the face, from 
the ear, descends, slanting inward to the 
jaw bone, then in again quite prominently 
to the chin, which runs straight across. 
The head fits on the neck at the ears, but 
seen in this position it appears opposite 
the jaw bone. 
The trapezius muscle (TZ) is on the 
shoulders, fitting on the clavicle in front 
49 and extending down the back in the shape 
of a V. The general direction from the 
ear to the shoulder curves in, but remem- 
ber that TZ curves out, as do all the 
muscles of the body. 
Head No. 2 is tipped backward, also 
sideways, consequently one sees under the 
chin and loses the top of the head. The 
further back the head is thrown, the more 
pronounced this is. See Head No. 3. 
A head in this position causes the construc- 
tion lines to curve up. The more the head 
is thrown back, the more the lines curve 
and the closer together they appear. The 
neck appears longer as one views more of it. 
All features must follow these guide lines. 
In Head No. 3 one sees where the neck 
really joins the head. 
Note the triangle formed on all faces. 
This triangle takes in the front of the face, 
while the remaining portion is on the side. 
When the head is tipped down, all construc- 
tion lines curve down. The nose appears 
longer, the under plane and the chin are 
lost, and one can see more of the top of 
the head. The more the head is tipped 
down the more pronounced these effects 
are. The neck becomes short and the top 
of the head full (Head No. 4). As one 
looks down on this head the upper lip 
appears thinner and the eyebrows nearer 
the eyes. 
THE PROFILE HEAD 
Draw the correct oval for the profile 
head on which place Head No. 5. 
In Lesson XIII, you learned the outline 
of the features, also about the forehead 
bone, and the lines of the chin, The jaw
-P-A-G-E-60
  bone runs up to the ear, which is as far 
from the eye as from the mouth. The 
trapezius muscle is at the back of the neck, 
and, while the general direction of the 
back of the neck slopes in, you must 
have the feeling of a slight outward effect 
for this muscle. 
Note the diagonal lines from the front 
to the back of the neck, showing that the 
neck is higher in the back than in the 
front. Watch the front line of the neck 
where it joins the jaw, and the reverse 
curve which is more prominent in a man 
than a woman. A man’s neck is shorter 
than a woman’s, measuring from the nose 
to the chin the same as from chin to PN. 
Do not draw a woman’s neck too long. 
THE THREE-QUARTER HEAD 
In Head No. 6, which is the three-: 
quarter view, the cheek bone is very 
noticeable. Note the outline of the far 
side of the face. The forehead bone pro- 
jects, the outline going in slightly above 
it. The line from this bone descends, 
goes into the eye, out to the cheek bone, 
down to the jaw bone. Show definitely 
where the line leaves the cheek and runs 
into the chin, which is straight across, but 
not as wide as in the full front view. The 
jaw runs up to the ear, which is at the 
back of the head. 
Remember to place three-quarter fea- 
tures on a three-quarter face and have the 
center line in the middle of the face. er Natty ernmamar er (oem 
50 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XIV 
THE SEVEN-EIGHTHS HEAD 
In the seven-eighths view, Head No. 9, 
the far side of the face is lost still more as 
are also the features. This view comes 
between those shown by Heads No. 5 and 
No. 6, therefore the ear is nearer the back 
than in No. 5 and not as near as in No. 6. 
In this view the line of the chin from the 
mouth is quite noticeable. 
Draw the fashion Head No. 7, and note 
the three planes of the cap as they fit 
around the head. 
Head No. 8 is the profile view tipped 
away from you. Study and draw this, 
applying all points learned in this lesson. 
Always construct a head by drawing 
the oval and placing all guide lines before 
attempting to draw the features. Practice 
drawing heads from the fashion papers. 
Copy them understandingly, using the 
charts as guides. 
Make a collection of heads in different 
positions. 
The student is advised to use pen-and- 
ink drawings to draw from as the lines 
can be seen plainly, but all photographs 
and wash drawings should be saved. 
Select large pictures of heads and draw 
the construction lines through the proper 
places. 
Study the people on the cars, also the 
advertisements in the cars. Be on the 
lookout everywhere for some point. of 
information. 
See on how many pictures you can apply 
the knowledge gained from this lesson.

LESSON XV 
THE ARM AND HAND 
Arms and hands require a great deal of 
close study before they can be drawn 
satisfactorily. In this lesson are given 
the proportions, and direction of the prin- 
cipal lines of an arm and hand, breaks 
being left where the lines change their 
direction. 
Leave all breaks when drawing the 
figures from the chart. 
Place your own arm in front of a mirror 
in the positions given, and see if you can 
follow the points illustrated. A woman’s 
arm being more slender and delicate than 
a man’s, the muscles are not so clearly 
defined. When drawing arms in fashions, 
bear this in mind, but use the chart as a 
guide. 
No matter how slender or delicate an 
arm is, it must have the shape of an arm 
and not look like a post. Hands, in fash- 
ions, are not chubby, except on children, 
but are slender, the fingers being long and 
tapering. 
PROPORTIONS OF THE ARM AND HAND 
Begin with Fig. 1. The upper part of 
the arm equals the lower, and the arm 
tapers from the shoulder to the wrist, ex- 
cept below the elbow, which is the widest 
part of the whole arm, in this position. 
Ascertain the direction of the upper part 
of the arm, then of the lower, then of the 
hand. To have three directions for the 
arm and hand, makes a more graceful 
drawing. 
On the arm are many intricate muscles, 
a few only being mentioned here. 
The deltoid (D) is at the top on the out- 
side. The biceps (B) and triceps (T) 
53 are on the shaft, the biceps being on the 
front part and the triceps on the back. 
The supinator longus (SL) is very promi- 
nent, especially so when the arm is bent. 
Figs. 3 and 6. 
The lower projection of the deltoid 
is lower than where the inner part of 
the arm joins the body. Note the cross 
line on the lower part of the arm, 
which indicates that the inside bulge is 
higher than the outside. This is the end 
of the humerus, or upper bone of | the 
arm. 
Fig. 1 is the view of the arm ie This   
with the thumb on the outside. This 
shows the inner view of the hand. It is 
not a position used in fashions, but a good 
one to study from. 
The middle finger is the longest and the 
little one the shortest; the others being 
of nearly equal length. The middle |and 
next finger are inclined to fall together, 
as in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 the whole arm 
is turned over, the biceps being on | the 
inside and the triceps on the outside. 
The back of. the hand is seen, and the 
thumb, which is on the inside and turned 
under, is lost to view. 
Place your own hand and arm in the 
position of Fig. 1, then turn it over to the 
position of Fig. 2. Place your hand in 
the position of Fig. 1, and turn the lower 
part only to the position of Fig. 5. 
There is one bone, the humerus, in| the 
upper part of the arm, and two bones, the 
radius and the ulna in the lower. The 
radius rotates over the ulna causing the 
thumb to fall on the inside. More gen- 
erally the arm hangs down more in the 
position of Fig. 2, with the biceps on the    
-P-A-G-E-64
54 
inside. In this position the lower part 
may be turned still more. 
When the arm is bent as in Fig. 3, or 
raised as in Fig. 6, the line for the supi- 
nator longus, if continued, would run to 
the elbow. In Fig. 6 the humerus (H) 
and ulna (U) show at the elbow, the deltoid 
is raised and the trapezius shows back of 
the deltoid. Take up Fig. 7 which is 
the outside of the hand, learn its propor- 
tions, then refer to the inside, Fig.1. Kis 
opposite the knuckles, and is half way 
between the wrist and the ends of the 
fingers. 
In Fig. 1 the crease in the palm is under 
the knuckles and is in the middle of the 
hand. 
Each finger has two joints where it 
bends, one joint only being given except 
in Figs. 8 and 9, the hand in the latter being 
placed on the hip, a position much used 
in fashions. The fingers are shorter on the 
inside. They join the hand on a curve, 
but not at the knuckles. Fig. 10 is the 
first finger, it differs from the others in 
that the first joint is forward of the crease 
below it. The thumb joins the hand 
slightly back of the knuckles and reaches 
almost to the second joint. The bulging 
part of the palm shows between the thumb 
and the first finger. 
Note the direction of the lines of the 
thumb, the inner part being a reverse curve, STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  LESSON XV 
while the outer part curves in, then takes 
a square effect between the curve and the 
wrist. The fleshy part of the thumb forms 
part of the palm and is about half its 
width at the wrist. Double your hand and 
see for yourself what curve the thumb takes 
on the inside of the palm. 
Note how narrow the side view of the 
wrist is. Note the break where the hand 
joins the wrist, which is more apparent 
when the hand is turned over. When 
the fingers are doubled or bent, watch the , 
directions the lines take. 
Fig. 11 is the gloved hand, here shown 
resting on the chest. Draw the hand and 
arm, then place the glove lines, which 
extend slightly past the arm line. The 
stitching on the back gives the appearance 
of a glove, the center line being between the 
middle and the next finger. The double 
line at the side of the palm and the one at 
the side of the finger give the effect of a 
heavy glove. 
When drawing an arm under a sleeve, 
be sure to have the sleeve take the shape 
of the arm. 
Make a collection of figures (in under- 
clothes and in dresses) with the arms in 
different positions. Study these care- 
fully. 
Draw and re-draw tke arms on the lesson 
plate until you become perfectly familiar 
with them.’

LESSON XVI 
THE LEG AND SHOE 
THE PROFILE VIEW OF THE LEG 
The profile view of the leg forms a re- 
verse curve, the lower part being set well 
back of the upper. See Figs. 1 and 2. 
Fig. 1 is the main outline of the leg, being 
sketched in with broken lines, thus obtain- 
ing the general shape and proportion. 
Fig. 2 is the modeled leg placed on Fig. 1. 
In Figs. 1 and 2 note the vertical line 
drawn from the upper part to the toes. 
This shows how far back to place the lower 
portion. The general direction of the front 
of the upper portion is out, while the lower 
part is in, but on this in, you will see a 
slight out, which does not affect the gen- 
eral direction of the inward curve. The 
back part of the upper portion is in, but 
on this also you will see a slight out, which 
does not change the general direction. 
The lower portion in the back is a decided 
out, the calf being a very prominent fea- 
ture. The knee projects, yet the general 
direction of this projection slopes toward 
the back. 
Draw Fig. 1, then place Fig. 2 on it care- 
fully. Remember that the muscles of the 
body form very pretty reverse curves; you 
must have this feeling in mind in order to 
obtain the effect. Practice reverse curves 
with your pencil, going back and forth over 
thelines. Much practice of this kind will 
give grace to your work. 
THE FRONT VIEW OF THE LEG 
The general direction of this view of the 
leg is in, and yet at the knee and below 
it, the leg takes the outward direction. 
The foot also points out. All parts of 
the inner side are nearly on a line. 
57 The leg is composed of many intricate 
muscles, two of them only being mentioned 
here. 
The vastus internus (V1) is on the inside 
and is low, while the vastus externus (VE) 
is on the outside and is high. The knee 
fits between these muscles and the lower 
part of the leg. 
Study the lower part of the leg, notice 
how much higher the outside is than the 
inside. At the ankle this is reversed, the 
inside ankle being higher than the out- 
side. 
THE BACK VIEW OF THE LEG 
In the back view of the leg the lower part 
is back of the upper; see the vertical line. 
The foot is partly hidden and is fore- 
shortened. Get the direction of all lines 
of the foot as it is lost behind the leg. 
Draw Fig. 5 and place Fig. 6 on it. 
Draw Figs. 1, 3, and 5, noting the cross 
lines. 
Keep these drawings for reference. 
Make other drawings of these figures on 
which place Figs. 2, 4, and 6. 
SHOES 
In the five different positions of the shoe 
which are given here, the direction of lines 
is the essential point, so the lines are 
broken. 
When drawing from the chart leave all 
breaks, but when making a finished draw- 
ing connect the lines. 
THE FRONT VIEW OF THE SHOE 
On the front view of the shoe note the 
direction of the leg, then of the foot as it  
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING ' | ; 
LESSON XVI 
  comes toward you, the heel in this view 
being lost. The outer curve of the shoe 
is longer and more prominent than the 
inner. There are three planes on the shoe 
which show most distinctly where the vamp 
and tip are sewed. The inside ankle is 
very prominent while the outside one is 
lost. 
THE SIDE VIEW OF THE SHOE 
Note all breaks and curves on this shoe 
and make the heel fit well under the foot. 
The top line curves down and the heel is 
on a line with the sole. 
When drawing a slipper, make it look 
dainty and like a slipper, not like a rubber. 
THE BACK VIEW OF THE SHOE 
In the back view of the shoe the top line 
curves up, not down. The foot being 
turned away from you, it is foreshortened 
and the vamp does not appear as long as 
in the other views. Note the line of 
direction as, the foot recedes. The leg breaks into the instep, showing that it is 
nearer to you than the instep. 
Note the plane at the back of the shoe 
and the two planes on the heel. The heel 
does not appear as far under the foot as 
in the side view. 
THE THREE-QUARTER VIEW OF THE SHOE 
In the three-quarter view of the shoe 
the heel is almost lost. Get the three 
planes on the vamp and tip, also the center 
line. This shoe is not resting evenly on 
the ground, the toe only touching it. 
When the shoe is pointing slightly toward 
you, the inside of the heel is seen. 
When drawing a black shoe, mark with 
pencil the place to be inked in, leaving 
high lights for the shape of the shoe, at 
the edge (except on the dark side) and on 
the sole. 
Nore.—The next lesson advises the student to 
study books on anatcmy. There are many books on 
this subject and from each one the student will learn 
something. Do not confine yourself to one book. 
Study from these books just how the bones of the 
leg fit under the surface. It will be excellent practice.

LESSON XVII 
THE FRONT FIGURE (THREE-QUARTER VIEW) 
To draw a good fashion figure the body 
must first be placed under the clothes. 
The figure given in this lesson is not nude, 
but is ready for a corset, underclothes, 
bathing suit, dress, suit, or a coat (a coat, of 
course not clinging to the figure as closely 
as a dress). If the student will draw the 
complete figure carefully under every gar- 
ment, he will have no trouble when drawing 
a bathing figure, or one in underclothes 
—although busy artists merely sketch 
in the figure without finishing parts that 
do not show in the finished drawing. This 
is a saving of time for one who knows how. 
Remember the lesson on the three-quar- 
ter form, Lesson I. See how the dress form 
conforms to the shape of the human figure. 
Fashion figures vary as style changes, 
but the student will do well to make 
figures seven (7) to eight (8) heads high. 
The figure must be slim and graceful. The 
figure may measure the required number of 
heads, but is too stout it will not look 
right. 
Fig. 1 is the way to commence to draw. 
It is a rough outline of the proportion, 
action, and the placing of the figure on the 
paper. Later, when you know how, you 
may use curved lines if you prefer. 
Study the proportions given here and 
apply them to Fig. 1. After you have 
drawn Fig. 1, using broken lines, place 
Fig. 2 on it. Remember all instructions 
given on heads, arms and legs. If you are 
weak on these, review the previous lessons, 
as parts poorly drawn will make a poor 
whole. 
PROPORTIONS OF THE FIGURE 
The figure measures seven (7) to eight 
(8) heads high. 
  61 The neck is about one-third (4) the width 
of the shoulders. 
The waist measures less than the shoul- 
ders. 
The legs join the body at the center of 
the figure. 
The knees are less than half (4) way 
between this point and the feet. 
From the shoulder to under the arm is 
one-half (3) head or less. 
The waist is about one and three-quarter 
(13) heads down from the chin. 
The arms bend opposite the waist, 
reaching down to the center of the figure, 
while the hands extend below this point. 
The standing line (or line of support) is 
an imaginary line from the pit of the neck 
to the standing foot. This line must be 
parallel with the edge of the paper. 
The foot is about the length of the head. 
The hand is as long as from the chin 
to above the eyebrows. 
In this position the standing hip is 
high while the other one is low, both of the 
hips being above the middle of the figure. 
The relaxed leg may be placed any- 
where, but must extend from the hip and 
not from the knee, which would give it a 
knock-kneed appearance. See line of di- 
rection for the hips, also sketch of the nude 
hips. 
If the figure were balanced evenly (on 
both feet) the line of support would fall 
between the feet. See Lesson XVIII. 
The legs must join the body at the cen- 
ter and on the center line of the figure. 
In the three-quarter view one sees con- 
siderably more of one side than of the other. 
In fashions there are very few strictly 
full front faces, but many are almost 
full, being turned slightly.
-P-A-G-E-72
62 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XVII 
The head is often turned in the opposite 
direction to the body; this lends grace to 
the figure. 
When drawing hands, keep them the 
same size, also be careful to have the feet 
mates. 
TO DRAW THE FIGURE 
Place the figure nicely on the paper; 
commence at the top, and swing in the 
correct oval. When this is done, measure 
down seven or eight heads to the standing 
foot, making a mark where the foot comes. 
Remember the standing line must pass 
through the ball of the foot. This takes 
but little time and can be easily erased 
if the figure does not fill the given space 
nicely. 
If incorrect, begin again by redrawing 
the oval the proper size. Do not draw the 
features until the whole figure is swung 
in correctly. 
Mark off the waist line one and three- 
quarter heads down, draw the shoulders, 
the bust, the standing hip, and one long 
line down to the standing foot, which is 
on the action side. Keep in mind all 
proportions and swing in the figure, using 
these spacings as guides. 
Much study should be given to anatomy, 
so learn all you can of this interesting 
subject. 
Professionals begin to draw with heavy 
lines, but light lines are advised until the 
student is fairly sure of his proportions. 
PROPORTIONS OF CHILDREN 
As children are “little people,” no extra 
drawings are given, but the student must 
remember that their proportions are quite 
different from those of adults. So many 
scholars say, ‘Oh, I would just love to 
draw children, they are such cute little 
things.” That is so, but be sure that you 
make them cute, and not little old men and 
women. A boy has squarer features than a girl. Children’s proportions vary ac- 
cording to their ages. 
In fashions a tiny baby measures three 
(3) heads high; at four years, three and 
one-half (33) heads; from six to eight 
years, from five (5) to five and one-half 
(5 to 53) heads; from twelve to fourteen 
years, six to six and one-half (6 to 63) 
heads; at sixteen years from six and one- 
half to seven (63 to 7) heads. Their 
dresses, being short, help to denote their 
ages. 
At fourteen the child becomes a young 
miss, and takes somewhat the build of a 
woman without any apparent bust pro- 
jection. The dress is longer, and is still 
longer at sixteen years, but never as long 
as a woman’s. 
A child has a, round head instead of an 
egg-shaped one, the eyes being in the mid- 
dle of the head. A tiny baby’s eyes may 
‘be placed a little below the middle. 
Children have no busts, their eyes are 
large and wide-awake, with a peculiar 
turn to the upper lid. Their noses are 
short and small and their mouths small 
and chubby. Their cheeks stick out. 
Their hands and arms are chubby as are 
also their legs and feet. They wear 
square, flat shoes. 
When drawing children, give them plenty 
of action and make them interested in some 
toy, etc. 
Children are used for so many purposes 
besides fashions, that the student would 
do well to devote much time to them. In 
advertisements, cards, book-covers, etc., 
children play a great part. Lesson XXX 
deals with this class of work. 
By this time the student should know 
enough of the outline of the figure to be 
able to use books on anatomy to advantage. 
Inquire at the library for books on this 
subject. Make numerous drawings from 
these books, also make drawings of ladies 
and children in underclothes, from cata- 
logues.

LESSON XVIII 
TO PLACE A DRESS ON THE FIGURE 
ILLUSTRATING A COSTUME 
If the student is able to dress up the 
dummy form and understands the figure 
in the last lessons, he will have no difficulty 
in understanding this lesson. This figure 
is slightly different from the last one as 
it is walking. As the weight is divided 
equally between the feet, the line of sup- 
port falls between them. The figure may 
have the legs crossed in walking and the 
weight be solely on one foot. Be careful 
to poise the figure correctly. 
When drawing a figure with the legs 
crossed, do not draw the far foot straight 
across the paper; bring it slightly forward. 
Try to draw possible positions. 
No matter whether you are designing a 
costume or illustrating one, the knowledge 
required to place it on the figure is the 
same. 
So far nothing has been said about 
original designing. Lessons XXIX and 
XXX are devoted to this subject. 
An original drawing is one that has been 
made by using a picture as a guide and 
changing it enough to make it your own. 
On this figure may be placed any costume. 
An illustration, which is an original 
drawing, is placing a given costume, which 
has been designed by someone else, on a 
suitable figure which will show the costume 
to the best advantage. 
A house may have one designer who 
decides how the gowns are to be made, and 
many illustrators who put these designs 
on figures ready for reproduction. When 
illustrating a costume, you will have 
either the gown itself, or a sketch of it, 
to work from. In either case pick out 
64 a suitable figure, one that will show the 
costume to the best advantage. In the 
beginning you will find it hard to render 
the costumes from the costumes them- 
selves, but if you practice taking one 
figure and another dress from the fashion 
papers, putting them together under- 
standingly, you will easily see how all 
principles apply. Pick out the dress first, 
then a proper figure on which to place it. 
If an evening-dress, find another evening 
dress figure in the same position (as nearly 
as possible). 
For a suit, use a suit figure, etc. Use 
the lines of the suit on the figure, as they 
fit the figure, and place the given suit on 
these lines. 
In the dress illustrated the right-hand 
should not rest on the hip, which would 
cover the design, nor should the left hand 
be placed on the chest. 
If there is something particularly attrac- 
tive under the arm, put the arm up, etc. 
When illustrating a costume be careful to 
show both sleeves. 
Many figures are drawn in a normal 
standing position, such as some of the pat- 
tern houses use, while some houses require 
the ‘‘swingy”’ kind, like the illustrations 
in the newspapers or the catchy advertise- 
ments. Learn to draw the up and down 
figure, then try the swingy kind. 
The figure in the illustration is swung 
slightly. 
When the skirt is swung out as if the 
wind were blowing it, the center line and 
lines of fullness will also swing. 
See how much easier the lines of this 
dress are than the ones in Lesson II; 
still we have the XX lines, also the X’s
-P-A-G-E-75
LESSON XVIII 
and the O’s. When a leg is extended, 
there are two XX lines near it, but do not 
draw them continuous with the leg. 
Note how the XX lines fall both ways and 
how sometimes X and O run together. 
Now that you understand what the lines 
mean, you must study carefully the illus- 
trations in the fashion papers and copy 
the lines of artists. 
See Lesson XIX for pen lines and Lesson 
XXVI for textures. 
If the student practices this lesson 
faithfully, applying it on original work, 
he will be ready to draw figures on bristol 
board, ready for pen and ink. Copy the 
lines used by other artists, studying them 
carefully. 
If the student finds his work is untidy, 
he may transfer the drawing to a clean 
sheet of paper. This may be accom- 
plished by making an accurate tracing 
on transparent paper, with a hard pencil. 
Place this tracing over the clean sheet in 
the same position, fastening it on the board 
at the top, only. Take a smooth piece of 
paper about five inches by seven inches, 
and after rubbing it solidly with a soft 
pencil, place it face downward between the 
tracing and the fresh paper. Mark over 
the lines carefully with a hard pencil. 
The tracing paper may be lifted to examine 
the work without disturbing its position. 
Redraw carefully. 
Study illustrations of costumes and see 
how others treat their work. Consider- 
able dark in a picture looks attractive; 
bear this in mind when making a drawing, 
but when representing a costume, be accu- 
rate. If the costume is all light, place 
the dark somewhere else; on the hat, 
shoes, parasol, background, etc. When 
- these darks are attractively distributed 
over a drawing, it is called ‘‘ good spot- 
ting.” In a layout good spotting holds 
the drawing together. 
Place all darks so that the eye will be   
TO PLACE A DRESS ON THE FIGURE 65 
attracted equally to both sides of the 
picture. Keep the sizes and shapes con- 
sistent with each other. A large dark 
will balance several small ones. 
When illustrating a costume, pick out 
a figure which will show it to advantage; 
one that will tend to induce the cus- 
tomer to buy the costume. Three things 
must always be kept in mind: good style, 
good drawing, and good technique. 
Good style is important because if a 
costume appears expensive, other poor 
points may be forgiven. If you can make 
a twenty-dollar suit appear like a fifty- 
dollar one, your services will be in demand. 
You will find this easier to accomplish 
if you select a stylish figure for your 
model. 
Good drawing is necessary, for one can 
not draw a stylish figure if one does not 
know how to render the figure and the 
costume correctly. 
Good technique in expressing the mate- 
rials of the costume is necessary. If the 
costume is made of thin material the 
fact must be clearly brought out, and simi- 
larly if the material is heavy. 
Many costumes, whether light or dark, 
are illustrated in outline only. If it is 
desired to use shading or textures, much 
thought should be given. . Obtain a good 
outline, use the proper lines to denote 
the material, then fill in gradually with 
lines for shading which accord with the 
outline. Fill in gradually, keep the whole 
drawing going and do not concentrate 
on the shaded places. 
The lines for shading should follow the 
form and help to mold the figure which 
is underneath. Lines placed close to- 
gether form a shade. Keep places which 
come toward you light; for example, the 
bust, line of the leg, top of the arm, etc. 
There is usually a dark and a light side to 
every drawing, but do not make the figure 
so dark in one place that the general build 
of the whole will be lost. 
Make your people ‘ put on airs.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 
When illustrating a hat, decide on 
its most attractive side. Make the hat 
expensive looking, even if it is a very cheap 
one. Do not stint on ribbons and bows; 
make them full and attractive. ‘Hats 
should be shaded to bring out the charm— 
there must be a light and a dark side. 
Represent the material the hat is made of 
—whether straw, silk or velvet. Keep 
the technique of these, placing lines closer 
on the dark side but do not be mechanical. 
A “sketchy effect” for a hat is attract- 
ive. 
Shaded back-grounds, circles and other 
shapes, behind hats lend enchantment. 
    ' STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XVIII 
Illustration work cannot be mastered 
until the student is further advanced. 
This lesson may be referred to from time 
time as the student progresses. It is well 
in studying to adopt the practice of first 
building the outlines, then inking them 
in and erasing the pencil lines. The shad- 
ing lines may then be placed in pencil and 
inked in. 
Illustrations are often done in a sketchy 
manner, many lines being used. Well 
connected lines are advised until the stu- 
dent understands the meaning of all lines. 
Some houses like sketchy work, while 
others do not.

LESSON XIX 
PEN AND INK LINES. FRENCH WASH. BEN DAY MACHINE 
By this time the student must desire to 
ink in a drawing. Ink work is extremely 
interesting, but it requires much practice. 
You may be able to render a nice drawing 
in pencil and be afraid to touch your pen 
‘to it. Many feel this way, and many good 
drawings have been spoiled because the 
student did not practice the lines on a 
separate piece of paper. The very idea 
that you are afraid will cause your hand 
to be unsteady, and a very steady hand is 
required. 
The idea is not to draw just an ink line 
over the pencil line but to draw the right 
kind of a line. Lines should be thick or 
thin, straight or wavy, as the nature 
of the picture requires. In the first 
place a pen line should be made with one 
clean-cut stroke and not patched up. A 
line should be of even width, unless shad- 
ing is called for. 
A line should be professional, that is, it 
must be the right kind of a line in the right 
place, and the artist must know before- 
hand, just what he wishes to do. A long, 
continuous line may be joined, but when 
beginning again, place the pen point back 
of the end and do not press on the pen 
until the end of the line has been reached. 
In this lesson are given some of the lines 
used in fashions and the student must 
become very familiar with them. When 
one can draw these lines well on a separate 
paper, he is in condition to ink in his 
work. Fine lines should be used for faces, 
arms, hands, etc., and very fine lines for 
eyelashes. Several fine lines instead of 
one wider line give the eye a soft expres- 
sion. Study these lines in the fashion 
papers. 
69 Use a suitable pen for the work in 
hand. 
In the shadow, lines are often wider, 
as underneath parts that project; as 
belts, collars, cuffs, etc. The greater the 
projection, the wider the shadow. 
Ink lines should be rendered on hard 
finished paper, bristol board, plate finish 
being the best. Kid finished bristol is 
also used. This board will take a wash 
of water-color paint. As bristol board is ex- 
pensive for practice work, buy a good qual- 
ity of shelf paper. This will take the ink, 
and on this paper, the student must 
practice — practice — practice — PRAC- 
TICE. 
Cut out a sheet of bristcl board, a little 
larger than the chart, and with pencil 
copy all lines carefully. In this way you 
will become familiar with the lines. Refer 
to Lesson I on how to study with a sharp 
point. 
On your practice paper make two dots 
a distance apart, grip your penholder 
tightly, fairly near the point, and connect 
the dots, keeping the eye in advance of 
the pen-point. Do not forget this when 
drawing long lines. 
Draw slowly, keeping the wrist well 
pressed on the board. Draw horizontal, 
parallel lines, also vertical ones. Prac- 
tice all lines with pen only, using the knowl- 
edge gained by drawing them in pencil. 
Fill sheets with these lines until you feel 
perfectly free and have control over your 
pen. When crossing diagonal lines, allow 
the first set to dry before crossing them. 
Lastly, ink in your drawing of lines 
and if the result is satisfactory, you are 
ready to ink in a fashion figure.
-P-A-G-E-80
70 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XIX 
  THE USE OF LINES 
As said before, lines should not be 
crowded. If a shaded effect is required, 
parts of the lines may touch, but keep the 
lines well separated so that the parts not 
touching will not run together when re- 
produced. 
Study all lines in the fashion papers, cut 
out examples as you have done for other 
lessons. Different artists use different 
kinds of lines; become familiar with them 
all. 
Line 1 is used for trimmings, worsted, 
etc. Lines 2 and 4 are used for lace; 
lines 3 for feathers; lines 5 for designs and 
trimmings; lines 6 for fullness. Practice 
with bold strokes. Lines 7 are used for 
chiffon—keep the lines fine. Lines 8 and 9 
are used for silk—keep lines well spaced, 
fitting one cluster into another. Lines 10 
are used for hair; lines 11 for crepe; lines 
12 for woolen goods—this is done with the 
point of the pen; be careful not to make 
hooks at the ends of the dots. Thisis called 
stipple and may be scattered all over a 
garment which gives a light tone, or the 
dots may fall on top of one another, or 
be placed close together, which causes a 
dark shade. This is an easy way to shade 
a drawing. 
Spatter work is the spattering of ink all 
over the part to be covered. Put a little 
ink in a saucer, dip a tooth-brush in it, 
and while holding the bristles down, run a 
knife over them, of course, covering the 
part not to be spattered. Try this out on 
a separate piece of paper. 
A line may be very fine but must be 
black. See method of reproduction, Les- 
son XXVIII. 
FRENCH WASH 
French wash is an outline ink drawing, 
rendered on illustration board with flat 
washes of gray, lamp black water-color paint being used. The shadows may be 
strengthened by darker tones. This is 
difficult to do well, and much practice is 
required. Follow directions carefully. 
DIRECTIONS FOR FRENCH WASH 
Mix the tones of gray in different saucers, 
having more color than is needed to go 
over a given space. Try the color tones on 
a piece of paper, allowing them to dry, 
as when dry they will be lighter. If too 
dark, add water; if too light, add paint. 
Hold the drawing on a slant and, begin- 
ning at the top, apply a coat of clear water 
all over the parts to be painted. Allow 
this to dry. Pick up some paint, having 
the brush full of color, begin at the top, 
and gently carry the color across the paper, 
allowing it to run down as it is carried 
across. Never go back or allow the 
color to dry; keep the edge wet until the 
bottom is reached, then pick up the extra 
paint with the dry brush; wipe on a rag. 
A blotting paper is very handy if the color 
tries to run below the bottom line 
THE BEN DAY MACHINE 
Benjamin Day of New York, invented a 
machine for placing lines and dots over 
given surfaces. This machine will print, 
on the drawing, textures, such as diagonals, 
squares, dots, etc., wherever it touches 
the drawing, thus saving the artist the time 
required to draw them. They are more 
mechanical then pen lines and often 
much closer together. All the artist is 
obliged to do is to rub with a blue pencil 
or apply a coat of Cobalt blue water- 
color paint to the part of the drawing on 
which he wishes this machine applied. 
Blue will not show in the reproduction. 
Cut out illustrations of Ben Day and 
do not confuse it with French wash, 
stipple or spatter work.

  LESSON XX 
FEATHERS AND HATS 
In this lesson few lines are used, the 
object being to explain the general direc- 
tion the lines take. 
To draw a full feather, many more lines 
should be added. The student should 
make a careful study of all drawings of 
feathers, also of the feathers themselves. 
The mass of small feathers to make up the 
whole are confusing, but when one realizes 
that it is the direction that is important, 
a few lines of the right kind will give the 
desired effect. 
If the feather is’ soft like those of the 
ostrich (Feather No. 1), it must be drawn 
with curvy lines, the ends of the lines form- 
ing the edge of the feather. They curl 
under. The vein is often prominent. 
When drawing a black feather, obtain the 
direction as in the lesson plate, ink it, 
leaving the direction white. 
Draw the hat with the wings. Note 
how the feathers in the wings fit behind 
each other, some lines being drawn full 
length while others fall short. The hat 
shows a plane on the side, and one in front. 
When making a finished drawing, the 
planes are not apparent. See the lines 
of direction below the hat. 
This hat has a high crown. Mark the 
center, curve the lines to be inked around 
the center in the direction of the hat, leav- 
ing high lights where the hat turns the 
corner. 
Draw Feather No. 2. See how the vein 
is lost at the top where the feather turns 
over, and how the small feathers take 
sharp turns. Feather No. 3 is a paradise 
feather. Study the direction of the lines. 
Note how fine they are and how some are 
long, some short, the lines fitting between 
73 each other. At the bottom they fit more 
closely together and take a slight reverse 
curve. Feather No. 5 is a feather which 
turns over at the top. Note the line of 
light where the feather turns and 
the little feathers which show at the 
edges. 
Draw the ostrich feather, boa and tas- 
sels. 
Feather No. 6 separates at the top, 
being in two parts. At the bottom one 
side only of the second part is seen. 
Draw the pompon. The short lines 
curve around the edge and form the circle, 
only a few lines being drawn within its 
border on the dark side. The center, 
being left light, gives the ball shape. 
Study the straw hat with high crown, 
and turn-up brim. Note the three planes 
to fit the head. See how the straw fits 
around the high crown and brim and how 
the cross lines of the straw are indicated on 
the dark side. They take the direction 
of the curve of the hat. 
A flat, round crown forms an ellipse. 
When a hat is viewed from above, one 
sees much of the brim and crown. This 
hat is bound on the edge. Where the brim 
turns up, the width of the binding is lost. 
The band follows the crown. 
As said before in Lesson XIII, the hat 
must be so placed on the head as to give 
a stylish effect. Refer to this lesson when 
drawing hats. When drawing a hat, have 
some decided turns on it, not points 
exactly, but a change of direction which 
will keep the hat from looking like a tin 
pan. When drawing a black hat, be sure 
to have white lines separating its parts. 
A hat made solid black will look larger than 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
74 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING | LESSON XX 
  when outlined, as the line of the edge be- 
comes part of the hat. A hard, shiny sur- 
face, like beaver, will show a decided high 
light in a given place. This high light 
takes the shape of the hat. Study care- 
fully the way other artists treat hats and 
feathers. When placing a hat on another head, use one facing the same way. Usea 
profile hat for a profile head, etc. You 
can use any picture facing the other way 
by reversing it in a looking glass. 
If you succeeded with the lesson on pen 
and ink, to ink in these feathers will be very 
interesting.

LESSON XXI 
PARASOLS 
Parasols are very interesting and they 
are not hard to draw if one understands 
their formation. 
Begin with Fig. 1. Place the stick 
through the ellipse at a right angle to it. 
The stick must be in the middle and be 
continuous where it goes through the 
silk. 
If you show much of the outside, show 
but little of the inner part. The less you 
observe of the top @f the parasol, the more 
you see of the inside, Fig. 4, and the Jess 
of the short end of the stick. 
Draw layout, Fig. 1, and place Fig. 2 
on it. 
Draw layout, Fig. 1, and place Fig. 3 
on it. 
In Fig. 3 part of the ruffle on the far side 
is hidden. 
In the Japanese parasol, you view the 
inside. The stick must go through the 
middle and the ribs must curve to form 
the hollow of the parasol. They extend 
past the edge. This parasol does not take 
76 a perfect round, it being viewed on a slant. 
The stick must rest on the shoulder and 
fit in the hand. The stick may be ruled 
to obtain a straight line. 
Fig. 5 shows where the ribs join the 
center and the supports from the stick 
to the ribs. 
Fig. 7 is the outside only. Note the 
center and how the ribs curve, vanishing 
on the far side, and extending past the edge 
on the near side. Study the parasol care- 
fully, and notice how the curve of the 
far side is less than the curve of the near 
side. 
Draw the closed parasol. Make 
slim. See how the openings fall. 
Draw the layout, place the loops on it, 
then the ends of the ribs which form a circle 
around the stick. 
The upper part of the stick is usually 
less than the silk part. 
An open parasol resting on the ground 
is bound to show the inside. 
The average parasol has eight ribs. it

LESSON XXII 
FURS AND FANS 
The student must learn to dress his figure 
warmly for winter and to convey the effect 
of coolness, for summer; so we have two. 
extremes, furs and fans. 
There are many kinds of furs; a cata- 
logue on the subject will give the different 
kind of technique, or lines used to repre- 
sent the texture of the article. 
If the fur has long hairs, use long lines; 
if curly, use curly ones. The long or 
curly lines may be massed in places to form 
the shadows or indications of the fur. 
Fur should look full and the lines must 
follow the shape of the fur piece. 
Follow the lines for the neck piece, Fig. 1. 
The lines for the fur fall down towards 
the front, while on the shoulder they go 
toward the back. 
Draw the main shape of Figs. 1 and 2, 
then the lines for the fur, which form the 
edge. Make the fur look full, especially 
so at the tails, Fig. 2. 
Fur trimming which is joined in the mid- 
dle causes the fur to fall both up and down. 
Note the different direction of lines where 
the fur is joined. Make the fur full at 
the edges and where it wraps around 
XX, Fig. 3. . 
Short fur is drawn with short lines, 
Fig. 4, the thickness of the fur extending 
past XX. n 
Draw the round muff. See how the 
lines follow around the muff and give it 
shape. There is a plane at the end (which 
is flat) with a round hole in the middle, 
but the end takes the shape of an ellipse, 
as it is viewed in perspective. See Lesson 
XXVIiI on perspective. The hole is nearer 
the far side. : Watch the lines carefully as they go 
around the muff and around the hole. 
In the flat muff the lines follow the form. 
As the muff is flat, the lines are straighter 
and the plane at the end is narrow. Note 
the lines as they go around the muff and 
around the hole. 
For all fur obtain a good outline first 
on which place the correct lines. 
FANS 
All sticks for a fan must meet in one 
point, which is in the hand. 
Draw the end sticks making them meet, 
the top of the fan, the middle stick, and 
the one half-way between it and the end 
sticks. These divisions may be divided 
and sub-divided. Sticks are often drawn 
with a double line. 
A fan partly open will take the lines 
of the plaits on a skirt. In this position 
the middle sticks are hidden where they 
join the center. ‘ 
On these foundations any kind of a fai 
may be created. If the shape at the top is 
different from this set curve, draw it so, 
but remember the principles stated. 
Feather fans are very popular in fashions. 
The student should make a large collec- 
tion of pictures of furs during the winter, 
as he may wish to use them in summer 
for the following season. 
Try placing a fur texture all over a coat. 
For this a good copy is needed. 
Remember black fur will have white 
lines. A white fur against a black back- 
ground is very effective.

LESSON XXIII 
THE BACK FIGURE 
If the student has been successful with 
the front figure and remembers its pro- 
portions and how to start the drawing, he 
will be somewhat at home when studying 
this lesson. As in Lesson XVII, the 
figure is not nude but ready for a garment, 
as are also the figures in Lesson XXIV 
and Lesson XXV. 
Draw Fig. 1 and place Fig. 2 on it. 
This is a three-quarter back view, the 
figure measuring seven and three-quarter 
heads high. 
In the back figure, the legs join the body 
below the middle and the waist-line 
curves up, not down. The head isa three- 
quarter back view, although a profile or 
seven-eighths front head may be placed 
on this body. Do not turn the head too 
far around to the front. Try turning 
your own head toward your back, and do 
not make the mistake of putting an almost 
full face on a back figure. 
Note the hair lines, which are brushed 
up to the top of the head. The ends of 
these lines in the back form a curved up 
line like the back collar line. 
Tn this view of the head, the ear is nearer 
the front, and the line for the neck 
breaks into the face, as it is on this side 
of it. 
The trapezius muscle breaks into the 
neck, showing that the face and throat 
are forward, the throat being lost some- 
what. 
The far shoulder is longer and is more 
sloping than the near one. The center line of the body takes two 
reverse curves; beginning at the neck it 
curves in, then out for the shoulders, in 
again for the waist, out again over the 
hips and buttock, in again to where the 
legs join the body. 
Study the little sketch of the nude back 
and of the trapezius muscle as it fits on 
the back of the head. 
Do not curve the center line too much for 
the fashion figure. See how the bust goes 
around to the front as also do the arms. 
Use previous instructions when drawing 
the legs and feet. 
When placing a dress on this figure, 
have the lines of the dress conform to the 
action of the figure as in Lesson XVIII. 
When the arm is bent and extended for- 
ward, the break of the sleeve at the supina- 
tor longus takes the opposite direction from 
the front view, showing that the upper part 
of the arm is on this side of the lower. 
The lower portion of the arm is foreshort- 
ened. 
When illustrating the back of a costume, 
use a back figure going the same way as 
the costume sketch to be illustrated. See 
Lesson II on the back form. : 
Draw back figures in corsets and in 
underclothes. These are harder to find 
than front figures. Keep everything that 
will help you, even upper and lower parts 
of figures. 
Compare several back figures. See if 
you can combine them in one drawing. 
Always use figures facing the same way.

LESSON XXIV 
THE SIDE FIGURE 
The side figure is not as frequent in 
fashions as the front view, as it does not 
show a costume in all its parts. However, 
it is graceful and artistic, and the student 
should be as familiar with it as with the 
front view. 
This figure measures seven and three- 
quarter heads high. 
The side view is inclined to look some- 
what taller than it is, the side of the body 
being narrower than the front. 
If the student can draw a graceful figure 
in all positions, he can use the knowledge 
gained in decorative work, such as cards, 
book covers and advertisements. See Les- 
son XXX. 
Keep in mind all points regarding the 
profile leg. As the inner view of the pro- 
file leg is slightly different from the cuter, 
sketches are given here of the straight 
and bent knee. 
As this figure is ready for a corset, note 
the long straight line in front, and the long 
curved line in the back, which does not 
show where the legs join the body. See 
the separate sketch of this. 
82 Be sure to show the plane on the shoulder, 
which is distinct from the arm. 
See the clavicle in the first drawing, 
which extends from the pit of the neck to 
where the arm begins. 
When the arm is extended forward, note 
the square effect on the back, caused by 
the shoulder blades. This is also notice- 
able when the arm hangs straight 
down. 
The body may bend at the waist for- 
ward and side-ways, but in fashions, we 
keep the figure erect, with the head on an 
upward turn, unless the figure is interested 
in some object and is inclined to bend 
the head downward. In this case the 
eyes must be lowered as well. 
Refer to Lesson XVII for proportions 
of the figure. 
If the features of a figure are not clearly 
defined, use other features, but be sure 
they belong to a head in the same position. 
It is better to find a satisfactory figure 
from which to draw, but the student may 
combine parts of different figures if he 
understands their construction.

  LESSON XXV 
THE SITTING FIGURE 
As the figure in this lesson is sitting, 
the horizontal part, which is resting on the 
bench, is lost in the height of the 
figure. 
The legs join the body in the middle of 
the figure, but not in the middle of the 
drawing. 
Let us divide the drawing into three 
equal parts. From the head to below the 
bust is one, to where the body bends is 
two, to the bottom of the foot is three. 
Remember the figure bends where it 
sits.and again at the knees, the leg flat- 
tening out slightly where it rests on the 
bench. 
Do not draw the near side of the bench 
close to the under side of the knees. 
Try sitting on a chair, observing how 
your kriees extend past the edge. It is 
possible to sit far back, but one seldom 
does. 
Study the sketch of the outside bent 
knee, the inside one being illustrated in 
the last lesson. 
Draw the far leg through the near one as 
indicated by the dotted lines. 
A figure may sit or recline quite differ- 
ently from this, so draw sitting figures in all positions. A sitting figure may be 
bent more than a standing one. 
Draw the sitting figure in underclothes 
and in dresses. Study the lines of the 
dress, how they fit around the figure, fall 
from the edge of the bench and from the 
knees. Study the lines of the main 
wrinkles. Study the wrinkles in the bent 
arm which are mostly on the inside. On 
the extended arm they pull as the arm is 
thrust out. 
An arm will show the inside of the sleeve 
at the wrist, unless the arm is turned 
back, as the arm placed behind this figure. 
Bear this in mind when placing cuffs on 
sleeves. 
The far armhole forms a reverse curve, 
the lines for the bust extending to the 
center of it. 
As under the arm is on a different plane 
from the front of the body it is often 
shaded. ; 
It is suggested that when a wide line 
is placed around a careful drawing, all of 
the heavy line be allowed to be on the out- 
side of the pencil line. If brought within 
its border, the shape will be destroyed. 
Note for example, a carefully drawn arm.

LESSON 
TEXTURES AND 
The representation of textures comes 
under the general classification of detail 
work. It requires great accuracy to be 
a detail artist. Many artists devote their 
whole time to this type of work. 
To draw the human figure correctly, 
and to be able to group figures, should be 
the aim of all students of fashion drawing; 
but they should be competent to do detail 
work as well. When filling an order in 
all its parts, the artist needs to be familiar 
with textures. He must be able to make 
the drawing for a silk dress convey the 
impression of silk, ete. 
The student of this lesson needs first 
to be able to render good ink lines. Then 
study textures carefully from catalogues, 
and from the goods themselves. Consult 
the lists of materials given at the end of 
the lesson. If you are not conversant 
with them all, examine them in the stores 
or obtain samples. 
To form a texture, the lines of the draw- 
ing must take the form of the weave, 
and the whole mass of lines must follow 
the form on which the texture is placed. 
Review Lesson VIII, as you must have a 
good foundation on which to place the 
lines. For example, when drawing a 
basket, the lines take the shape of the 
straw, and also of the basket, the imagina- 
tion does the rest. The same kind of lines 
might be used for a worsted sweater, and 
if placed on a nicely drawn sweater, we 
recognize the material. 
Be careful of the outline and have a good 
foundation of stripes or plaids on which to 
place the texture, unless the texture has no 
noticeable direction of line. 
Study the eight examples given of flat 
87 XXVI 
DETAIL WORK 
pieces of materials. Fig. 1 is chinchilla, 
2 and 3 are crochet or knitted worsted, 
4 is corduroy; a flat piece would not be 
shaded but on the figure the shading helps 
the form, Fig. 5 is outing flannel or cotton 
goods, 6 is rough cloth; if very rough, 
allow the rough edges to form the edge of 
the garment. Fig. 7 is moire silk, 8 is 
dimity or swiss; use fine lines for thin 
goods, very fine lines for chiffon. Fig. 9 
is lace, 10 is embroidery; work out the 
pattern carefully, placing a shadow under 
each design. 
Criss-cross the mesh in-either squares or 
diamonds. Do not make the mesh round. 
Much detail work is worked out in white 
water-color paint, used thick from a jar. 
This is applied with a fine sable hair 
brush. All wash drawings have the lace 
and embroidery worked out this way, 
a flat tone of gray paint being first applied 
as a background for the lace. Always 
allow this to dry before applying the 
white paint. 
Fig. 11 represents black silk. Draw 
the outline of all parts to be inked in, 
leaving high lights on top of XX. The 
solid ink parts fit into each other in a sori 
of lighting effect. 
Fig. 14 is part of a light silk skirt, 
Fig. 13 is dark silk; another kind of stroke 
which gives a very pretty silk effect. 
Fig. 12 is a loose sketchy way of placing 
net all cver a skirt, the lines of the net being 
more apparent in the shadows. For white 
lace, rendered in white paint, this order 
is reversed. For catalogues this would 
not be accurate enough, as the customer 
has only the picture to order from. 
Study carefully the pen lines of artists,

and try to reproduce the same kind of 
lines. If you do not succeed in this, take a 
sheet of tracing paper and trace their lines 
with pen and ink. Make a line clean cut 
as instructed in Lesson XIX.

LESSON XXVII 
PERSPECTIVE 
It is very important for the student to 
understand something about perspective 
in order to be able to place chairs, tables, 
etc., in his drawings; rugs and squares on 
floors must be drawn according to rule. 
A few simple rules are here given to aid 
the student in the perspective needed in 
fashion drawing. Study these rules care- 
fully and apply them when copying 
pictures. 
When copying the chart, draw in large 
enough scale to enable you to work well; 
these illustrations are very small. Be 
very accurate as every fraction of an inch 
will tell. Use a ruler on all straight lines 
and a compass for circles. 
There are two kinds of perspective, 
parallel (or one point) perspective, and 
angular (or two point) perspective. 
The horizon (H) is an imaginary horizon- 
tal line, where earth and sky seem to 
meet; it is high or low according to the 
elevation of the observer. 
Example. A person on a mountain can view more of 
the surrounding country than if he were on the level, 
hence the horizor will be high as it is directly on a line 
with his eyes. 
Place your pencil across your eyes, if 
you can see just over the top you have 
the horizon line. 3 
The point of sight (PS) is an imaginary 
point on the horizon directly in front of 
the eyes. The direction of vision is‘an 
imaginary line from the eye to the point of 
sight. 
The picture plane is a vertical plane on 
which the picture is drawn. 
The ground plane is the plane on which 
the observer stands. 
The place he stands (8) is called the 
91 station point, Fig. 3. This is the eye of 
the observer. 
The picture plane is perpendicular to 
the ground plane. 
Example. Place a large plane of glass perpendicular 
to the ground. Place a cube on the other side a little 
way back. Keep the eye steady and trace on the glass 
the outline of the cube. If this is done accurately, 
you will have a picture of the cube in perspective. 
Close one eye while doing this. 
All parallel lines which run directly 
away from the observer are called conver- 
ging lines. Converging lines which are 
perpendicular to the picture plane vanish 
in the point of sight. (Fig. 1) and (Fig. 5 
3 ft.) 
Converging lines which are not per- 
pendicular to the picture plane but run 
obliquely away from the observer, vanish 
in a point on the horizon, but not in the 
point of sight. (Fig. 5 (2 ft.)) 
The prime vertical (PV) is a vertical 
line drawn perpendicular to the horizon. 
It passes through the point of sight and 
through the station point. (Fig. 3.) 
Study Fig. 3. H is the horizon, PS is 
the point of sight, S is the station point. 
Place the station point at a distance of 
13 the diagonal of the picture plane. 
PV is the prime vertical, abcd is the pic- 
ture plane. 
D and D’ are distance points, or as far 
as the observer can see on each side of the 
point of sight. From PS to D equals 
from PS to S. D? is one-half this dis- 
tance; its use will be explained later. 
Study Fig. 5. Find H and PS. 
When wishing to represent objects by 
measurement, a measuring scale can be 
used in the foreground. This measuring
-P-A-G-E-102
92 
scale should be the actual measurement in 
feet and inches. As objects recede, they 
appear smaller, just how much smaller can 
be determined by using this scale. 
In Fig. 5 let us call the spaces in the 
foreground feet. If a six-foot post were 
placed close to the (glass) picture plane 
(on the other side), it would appear six 
feet, or life size; if placed farther back it 
would look smaller. See the posts. 
To place a six-foot post a distance back, 
count off three feet on the scale, connect 
the ends with PS. Any horizontal line 
(parallel to the picture plane) between these 
lines will equal three feet. The farther 
back the shorter three feet will appear. 
Take the three feet in the distance, 
double it and stand it up on the three- 
foot line. This makes six feet in the dis- 
tance; or take the six-foot measure on 
the scale, find six feet on the ground in the 
distance, then stand it up. 
PARALLEL PERSPECTIVE 
An object is in parallel perspective when 
one of its sides is parallel with the picture 
plane, Fig. 1. 
Draw the picture plane, the horizon, 
the point of sight. Draw the fronts of 
the blocks, then the converging lines, then 
the backs of the blocks. Place the rug 
on the floor, using the same rule. 
The block at the left of the point of 
sight exposes its right side. The block 
at the right exposes its left side. The block 
in the center has both sides hidden. 
Remember a block, chair, table or any 
object lower than the level of the eye will 
show the top, so all converging lines wil] 
run up to the point of sight. 
Objects higher than the level of the eye 
will extend higher than the horizon, and 
all converging lines above the eye will run 
down to the point of sight. (Fig. 6.) The 
relation of the object to the horizon deter- 
mines the size of the object. When draw- STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING 
  LESSON XXVII 
ing children, make a high horizon, this will 
make them look small. 
If an entire object is above the level of 
the eye, you see its under part. A plane 
on a level with the eye has the appear- 
ance of aline. If below the eye, it exposes 
its upper part. If above tke eye, it 
exposes the under part. The higher or 
lower a plane is placed, the more one 
can see of its under or upper surface. A 
plane at a distance loses in depth. 
Fig. 2 is a-room in parallel perspective. 
find H, PS, and the converging lines. 
Study the lines of the bureau which is 
built in the form of a block. The top of 
the bureau is below the eye and the top of 
the back above the eye. 
Build all furniture away trom the wall 
from the floor up. Note the lines for the 
beginning of a table. The floor lines con- 
verge (up) to PS. The ceiling lines con- 
verge (down) to PS. When drawing 
bureaus, chairs, etc., the student is inclined 
to show too much of the top planes. 
Fig. 4 shows how to obtain the correct 
measurement. 
First study Fig. 3. Draw picture plane, 
horizon, point of sight, prime vertical, 
station points and distance points. As the 
paper is rarely large enough to draw DSD’, 
we use one-half the distance (D’) and 
one-half the measurements on the measur- 
ing scale. 
We are to decide how much to show of 
the seat of the chair, Fig. 4. A is the 
length of a horizontal line in perspective; 
to obtain the same length on the converging 
line draw the broken line (auxiliary line) 
from the end of A equal to one-half the 
measurement of A. Draw a dotted line 
from the end of the auxiliary to D’; 
this will cut the converging line the cor- 
rect length or so that a=A. Use whole 
measurement and dotted line to D or 
half measurement and dotted line to 
D2. ; 
To cut the converging line coming for- 
ward from A, connect the end of the
-P-A-G-E-103
  LESSON XXVII 
auxiliary with the opposite D2. This 
makes A=a=aa, Fig. 4. 
Lines drawn from both ends of the 
auxiliary to the picture plane will give one- 
half measurement of A, or on the measur- 
ing scale, the actual size in feet or inches. 
This rule will be very helpful when 
drawing windows and doors which open 
toward you. 
One picture I saw will explain the use- 
fulness of this rule. The window was 
divided into two parts, being on hinges. 
These opened toward me, the mistake 
being that one part was large enough 
to cover the whole window when 
closed. 
Use this rule to ascertain the length of 
the converging lines of the chair, Fig. 4, 
and the table and bureau, Fig. 2. 
To obtain the depth of the window, drop 
lines to the floor converging line. 
Place the rungs of the chair according 
to rule. 
The back of the chair slants back 
slightly. Parallel oblique lines in the air 
converge to the same point on the prime 
vertical. In this case they meet below 
the horizon. If the slant were in the 
opposite direction, they would meet above 
the horizon. Obtain the slant of one side 
of the back, then draw the other side to the 
same point. 
Study Figs. 6 and 7, which show how 
a circle or an oval can be drawn in 
perspective. Draw a circle in full view, 
enclose with a square, cross the square 
from corner to corner up and down and 
across through the center,.and again up 
and down and across where the circle 
meets the cross lines. Continue these 
cross lines to PS. Place the circle at the 
junction of these lines on the converging 
square, Fig. 7; this will give you a vertical 
ellipse (or a circle in perspective). 
A horizontal circle in perspective may be 
obtained by filling the top converging 
plane with the seme kind of lines. This 
rule will help you when drawing oval PERSPECTIVE 
  93 
mirrors, children’s hooples, curves on 
furniture, etc. 
Draw an oval mirror on the bureau in 
Fig. 2. Draw a basket in Fig. 8. 
ANGULAR PERSPECTIVE 
An object is an angular perspective 
when neither side is parallel with the 
picture plane. In Fig. 9 we have a box 
in angular perspective. 
Draw picture plane, horizon, point of 
sight, prime vertical and station point, 
also distance points the same as you did 
in parallel perspective. The measuring 
scale in the foreground may also be used 
but instead of using D and D’ use M 
and M’, 
You will note that this station is not 
13 the diagonal of the picture plane. 
Remember, when neither side of the 
object is parallel to the picture plane, both 
sides are on the slant. 
To draw the cube, draw the height, and 
one vanishing line to the horizon; where 
it touches the horizon we call V or vanish- 
ing point. You may place this line on any 
slant. When drawing from a real cube, 
hold your pencil along the line and get 
the direction this way. Remember, if the 
near edge of the cube is on the prime 
vertical at an angle of 45°, you see as 
much of one side of the cube as you do of 
the other. Both sides will vanish at 
equal angles .and the vanishing points 
will fall on D and D’, but the minute 
you move the cube at another angle or 
change its position to the right or left, 
the vanishing points will change. So in a 
room, different objects have different 
vanishing points while objects in parallel 
perspective all vanish in the point of sight. 
This cube is to the right PS. You see 
more of the one side than you do of the 
other, the vanishing line will fall elsewhere 
on the horizon. The greater the slant of 
one side the more gentle the slant of the 
other, the vanishing point on the side with
-P-A-G-E-104
  
94 STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING _ LESSON XXVIL 
  the greater slant will be nearer PS than 
the other vanishing point. 
‘You know the angle of the object is really 
a right angle, so after finding one vanish- 
ing point V, draw the line from V to § 
(or station point), and at the station con- 
struct a right angle. Continue this line 
to the horizon, which will give V’ or the 
other vanishing point. 
You know that parallel oblique lines 
vanish in the same point, so the parallel 
sides of the cube vanish in the same points. 
How much of the side is seen we deter- 
mine by M and M’ instead of D and D’. 
Using a compass and with V as a center 
and VS as aradius, mark off the horizon M. 
With V’ as a center and V’S as a radius, 
mark off the horizon M’. These points 
are used as D and D’ in parallel perspec- 
tive. 
Draw the auxiliary lines the same length 
as the height of the cube, then the dotted 
line to M and M’. The parallel sides of 
the cube vanish to the same points. Carry 
measuring lines forward to obtain the size 
on the scale. 
Fig. 10 is an angular view of ‘&' room; 
it is like the inside of a large box. 
Draw the picture plane, horizon, point of sight, prime vertical, station point, 
distance points and measuring points 
as in Fig. 9. The lines of the ceiling 
come down to V and V’. One vanishing 
point is not on the paper, so slip another 
paper under your drawing, extend the 
horizon and continue the converging lines 
to the vanishing point. 
The lines of the door follow the wall. 
The lines of the seat follow the other wall, 
and therefore the vanishing points for 
walls, door and seat are the same. 
A room in parallel perspective may con- 
tain objects which are in parallel perspec- 
tive and objects which are in angular 
perspective. If several objects in a room 
are at different angles, each one has its 
own vanishing and measuring points, while 
the converging lines of the parallel objects 
vanish in the point of sight, the same as 
the lines of the room. - A room in angular 
perspective may contain objects at the 
same angle and objects at different angles 
and objects in parallel perspective. 
Cut out a picture of a room with furni- 
ture in angular and parallel perspective, 
paste the cut-out on paper, and extend 
two converging lines; where they meet 
will be the horizon.

LESSON XXVIII 
LAYOUTS FOR NEWSPAPERS AND CATALOGUES 
By this time the student should have 
learned to draw the fashion figure in the 
front, back, side and sitting positions. 
He should have learned to sketch a gar- 
ment from the model, and to place it on 
the figure. He should have learned also 
how to ink a drawing using the proper tech- 
nique. To draw four or five figures may 
seem an undertaking and if one feels that 
he is slow in drawing one figure, he should 
keep on practicing until he can place one 
figure in, fairly quickly, that is getting the 
action and proportion without much dif- 
ficulty. 
A layout artist is one who draws the 
figures and their costumes, in a given 
space. Where many different articles of 
clothing, as hats, waists, corsets, dresses, 
etc., must be advertised, many business 
houses employ a staff of artists on the 
work, each artist doing the class of work 
that he is most proficient in. In such 
cases one drawing may pass through 
many hands before it reaches completion. 
The layout artist begins the drawing, 
another artist inks or paints the costumes, 
another the heads, and another the detail 
work, etc. Wash drawings in black and 
white and in water color are done in these 
houses, and while this book does not take 
up wash work, the student of this book 
might become one of the artists to make the 
layouts for these wash drawings. 
Taking it for granted that the student 
is to fill an order in all its parts, beans in 
mind the rule for enlargement. 
The size of the plate is very ener 
it being the size of the picture when 
finished. 
It should be interesting as well as help- 
97 ful for the student to go through an 
engraving plant. As this may be impos- 
sible, a brief account of the photo-engraving 
process, by which line pictures are re- 
produced, is here given. 
The drawing is first photographed, 
usually to a reduced scale, and brought 
down to a size much smaller than the 
original. In this case all lines and dots 
will be reduced in size, and also the spaces 
between them. The photographic film 
is then toughened by a solution, stripped 
from the glass, turned, and placed over 
another sheet of glass with the positive 
side up. The glass plate carrying the 
turned negative is placed in a frame over 
a sensitized zine plate and placed in the 
sun or under a powerful electric light. 
As the photograph is a negative, the lines 
of the drawing are transparent and the 
light shines through on the zinc plate, 
hardening it under the lines only. The 
part protected by the black portion of 
the film remains in its natural condi- 
tion. 
The plate is then inked and afterward 
washed. The hardened part, only, retains 
the ink, thus leaving a copy of the drawing 
on the plate. A fine powder (dragon’s 
blood) is sprinkled on the plate, and adheres 
to the ink parts only, thus protecting the 
lines. The back of the plate is protected 
by a coating of asphalt varnish. 
The plate is given several “ bites” in 
acid, which eats away the surface not 
protected. As the bite eats sideways 
as well as down, the plate is sprinkled sev- 
eral times, with the powder, during the 
biting process. The “ bite” eats between 
lines and dots, leaving the image in relief
-P-A-G-E-108

  LESSON | XXVIII   
on the plate. From this relief the drawing 
may be printed. 
A drawing which is to be reduced by the 
photo-engraving process must be large 
enough so that the lines may be clean cut 
and distinct. If there is much detail, 
there must be room enough for careful 
drawing. Lines that are crowded will 
run together when reduced. 
On the other hand a drawing, if made 
too large, will lose in value when reduced. 
As a rule the original drawing is larger 
than the plate, although it may be the 
same size or even smaller. In the latter 
case it will be enlarged when reproduced. 
THE METHOD OF ENLARGEMENT 
Where drawings are to be made for re- 
production by printing, the customer will 
give the artist the size of the plate which 
will be the size of the picture when repro- 
duced. The artist leaves a margin on the 
left-hand side and at the bottom of his 
paper. He then draws the exact size of the 
plate in the lower left-hand corner and a 
diagonal line through the opposite cor- 
ners, extending it indefinitely. (See Figs. 
1 and 3.) Fig. R is the size of the plate. 
The plate is to contain one figure. 
Extend the line b far enough to give 
a good height to draw the figure. Draw 
c to the diagonal line. Draw d from where 
c touches this line, to a. When reduced, 
the rectangle a, b, c, d will be in the same 
proportion as Fig. R. Any horizontal and 
vertical line meeting on the diagonal will 
mark off the same proportion. 
The proper size space having been deter- 
mined, fill in this space with one figure 
as in Fig. 2. The customer is paying so 
much for every square inch of metal plate, 
consequently, he does not wish to waste 
space; make the figure touch the edges 
of the plate on all sides, Fig. 3 is the beginning of a layout for 
three figures. Fig. 4 is the way to space 
the figure. Fig. 5 is the way to place the 
figures. 
Fig. 2 is a suit layout; other layouts 
(for hats, waists, underclothes, etc.) are 
enlarged in the same way. Leave at least 
one inch margin, draw the size of the plate, 
enlarge it, then place as many ovals as 
there are to be figures. Place all ovals 
before drawing the figures. 
When arranging several figures, make a 
variety of positions of heads, and a variety 
of positions of feet. Make the figures 
express interest in each other. News- 
papers and some business houses require 
“ swingy ” figures with plenty of dash and 
“go.” Many pattern houses are more 
conservative and like the figures more 
normal. Some houses have the figures 
drawn on separate papers. These they 
cut out and paste on a large sheet of paper 
in an arrangement to suit themselves. 
In this case they give the artist the height 
of the figures to be drawn. 
If one figure is supposed to be at a little 
distance back of the others, follow the 
rules of perspective and make the far 
figure smaller. Keep the figures in the 
foreground the same size. 
Fig. 6 is a catalogue, underclothes layout. 
This layout calls for two figures and nine 
garments. 
Keep the space well covered and the 
separate garments the size of the ones on 
the figures. The place at the upper 
right-hand corner is left for printing. 
It is called mortice. A figure or garment 
may slightly overlap the edge of the space 
for printing. Odd spaces may be filied in 
with backgrounds, such as tables, ‘vases, 
mirrors, etc., or out-of-door views. See 
Lesson XXVII on Perspective. 
Do not draw back figures unless your 
employer wishes the backs of garments 
illustrated.

LESSON XXIX 
ORIGINAL DRESS DESIGNING 
Costume design is a very interesting 
subject and is an art in itself. If one can 
draw fashions correctly, he can learn to 
create them. 
Study this lesson carefully and apply 
its principles on original work. Keep a 
note-book handy in which jot down ideas 
as they present themselves. 
The student should also read and study 
the fashion papers. He must become 
familiar with the names of principal de- 
signers and their work, as for example: 
Callot, Jenny, Chéruit, Lavin, Paquin, 
Poiret, Drecoll, Premet, Redfern, Doeiul- 
let, Bulloz, Soulie, Douchet, Worth, Beer, 
Armand, Revillion, Renard, Reboux, 
. Chanel, Callot, Soeurs, Monge, Lacroix, ie Hallée, Talbot, Erte, Leon Bakst, Geor- 
gette, Lady Duff Gordon, (Lucile), ete. 
He must visit the openings and French 
shops. The newspapers send artists to 
these shops to sketch the latest designs 
for their papers. Ideas for new designs 
may be taken from many things in which 
one not versed in this art would never 
dream that they existed. 
The very first thing to know is what 
are the prevailing styles. A design must 
be simple and have good lines. Long 
lines running up and down tend to make a 
stout person look more slender, while lines 
running around the figure lend breadth 
to the slim figure. Long lines from the 
shoulders down are good, but these may be 
broken at intervals without destroying 
the long line effect. 
One great thing to be considered in 
costume designing is proper proportions: 
Have all proportions interesting. Do not 
divide up spaces into mechanical divisions. For example, if you want to place very 
small tucks up and down on a waist, do 
not make the tucks the same size as the 
spaces between them, or any mechanical 
division of the same. This rule applies _ 
to cluster of tucks and to the space be- 
tween the clusters. 
Do not open a V neck one-quarter, one- 
half or one-third way down the front. 
Consider the proportion of cuffs to other 
dimensions, also of the size of the pockets 
to the distance down from the belt, length 
of over-skirt to under-skirt, etc. 
Study Fig. 1. Note where the lines are 
omitted as indicated by dots. In Fig. A, 
lines 1 and 2 are continued to the bottom 
of the dress. 
To obtain an idea for a design seems dif- 
ficult for the beginner. The simplest way 
for the student to start, is to cut out of 
the fashion papers parts of different dresses 
that will accord, and that will make a good 
whole. Take one waist, another skirt, 
another sleeve, another collar, etc., all 
of which place on a nicely drawn figure. 
All parts of the costume must look as if 
they were meant to go together. This 
is good practice; but designs made this 
way are not original enough to be sold. 
The next step in dress designing is to 
create a modern dress from a modern 
dress, using the main lines as a foundation. 
Fig. 1 is taken from Fig. A. See how lines 
1, 2, 3 and 4 are preserved, while the design 
is entirely different. The belt in Fig. A 
suggests the piece over the shoulder in 
Fig. 1. 
The idea for Fig. 2 was taken from a 
bird, a bobolink. The designs and colors 
of the plumage of the bird are carried out 
101 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
   102 
on the dress. The bird has a white (W) 
back with mottled (M) feathers near the 
head, which come next to the yellow 
(Y) on the head. The breast and wings 
are a greyish black (B) as also is the tail. 
The part where the mottled feathers are 
may be embroidered in many colors on 
the dress. Follow the shape used for the 
wings and the shape of the white back, 
which extends past the wing line. 
Fig 3 is taken from a rug design. See 
how the shape of the figure repeated so 
often on the rug is used for the front of 
the waist and for the collar. The trim- 
ming is embroidered with the design taken 
from the outside edge of the rug. Color 
schemes may also be carried out. 
Be particular about making the back of a 
dress correspond with the front. 
If you can create a design from a modern 
dress, you will be able (if you keep in mind 
the present style) to create a design from 
an ancient dress. Obtain books from the 
library on ancient costumes. 
Designers use costumes from all periods 
in history for their work. They take their 
ideas from both court and peasant life. 
Study the costumes worn by ancients in 
all countries. The museums are excellent 
places for inspirations. 
_ Designers pay much attention to the 
general outline of the whole figure (when 
dressed), expressed most clearly by the 
silhouette. Study the silhouette as it 
appears in different centuries. 
Things around you, such as flowers, 
vases, etc., all may suggest designs and 
color schemes. Manufacturers of costume STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XXIX 
materials like nicely drawn fashion figures 
dressed in their materials to advertise their 
goods. Select a sample of goods and design 
a suitable costume for that goods, render- 
ing it in color. 
Designs may be submitted in pencil 
only, on the lay figure, or they may be 
placed on the human figure. These are 
more pleasing, especially when they are 
colored. These should be rendered on 
water-color paper. They may be outlined 
in pencil, ink, or a different color from the 
gowns themselves. When placing flat 
washes of color over given surfaces, use 
the directions for French wash but use 
color instead of lamp black. Try all color 
schemes on separate paper. 
Tempera colors are often used. These 
come in tubes and are applied thick like 
oil paints. The student may mix white 
paint with ordinary colors to obtain this 
effect, or he can use show-card colors. 
There are many good books on color; 
study them carefully. 
The student may best decide which 
branch of “ Fashion Drawing” he wishes 
to pursue. If it is ‘‘ Costume Design,” 
he should use every effort to perfect him- 
self in that direction. If it is ‘‘ Costume 
Illustration,” study every detail that 
applies to this line. He must study the 
work of successful artists in both branches 
and try for style. There are many ways 
of illustrating costumes, try for something 
clever, as it is the clever thing that counts. 
Lesson XXX suggests other ways to put 
in practice what has been learned from 
this book.

LESSON XXX 
DECORATIVE WORK 
The student is now in a position not 
only to draw for fashion papers, but to 
use his knowledge in designing box covers, 
book covers, cards, etc., and to draw 
catchy pictures which may be used for 
advertising purposes and which will be 
salable. Publishers will order pictures 
from sketches submitted in rough form, 
but the artist’s finished work must first be 
approved. 
Sketches are made with a few pencil 
strokes giving the publisher the ideas. 
They may be very rough but must have 
snap and the lines must be drawn as if 
one knew how. The more sketches one 
creates of this class the more ideas will 
come to him. 
A composition is good when the main 
point in the picture is most apparent, all 
other things being subordinate to it. The 
given space must be filled in nicely, but 
not crowded. Keep your point of inter- 
est near the center and have the back 
ground spaces interesting. This may be 
accomplished by making a variety of shapes 
and sizes, without having them too differ- 
ent. All parts must pull together for one 
purpose. Study books on composition. 
These treat on balance, harmony and tone 
values. 
It is well first to sketch in your ideas 
very roughly with pencil and practice paper. 
Take your ideas from decorative pictures, 
changing the figures and the backgrounds. 
Start with some selected idea and place 
lines around it that will fill in the given 
space; these lines will suggest shapes of 
objects which may be used for the main 
idea or for the background. 
It is well to draw the figures and the background before placing the frame line 
around them. To ascertain just where to 
place this frame line, make a small hole 
in a piece of paper, cut the hole round or 
square and view the picture through it, 
shifting the opening in different positions. 
This is called a “ finder,” and by this 
method you can find the best place to 
draw the frame around the picture. 
These sketches, when worked out, may 
be rendered on pencil paper with pencil 
only, or they may have flat washes of 
color placed on the parts to be colored. 
A finished pen-and-ink drawing should 
be drawn on bristol board. If the colors 
are to be given, place them on transparent 
paper which is laid over the picture, 
being pasted on the wrong side of the top 
edge of the bristol board. This will suggest 
to the publisher the color scheme, although 
he may change it when reproducing the 
drawing. Many drawings are sold this 
way; they are line drawings. Others are 
sold with the colors carefully worked out 
on the pictures themselyes. These should 
be rendered on illustration board with wash 
or tempera colors. They require a dif- 
ferent process for reproduction than that 
used for line drawings. Consult previous 
instructions for the use of water-color 
paints, Lesson XIX and XXIX. 
Try for good color schemes. Use com- 
binations of colors you have seen, also 
try new combinations. Try out all schemes 
on other paper before attempting to color 
your drawings. 
The sketch shown in Fig. 1 was taken 
from seven different pictures, the figure 
itself being drawn first (the figure was in 
underclothes, the right-hand held flowers, 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
106 
while the left one was resting on a table). 
There is nothing in this sketch to suggest 
any of this detail except the position. 
Now let us dress the figure in a summer 
dress with a hat suitable for the occasion. 
A parasol will go nicely in the right hand 
and fill in the space at the right. There 
is still more space to fill at the right; 
a rose bush will go well with the idea of a 
hot, summer day. The composition needs 
a lawn for the standing figure and this is 
taken from still another picture. Let us 
place a few more roses on the left at the 
bottom, and a few clouds at the top which 
help the summer day. Thus we have parts 
of seven pictures; the lady, the dress, the 
hat, the parasol, the bushes, the lawn and 
the clouds. 
Study Fig. 2. This little girl was seated 
in a daisy field with hills in the back- 
ground. Her hair had a Dutch cut. 
She was picking a daisy. Suppose we 
draw. her as she sits, give her long hair 
and another dress and have her fixing a 
pot of flowers in the house. The window 
suggests the house part; so we have the 
child, the hair, the dress, the plant and 
the window taken from five different pic- 
tures. 
When submitting sketches, ovals and 
circles need not be perfect, but when 
making finished drawings be very accurate. 
Use a compass for circles and a ruler for 
squares and oblongs. 
Construct an oval within an oblong. 
A good way to make a perfect oval is to 
draw diagonal lines from corner to corner 
and a vertical line and a horizontal line 
through the middle. Draw one-quarter 
of the oval in the left-hand top corner. 
Trace off this quarter of the whole drawing 
and turn the tracing over, placing it in 
the right-hand corner, having all lines fit. 
Trace off, then turn the tracing over and 
place it in the right-hand lower corner; STUDENT’S MANUAL OF FASHION DRAWING LESSON XXX 
trace to the left lower corner similarly 
and then redraw carefully. 
Fig. 3 was designed in the same way. 
The little colonial lady had one hand 
resting on a piano and the other one 
extended. Why not place her dress in her 
hands and help the old-fashioned effect 
by the diamond window in the back- 
ground? 
In Fig. 4 the winter girl is very much 
blown by the wind. Everything is driven 
in the same direction, even the snow. A 
small portion of a figure may extend past 
the circle, but do not extend it too far. 
Do not touch the feather with the circle 
or the figure with the distant hills. If 
the figure were leaning against an object, 
she would touch the object. In case of 
distance the space between lends atmos- 
phere. 
The student must not only strive to draw 
well, but he must strive to sell his work. 
Remember publishers will not go to you 
until you have shown yourself worth 
looking up. Go to them with samples 
of your work, always taking your best 
drawings, and taking to each house the 
class of work that that house uses. 
Letters of introduction are excellent 
things to have, and they might get one a 
position. But good work is required to 
keep a position, as it is the work that really 
counts. Show what you can do and do 
not get discouraged if you do not make a 
sale at once. Most houses are courteous 
and are willing to offer suggestions. 
“Free Lancing” is when an _ artist 
has his own studio and sells his work 
to different business houses. 
Take your knocks as so much medicine 
and keep on learning and pushing to the 
front. There are many positions open 
for artists and even a subordinate posi- 
tion is a wonderful thing, for it will give 
experience and may lead to opportunity.

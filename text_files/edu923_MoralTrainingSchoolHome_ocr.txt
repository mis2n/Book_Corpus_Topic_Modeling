PREFACE 
Tue aim of this Handbook is to furnish teachers 
with a manual for moral training in elementary 
schools. It is not a guide for teaching ethics to 
children, for such instruction belongs to a later pe- 
riod of their development. It merely aims to assist 
teachers in their efforts to train children systemati- 
cally in the virtues. Such training, however, involves 
imparting moral lessons, and of course the teacher 
must know what these lessons are, and when and 
how they should be imparted. This book deals 
briefly, and in a very concrete manner, with the sub- 
ject matter and methods involved in such moral 
training. It is the outgrowth of the authors’ expe- 
rience in preparing a graded system of moral in- 
struction by means of fairy tale, myth, fable, legend, 
parable, allegory, hero and heroine tales, biographical 
sketch, and historical event, in the form of a series 
of literary and ethical readers (The Golden Rule 
Series, The Macmillan Company, New York). The 
book may be used independently or in connection 
with the Series. It is the earnest hope of the authors 
that both the Handbook and the Series may prove 
serviceable to teachers desirous of introducing sys- 
tematic moral training into elementary schools, and to 
parents desirous of introducing such training into the 
home.

MORAL TRAINING IN THE 
SCHOOL AND HOME 
. CHAPTER I 
MORAL TRAINING — ITS AIM AND METHOD 
Ir is a remarkable fact that some of the things of 
most importance receive least attention in our edu= 
cational schemes. Probably no one, on a little reflec- 
tion, will question the importance of morality for 
the individual and society. For the individual, 
the virtues aréa means of self-preservation and of the 
highest possible self- development. For society, the 
same thing is true. Society could | not exist with- 
out justice, truth, honesty, and industry, They are 
necessary conditions,-not.only_o! th 
‘society, but of its being at all. Morality lies. ‘at : 
the foundations of the social structure, and it is the 
essential condition of its perpetuity.) “So that in the 
ethical sphere we,are in the sphere of.supreme values, 
and the paramount business of the individual is ‘to 
moralize his life, and the supreme business of society 
is to moralize itself. 
And yet, notwithstanding the supremacy of mo-

rality, hardly anywhere in this country is provision 
made for careful, systematic, graded moral training 
in the schools — either public or private — and much 
less in the home. We get along with what at best 
can be called incidental instruction. And in the 
averagé home moral “training, asa a tule, consists of a 
set of “don'ts” “and “dos? — chié! 
as occasion-requires; with: the’ parént: sacral jude. 
ment, which is often uncritical, _as_the measure of    
  This is wrong, and flagrantly wrong. How wrong 
it is can be estimated only from the standpoint of the 
fact that, as we have seen, morality is the reality of 
supreme worth. But it is of little consequence. to , 
, point out a wrong if one cannot provide a remedy for 
t. | Some may say that the remedy lies in creating a 
public sentiment that will demand systematic train- 
ing in morals in the schools. As citizens, we have no - 
jurisdiction over the home in these matters; but we 
have over the schools. They are our schools, created 
and maintained by us, and as morality is the essen, 
tial condition of public welfare, and the fact of su- 
preme importance to the state, we ought to demand 
of them that our children be systematically trained in 
the virtues. 
But is it really necessary to create such a senti- 
ment, or to make such a demand? Does the senti- 
ment not exist already, and are not the schools in
-P-A-G-E-11
MORAL TRAINING-~ITS AIM AND METHOD 3 
sympathy with it? In a questionnaire circulated 
among the grade teachers of ten cities several years 
ago, a large majority of the teachers responded in 
favor of such moral ttaining. As a matter of fact, 
in virtually all of our schools, moral lessons are im- 
parted, indicating, of course, an interest in this phase 
of human culture. But there is no careful, graded 
system of moral training to be found there. This 
is true in both public and private schools. “It is one 
of the marvels of education, that, notwithstanding 
the recognition of the vital importance of morality, 
and the constant affirmation by educators of the 
ethical end of all education, very dittle attempt has 
been made in this country to work out such a graded 
system. France and Japan have introduced a sys- 
tem of moral instruction into the governthent schools. 
In England, such a systeny has been organized, and 
already it has been introduced into more than thirty- 
five hundred schools. But in this country, barring 
recent incomplete attempts in several states, nothing 
has been done in this direction. That we have failed 
to provide a graded system of moral training proves 
us as educators to be woefully recreant to the most 
vital and sacred interests of those committed to our 
care. Taking for granted, then, that the sentiment 
in favor of systematic moral culture in our schools 
exists, the careful organization of such a system is a 
great desideratum, and it should be introduced into
-P-A-G-E-12
4 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
all schools, both public and private. In organizing 
it the following essentials should be observed : — 
First, weShould not try to teach ethics. The time : 
when the pupil is in the grades is not the time when 
he should be introduced to a science Of morals; such 
a procedure would prove worse than useless. What 
the teacher should aim to do is, to establish the pupil 
__in the virtues —in the habits of will and forms “of. 
conduct — that are so essential to the development 
of the individual and of society. In the second place, we should recognize the neces. 
sity of beginning with the kindergarten. Systematic 
observation, and a careful study of psychology in its 
relation to the child’s moral nature, reveal the fact 
that he is sufficiently developed at this time to begin 
a kind of systematic training along moral lines. “ Such 
training ought to be continued all through the Srades, 
as well as through secondary education- 
In the (third lace, it is exceedingly important to 
determine the~Virtues and-vices that belong to each 
stage. of. the individual’s unfolding: We must de 
““Yemmine-in a scheme of moral culture the virtues 
and vices to be dealt with in the respective grades. 
This should be done by emiploying the methods of 
psychology in a careful study of the moral unfolqin, 
of the child. The so-called recapitulatory theory _ 
that the history of the race is more or less Pitomjzeq 
in the child, — true, at least, in its more Sener. al  
-P-A-G-E-13
MORAL TRAINING— ITS AIM AND METHOD 5 
aspects, will be of service here. The results of such 
an inquiry should be supplemented by a questionnaire 
circulated among thousands of grade teashers, secur- 
ing the results of their observation, based on wide 
experience. In these ways we may determine, ap- 
proximately at least, what virtues and vices ought to __. 
be dealt with in elementary education. 
In the(fourth® Place, due regard must be paid to the 
determination of the right method to be used in moral 
training in the elementary grades. Admitting the 
necessity, especially in the home, of more or less 
direct instruction, the chief method of teaching the 
child morality should nevertheless be the indirect 
_method. That is, we must avoid the formal, didactic - 
™ethod. We should introduce children to the vir- 
tues and vices, with their corresponding rewards and 
punishments, through fairy tale, myth, fable, allegory, 
parable, legend, stories of heroes and heroines, biog- 
raphy and history, The child is easily brought into 
sympathy with the story, and grasps in this concrete 
and interesting way its moral import; and the lesson, 
because of the child’s intense sympathies, soon sinks 
into his sensitive mind and receptive heart. 
The history of story-telling shows the hold it has © 
upon thehuman mind. This history is “full of vivid 
and dramatic scenes; and everywhere belief gives a 
touch of sincerity and seriousness. It tells of groups 
of young American Indians, who sit by the night fire,
-P-A-G-E-14
6 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
nestling close to earth, listening to old tales of giants 
who live in the north, and of the great wind-bird 
who makes the storms. One will hear of story- 
tellers in villages of the African forest, who tell tales 
of the wonderful doings of animals: of the antelope, 
the leopard, the turtle, and even Br’er Rabbit. One 
will come upon groups of Eskimo children listening 
to stories of the ancient time, some of them like 
many of our own stories that have come to us from 
the Icelandic Norse. In the East there will be charm- 
ing scenes in which yellow-robed priests, with palm- 
leaf books in their laps, are telling or reading the 
birth stories of Buddha. In China and Japan will 
be found the professional story-teller, entertaining 
or teaching in the public hall, or in the market-place ; 
scenes in so many ways like those in ancient Greece, ° 
that one will wonder whether there was once contact 
between the two civilizations. In Northern Africa 
the professional story-teller will be seen entertaining 
crowds of wild-eyed Arabs in the public market- 
place. If one lingers among historic places in Europe 
he will still imagine the presence of the strolling 
singers and bards, who did more than any other class 
to keep culture alive through the Dark Ages, and 
who laid the foundations of our literature. Among 
northern castles one will seem to hear still the echoes 
of the voices of the ancient skalds, telling of the great 
deeds of old kings, and of the mighty gods, Odin
-P-A-G-E-15
MORAL TRAINING-—ITS AIM AND METHOD 7 
and Thor. In rural Germany, in Normandy, in the 
Highlands, and the country districts of Ireland, 
and wherever there is still a trace of unwritten litera- 
ture, and the folk-tale survives, one will find remains 
of story-telling customs which have outlived the cen- 
turies. There will be the warm fireside, the music, 
the home-brewed beer or cider, the eager peasants 
listening to the strange stories of the traveling story- 
teller, who perhaps combines with his art the more 
practical trade of shoemaker or tailor. Wherever, 
in a word, there has been religion to teach, tradition 
and custom to perpetuate, history to record ; where- 
ever there is folk thought and local legend, country 
gossip and news, there will be found the story-teller 
—-more or less serious and skilled, more or less a 
creative artist; but usually with a sense of a serious 
mission to carry abroad what he has learned as the 
truth.” + 
This is really no exaggeration. In the story we 
_ have a kind of universal language. It has an interest 
for every one at some period of his career. Its em- 
pire extends to the confines of the race. Its throne 
is established especially in the imagination and heart 
of childhood — whether in the childhood of the in- 
dividual or the childhood of the race. Anything so 
intensely human — so essentially the possession of

pp. 8-z0.

8 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
- the race — must find its raison d’éire deep seated in ~~ 
the human soul. Its psychology reveals something 
more than a mere play of fancy or a desire to be en- 
tertained. [Stories in their fundamental aspects, are 
the’ products of intense human desires, fears, hopes, 
and beliefs. | In the earlier history of man they were 
. undoubtedly the outgrowth of man’s struggle with. 
nature and with supposed unseen powers. Stories 
represent the fears, desires, and hopes of this struggle. 
Giants, fairies, etc., are the personification of these 
fears, desires, and hopes. These beings, revealed by 
fancy and the imagination, conquer or are to conquer 
others, who represent opposing forces. Stories are 
born of religious and ethical moods, and this is why 
they are so intensely human in their character. 
The story has for ages proven itself a most effec- 
“tive educational means. Indeed, it constituted one 
of the earliest means of education. Priests, prophets, 
poets, singers, historians, made use of it. The Hindoo 
. Jatakas, the Hebrew tales, the Greek myths and . 
fables, the Christian parables, the medieval ballads 
and legends, all testify to the fact that the story in 
some form has been a favorite method of commu~ 
nicating knowledge and belief. This is doubtless 
due to the fact that it is such a very human thing. 
By virtue of its content it appeals to the humanity 
in us. Our imagination and sympathies are awak~ 
ened, and together they envisage the story content
-P-A-G-E-17
MORAL TRAINING —ITS AIM AND METHOD 9 
with reality — they clothe the characters with flesh 
and blood. In most instances the reader or hearer 
of the story identifies himself with the hero or 
heroine of the tale. In short, the story secures our 
interest, and what we are interested in we attend to, 
and what we attend to, as a rule, we remember, and 
what we remember we think about, and all this, 
when it involves a moral content, affects character 
and conduct. 
Now, because, as a rule, the story is a spiritual crea- 
tion, involving a moral content, as is manifest in so 
many fairy tales, myths, fables, parables, allegories, 
legends, etc., its use becomes a peculiarly effective 
method in moral culture, and this is why the great 
moral teachers have resorted to it A As Froebel once 
said: ‘It is not the gay forms that he meets in the 
fairy tale which charm the child, but a spiritual, in- 
visible truth lying far deeper.’ >| It is not merely 
because the story entertains, and ministers often to 
the child’s self-forgetfulness, but because of its moral 
and spiritual content that the child becomes vitally 
interested in it. This is what makes it such a potent 
instrument in character building. A book of well- 
selected stories, or a series of such tales well told by 
the teacher, is far more effective than any text-book. 
_ This is doubtless what President Hall meant when he 
said: “Let me tell the stories and I care not who 
writes the text-books.” A good story is a sure and
-P-A-G-E-18
0 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
swift method of approach to a child’s mind and 
heart. 
Furthermore, in certain respects the moral story 
. is a more powerful influence with the child than an ~ 
actual living example. The sanctions of morality — . 
the rewards and penalties — must be apparent and 
more or less immediate to the child if the moral 
lesson is to be effective. In actual life these are not 
always obvious, and often seem far removed in point 
of time. Whereas, in the story, punishment is swift 
and reward immediate, so that the child soon per- 
ceives what the results of bad and good conduct are. 
Objection is sometimes urged against the use of 
stories — especially of fairy tales — by sophisticated 
persons who would reduce all life to the terms of a 
scientific prose translation, and are afraid of the pres- 
entation of truth in any other manner than in the 
language of fact. Some parents fear that children 
may draw from these fanciful tales inferences about 
the world which must be unlearned, and that thé pro- 
cess of unlearning may lead to a skeptical attitude 
toward all instruction. The child finds out that the 
fairy stories are not true, and infers that other teach- 
ing is untrue also. The fact is, however, that the 
normal child passes easily out of the reading of im- 
aginative fiction into the reading of veritable history 
without any process of disillusion. He perceives the 
difference. We do not need to explain it to him.
-P-A-G-E-19
MORAL TRAINING—ITS AIM AND METHOD It 
He is no more likely to reproach us for telling him 
about giants and dragons than for dressing him in 
the proper frocks of childhood. He instinctively 
puts all these things where they belong. Meanwhile, 
the fairies are as appropriate to his youth as the 
frocks. He comes on with widened interest, having 
_ taken into his possession that sense of the mystery of 
the world which right education does but increase. 
He gets out of his reading an assurance of the eventual 
triumph of the good, which he may verify afterward 
in history, and which he needs for the development 
of his character. 
Again, there is a psychology governing the order 
of the selection of stories. : ‘ The psychological order 
is practically the historical one. A regard for it 
would begin with the myth and fairy tale, because 
their people are most nearly like children themselves. 
“Especially is this true of the fairy tale. And the fact 
that the child is greatly interested.in animals makes 
the fable effective, although here we find the mora] 
stated, which is not so effective as when the child is 
permitted to infer it himself. As the child grows 
older and deals more and more with the real than 
with the fictitious, the legend, which has an element 
of both, paves the way for a transition from the 
myth, fairy tale, and fable to stories of real life. In 
the stories of King Arthur and his Knights, in the 
adventures of Robin Hood, in the splendid legends
-P-A-G-E-20
12 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
of the heroes, the fairy tales merge into actual life. 
The child learns the fineness of courtesy, the com- 
bination of tenderness with strength, the protection 
of the weak, the scorn of all things base and mean, 
which are exemplified in the exploits of men in armor. 
In all this he is living the long past over again, and 
is coming on over the road of progress along which 
the race has gone before him. He is filling in the 
historic background of human life. After the legend 
comes a vital interest in heroes and heroines, as life 
actually presents them, and moral education will 
meet this interest with biographical and historical 
literature. 
Furthermore, the Tadirect_method comands that 
the child be allowed to-do his own moraliaig. To 
tell the story, and then to apply it in the form of 
preaching or exhortation, is not to be commended. 
The child is capable of doing his own moralizing, and 
this is much more effective than if the parent or 
teacher does it for him. It is, of course, vitally im- 
portant that the child should grasp the moral import 
of the story. If he fails to do so at first, tactful 
questioning will bring the moral lesson out; but, by 
all means, avoid “preaching.” As Professor St. John 
says: “If a good story is well told moralizing is not 
necessary; but that is not all. It has been clearly 
demonstrated that it weakens the moral influence. 
Psychologists have formulated the law that the power

of normal suggestion varies inversely with the extent 
to which its purpose is definitely revealed. The , 
mother who says to a child, ‘Why don’t you go out 
on the lawn and see how many dandelions you can 
pick ?’ is likely to secure a period of privacy, but if 
she adds, ‘so that I can be alone for a little while,’ 
the result will not be the same. Children resent the 
old-fashioned Sunday-school stories with their too 
obvious moral purpose, but are strongly influenced 
by transcripts of life in which the same duties are 
clearly implied, but not explicitly stated. So adults 
are often more strongly influenced by a play like 
The Servant in the House than by many sermons.” ? 
In the fifth place, if morals are.to be taught in 
this manner, it necessitates a body of good literature, 
carefully graded in vocabulary, interest, and ethical 
content: This literature, so far as possible, should be 
selected from the best ancient and modern lore of all 
nations. We are thus likely to secure, not only the best 
literature, but also to strike the fundamentally moral 
and human. In making a collection of such literature 
for the schools the utmost care must be taken not 
to use anything that has not been made the subject 
of actual test in the classroom. It is in this way 
alone that the best results can be secured. This 
literature should be compiled in the form of ethical 
readers that may take their place side by side with 
1 St. John, “Stories and Story-telling,” Boston, 1910, p. 33. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
14 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
literary, historical, nature, and other readers. Thus, 
for nine years, in the kindergarten, and in the eight 
grades of the elementary schools, we could train the 
pupil in the virtues by means of good literature 
adapted in every way to the pupil’s stage of develop- 
ment. \ 
It should be stated again that we are not to teach a 
_ science of ethics. We are to establish the pupil in 
” the virtues. We are to build character, and the best 
way in which to do this is by systematically placing 
before the pupil moral situations as embodied in 
story. Such situations, thus presented, dealing with 
the virtues and vices peculiar to each period of the 
child’s unfolding, result in wholesome moral fFeactions 
which, through frequent repetition, lead the pupil 
to develop habits of will and forms of conduct that 
are morally worthy. In other words, they tend to 
establish him in those virtues which constitute the 
foundations of good character. 
Finally, the teacher herself should be a good story~ 
teller. The story of the reader should often be sup- 
plemented by a similar story related by the teacher. 
In order that this may be effectively done, the teacher 
should cultivate the art of story-telling, and should 
have a fund of stories at her command. She must 
familiarize herself with the fundamentals of story. 
telling, and she will find that practice will grad- 
ually tend to perfect her art. It may be difficult
-P-A-G-E-23
MORAL TRAINING-——ITS AIM AND METHOD 15 
at first, but perseverance will conquer the difficulties, 
and victory means much for the teacher. It adds to 
her power over the child. The child is eager to hear, 
and he reacts with a receptive mind and heart. Such 
an audience should be an inspiration to the teacher, 
and’ it should furnish an incentive to make herself 
proficient in this interesting and potent art. To 
have the story of the reader supplemented by the 
well-told story of the teacher will make the moral 
lesson doubly effective. 
The teacher will find it to her advantage to consult 
the following works on stories, and how to tell them :— 
“The Science of Fairy Tales,” E. Sidney Hartland; 
“Fairy Tales: Their Meaning and Origin,” J. T. Bunce; 
“Comparative Mythology,” Max Mueller; “The Mythol- 
ogy of the Aryan Nations,” Sir G. W. Cox; “How to Tell 
Stories to Children,” Sara Cone Bryant; “Some Great 
Stories and How to Tell Them,” R. T. Wyche; ‘“Story-

Home,” E. N. and G. E. Partridge.

Aut human_ efficiency is conditioned on_bodily 
efficiency. This is a dictum of modern science. Now 
since the bodily life 3s‘subject to. juoral. law, our prime

quaint’ ourselves with’ the essential conditions of 
bodily welfare, and to conform to them. According 
to hygiene, the welfare of the bodily organism is 
dependent on cleanliness of person, clothes, and sur- 
roundings; on the quantity, quality, and digestion 
of our food, and on the regularity of our eating ; 
on the purity of the water we drink, as well as on the" 
manner of our drinking; on the air we breathe, its 
temperature, moisture, freedom from bacteria, as 
well as on our methods of breathing ; on the sufficiency 
and soundness of our sleep; on the amount and kind.

of exercise we take; and on either abstinence or 
temperance with reference to indulgence in alcoholic 
stimulants, narcotics, sexual passions, etc. This 
being so, it is important that the pupil should ap- 
prehend these essentials, not only as natural conditions 
of bodily welfare, but also as involving duties im- 
posed on him by his moral nature. To remain in 
willful ignorance concerning the conditions of bodily 
well-being, and to fail willfully to conform to them, 
is to be guilty of gross moral neglect, and of positive 
evil, . - 
It is evident that many of the duties pertaining 
to the bodily life come early in the individual’s career. 
Indeed, they antedate the period when the child 
first enters upon his school life. It is, therefore, 
obligatory upon the parent, or upon those who have 
the supervision of the child in these early years, to 
make him acquainted with these duties, and to teach 
him to perform them. In these early years the direct 
‘method may not only be necessary, but in all prob- 
ability it will prove the more efficient. However, 
aftey the sixth year the indirect method is without 
‘ doubt primarily the method to be used. 
In moral instruction in this sphere of human 
nature we seek to acquaint the pupil with virtues 
and vices that pertain to the life of the body, and also 
to establish him in those habits of will and forms 
of conduct that make for its highest well-being. One

of the natural conditions of a healthy body is bodily 
cleanliness. In view of the germ theory of disease 
the importance of this condition needs to be fully 
emphasized. Dangerous microbes exist in dirt which 
constantly menace the health of the body. They 
infest the dust that accumulates under the finger 
nails, or on the surface of the body, especially on the 
hands and face, and are thus often introduced into 
the system by being conveyed to the mouth, or to 
cuts and scratches on the body. This often results 
in disease, or in painful and dangerous inflammations. 
Hence the necessity of keeping the body clean by 
frequent bathing. Dangerous microbes exist also 
in unclean clothing and are transferred to the body. 
Hence it is not a matter of indifference whether our 
clothes be clean or not. Here cleanliness becomes a 
necessity also. 
Again, harmful microbes lurk in the food which 
accumulates between and in the cavities of our teeth. 
When it is allowed to remain there, it soon turns into 
a workhouse for microbes—a breeding place of 
disease. It is really surprising how many serious 
diseases are the result of neglect or improper care 
of the teeth. Hence the necessity of keeping them 
in a healthy condition by frequent cleansing and 
proper dentistry. 
Furthermore, the function of the skin is to eliminate ~ 
waste products, and particularly to control the heat

losses of the system. In order to function normally 
it must be kept in a healthy condition. The pores 
must be kept open by frequent removal from the sur- 
face of the body of the products they emit. This, of 
course, is to be accomplished by frequent bathing, 
and by rubbing the body thoroughly with a rough 
towel. Bodily cleanliness becomes an essential if 
the body is to maintain efficiently its functions and 
promote its own well-being. 
Now, since personal cleanliness in all of these forms 
is an essential natural condition of bodily health and 
strength, and since we are under moral obligation 
to preserve and to promote the efficiency of the body, 
such cleanliness is a matter of moral obligation also. 
We are morally bound to practice it as a virtue. No- 
where can this virtue be taught with greater success 
than in the school. In many instances home condi- 
tions are such that a systematic observance of this 
obligation on the part of the children can hardly be 
expected. So that the school has a special duty to 
perform here. Personal cleanliness ought to be made 
a requirement on the part of every pupil. Here 
compulsion becomes a virtue. The hygienic, exs- 
thetic, and moral sanctions of personal cleanliness 
ought to be brought to bear on the pupil. The 
hygienic sanctions will, of course, be dealt with in the 
course on hygiene. The esthetic and moral sanc- 
tions can be brought forward in a course in elemen-
-P-A-G-E-28
20 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
tary moral training. Here the duty of maintaining 
the efficiency of the body by observing the natural 
conditions of its well-being can be presented as a 
matter of ethical obligation, and as a matter of de- 
cency and self-respect, and a serious effort to estab- 
lish the pupil in habits of personal cleanliness can 
be made. And here, as in the case of other virtues, 
systematic training is necessary. 
Prudence and self-control in relation to the bodily 
life are also virtues which need to be dealt with in 
elementary moral training. They relate chiefly to 
regulation of the bodily appetites — the appetites 
of food, drink, sleep, and sex. .The appetite for food 
is, of course, fundamental. By it the. body is sus- 
tained. But how it is to be sustained, whether at 
a high point of efficiency or not, depends largely upon. 
what we eat, how much we eat, and how we eat. 
Modern science shows this to be true in a very im- 
portant sense. Our bodily and mental efficiency 
depends in a large measure upon the quality, quan- 
tity, and digestion of our food. Physiological 
chemistry shows us that there are food values. Cer- 
tain foods are better adapted to promote the well- 
being of the body than others. So that it is not a 
matter of hygienic indifference, and therefore not a 
matter of moral indifference, what we eat. In 
a very important sense the German maxim is true : 
Mann ist was Mann isst, —‘‘Man is what he eats.??
-P-A-G-E-29
THE BODILY LIFE ai 
The same thing is true in regard to quantity of food. 
According to recent scientific investigations the 
average person eats too much. The result is that 
waste products accumulate in the system. They 
are in a state of fermentation, and thus poison the 
body — impairing and weakening it. The organs of 
nutrition are overtaxed, and the organs whose func- 
tion it is to eliminate by-products are also unequal 
to the burden imposed upon them. Thus the body 
suffers and, with it, the mind also. So that to eat 
too much is not only an hygienic evil, but a moral’ 
evil as well. It is a sin against our total life, for 
our entire mental efficiency is conditioned upon our 
bodily well-being. 
Neither is the mastication of our food a matter of 
hygienic and moral indifference. To fail to have the 
digestive work properly initiated in the mouth is to 
throw upon the stomach a burden that does not prop- 
erly belong to it. The result is that the work of 
digestion is not thoroughly done, and our bodily 
strength is weakened, and with the weakening of 
" the bodily organism there is a corresponding impair- 
ment of mental and moral strength. 
It is evident, then, that dietetics is an important 
branch of hygiene, and it ought to figure conspicuously 
in the school curriculum. Since we are under ob- 
ligations to moralize the bodily life, and since the 
supreme obligation here is to raise the bodily or-
-P-A-G-E-30
22 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
ganism to its highest point of efficiency, it becomes 
our duty to acquaint ourselves with the laws of hy- 
giene as they relate to the food of the body, and to 
conform to them. Thus this subject becomes a part 
of morals also. It belongs to moral education as well 
as to intellectual culture. Prudence and self-control 
in regard to our appetite for food are virtues which 
must be cultivated, and the time to cultivate them 
is in early childhood and youth. 
But these virtues ought also to be practiced in 
relation to our drinking. Water, too, is a funda- 
mental necessity of our bodily life. As in the case of 
food, so in the case of drink, our bodily efficiency is 
dependent on the quality of the water we drink, and 
on the mode of drinking it. In regard to the quality, 
it is exceedingly important that the water introduced 
into the system be pure. As in the food we eat, 
and in the air we breathe, so in the water we 
drink, disease microbes are often present. For ex- 
ample, water is probably the most prolific source of 
typhoid fever germs. So that it is a matter of vital 
importance for us to protect the body from such 
sources of danger. From a hygienic point of view 
hardly anything is more important to a city than 
its water supply. Citizens should guard it against 
all sources of pollution, especially from sewage. 
Hence prudence here is not only a hygienic obliga~ 
tion, but a moral obligation as well. Every individ.
-P-A-G-E-31
THE BODILY LIFE 23 
ual is under moral obligation to guard the interests 
of his own bodily life as well as the interests of the 
bodily life of the community from such dangers. 
Not only the teacher of hygiene, but also the teacher 
of morals in our schools, must aim to cultivate in the 
pupil the virtue of prudence in this respect. In this 
relation it is both a personal and a social virtue. 
A moral obligation extends also to our mode of 
drinking water. It is a matter both of hygienic and 
moral concern as to how we drink. We should not 
drink while chewing our food. To do so interferes 
with the digestive process, by replacing the saliva 
whose office is to moisten and soften the food. It 
thus interferes with the proper preparation of the 
food for the stomach. This means that it interferes 
with digestion, and good digestion is absolutely es- 
sential to our highest physical well-being. So here 
again the virtue of prudence becomes important, and 
a course in elementary morals should emphasize the 
virtue in this relation. Indeed, it needs special em- 
phasis, for there is hardly any law of hygiene more 
frequently and flagrantly violated by children than 
this one. 
Sleep is sometimes spoken of as an appetite. It 
is an absolutely necessary condition of the body’s 
maintenance and well-being. Indeed, every one’s 
bodily and mental efficiency is largely dependent 
upon it. During our waking moments the brain is 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
24 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
constantly active. It is at work even in our 
- trivial employments. It is constantly expend: 
energy. Hence it becomes fatigued and needs 1coc. 
Sleep brings the rest necessary for savin~ ond r=. 
newing its energy. And so it is with the 
of the body. Although more or less : 
sleep, they are relatively at rest when 
is compared with that of our wakii 
This results in a saving and a renewing 
energy. When we sleep, we cease to s

flagrantly violate the laws of hygiene in the treatment 
of their children in this respect. We must raise up a 
generation possessed of knowledge, prudence, and self- 
control in these matters, so that not only they, but 
subsequent generations also, may profit by their 
knowledge and virtue :— 
“We cannot say what the mental and physical average 
of our race is really capable of being until we devote far 
more attention than any hitherto to the question of sleep 
in childhood. It is not only growth of limb but also 
growth and development of brain that occurs during the 
constructive period of sleep. To eat is only to take in, 
but to sleep is to build.” 1 
Another essential condition of bodily welfare 
which calls for the exercise of prudence is proper . . 
breathing. We breathe from birth till death, and 
our physical well-being is conditioned upon the air 
we breathe, and upon our mode of breathing. The 
results of fresh and pure air in the schoolroom, com- 
pared with those of a poorly ventilated room, will be 
very apparent. Dr. Gulick, in his simple hygienic 
lesson to children, does not exaggerate the case : — 
“T can think,” he says, “of two schoolrooms. In the 
first the children look unhappy; their eyes are dull and 
their cheeks are flushed, though some of them have pale 
faces instead. Only a few sit up straight, while none of 
1Saleeby, “Health, Strength, and Happiness,” New York, 1908, 
p. 108. :
-P-A-G-E-34
26 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
them look as if they enjoyed studying. One class is 
reciting a spelling lesson, and I notice that several of the 
children miss the easiest words. In this room the air is 
wretched. I look around and cannot see any place for 
fresh air to enter. : 
“The second room is of the same size, and although it 
holds the same number of children, still everything here is 
different. Both the girls and the boys look as if they en- 
joyed studying, most of them are sitting up straight, their 
eyes are bright, they do not often miss the easy words, 
and nobody looks cross. As might be expected, enough 
fresh air is coming into the room all the time to keep it 
fresh and pure.” 1 
Until recently the explanation of the bad effects 
of this “wretched air” on the bodily life was that 
they were due to the introduction of carbon dioxid 
into the. system. Beside inert nitrogen air contains 
oxygen and carbon dioxid, one of which is beneficial 
to the body, the other is not. In inhaling pure 
air, we inhale oxygen; when it is exhaled, it has been 
changed by the lungs into carbon dioxid. When 
we are in a room not properly ventilated, there is a 
gradual decrease of oxygen and an increase of carbon 
dioxid, which may be harmful. It was formerly, and 
still is, supposed by many that we are poisoned by in~ 
haling it. Lately, however, this explanation has been 
called into question; indeed, it has been rejected ag 
false. Dr. Leonard Hill and others affirm, on the 
1 Gulick, “Good Health,” Boston, 1906, pp. 6-7.
-P-A-G-E-35
. THE BODILY LIFE 27 
basis of experiment, that the evil results of living 
in stuffy or ill-ventilated rooms are due to the 
temperature, dryness, and stagnation of the air rather 
-than to its chemical impurity,—to a deficiency of 
oxygen, and the inhalation of carbon dioxid, and that 
our American school buildings, many of which are 
heated by hot-air systems, are often responsible for 
the throat and respiratory troubles of children 
Whichever of these two explanations is correct, 
the fact remains the same, that poorly ventilated 
rooms are responsible for serious bodily ills, and there- 
fore the child should be made acquainted with the 
fact, and be taught the importance of proper ventila- 
tion. 
And what is true on a large scale with respect to 
the schoolroom is equally true on a smaller scale 
concerning the home. So that children ought to 
be made to realize the importance of good ventila- 
tion in the home, and thus we shall raise up a genera- 
tion that will observe hygienic measures on which the 
physical, mental, and moral welfare of a people largely 
depend. When we remember how many children of 
the poor live in badly ventilated tenements, and how 
bodily disease is often the result; when we remember 
how seriously such conditions affect the mental and 
moral life of the children of the poor who attend our 
schools, the teacher will see at once what an op-

-P-A-G-E-36
28 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
portunity presents itself to the school for the improve- 
ment of the bodily life of a large element in the 
community. She will then not only insist upon 
knowledge, but will endeavor to develop wisdom also 
in the matter of breathing fresh air. Prudence as a 
moral obligation will be cultivated. An effort to 
establish the child in this important virtue will be 
made. 
But there is another aspect of this subject. Modern 
science has made us acquainted with the existence of 
innumerable microbes in the air, some of which are 
the enemies of man, and which, when introduced 
into the body through breathing, threaten its wel- 
fare, and often, indeed, its life. Dangerous microbes 
frequently infest poorly ventilated rooms. So that 
here again the virtue of prudence becomes a necessity 
if we would preserve our bodily efficiency. Fur- 
thermore, whether in the home or out of it, we are 
constantly enveloped in an atmosphere of dust, vary- 
ing in degrees of density. In this atmosphere harm- 
ful microbes are often present. So that the dust 
of streets should be avoided as much as possible, 
and great care should be exercised not only in keep- 
ing the house as clean as possible, but also in sweep~ 
ing carpets, shaking rugs, dusting furniture, and 
brushing clothes. Carelessness here becomes an evil 
because of the danger involved, and prudence becomes 
a virtue. The teacher should train children to
-P-A-G-E-37
THE BODILY LIFE 29 
be on guard against the vice, and to practice the 
virtue, the opportunity for exercising which comes 
to every one. 
Again, it is not a matter of indifference as to how 
we breathe. The child should not breathe through 
his mouth. As a rule, the presence of adenoids will 
probably be found responsible for improper breathing 
of this nature. Where there is medical inspection 
in the schools, this will doubtless be attended to. 
Where there is not such inspection, the teacher 
should report the matter to the child’s parents. 
There are other forms of improper breathing which 
will probably be corrected by the teacher of hygiene 
or the physical director. But when the teacher of 
hygiene or the physical director is not to be found 
in the school, then the teacher herself should take 
the matter in hand. She should be informed on the 
subject of proper methods of breathing, and the 
child has a right to the benefit of her informa- 
tion. Montessori speaks of ‘the art of breathing,” 
and she has adopted Professor Sala’s systém of 
respiratory gymnastics for the purpose of devel- 
oping this “‘art.”1 This matter is one of vital 
importance from a hygienic point of view, and, there- 
fore, the teacher of elementary morals must treat the 
Subject as a matter of moral concern also.

-P-A-G-E-38
30 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
Exercise is another essential of bodily welfare, and, 
as such, it becomes a moral obligation. There are 
two forms of exercise: play and physical labor. 
Both, properly indulged in, make for the welfare of 
the body. The teacher is primarily concerned with 
play. It preéminently belongs to childhood and 
youth. To-day the playground comes into the cur- 
riculum of the school out of the experience of the 
street. It has been found so potent an influence 
in the lives of unprivileged children that the provid- 
ing of open spaces for the purpose of supervised play 
is becoming more and more a part of the business of 
every progressive city. Many experiments have thus 
been tried already, and the results are available for 
use in the schools. The idea of using schoolyards 
for real playgrounds is largely the outcome of these 
successful experiments. . 
Of course, the schoolyard has always been a place 
for play, but it has seldom been an attractive place ; 
hardly has it been well adapted to purposes of rec- 
reation; and still less frequently has any serious 
effort been made to render by expert direction the 
games of the children profitable as well as pleasant. 
The private school has had a great advantage in this 
respect over the public school. Indeed, the play— 
ground has thus far been one of the chief reasons for 
the existence of. the private school. Parents per- 
ceive that out-of-door play is a part of the norma]
-P-A-G-E-39
THE BODILY LIFE 31 
life of the child, and that without it not only the 
physical but the moral life is endangered. They per- 
ceive also that the crowded town affords little oppor- 
tunity for such recreation. Hence they send their 
children to schools which are built in the country, in 
the midst of broad fields for exercise. The teaching 
in the classrooms of these schools may be no better 
than in the public schools, or not so good, but the 
boys and girls get the needed development which is 
gained from normal play. 
The transformation of schoolyards into playgrounds 
gives to the poor one of the privileges of the rich. 
This matter is intimately related to morals. It is a 
help to good health, and is thus an aid to all good 
living. It improves the quality of the moral stock ; 
it gives the city better citizens. 
The first necessity is an enlargement of most school- 
yards to make them big enough for actual use. Then 
the materials of amusement must be supplied in the 
form of swings and games, and other opportunities 
for exercise, and, in charge of the whole, must be a 
director. The moral value of the playground de- 
pends on his wise supervision. For the games of 
children are to be used not only to amuse them, and 
not only to enlarge their lungs, and straighten their 
backs, and toughen their muscles, but to minister 
to the betterment of character. They are to carry 
from their recreations not only a knowledge of games,
-P-A-G-E-40
32 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
which must presently, in the business of life, be of © 
little use, but a knowledge of life itself, learned in the 
learning and playing of the games. 
According to Groos, animal play is a preparation 
for the life the young animal must lead later in the 
struggle for existence. This is true also of the child, 
however true may be the so-called recapitulatory 
theory of play. It is nature’s method of preparing 
"the child for the things he must later work at instead 
of play at. It prepares him also for the larger moral 
life which will be his in the future. Aside from the 
benefits to the bodily life gained through play, the 
playground is the classroom of the social virtues. 
Children are taught, without knowing that they are 
learning lessons, how to get on with their neighbors. 
They learn patience, and forbearance, and self-re- 
straint, and to await their turn, and to be fair and 
honest, to lose with good humor, and to care for the 
game more than for the prize. They perceive that 
results are best attained by combined effort, by 
“team play”; they learn to obey, to follow a leader, 
to subordinate themselves. They prepare for the 
serious responsibilities of life. 
Gymnastics, too, are a wholesome form of physical 
exercise. They partake both of the nature of play, 
and, as prescribed school exercises, of the nature of 
work. They should be encouraged in every school, 
for they make for the ‘vitality and efficiency of the
-P-A-G-E-41
THE BODILY LIFE . 33 
body. School authorities should provide opportuni- 
ties and apparatus for systematic exercise of this kind. 
Such a regimen not only has a wholesome physical 
effect, but the order and discipline involved exert a 
moralizing influence as well. ‘‘As boys become in- 
terested in their biceps they grow trusty and are more 
likely to be temperate, to accept discipline, to be more 
interested in wholesome régime. As muscles develop, 
the gap between knowing and doing narrows, and 
motor mindedness increases. There also arises a sal- 
utary sense of the difference between tolerable well- 
ness, or mere absence of sickness, and an exuberant 
buoyant feeling of abounding vitality, health, and 
vigor, which brings courage, hope, and right ambition 
in its train, power to undergo hardship, do difficult 
things, bear trials, and resist temptation, while fabby 
muscles and deficiency of exercise give a sense of weak- 
ness, lust for indulgence, easy discouragement, and 
feelings of inefficiency.” ! 
It is fortunate, also, from a moral point of view 
that manual training has been introduced so largely 
into our schools. ft, too, is a kind of physical exer- 
cise which makes for the development of the body, and 
for this reason alone it might be commended on moral 
grounds, to say nothing here of its value for the 
development of the will, and its great moral value in 
developing certain virtues and in preparing, to a cer-

tain extent, the pupils for thé vocational or eco 
nomic life. Here it is sufficient to heartily commen: 
manual training on the ground of its value for mora 
because of its salutary effect upon the bodily life. 
It makes for vitality and better physical develop- 
ment, and, therefore, for greater physical efficiency, 
thus rendering the body a more capable instrument) 
in the service of the mind. 
In dealing with the moralization of the b-¥- ¥*~ 
another virtue to be dealt with is physica 
Courage is often necessary for the preservat... ve eee 
body, not only from injury, but also from possible 
death, and therefore it becomes a moral obligation. 
The Greeks greatly emphasized this virtue. Aris— 
totle regarded courage as the mean between coward~ 
ice and foolhardiness. Physical courage moralized is 
really rational self-defense. Such courage is always 
prudent. It guards the body against surprises and. 
sudden or prolonged attacks. 
“That man is brave,” says Paulsen, “who, when at— 
tacked and in peril, neither blindly runs away nor rushes 
‘into danger, but retaining his composure, carefully and 
calmly studies the situation, quietly deliberates and de- 
cides, and then carries out his resolution firmly 
energetically, whether it be resistance and attack, or 
. fense and retreat. Prudence, therefore, constitutes an 
essential part of valor.”!

1900, p. 496.

It is well for the teacher to develop this virtue in 
children. They ought to be taught to endure pain 
patiently and courageously; to meet danger fear- 
lessly, but cautiously. In this way they not only 
render a valuable service to the body, but also to the 
soul. Its value for social service is often seen in the 
golden deeds of heroism on the part of children, which 
constitute a glorious page in the annals of the race, 
and in that martial courage which is the expression of 
patriotic loyalty to the state, and which, later in life, 
they may be called upon to exercise, and for which 
the early cultivation of courage prepares the way.

CHAPTER Il 
‘THE BODILY LIFE (continued) 
In relation to alcoholic stimulants, temperance 
is a form of self-control and prudence with reference 
to the bodily life that should receive special con- 
" sideration at the hands of the school because of its 
vital relation to the interests of the individual, and of 
society. So callous do we seem to be to the awful 
social, economic, and moral effects of its opposite —— 
the vice of intemperance — that it really seems 
as though it might be better to approach the moral 
aspécts of the subject through hygiene. For children, 
at least, acquaintance with the evil effects of alcohol, 
and of an intemperate use of it, on the bodily organ- 
ism may prove to be the most effective means of 
introducing them to the higher moral consideratic 
involved. To this end it is well for the teacher 
elementary morals to codperate with the teacher 
hygiene, — the one dealing primarily with the scien- 
tific aspects of the subject, and the other more es- 
pecially with the moral aspects as involved in the 
facts disclosed by science. 
The effects of alcohol on the bodily organism are 
36
-P-A-G-E-45
THE BODILY LIFE 37 
so deleterious that it is not difficult to develop in the 
large majority of pupils a moral attitude against its 
use as a beverage by man. Metchnikoff has shown 
how its effect upon the white cells of the blood — 
the so-called leucocytes or, as he calls them, the 
phagocytes or eating cells, the natural protectors 
of the body — is to diminish their power of resistance 
against the attacks of the unfriendly microbes of in- 
fectious diseases. The function of the white cells is 
to weaken and destroy these disease germs. Like 
soldiers, they rush to the front in cases of inflamma- 
tion and fight the enemies of the body. They eat 
them up. Thus they are our friends, and alcohol is 
our enemy, for it weakens their fighting powers; it 
lessens the power of resistance of these minute friends 
that live in the blood. 
Science also calls attention to the deleterious effects 
of alcohol on the brain. It affects for the time being 
the higher brain centers which have to do with self- 
control; also to its bad effects on the nervous system, 
as well as to its ill effects in weakening our powers of 
endurance of heat and cold.: It is, also, either directly 
or indirectly, responsible for nearly one half of the 
cases of insanity that burden the race. 
It is evident from all this that a most serious indict- 
ment can be brought against alcohol in its relation to 
the bodily organism. It makes against its vitality, 
health, and efficiency; it is an enemy of our bodily
-P-A-G-E-46
38 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
life.. It would seem from a hygienic, and therefore 
from a moral, point of view, that not only temperance, 
but abstinence also is a moral obligation. And when 
we add to all this the terrible indictment against 
intemperance that comes from criminology, —an in- 
dictment that makes alcohol responsible for more 
than half of the crimes against society, — it is evident 
that temperance is a virtue that should be taught in 
the schools. There should be no compromise here 
or lack of moral courage on the part of the school. 
Intemperance is a most serious sin against body and 
mind, and a terrible sin against society. Indeed, it 
is an evil of such magnitude against society that to 
bring up a child in the way he should go with refer- 
ence to the virtue of temperance alone would almost 
justify a course in elementary hygiene and morals. 
In regard to the deleterious effects of the use of 
tobacco on the bodily organism, there is such a differ- 
ence of opinion that it is hard to treat the matter with 
accuracy. But while this is true with reference to its 
effects on adults, there seems to be a pretty general 
consensus of opinion on the part of students of hygiene 
in regard to the effect of cigarette smoking on children. 
It is affirmed that the poison of the nicotine in cigar- 
ettes weakens the action of the heart, irritates the 
nerves, and retards physical growth and develop- 
ment. Many school principals make it responsible 
for mental inefficiency, which in many cases leads to
-P-A-G-E-47
THE BODILY LIFE 39 
truancy, and truancy often leads to crime, all of which 
is doubtless due originally to the ill effects of nicotine 
on the body. If this be true, then abstinence with 
reference to cigarette smoking on the part of boys is 
to be taught as a virtue, and the schools have a great 
responsibility here. School principals affirm this to 
be an evil of no small proportion among pupils, — 
to be found in many instances even among children 
of the fourth grade of our schools, and, indeed, some- 
times among those of the third grade. Because of 
its baneful effects upon the bodily life, and its 
general demoralizing influence, it should be seriously 
dealt with in elementary courses in hygiene and 
morals. 
Self-control in the regulation of sexual appetite 
is another essential condition of bodily welfare, which, 
because of its vital relation to morality, calls for 
special consideration in the moral training of children 
and youth. 
A difficult problem confronts us when we deal with 
moral training in its relation to sex. We have only 
recently waked up to the tremendous importance of 
this aspect of moral education. The merging of 
childhood into youth, and of youth into young man- 
hood and womanhood, are in many respects the most 
important periods in the history of a human being, 
and the mental, moral, and spiritual interests involved 
are simply momentous. Psychological and educa-

tional science is now devoting earnest effort to th 
study of the phenomena of adolescence. Profound 
physical and mental changes, fraught with mor 
significance, occur in the life of the inclividual, ani 
their nature and meaning ought to be understood, not 
only by the scientist, but by the teacher, parent, and 
children as well. Appalling ignorance on this sub 
ject has heretofore reigned supreme; amd a fata 
modesty has, as a rule, kept parents amd teaches 
from imparting what knowledge they hawe to childres 
who have a tight to know. Asaresult, maamy childre 
have been seriously injured, and many have bea 
lost bodily, mentally, and morally because of the 
ignorance. What rational excuse can be given fa 
withholding from children that which they haves 
right to kriow because of its vital relation to thet 
total welfare? A modesty that will keep childrs 
ignorant on such a vital subject is not on LY false, bul 
it partakes of moral recreancy. Any One truly aad 
intelligently interested in the moral welfare of soci 
should not oppose a judicious, but frank deali 
with this problem. 
From the standpoint of elementary moral educati 
the problem is, How should this important matter 
sex be dealt with? Nothing is to be gained, but m 
is to be lost, by allowing the boy or girl to rei 
in ignorance concerning the facts of sex comscior 
and their vital significance. It is a prereqquisite of

ignorant or perverted nurse, and in giving information 
as to how to deal with the child’s questions in regard 
to his own origin. Such questions are not infrequently 
asked by children at this time of life. Expert opin- 
ion regards it wise not. to ignore the questions, or to 
give false replies. 
The years from six to twelve are, of course, a much 
more important period in the child’s life. During 
these years we have the immediately preadolescent 
period, as well as the dawn of adolescence. The vi- 
tal importance of these years cannot be exaggerated, 
and they bring a very solemn obligation to those who 
are responsible for children during this period. Sex 
instruction in the immediately preadolescent period. 
should not impart knowledge of relations between 
the sexes. It should concern itself merely with the 
child’s relations to himself, protecting him against 
evil habits that involve a violation of the laws of his 
sexual nature. The ravages of such habits are so 
serious*- that this.duty cannot conscientiously be 
shirked by those responsible for the child’s welfare. 
Warning ought to be given to the child against an 
evil that threatens his bodily, mental, and moral 
welfare. Such instruction and warning should not be 
confined to the preadolescent period, but should be

THE BODILY LIFE 43 
repeated in the first years of adolescence, and the 
moral as well as the hygienic restraints should be 
made use of. 
But the important question arises here, By whom 
should such instruction be given? Naturally the 
parent is the person upon whom this obligation rests. 
But we are here confronted by the fact that a large 
majority of parents are not qualified to deal intelli- 
gently with the subject; also by the fact that many, 
whether qualified or not, fail to meet their obligations 
in this respect. Because of this situation, the duty 
falls upon the schools, and they should not fail to 
measure up to their responsibility. 
But how should the schools deal with the problem ? 
Here again they might deal with it through district 
mothers’ meetings, in which mothers might be in- 
structed by competent and sympathetic physicians. 
But such instruction of mothers would not prove 
sufficient. Only a limited number would attend the 
meetings, and many of those who did attend would 
fail to act in accordance with their knowledge. This 
necessitates dealing directly with the boy and girl. 
Either the medical inspector of schools, where there 
is one, or the teacher of biology in schools that em- 
ploy one, should perform this delicate task. In 
schools where neither medical inspector nor teacher 
ef biology are to be found, it would be advisable to 
invite physicians of standing to undertake such in-
-P-A-G-E-52
44 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
_ struction. If this be impossible, then the obligation 
devolves upon the teacher herself. 
But how should such instruction be given? Co- 
education exists in schools. Furthermore, even if 
this were not the case, the question arises whether 
such instruction should be given in public. On the 
whole, private instruction seems to be the best method. 
of handling this important and delicate subject. 
But there should be more formal sex instruction 
during the later years of this period from six to twelve. 
Thig should be given in connection with the course in 
biology. The subject of plant life lends itself ad- 
mirably to this purpose. The recommendations on 
this point, included in the Report previously referred. 
to, are wise, and may be quoted here to advantage : — 
“There should be given, during the years of later child- 
hood, including the remaining years of the ordinary 
elementary school course, a carefully planned series of 
lessons on reproduction in plants as a part of the course 
in nature study. The child should be made to understand. 
the function of root, leaf, flower, and seed; the different 
modes of scattering seeds; the various methods of fertili- 
zation and the necessity of fertilization, and he should be 
led up to the generalization that plant life always springs 
from plant life. 
“Tn like manner a series of lessons on reproduction 
in animal life below mammals should be given, making 
use of familiar animals. The origin of the chick, the 
fish, and the frog from the egg, and the metamorphosis,
-P-A-G-E-53
THE BODILY LIFE 45 
of the frog; the origin of insects and their metamorphoses ; 
and, finally, the necessity for fertilization ;— these might 
form the chief, general topics of such a series of lessons. 
“The aim should be, so far as specific sex instruction is 
concerned, to impress deeply the mind of the child with 
the beautiful and marvelous processes of nature by which 
life is reproduced from life, both in the plant world and 
in the animal world. It is not necessary, and in most 
cases not desirable, that children should make applica- 
tion of this knowledge to reproduction in man before the 
beginning of adolescence further than the human infant 
is developed within the mother. But such instruction on 
reproduction in nature will create the background of kfiowl- 
edge which will afterward invest reproduction in the 
higher animals and in man with a significance and a 
dignity not otherwise attainable; and what is equally 
important, it will create the right emotional attitude to- 
ward human reproduction and prepare the child’s mind 
to appreciate its sacredness,”’ + 
In addition to all this, however, children of this 
period should be put through a kind of regimen. 
They should have opportunities and facilities for 
physical exercise. Supervised play is helpful. It 
not only directly contributes to the bodily efficiency 
of boys and girls, but it acts also as a preventive 
in regard to sex evils. It also shields them from per- 
1 Report of the Special Committee on the Matter and Methods 
of Sex Education, New York, 1912, pp. 6-7. Although this Report 
contains very little that is new it tends to confirm much of the best that 
has been said on the subject. We have in the main followed their 
program with reference to sex education.
-P-A-G-E-54
46 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
verting influences of social surroundings. Prophy- 
laxis in sex hygiene is as desirable as it is in medicine. 
The last two years of elementary education are 
exceedingly important in their bearing on the problem 
of sex education. A large majority of the children 
of our public schools fail to pursue school life beyond 
the eighth grade. Many go into life after their four- 
teenth year as breadwinners. If they are to receive 
systematic instruction in regard to the relation of the 
sexes, it must be given in most instances before they 
leave the schools. And such instruction should be 
given. It is therefore necessary for the schools to 
make provision for it. For here, as in the other aspects 
of sex education, and for the same reasons as stated 
above, we must depend on the schools rather than on 
the home for adequate instruction. Here, again, the 
instruction should be given, if possible, by the teacher 
in biology. Of course, reproduction would constitute 
the chief subject for consideration. The following 
program is suggested by the Special Committee on 
the Matter and Methods of Sex Education : —- 
“During the early adolescent period, approximately from 
the-age of twelve to sixteen, reproduction in plants and 
in animals below the mammal should be more extensively 
studied, and the wonderful variety of modes of fertiliza~ 
tion, especially in plants, be emphasized. It is important 
to make the pupil acquainted with a wide range of facts, 
in order to impress his mind with the wondrous beauty
-P-A-G-E-55
THE BODILY LIFE 47 
of nature’s provision for the perpetuation of life, the aim 
being always ethical as well as scientific and hygienic. 
“With this background of knowledge, reproduction in 
mammals may be taken up. The teaching ought now to 
impress, with many illustrative facts, the generalization 
that animal life comes from the ovum. (The more accurate 
formulation may be left until later.) Fertilization in 
mammals should now be taught, and this should by natu- 
ral steps lead up to reproduction in man. The simplest 
facts in regard to heredity should now be taught, and their 
applications be made to human life. The pupil will then 
be in a position to understand the significance of sexual 
morality, and to be impressed with the dangers to health 
and morals of abnormal sexual habits. Specific instruc- 
tion in regard to sexual morality will now be especially 
effective. 
“As girls mature from a year to a year and a half 
earlier than boys, they should receive such instruction 
somewhat earlier, and emphasis should be laid upon in- 
struction in regard to the special care of their health 
at the change of life called puberty.” ! 
A difficulty, however, presents itself here that the 
Report of the Committee referred to above does not 
explicitly deal with, so far as it relates to the last years 
of elementary education. Attention has been called 
to the fact that a large majority of boys and girls 
leave our public schools after they have finished their 
work in the grammar grades. These adolescents should 
1 Report of the Special Committee on the Matter and Methods of 
Sex Education, pp. 7-8,
-P-A-G-E-56
48 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
receive adequate instruction in regard to the nature 
and dangers of venereal diseases. This matter is so 
important that instruction cannot be postponed to later 
years. Who will furnish instruction to the majority 
of our pupils who leave the schools between the ages. 
of fourteen and sixteen? Were the large majority 
of public school children to continue their education 
through the high schools instead of dropping out 
after completing their elementary course, considera- 
tion of this aspect of sexual relations might be safely 
and profitably postponed as belonging more properly 
to secondary education. But the situation being 
what it is, we must reckon with the majority who 
leave the schools at the close of the elementary period 
Hence, just as in the preadolescent years we prepare 
the child for the adolescent period, so here, though it 
may seem rather early to some, we are under obliga- 
tion to prepare the pupils of the grades for the im— 
portant years that follow. And the instruction should, 
be most impressive. It should serve as a powerful, 
restraining influence in the future life of the pupil. 
In many instances the instruction in the class in 
biology might be supplemented by several talks by 
a conscientious and tactful physician. His voice 
on the pathology of sex would probably carry with 
it the weight of professional authority. This would 
be more likely to impress boys and girls than the 
authority of the teacher of biology, because the
-P-A-G-E-57
THE BODILY LIFE . 49 
physician is constantly dealing in a practical way with 
disease. Of course, a female physician should be 
invited to give such instruction and warning to girls, 
and a male physician to boys. 
The foregoing views are not in accord with those 
advocated by a recent writer on the sex problem. 
Dr. Foerster, of the University of Zurich, still advo- 
cates the old plan of reticence on this subject. He 
would trust to the development of a kind of spiritual 
mastery in the boy and girl that will enable them to 
“keep the body under” when adolescence dawns, 
and as it progresses. This spiritual mastery is to be 
attained through a “species of will-gymnastics.” 
He says :— 
“The outstanding feature of sexual education should 
not be an explanation of the sex functions, but an intro- 
duction to the inexhaustible power of the human spirit 
and its capacity for dominating the animal nature and 
controlling its demands. 
“When young people have‘learned to appreciate the 
joy of such spiritual mastery, they have attained the 
highest possible immunity from sexual temptations. I 
have often found pleasure in telling boys entering their 
teens the story of Achilles — how his mother brought him 
up among girls, dressed as a girl, so that he might not 
have to go to Troy with the other Greek youths; but 
Ulysses had the war trumpet blown before the palace 
gates, when the maidens all fled terrified at the noise, 
while the young Achilles immediately felt for his sword. 
In the same manner, a boy of character will not show 
B

himself a coward when the animal impulses first make 
themselves felt, but will at once take to arms and realize 
that an opportunity has been given him to prove and 
perfect his courage. 
“Young people are practically never deaf tosuch an 
appeal. They are more than ready to receive Nietzsche’s 
words: ‘Do not cast aside the heroic in thy soul!’ 
“Tn addition, I should like to say that this species of 
will-gymnastics seems to me to be quite as essential in 
the education of girls as in that of boys, and for the 
special reason that in the woman’s case it is necessary to 
work against the tendency towards a life of one-sided 
emotionalism. It is only by a training of the will that a 
real education of the emotional life can be accomplished . 
Regular practice in the controlling of bodily conditions 
and outward distractions prepares the way for a mastery 
of the emotions and for their noblest development; it 
enables them to become independent of external circurm- 
stances, of whims and moods, and to acquire concentra— 
tion, force, and endurance. Such will-training pr 
woman from the dangers which arise from he: 
siveness and suggestibility.” ! 
Much of this is true. But an essential par: 
development of such spiritual mastery in th 
is knowledge of himself. If he be informed 
nature of the sex functions, and of the consei..-++--~~- 
of their abuse, he will be more able to deve 
better prepared to exercise, that spiritual 
which is so desirable and so necessary.

Booth, N. Y., 1912, Pp. 177-178, -
-P-A-G-E-59
THE BODILY LIFE 5r 
To all this biological and hygienic instruction must 
be added the moral restraints as well. The scientific 
instruction prepares the way for an impressive moral 
lesson. It is well to call attention to the duty of 
raising the bodily organism to the highest point of 
efficiency as it conditions all other efficiency, — men- 
tal, social, esthetic, moral, and religious. He who 
violates the laws of his bodily organism sins not 
only against his bodily nature, but against his whole 
being, as, by so doing, he reduces its total efficiency. 
Again, the individual must be made to realize that 
\he does not live unto himself alone — that he is re- 
sponsible to others for the use of his energies. Weak- 
ness on his part entails weakness on the part of others 
who may be his offspring. The moral aspects of the 
case ought to be especially brought out with pupils 
of the eighth grade. They are then old enough to 
profit by it. In all this the direct method must, on 
the whole, be used. It may be greatly supplemented 
by the use of the indirect method when we reach 
secondary moral education. 
In concluding these chapters on the bodily life, 
let us recall that cleanliness, self-control and pru-” 
dence in the regulation of all the bodily appetites, 
and in our breathing and sleeping ; also exercise, phys- 
ical courage, and temperance — these are the virtues 
relating to the bodily life that we should teach children 
both in the home and in the school. And we should
-P-A-G-E-60
52 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
guard them against their opposites, — the corre- 
sponding vices. This should be done, not merely 
incidentally, as occasion arises, but systematically. 
A careful study of their relation to different periods 
of the child’s growth and unfolding should be made, 
and then, by systematic culture, we should seek to 
establish children in these important virtues and to 
teach them to shun the bodily vices. Systematic 
training by the indirect method (except in the in- 
stances mentioned above) is best adapted to meet 
the ends sought by the parent and teacher in this 
respect, and a graded scheme of virtues and vices to 
be dealt with is here suggested (p. 53). 
As a final word let it be said that few parents and 
teachers fully appreciate the vital relationship be- 
tween a wholesome bodily condition and sound morals, 
and, as a consequence, moral culture suffers. As a 
well-known student of education has recently said : 
“We do not begin to utilize the culture of health 
as the basis of morals as we should do, because 
we do not realize that their relation is so intimate as 
at many points to be entirely identical. Body-keep- 
ing with the young can and should be made almost 
a religion; and most of the worst sins and errors of 
youth are in no way more effectively forefended 
than by high ideals and a vigorous cult of personal 
and social hygiene. Indeed, Plato thought he could 
not teach an invalid morals because if he had not

learned the art of body-keeping, still less could he 
discipline his soul.”’? 
It is imperative that we should impress the child 
not only with the importance, but also with the 
dignity and sacredness of the body. In a licentious 
age Paul called the attention of the early Christians 
to the fact that their bodies were the temples of the 
Holy Ghost. This was a superb appeal for a proper 
treatment of the body. But it should not require a 
religious appeal to excite in our minds a conception 
of the dignity and sacredness of the bodily organism. 
Our bodies are the temples of our own ghosts, — 
our own spirits, — and they ought to reflect or sym- 
bolize the highest life of the soul. Beauty and grace 
of spirit are to find expression in beauty and grace 
of body. This doubtless was the thought of Socrates 
when he uttered that wonderful prayer recorded in 
the “ Phadrus,” — ‘Beloved Pan, and all ye other 
gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in the in- 
ward soul, and may the outward and inward man be 
at one.” 
In her efforts to establish pupils in the virtues of 
the bodily life the teacher will find the following stories 
helpful: —

CHAPTER IV 
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 
OF all institutions that have to do with child life 
the school is the one primarily in charge of his intel- 
lectual training. We are intellectual beings, with 
capacities to know, and the school exists chiefly’to 
develop them. Itis the child’s duty to acquire knowl- 
edge. It is a duty that he owes to himself as well as 
to others. According to Professor Adler, the teacher 
can best lead him to a recognition of this duty by 
showing him that knowledge is a means to nearly 
all the ends which men aim at. This, he says, might 
be illustrated first by calling attention to the mere 
material ends of life — how in the effort to provide 
for our most immediate wants, such as those of the 
body, the man of knowledge has the advantage over 
the man of ignorance. He who knows how to do 
things succeeds where he who is ignorant fails. The 
child in the upper grades at least is sufficiently self- 
centered to appreciate that which will prove an ad- 
vantage to himself in the struggle for existence await- 
ing him, hence it is well to emphasize the advantages 
of knowledge and the handicaps of ignorance. 
But gradually the higher interests of the child can 
57
-P-A-G-E-66
58 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
be appealed to— the social interests. Knowledge} 
is a means to social recognition and position. The 
child soon learns that he is not to be merely a bread- 
winner; that other possibilities are open to him by 
virtue of his social nature. As he matures he grows 
sensitive to social appreciation, and he finds that 
knowledge is a-means to social esteem and distinction. 
Ignorance is usually rewarded with contempt, or at 
best with a pity that humiliates its object. Further- 
more, at an age when the child is in the upper grades 
of school, he begins to realize, in a more or less pro- 
nounced manner, some at least of the joys of knowl- 
edge — joys that constitute in themselves a sufficient 
reward for the labor of acquiring it. And, finally, as 
he approaches middle adolescence, when the al- 
truism of his nature is very manifest, the service 
that knowledge will enable him to render to others 
can be used as an appeal to encourage him to serious 
effort in its acquisition! In short, the more the child 
can be made to realize the truth of Bacon’s famous 
maxim : Knowledge is Power — no matter from what 
standpoint we view it —- power which makes in every 
way for the highest self-realization, both of the in- 
dividual and society, the more will he take a moral 
attitude toward its acquisition. 
Tn the acquisition of knowledge certain habits of 
*Compare Adler, ‘‘The Moral Instruction of Children,” York, 1901, pp. 182-184. . . a” New

* THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 59 
will and forms of conduct are necessary for the best 
results. When viewed from the moral standpoint, 
they become virtues. It is the function of the teacher 
of elementary morals to establish the pupil in these 
virtues. ‘To this end she must know what they are, 
something about their nature, and how they can best 
be developed in the child. 
The first virtue which naturally suggests itself is 
industry. Nothing of consequence to the intellectual 
life can be accomplished without this cardinal virtue. 
Systematic application of the child’s intellectual 
powers to attain a knowledge of the subject matter 
with which he is dealing is essential to success. It is 
very important that the teacher should begin in the 
beginning to develop in the child the power of sys- 
tematic and steady application as against sporadic 
effort. And, in doing this, a fundamental law of the 
mind will greatly assist her in her work. This law 
is the law of human interest. This interest must be 
maintained and increased. It must be converted into 
voluntary interest. If we can genuinely interest the 
child in the subject with which we desire him to be 
concerned, industry will follow naturally. This is a 
psychological law which the teacher must recognize, 
and so far as she ignores it her efforts will not prove 
fruitful. To develop such interest it is necessary to 
make the lesson attractive —it must be in some 
manner pleasing. Now if the matter of industry is
-P-A-G-E-68
60 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
to be brought before the child as a moral obligation, 
it should be presented here also in an interesting man- 
ner. The advantages and rewards of industry, and 
the disadvantages and penalties of indolence, as men- 
tioned above, should be brought to his attention in a 
manner that will appeal to the child, and what better 
method can we adopt than the story method? Every 
child delights in stories of achievement, and to read 
or tell stories of rewarded labor and of punished in- 
dolence on the part of children, will not fail to interest. 
them and to lead them to practice this prime virtue 
of the intellectual life. 
A second important virtue of the intellectual life 
agguracy. Accurate perception, accurate memo- 
‘rizing, accurate thinking, accurate reasoning, and ac- 
curate speaking are necessary for the best intellectual 
development. If one of the ends of such develop- 
ment is knowledge of the truth, such accuracy, of 
course, is an essential condition. This matter should. 
be made, as far as possible, not merely an intellectual 
obligation with the pupil, but a moral obligation as 
well. Itisa matter of honesty with himself and honesty 
with others — hence it is not a matter of moral indif- 
ference. Indeed the teacher will find that a training 
of the child in intellectual accuracy, or an indulgence 
of the child in intellectual inaccuracy, will have an 
important influence on his moral nature. Intellec. 
tual accuracy is closely related to truthfulness and is 
age OTT
-P-A-G-E-69
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 61 
honesty; and intellectual inaccuracy is closely re- 
lated to falsehood and dishonesty. 
But how shall this virtue of accuracy be cultivated ? 
The teacher should call attention to the serious con- 
sequences of inaccuracy by having the class read some 
story of real life, such as the wreck of a railroad train, 
with its loss of life, due to the inaccuracy of the man 
who framed the time schedule, or to the inaccuracy 
of a telegraph operator, or of a train dispatcher. 
Or, a story involving serious loss in financial matters, 
due to inaccurate calculation, may be used. Or, to 
bring the subject a little closer home to the pupil — 
especially the very young pupil — a story of the loss 
of a school prize because of inaccurate work. The 
rewards and honors of accuracy must be emphasized 
in similar manner. In the upper grades the impor- 
tance of accuracy should be especially dwelt upon; 
for, since the large majority of pupils enter upon 
their vocational life after leaving the elementary 
schools, the significance of intellectual accuracy in all 
industrial and commercial life can be presented at 
this time with excellent effect. The primary aim of 
intellectual development is the acquisition of knowl- 
edge, and inaccurate knowledge is a paradox — it 
is not knowledge at all—it makes against knowl- 
edge. Error is the result of inaccuracy, and error 
is a serious intellectual evil which is often closely re- 
lated to moral evil. ,
-P-A-G-E-70
62 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
4+ 
In dealing with inaccuracy the teacher will find 
that it is often due to another evil, namely, careless- 
ness. In some respects, indeed, it is a form of care- 
lessness. Such carelessness easily becomes habitual 
and should be vigorously taken in hand by the 
teacher. It should be corrected, not merely as an 
intellectual expediency, but as a moral obligation as 
well. 
Thoroughness, though closely related to accuracy, 
differs from it. One may be accurate as far as he 
pursues a subject and yet not be thorough in dealing 
with it. Thoroughness leads to mastery of a subject, 
and of course is a prime virtue of the intellectual life. 
The child should be taught to master the lesson as- 
signed him. If he be once convinced that knowledge 
is power, as explained above, it is easy to show him 
that thorough knowledge is still greater power; it 
will be easiet to lead him to an appreciation of the 
moral attitude toward this intellectual quality, and 
he will soon see the value and obligation of thorough- 
ness as a virtue, and the evil consequences of its op- 
posite. According to the old adage: “What is 
worth doing at all is worth doing well;” and if the 
pupil sees the advantage of so doing, and the dis- 
advantages of the opposite, the teacher’s task in cul- 
tivating this virtue in her pupil will be greatly light- 
ened. Well-selected stories will assist her greatly 
- in accomplishing this end. aay
-P-A-G-E-71
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 63 
Perseverance is another requisite in the intellectual 
life. The child is often easily discouraged. Fre- 
quently the task is hard, or it is more or less unpleas- 
ant, and it requires persistent effort to accomplish it. 
To develop in the child a spirit of perseverance is 
part of the work of the teacher of elementary morals. 
To strengthen the child’s resolution to conquer dif- 
ficulties —- to overcome obstacles —.this is part of ‘her / 
office. The child should be encouraged to persist by 
calling his attention to the delights of triumph, the 
glory of victory, the rewards of success. ‘‘To the 
persevering mortal the blessed Immortals are swift,” 
said Zoroaster. But not only do the Immortals 
honor him, but mortals also bestow on him their ap- 
proval and esteem. These are among the sweetest 
tewards of perseverance, and the child will be in- 
fluenced by them. The moral aspects of perseverance 
will soon be perceived by him under such circum- 
stances. Splendid examples of men, women, and 
children who have succeeded through perseverance — 
not only in the intellectual, but also in other spheres 
of human activity — are available for the develop- 
ment of this virtue in the child. 
Latience is necessary for persistence as well as for 
the Tealization of other intellectual virtues. Michael 
Angelo once said that genius is infinite capacity for 
taking pains. Some capacity for taking pains is 
necessary for any genuine intellectual work, and this _
-P-A-G-E-72
64 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
means that we must have patience. In the child’s 
desire to realize immediate results he often grows 
impatient. He doesn’t like to bother with the means, 
time, and effort necessary to accomplish his task. 
A short cut is his preference. But a short cut to the 
goal is often impossible, and the child must be devel- 
oped in patience with slow progress and in dealing 
with hard and sometimes not altogether agreeable 
tasks. Here again, in endeavoring to cultivate a moral 
attitude toward this important requisite in the in- 
tellectual life, the teacher must have due regard to 
the child’s interests. If she can pleasantly relate 
this virtue to the child’s work by pointing out its 
bearings on the interests which he highly prizes, and 
the interests which, in his further development, he 
will prize still more, then the child will respond 
more readily to the demands for patience which his 
immediate work makes upon him. 
Rrretance will be recognized at once by the 
te: ‘as another virtue of paramount importance in 
developing the intellectual life of the child. Child- 
hood is a period of dependence, and from birth, for 
many years, the child is largely dependent upon others 
for much that concerns his fundamental interests. 
This develops a tendency to rely upon others in mat- 
ters in which he is capable of helping himself. It is 
not to be wondered at, therefore, that in the difficulties 
which he encounters in school in his efforts at self-
-P-A-G-E-73
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 65 
development, under the guidance of the teacher, when 
he confronts a difficult task that he should resort 
to the teacher, or to his more proficient schoolmates, 
for help. This tendency is so marked and wide- 
spread among children that its correction becomes a 
serious problem. No child should be allowed to go 
through school constantly leaning on others for sup- 
port. If there be no other way of curing him of his 
dependence, he should be shamed out of it if possible. 
Self-reliance is such a necessary virtue that the teacher 
can afford to put forth special effort to cultivate it 
in the child. We can largely measure the individual’s 
success or failure in every walk in life by means of 
this virtue. ‘Welcome evermore to gods and men 
is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung 
wide. Him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all 
eyes follow with desire.” These words of Emerson 
are really not extravagant, and the teacher in teach- 
ing the child to form the habit of self-reliance should 
show to him that they are true. Especially in the 
upper grades such a presentation of the virtue as 
illustrated in the lives of self-reliant men and women, 
not only in intellectual pursuits, but in others also, 
cannot fail to have a salutary effect. Short bio- - 
graphical sketches of self-reliant men will prove very 
effective in dealing with this virtue. 
Lge.of truth is a virtue that ought to be developed 
in all, but it pertains more especially to more mature 
; oF 
}
-P-A-G-E-74
66 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
years than to those with which we are dealing. How- 
ever, even here, and especially in the upper grades, it 
might be fittingly dealt with. Children are partisans 
and dogmatists. Their partisanship is strong, and 
their dogmatism instinctive and naive. Attention 
should be called to the dangers to our intellectual 
life of prejudice and unwarranted assumption. It 
can be shown how this frequently leads us into error, 
which of course is opposed to one of the chief ends 
we aim at in intellectual development, namely, the 
knowledge of the truth. Prejudice, even in the child, 
is often so subtle that it is not an easy vice to deal 
with, but the fact that it exists more or less in all 
should not be overlooked, and it is well for the teacher 
to treat of it, not merely as an intellectual fault, but 
also as a moral fault — a vice. 
But finally, knowledge is not an end in itself, — 
it is a means to an end, — and the ultimate end is 
the highest well-being of the individual and society. 
So that another virtue belongs to the intellectual life, 
and that virtue is wisdom. Wisdom is the right use 
of knowledge — such as will make for the realization 
of the highest good. It is not the gift of the gods, but, 
like other virtues, it is an acquisition —a develop- 
ment. It is the result of reflection and discipline. 
We don’t look for much wisdom in the child, for he 
naturally acts with reference to immediate rather than 
ultimate ends. So that wisdom is preéminently a
-P-A-G-E-75
THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE 67 
virtue of maturer years, and, in its stricter meaning, 
can hardly be dealt with except in the upper grades. 
But we can at least teach the child that knowledge is: 
power to be used for worthy ends — for such good 
endsas pertain to the bodily, social, moral, and spiritual 
welfare of himself and society, and in doing this we 
must, of course, represent these ends in the most 
concrete manner possible, and in accordance with in- 
terests as they bear on his life at the particular period 
with which we are dealing. Examples of wise and 
foolish action should be used in dealing with this vir- 
tue and its opposite.

CHAPTER V 
THE SOCIAL LIFE (THE FAMILY) 
WE are by nature social beings, and, as such, 
we sustain a variety of relations to others constituted 
like ourselves. We are not like the famous Crusoe, 
‘alone on an island, working out our destiny regardless 
of our fellows. We are born into society, and from 
birth till death we are hemmed in by a network of 
social relations. All these relations come under the . 
moral ideal, and are subject ‘to moral law. Hence, © 
duties in the social sphere are as manifold and com- 
plex as social relations themselves. It is in this 
sphere that we find our largest field of moral activity. 
Certain institutions are the outgrowth of our social 
nature, such as the family, the school, and the com- 
munity organized under custom and law. We realize 
our largest life and our best self through these institu- 
tions. With one or more we are in constant inter- 
action, and these interactions are governed by moral 
law. They involve moral obligations. In other 
words, duty is associated with all our family, school, 
and community life. 
In treating of morals in the social sphere. it is well 
7t
-P-A-G-E-80
72 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
to follow the natural order. The child is born into 
the family, and his first interactions are with father 
and mother, with sister and brother. Certain moral 
obligations grow out of these relations, the observance 
of which is absolutely necessary for the best develop- 
ment of the family as well as for the best development 
of the individual, such as obedience, truthfulness, 
honesty, courtesy, love, etc. Indeed, the famtily 
could not exist at all without realizing, to some degree 
at least, these obligations. The corresponding vices 
make for its destruction. 
The family is a great moral institution, and its value 
for the idealization or moralization of society cannot 
be overestimated. It is here that the individual learns 
his first moral lessons, and is thus prepared for the 
larger social and moral life of the school, the commu- 
nity, and the state. Itis here, for example, that he 
first becomes conscious of the existence of laws that 
govern human action, and is counseled and warned 
to conform to them. For a time the parents’ com- 
mand is law to his will. He learns the lesson of 
obedience, and when he emerges from the family 
into the community, he is in a measure prepared to 
obey the commands of the community which come to 
him in the form of conventions and customs, and 
also those of the state, which come to him in the form 
of statutes or laws. And as obedience to his parents’ 
command gradually takes on more and more of a
-P-A-G-E-81
THE SOCIAL LIFE 3 
moral character, the way is prepared for the child’s 
recognition of obedience to social custom and to civil 
and political laws, not merely as a matter of compul- 
sion or necessity, but as a matter of moral obligation. 
And what is true of the obligation of obedience is 
practically true of all other social obligations. The 
child’s moral relations to the family prepare him for 
his moral relations to society. 
One of the fundamental virtues belonging to the 
first class is obedience. The parent is both the natural 
and legal guardian of the child. As such he is re- 
sponsible for its well-being. To this end his will be- 
comes law to the child, and it is the child’s duty to 
obey. It is unfortunate that, in the imperfect state 
of society, the parents’ will is, in so many instances, 
unworthy. Still, until the child reaches a certain age 
and a certain state of maturity, it is, on the whole, 
his duty to obey. This age and state hardly occurs 
within the age limits of the elementary school grades. 
Hence this virtue may be categorically affirmed in 
dealing with children. It is absolutely essential 
to the existence of the home. There could be no 
home without it. More or less unity and harmony 
are necessary to constitute a home. This means that 
law must prevail, and the law is the parents’ will. 
Disobedience to it means lawlessness, and gross and 
constant disobedience means social chaos or anarchy 
within the precincts of the home. Such filial obe-
-P-A-G-E-82
74 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
dience is an important factor in the child’s moral un- 
folding. It develops self-control, a most essential 
virtue, as we have already seen in considering the 
moralization of the bodily life, and the more worthy 
the parents’ commands, the sooner is obedience fol- 
lowed by respect and reverence for the law and the 
lawgiver, respect that is highly desirable, and the 
development of which should become one of the ends 
aimed at by parent and teacher. Furthermore, as 
already observed, a training in family obedience pre- 
pares the child for a larger and most vital obedience 
in his interaction with the school, community, and 
state. It makes for good citizenship—for the 
practice and love of social order. So also does it pre- 
pare the way for that period of development in youth 
when the individual awakens to the consciousness that 
he is a lawgiver unto himself — when, in the maturer 
exercise of his functions as a moral personality, he 
evaluates ideals of conduct, imposes them upon him- 
self as laws to his will. In dealing with the morality 
of the family in elementary moral training, then, 
filial obedience is a virtue that requires special con- 
sideration. 
It ought not to be such a difficult matter to secure 
dbedience on the part of the child as it sometimes 
proves. By virtue of his race connection the child is 
predisposed.to obey. As far back as we can trace 
the history of man he has existed under some form
-P-A-G-E-83
THE SOCIAL LIFE 15 
of organized life, which means that he has been subject 
to command or law. The child has this background 
of the race as a kind of inheritance, and therefore 
he comes into being with a predisposition to obey. 
Referring to Dr. Montessori, Dorothy Canfield 
Fisher says : — 
“She tells us just as forcibly that the children prefer 
right, orderly, disciplined behavior to the unregulated 
disobedience which we slanderously insist is their natural 
taste. As a result of her scientific and unbiased obser- 
vation of child life she informs us that our usual lack of- 
success in handling the problems of obedience comes be- 
cause, while we do not expect a child at two or three or 
even four to have mastered completely even the elements 
of any other of his activities, we do expect him to have 
mastered all the complex muscular, nervous, mental, 
and moral elements involved in the act of obedience to 
a command from outside his own individuality. 
“She points out that obedience is evidently a deep-rooted 
instinct in human nature, since society is founded on 
obedience. Indeed, on the whole, history seems to show 
that the average human being has altogether too much 
native instinct to obey any one who will shout out a com- 
mand; and that the advance from one bad form of govern- 
ment to another only slightly better is so slow because 
the mass of grown men are too much given to obeying 
almost any positive order issued to them. Going back 
to our surprised recognition of the child as an inheritor of 
human nature in its entirety,we must admit that obedience 
is almost certainly an instinct latent in children. 
“The obvious theoretic deduction from this reasoning is,
-P-A-G-E-84
76 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
that we need neither persuade nor force a child to obey, 
but only clear-sightedly remove the various moral and 
physical obstructions which lie in the way of his obedience 
with the confident expectation that his latent instinct will 
develop spontaneously in the new and favorable condi-\ 
tions.” 1 
Another fundamental virtue of family life is truth- 
fulness. No family could exist on the basis of a lie. 
Truth is necessary to hold human society together. 
in any kind of relation that is worth while. Truth 
in speech, truth in action, “truth in the inward parts,” 
—— these must be devéloped in the child, and this is no 
easy task. It is often difficult to determine what is 
really a lie in the child’s conduct. Our moral train- 
ing ought to rest upon a careful study of the psy- 
chology of children’s lies. The teacher should study 
the psychology of fancy as it functions in the child; 
of illusions, of make-believe, or the tendency to 
dramatic action so characteristic of children. This 
will at least save her from what is too often a severe 
and unjust judgment in regard to the child. She 
should also carefully consider the pathology of lying, 
which will increase our charitableness. But after we 
have made all allowance for what may not really be 
1 Fisher, “A Montessori Mother.” New York, 1912, pp. 159, 160. 
2 The teacher should read the remarks on children’s lies in Sully’s 
“Studies in Childhood,” New York, 1890, p. 251f., and in Hall’s 
“ Educational Problems,” Vol. I, Chapter VI, and the literature to 
which they refer.
-P-A-G-E-85
THE SOCIAL LIFE 77 
regarded as lying, children do lie in a really ethical 
sense, and often with amazing ease and unconcern. 
So that the matter of truth telling, which is so vital 
to the peace and happiness of the family, should be 
tactfully but vigorously dealt with. 
The subject of truthfulness will be more fully dis- 
cussed in the chapters dealing with the morals of the 
school and the community. So far as the teacher 
deals with this virtue as it relates to the family, she 
cannot be too careful. The best method here is the 
indirect method. Let the children read stories of 
family, life, which bring out the rewards of truthful- 
ness afid the penalties of lying, and let the teacher 
be sure that every child thoroughly apprehends the 
import of such stories. She should also try to 
strengthen the impression made by narrating one or 
more stories of a character similar to those read in 
the class. 
Honesty is a third virtue which relates to the moral 
life of the family. It is closely related to truthful- 
ness, and much that has been said about the one ap- 
plies equally to the other. Of its importance as a 
-social virtue, and of dishonesty as a social vice, we 
can speak to better advantage in dealing with them 
in connection with the virtues and vices of the school, 
and especially of the community, for here they as- 
sume much larger, and, in a sense, more significant 
proportions. Still in a course in elementary morals
-P-A-G-E-86
78 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
they should be duly emphasized in their relation to 
family life. 
Helpfulness in the family is another virtue in which 
children need to be established. Some one has said 
that we are all as lazy as we dare to be. The major- 
ity of us would hardly admit this statement to be 
true. But it is hardly a libel on child nature to say 
that the average child is disposed to be lazy with 
reference to helping in home work. During his 
earliest years so much is done for him, and so much of 
the general housework is done by others, that, when 
a little later he is called upon to share in it, it is more 
or less irksome to him. Furthermore, play is so 
instinctive and enjoyable in childhood that work, 
which interferes with play, is usually not relished 
very much. But a child ought to be taught to be 
helpful in the home, to make his contribution, be it 
ever so modest, to the household work. This is a 
very important matter in the homes of the poor, where 
the child can often be of great service to the mother. 
It is well to cultivate in all children, rich and poor 
alike, the spirit of service. Such a spirit is ethical 
through and through. That this is possible, even 
among very young children, has been demonstrated 
in the Casa dei Bambini of Montessori. In these 
“Flouses of Childhood, it is really quite remarkable 
how the spirit of real helpfulness is developed in the 
child, and there is no reason why this spirit should not

be active in the home. Mrs. Fisher, who made a 
special study of the ““Houses of Childhood,” says : — 
“The children have the responsibility not only for their 
own persons, but for the care of their Home. They 
arrive early in the morning and betake themselves at once 
to the small washstands with pitchers and bowls of just 
the size convenient for them to handle. Here they make 
as complete a morning toilet as any one could wish, washing 
their faces, necks, hands, and ears (and behind the ears !), 
brushing their teeth, making manful efforts to comb their 
hair, cleaning their finger nails with scrupulous care, and 
helping each other with fraternal sympathy. It is as- 
tonishing (for any one who had the illusion that she knew 
child nature) to note the contrast between the vivid 
purposeful attention they bestow on all these processes 
when they are allowed to do them for themselves, and the 
bored, indifferent impatience we all know so well when it 
is our adult hands which are doing all the work. The big 
ones (of five and six) help the little ones, who, eager to 
be “big ones” in their turn, struggled to learn as quickly 
as possible how to do things for themselves. 
“After the morning toilet of the children is finished, 
it is the turn of the schoolroom. The fresh-faced, shin- 
ing-eyed children scatter about the big room, with 
tiny brushes and dustpans, and little brooms. They 
attack the corners where dust lurks, they dust off all the 
furniture with soft cloths, they water the plants, they 
pick up any litter which may have accumulated, they learn 
the habit of really examining a room to see if it is in order 
or not. One natural result of this daily training in close 
observation of a room is a much greater care in the useof _, 
it during the day, a result the importance of which can °

be certified by any mother who has to pick up after a family 
of small children.” ! 
Courtesy, or good manners, is a virtue of which we 
shall have more to say in connection with the virtues 
of the school and of the community. But it is a 
virtue which eminently belongs to the home. It is 
not only an esthetic imperative, but a moral com- 
mand as well. In its highest form it is an expression 
of the moral spirit — it is a manifestation of our good 
will in what we deem to be proper or fit conduct. 
And where should such conduct prevail more than in 
the home? Who is more worthy of the child’s 
courtesy than father and mother, or brother and 
sister? Our family relations should be cast in fitting 
mold. The moralizing effect of good manners in 
the home is not appreciated enough. Parents are 
not fully alive to their ethical value, and often the 
task of training the child in courtesy as it should pre- 
vail in the home devolves upon the school. Boorish- 
ness and vulgarity are closely allied to evil: Gentle 
manners and refinement are intimately related to 
good. Elementary moral education should reckon 
with this fact, and should make provision for training 
the child in courtesy and gentility in the home. This 
can be done largely in connection with the manners 
which he is called upon to practice in the schoolroom, 
as well as by lessons in story literature which tell of 
* Fisher, “ A Montessori Mother,” New York, 1912, pp. 34-35-
-P-A-G-E-89
THE SOCIAL LIFE 81 
polite and impolite children. More or less direct 
instruction is desirable here. For example, the meal 
is such a valuable social institution that it ought to - 
be refined and moralized as much as possible. Good 
table manners ought to be taught in the school, for 
in so many homes the children do not become ac- 
quainted with prevailing etiquette as it bears on this 
matter. To familiarize them with such a code re- 
quires more or less of the direct method. The meal 
can be made a great moral factor in the life of the 
home, and anything that tends to refine it makes for 
the moral welfare of the family. The teacher should 
not overlook the importance of the etiquette of the 
home and of establishing the pupil in the virtue of 
courtesy and in the practice of gentle manners. 
Another splendid virtue that ought to be developed 
in the child in his relation to the home is gratitude. 
Especially in his relation to his parents is this virtue 
to be exercised. He owes so much to them for their 
kindness and care — for the general providence which 
they exercise over his life — that gratitude is one of 
the preéminent moral obligations in the child’s more 
mature life. In the earlier years of childhood the 
child accepts all of this care and kindness as a matter 
of course, but gradually he can be made to appreciate 
the sacrifice and love\that are involved in much of 
it, and grateful feelings can be awakened. There is 
great need of cultivating filial gratitude; for, in many 
G

cases, the heartless inappreciation of children in the 
face of great love and sacrifice on the part of parents 
makes the soul sick. Ingratitude is a base vice, and 
it seems especially base in the relations of children to 
father and mother. 
Love for parents of course is natural to children, 
but, as natural, it is nonmoral. When it represents 
an attitude of will, it becomes moral. In develop- 
ing the child in all the virtues of the home the teacher 
is really developing the child in filial love. True love 
is the crowning grace and virtue of the soul in all 
forms of social life, and nowhere should it abound 
more than in the home. By virtue of the child’s 
peculiar relation to his parents he is under special 
obligations to love them, and the same thing is true 
with reference to his relation to brother and sister. 
As love is “the greatest thing in the world,” so is it 
the greatest thing in the family. \ It makes for all of 
the other virtues. It leads to “willing obedience ; to 
truthfulness, for it “‘rejoiceth in the truth”; to hon- 
esty, for “it seeketh not its own”; to sympathy and 
helpfulness: “It suffereth long and is kind”; it 
bears all things and endures all things. “Love never 
faileth.”’ And all this is exceedingly necessary in the 
family. When love abounds in the family, there is 
unity, harmony, and moral progress. It recognizes 
the mutuality of interests, and all labor toward a com- 
mon end. Hence anything that can be done by the
-P-A-G-E-91
THE SOCIAL LIFE 83 
teacher to promote love in the home by establishing 
the child in this supreme virtue represents a decided 
moral gain, and its influence extends far beyond the 
immediate boundaries of the home. Here again the 
story method will be found most effective. In con- 
nection with the helpful reading lesson in morals there 
are many beautiful stories of home life of which the 
teacher may avail herself to bring this virtue before 
the pupil. The teacher should familiarize herself 
with such literature. 
Another virtue relating to the family is loyalty. 
Professor Royce seems to regard loyalty as com- 
prehending the whole life of morals.1_ Whether this 
be so or not, loyalty is certainly a cardinal virtue, and 
loyalty to the best life of the family and to its highest 
ideals is an important moral obligation. To be true 
‘to those who love us most, to be mindful of their 
interests, and to guard their honor — to do all this is 
to live a wholesome moral life. The boys and girls 
who possess this virtue of loyalty to the home have 
a great safeguard against the evil of the world when 
other safeguards give way. It often serves as a check 
to temptation. They will often think twice before 
doing a thing that they feel sure would. bring discredit 
or disgrace upon the family. A keen sense of family 
honor is a good thing, and the teacher should aim to 
establish the child in this virtue. Especially should

84 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
this virtue be brought impressively to their atten~ 
tion in the upper grades of the elementary schools, 
just before many children enter upon their voca- 
tional course. 
In teaching the morals of the home, then, obedience, 
respect, truthfulness, honesty, courtesy, helpfulness, 
gratitude, love, loyalty, and their corresponding vices 
should be dealt with. These virtues make the home 
the most blessed place on earth —a place of peace 
and joy —.a place of sweetest and purest fellowship. 
The school can do much to moralize the home, and the 
teacher who labors toward this end will have as her 
reward the consciousness that she has done something 
to idealize one of the most vital and sacred institutions 
of the race. 
In our efforts to establish children in the virtues of 
the family the following graded scheme (pp. 86-87) 
is recommended for adoption.

life the following stories will be found helpful : —

CHAPTER VI 
THE SOCIAL LIFE (THE SCHOOL) 
Tue child soon emerges from the family into another 
social circle —- the school. Here, as in the family, he 
interacts with beings constituted like himself, and 
sustains relations similar to those of the family. 
Hence, many of his moral obligations here are essen- 
tially the same as there, and most of the virtues and 
vices which he exemplifies are also the same. ‘The 
principal difference between the family and the school, 
so far as the moral obligations are concerned, is largely 
a difference of emphasis. Certain duties are em- 
phasized more in the family than in the school, and 
vice versa. There are some duties growing out of the 
natural relations of the child to the parents, and to his 
brothers and sisters, which belong peculiarly to the 
family; and the same may be said of the child in his 
relations to the school. But, on the whole, the same 
fundamental moral obligations obtain in both social 
institutions — the teacher, in a sense, taking the place 
of the parent, and his schoolmates taking the place of 
brothers and sisters. The intellectual virtues, of 
course, must receive special attention in the school, 
89
-P-A-G-E-98
go MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
as it is specially engaged with intellectual function- 
ing. These have already been considered. But the 
school is a social institution, also. It is composed of 
persons constantly interacting in a social way — 
hence the virtues relating to the social life of the 
school must also be considered. The pupil sustains 
special relations to the teacher, as well as the ordinary 
social relations to his fellow pupils. These must be 
moralized. In other words the pupil must not only 
be trained in the virtues and guarded against the 
vices that pertain to his intellectual life, but also in 
those which pertain to his social life in the school. 
As in the family, so in the school, obedience is one 
of the fundamental virtues to receive consideration. 
It is absolutely essential to the life of the school. 
Certain rules and laws are necessary for its existence. 
These rules and laws are the expression of the teacher’s 
will, and of the will of the Board of Education. They 
are made in the interest of all of the pupils, and they 
must be obeyed if these interests are to be properly 
conserved. Social chaos would result if they were 
not enforced. Indeed! one of the marks of an effi- 
cient teacher is the success with which she secures 
obedience to them. But it is better to secure a 
willing than a compulsory or slavish obedience. It 
is better to lead the pupil into a rational appreciation 
of their worth, and to secure conformity to them from 
such motives, rather than through an assertion of mere
-P-A-G-E-99
THE SOCIAL LIFE or 
arbitrary authority. The pupil’s obedience then takes 
on a real moral character, and the moral atmosphere 
of the school becomes more wholesome. This is 
really a very important matter. The attitude of 
many children toward the, eacher is similar to the 
attitude of many people toward the law, and toward    
those who enforce it. It is an attitude of inward 
hostility. The law is the friend of every ‘right-minded 
citizen, and so are they who properly execute it. Laws 
are made, as a rule, in the interests of the common- 
weal, and the more we can lead citizens to realize 
and appreciate this fact, the more willingly and gra- 
ciously do they conform to them, and the result is a 
higher type of citizenship. So it is in the school. 
' The more we can lead the pupil to realize that the 
tules and laws of the school are made for his benefit, 
and that the teacher enforces them simply because 
they are for his interests, the more readily and gra- 
ciously will he submit to them. We develop in this 
way a higher kind of school citizenship. Then the 
teacher’s task becomes easier, and the pupil’s obe- 
dience becomes truly moral. 
Probably the next in importance of the virtues re- 
lating to school life is that of justice. The sense of 
justice is instinctive with man. It is rooted in his 
sense of what belongs to him as a personal being. Any 
violation of this instinct gives rise to a feeling of re- 
sentment or retaliation. Justice calls for ‘‘fair play”
-P-A-G-E-100
92 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
in the interaction of man with man. Hence it lies 
at the foundations of society as organized under govern- 
ment; and since the school is a governing body, its 
tules and laws should duly respect the rights of all its 
members. Every pupil should stand on an equality 
before the school Jaw. There must be no partiality 
either in school legislation or in the application or 
enforcement of school laws. Special privileges to 
particular pupils should not be granted unless it be 
for the purpose of stimulating good work and good 
conduct, and then they are not really special, for such 
privileges are open to all. Impartiality of law and 
its enforcement creates an atmosphere of justice in 
the school which is very potent in the moralization of 
its pupils. 
As has been already observed, the playground 
affords an excellent opportunity to teach justice to 
children in their relations one with another. Fair 
play in sport must be insisted upon. Cheating, 
trickery of all sorts, must be prohibited and punished 
whenever discovered. This makes it eminently de- 
sirable, indeed necessary, that the teacher, or the 
| supervisor of sports, if there be one in the school, 
| should supervise all sports. Clean, wholesome, fair 
play helps to establish the pupil in a virtue that is 
fundamental] to all social life. 
But this virtue should receive attention in the class 
also. In a course in moral training justice as a vir- 
     
                  
-P-A-G-E-101
THE SOCIAL LIFE 93 
tue to be exemplified in the social life of the school 
should be brought to the pupil’s attention as an 
exceedingly important virtue. This may be done 
by reading and telling stories embodying justice as 
it relates to school life. There is sufficient literature 
of this kind, especially as it relates to fair play in 
sport, available, and the teacher will do well to make 
herself familiar with it so that she may be able to 
supplement the lesson of the ethical reader by narrat- 
ing one or more stories of her own selection. The 
rewards and punishments of justice and injustice, as 
these are brought out in stories of fair play and stories 
of injustice and cheating, will surely find a most 
sympathetic response in the minds and hearts of 
children. These rewards and punishments take on 
the form of social approbation and disapprobation 
to which the child is very susceptible. More will be 
said as to the significance of this social virtue when 
we come to the chapters on the community and the 
state; but it is necessary to deal with justice in its 
relation to the smaller community — the smaller 
state — which is the school — both for its own good 
and for the sake of the larger social relations which 
the pupils will sustain later in life. 
Honesty is a virtue that calls for special considera- 
tion as it relates to school life. And it calls for recog- 
nition very early in the pupil’s career, as early indeed 
as the kindergarten period. The distinctions between
-P-A-G-E-102
94 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
meum and tuum are not well known to the very young 
child. Gradually he acquires a knowledge of them 
—often through painful experience. But knowledge 
does not necessarily establish him in virtue, and the 
tendency to appropriate the property of others mani- 
fests itself from time to time. In school he finds him- 
self surrounded with the property of others — much 
of which belongs to the public, and some of it to his 
fellow pupils. For his own good, as well as for the 
good of the school, it is important that he should 
. develop an honest regard for the possessions of others. 
He must not dishonestly appropriate either the prop- 
erty of the school or the property of his schoolmates. 
How strong a temptation the latter may prove will 
depend somewhat on the abundance of others’ pos- 
sessions as compared with his own. The child often 
smarts under a sense of injustice in this respect. He 
can’t understand why another child should have so 
much more than himself when the other child seems 
no more deserving, — not having earned it for him- 
self, —and the temptation to equalize matters comes 
to him. Again, if the favored schoolmate be selfish 
or wngenerous in the use of his own possessions, fail- 
ing to share them, to some extent at least, with his 
fellow pupils, such a lack of generosity may con- 
stitute a temptation to theft on the part of the less 
favored. 
In dealing with the virtue of honesty and the vice
-P-A-G-E-103
THE SOCIAL LIFE 95 
of dishonesty, a good. mode of procedure is to develop 
the sense of ownership in each pupil. Teach him to 
collect things and to add to them by service. That 
which he earns he will prize, and it will, at the same 
time, develop in him an appreciation of ownership 
on the part of others. He will then know that 
another’s possessions cost the owner something and 
will hesitate to steal from him. ‘To own also teaches 
respect for others’ possessions ; and even the greed for 
gain by those who have much rarely prompts theft. 
Stealing is the vice of the ownerless. To have what 
has cost pain, effort, and denial to get, gives a just 
sense of worth and best teaches what real ownership, 
which should always and everywhere represent serv- 
ice, means. Those who have felt the joy of pos- 
sessing the well-earned fruits of toil are least liable 
to rob others of them.” +! Parents should coéperate 
with teachers here. Children’s possessions are orig- 
inally acquired in the home, and were the parents to 
condition their ownership largely upon service, it 
would undoubtedly make for honesty in the child. 
This sense of ownership manifests itself very early 
in the child’s history, and therefore the parent is 
primarily responsible for its moralization. 
But honesty and dishonesty may be dealt with 
also by means of the story method. The rewards 
of the former and the penalties of the latter should be 
1 Hall, “ Educational Problems,” Vol. I, pp. 255-256.
-P-A-G-E-104
96 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
presented to the pupil in stories relating to school 
life. The sense of ownership is so strong in children 
that it is easy, through sympathy, for a school boy or 
girl to put himself or herself in the position of one who 
has suffered from theft, and they are in sympathy 
with the punishment meted out to the thief. The 
same thing is true concerning their sympathy with 
honesty and its rewards — especially when they read 
or are told of an honest act performed by a school boy 
or girl. This is particularly true of children in the 
elementary grades, because the school is their largest 
social circle during these important years. 
The next virtue to be dealt with in its relation to 
- school life is the virtue of truth. As the school, in 
its social life, is, in many respects, a larger family, 
all that has been said of this virtue in its relation to 
the family applies equally to the school. Truth in 
speech, conduct, and spirit is one of the foundation 
stones of the school viewed as a social institution. 
Here let it be stated again that the teacher should ac- 
quaint herself with the psychology of falsehood as it 
manifests itself in children, so that she may be capable 
of forming a correct judgment concerning their ve- 
racity. She will soon discover that all so-called 
“children’s lies” are not really lies. Hall, Compayré, 
Perez, Sully, Stern, and others have given careful 
attention to this matter, and it is evident from their. 
work that in dealing with children’s lies we must take
-P-A-G-E-105

into consideration the child’s instinct to secrete things, 
the dramatic instinct or the desire to play a part, 
which leads to deception, the vivid fancy and im- 
agination of children which leads to illusions and to 
exaggeration, the desire to please, which is so charac- 
teristic of childhood, and which leads to insincerity, 
the apprehension of giving offense, which often re- 
sults in misrepresentation of the facts, etc.,!—~ these 
are things that must be taken into consideration in 
determining our judgments in regard to children’s lies. 
When this is done, our judgments will probably be 
softened. Nevertheless children do lie, and there 
are many opportunities associated with school life 
which afford sufficient temptation. Such tempta- 
tion usually arises in connection with school discipline. 
The school is a governing body, and, as such, it must 
have rules and laws, and penalties for their violation. 
Fear of these penalties impels the disobedient pupil 
to falsify. For example, there is a rule relating to 
punctuality, and a penalty for being late. The pupil 
may have loitered along the way and reported late. 
To avoid punishment he is tempted to frame an excuse 
not in accordance with the facts. So with reference 
to absence from school or unprepared lessons, or there 
may be a violation of rules relative to school property, 
as cutting desks or defacing walls. These things 
usually bring punishment upon the offender, and there

is a temptation to lie to escape it. It is a means of 
self-defense. All lying of this kind should be pun- 
ished, and the pupil should be made an object les- 
son to his schoolmates. Locke, in his celebrated 
“Thoughts Concerning Education,” has made some 
wise remarks on this subject which the teacher might 
ponder over to advantage. They are as apy icgble 
to her as to the parent in dealing with this e x 
“Lying is so ready and cheap a Cover for any Mis: 
carriage, and so much in Fashion among all Sorts of 
People, that a Child can hardly avoid observing the use 
made of it on all Occasions, and so can scarce be kept 
without great Care from getting into it. But it is so ill a 
Quality, and the Mother of so many ill ones that spawn 
from it, and take shelter under it, that a Child should 
be brought up in the greatest Abhorrence of it imaginable. 
It should be always (when occasionally it comes to be- 
mention’d) spoke of before him with the utmost Detesta- 
tion, as a Quality so wholly inconsistent with the Name 
and Character of a Gentleman, that no body of any Credit 
can bear the Imputation of a Lie; a Mark that is judg’d the 
utmost Disgrace, which debases a Man to the lowest 
Degree of a shameful Meanness, and ranks him with the 
most contemptible Part of Mankind and the abhorred 
Rascality ; and is not to be endured in any one who would 
converse with People of Condition, or have any Esteem 
or Reputation in the World. The first Time he is found 
in a Lie, it should rather be wondered at as a monstrous 
Thing in him, than reproved as an ordinary Fault. If 
that keeps him not from relapsing, the next Time he must

be sharply rebuked, and fall into the State of great Dis- 
pleasure of his Father and Mother and all about him who 
take Notice of it. And if this Way work not the Cure, 
you must come to Blows; for after he has been thus 
warned, a premeditated Lie must always be looked upon 
as Obstinacy, and never be permitted to escape un- 
punished. 
“Children, afraid to have their Faults seen in their 
naked Colours, will, like the rest of the Sons of Adam, 
be apt to make Excuses. This is a Fault usually bordering 
upon, and leading to Untruth, and is not to be indulged 
in them; but yet it ought to be cured rather with Shame 
than Roughness. If therefore, when a Child is questioned 
for any Thing, his first Answer be an Excuse, warn him 
soberly to tell the Truth; and then if he persists to shuffle 
it off with a Falsehood, he must be chastised; but if he 
directly confess, you must commend his Ingenuity, and 
pardon the Fault, be it what it will; and pardon it so, that 
you never so much as reproach him with it, or mention 
it to him again: For if you would have him in love with 
Ingenuity, and by a constant Practice make it habitual to 
him, you must take care that it never procure him the 
least Inconvenience; but on the contrary, his own Con- 
fession bringing always with it perfect Impunity, should 
be besides encouraged by some Marks of Approbation. 
If his Excuse be such at any time that you cannot 
prove it to have any Falsehood in it, let it pass for 
true, and be sure not to shew any Suspicion of it. 
Let him keep up his Reputation with you as high as 
is possible; for when once he finds he has lost that, 
you have lost a great, and your best Hold upon him. 
Therefore let him not think he has the Character of a

Liar with you, as long as you can avoid it without flat- 
tering him in it.’’! 
But there is a brighter side to all this. The 
child is more disposed to truth than to false- 
hood, and the teacher should reckon with this 
fact. A high regard for the truth should be cul- 
tivated in the child by pointing out its value and 
its rewards as- these relate to school life, as well as 
to life in general. 
Another point should be noticed here. The 
teacher should be especially on her guard with refer- 
ence to her own conduct in relation to this virtue. 
The child is a realist. He is a literalist. He does 
not make fine distinctions between motiveless actions 
and actions prompted by motives. {If the teacher be 
c t Statement of Tact, it sometimes means 
falsehood to the pupil. Beware of inexact and of 
exaggerated statements. They not only react on 
your own mental life, but often lead to misinter- 
pretation on the part of the pupil. 
Finally, beware of casuistry. It is exceedingly 
unwise to raise questions of this kind as they relate 
to the virtue under consideration. To discuss with 
pupils of the elementary grades the question whether 
a lie is ever justifiable, and if so, under what circum- 
stances, is to weaken the pupil’s regard for the truth. 
  1 Locke, “Some Thoughts concerning Education,” edited by R. M. Quick, Cambridge and London, 1889, pp. 113-115.
-P-A-G-E-109
THE SOCIAL LIFE IO1 
Such questions, if they have a place in moral training 
at all, belong to a later period in the life of the in- 
dividual. The discussion of such questions with 
children of the age represented in the grades is not 
only profitless, but may prove positively harmful. 
Many writers believe that, under some circumstances, 
a lie is justifiable. If the teacher so believes, nothing 
is to be gained by raising the question with children 
and presenting the teacher’s views. The child is not 
mature enough to make the distinctions which are in- 
volved in such a position. One is dealing here with 
a part of the general question of the relativity of 
right and wrong, the consideration of which belongs 
to a much later period in life. 
Another virtue belonging to school life is courtesy. 
In their interactions with the teacher and their 
schoolmates the children ought to be courteous. 
its highest form courtesy is the expression of good 
and, as such, it is preéminently a moral thing. Gentle 
manners are indicative not only of refinement, but 
they represent often a moral attitude. The impor- 
tance of this virtue is not yet sufficiently appreciated, 
and therefore not sufficiently emphasized in our schools. 
In the family, school, or community our social feelings 
manifest themselves in conduct. It is well therefore 
that the child should be taught to give them a fitting 
expression in action, for on such expression depends a 
large proportion of his own happiness and general    
   
-P-A-G-E-110
102 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
     
   well-being, as well as the happiness and general well- 
being of others. 
The school affords excellent opportunities to train 
children in good manners. It is a small community 
in itself, and relations to superiors, equals, and infe- 
riors are to be found here. The teacher has thus an 
opportunity to cultivate good manners on the part of 
children which presents itself to comparatively few, 
and it is especially incumbent upon her since she 
deals with so many children who, because of their 
home surroundings, have not the opportunity for 
much culture of this kind. 
The teacher should herself be acquainted with, and 
practiced in, the code of etiquette that prevails in cul- 
tured society — at least so far as this has to do with 
the more fundamental modes of social interaction, 
so that she will not only be an example to her pupils, 
but will be able to acquaint them with the code and 
practice them in it. Much of this, of course, calls 
for direct instruction and immediate practice in the 
' schools. There should be certain requirements in 
the way of greeting, in question and answer, and in 
showing deference and respect / There ought to be 
morning, Miss Adams,” instead of merely 
“Good morning,” or instead of no greeting at all. 
There ought to be “Yes, Miss Adams,” instead of 
merely “Yes” in answer to a question; or “No, 
Miss Adams,” instead of merely “No.” If the pupil      
                
-P-A-G-E-111
THE SOCIAL LIFE 103 
must pass in front of the teacher, he should be taught 
to ask to be excused for so doing. In other words, 
ere ought to be a well-defined body of social eti- 
quette governing the school, and inasmuch as the 
social relations of pupils to teacher and fellow pupils 
are primarily the same as those which obtain in the 
community at large, the body of etiquette should 
therefore be that which prevails in what is commonly 
called ‘‘good society.” A school that expresses its so- 
cial life in this manner is a morally wholesome school, 
for conduct not only reflects the inner life, but also 
reacts upon it, and good manners cannot help but 
have a moralizing influence upon the spirit of the child. 
o courtesy add kindness. No one will be disposed 
to question such counsel, if for no other reason than 
that school children are often very unkind. This 
may be due at times to lack of imagination, or to 
thoughtlessness, or to a lack of sympathy, or to down- 
right meanness and brutality. But whatever it may 
be due to, it works injury to its object, as well as de- 
moralization in some measure to its author. There 
is a heartlessness manifest sometimes in school 
children that to older people seems almost inhuman... 
At times some at least seem to enjoy teasing others in 
a manner which often approaches torture. Bullying 
is an example of unkindness which borders on bru- 
tality. A big boy taking advantage of his superior 
strength to enforce his will on a smaller boy is not an

    104 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
edifying, although a common, sight. “Making fun 
of” physical defects and of personal peculiarities of 
other children is by no means uncommon among 
children. A kind of snobbishness that excludes cer- 
tain children from certain social groups, and from cer- 
tain sports; or other pleasures, also causes needless 
pain. In these, and in many other ways, unkindness 
is manifest among school children. It mars the social 
life of the school, and, in many instances, causes 
children who are the sufferers not only to lose interest 
in it, but also to regard the school as a place of fear 
and dread, thus handicapping the teacher in her work. 
~The teacher should aim to supplant all this by cul- 
_tivating in_the children..under her care_a-spirit_of 
mutuatkindness:~ With the self-centeredness and self- 
" assertion so characteristic of childhood this is not an 
easy task. But there is a constitutional altruism in 
the child as well as egoism, and this is capable of 
development at a very early age. The teacher should 
take advantage of this fact in her attempts to develop 
the virtue of kindness. 
indness often leads to generosity, and both to 
friendship, although friendship with children is also 
determined by other considerations, such as affinities, 
social position, geographical location, etc. Some of 
these friendships formed at school are among the most 
lasting and most delightful, and all that makes for 
true friendship should be encouraged by the teacher. 
    
-P-A-G-E-113
THE SOCIAL LIFE 105 
All the social virtues and vices of school life should 
be dealt with according to the story method, even 
though in some instances the more formal method 
may be desirable. It is greatly to be regretted that 
among the innumerable children’s stories that flood 
the market so few of them deal with school life. 
Wholesome stories, embodying important moral 
lessons relating to school life, are a desideratum, and 
some successful writer of children’s stories would 
serve not only his or her generation, but future 
generations as well, by providing literature of this 
kind. 
In dealing with the social virtues of the school there 
are certain special lessons that ought, by all means, 
to be emphasized — particularly by the teacher in 
the publie schools. They are: respect for school 
property, school loyalty, gratitude for school privi- 
leges, and an active appreciation of the value of the 
school for the individual and for society. The first 
of these ought to be taught as soon as the pupil enters 
the school, and systematically continued through at 
least the first five grades. The pupil must be made 
to understand that the building he is occupying, the 
books and desks, etc., he is using are not his own. 
They are the property of others who are generously 
allowing him the use of them, and that he is not only 
grossly disrespectful, unjust, and in a sense dishonest, 
but also basely ungrateful when he defaces the school
-P-A-G-E-114
106 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
building, cuts or scratches a desk, and mutilates a 
book. This lesson should be taught him both by the 
direct and indirect methods. It is exceedingly de- 
sirable to develop in the body of pupils a fine spirit 
of school loyalty, which not only takes pride in the 
high grade of its scholarship, and its high standards of 
honor, but which takes pride also in its school build- 
ing and its equipment. If this spirit of loyalty be 
too much to expect from children of the lower 
grades, it is certainly not too much to expect from 
children of the higher grades. And the teachers of 
these grades ought to bend their energies toward 
developing a spirit which not only contributes to 
the moral wholesomeness of the school atmosphere, 
but which serves also as a protection to school 
property. 
The lesson of gratitude for school privileges is a 
lesson that certainly should not be overlooked in the 
moral education of the child. The pupil is a bene- 
ficiary of the community, and he ought to be made to 
understand what that means. So far as his education 
is concerned he is supported by the public, and to the 
public he owes an immense debt —a debt that he 
can never adequately repay. Certainly gratitude is 
small enough recompense for what he receives. Not 
until he becomes a taxpayer does he in any material 
manner make a return for the privileges accorded him. 
So it is well for the teacher to lead him into a grateful
-P-A-G-E-115
THE SOCIAL LIFE 107 
appreciation of the invaluable favors conferred upon 
him by the community. Especially in the upper 
grades — just before many pupils permanently leave 
the school— ought these lessons to be imparted. 
Here, in addition to the moral lesson taught in story 
or biography, the direct method may be used. It 
might be well for the teacher in a more formal and 
direct manner to call the pupil’s attention to the nature 
of this moral obligation, and try to beget in him an 
abiding appreciation of the generosity of the com- 
munity. To learn this lesson will not only make him 
a better individual, but also a better citizen. 
Another lesson that the pupil should learn in this 
connection is the value of the school for the individ- 
ual and for the community. This, indeed, will un- 
doubtedly help in establishing him in the other vir- 
tues relating to the social life of the school. Once 
he is really made to see how the school fits him, not 
only for his life as a breadwinner, but also, in a large 
measure, for exercising in a much better manner the 
functions of his entire complex nature, he will see that 
the school more than anything else, with the possible 
exception of the home, ministers to his personal wel- 
fare. It is one of his best friends. In a similar man- 
ner he can be made to see how the school ministers to 
the welfare of the community. If this be done, when 
he becomes a citizen, the interests of the school are 
likely to be guarded more jealously by him, and this
-P-A-G-E-116
108 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
great institution will become more efficient as a moral 
force in the community life. 
In our endeavor to establish the pupil in the virtues 
of the social life of the school the following graded 
scheme (pp. 110-111) will prove serviceable. 
In conclusion, it should be said, that play affords a 
splendid opportunity to put into practice many of 
the social virtues, and to guard against many of the 
social vices. A wise teacher will take advantage of 
this splendid opportunity to make vital — to clothe 
ith flesh and blood — the important moral lessons 
that she is dealing with in the schoolroom. In the 
class she makes the virtuous or vicious characters live 
in the imagination of the child; but on the playground 
she gives the children an object lesson in actual life. 
f Lessons in the virtues of fairness, kindness, generosity, 
codperation, and the corresponding vices especially 
may be learned from play. A wise teacher will not 
absent herself from the playground, even where a 
supervisor of play is employed. Rather will she 
participate in the play of the children, and make her 
participation a means of inculcating important moral 
lessons, and a means of establishing the children in the 
important virtues that ought to obtain on the play- 
‘ound, and which constitute so large a part of the 
ell-being of the individual and of society.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SOCIAL LIFE (THE COMMUNITY) 
Tus child is also a member of a larger social circle 
than is represented by the family and the school. He 
is a member of the community. As he grows older 
he becomes more and more related to this larger 
society, and his sphere of duty is enlarged. In an 
important sense the relations that he sustains to its 
members are essentially the same as those he sustains 
to the members of the family, and to the members of 
the school, and the moral obligations that grow out of 
these relations are also practically the same. Hence 
the virtues and vices involved in his moral develop- 
ment in his relations to the family and school are those 
which ¢ail for consideration in his relation to the com- 
munity. This being the case, we need not dwell long 
upon them, as they have already been considered 
somewhat at length in both of the chapters relating 
to the family and the school. 
It will doubtless be recalled that the social virtues 
treated) of there were justice, truthfulness, honesty, 
Kindnegs, courtesy, generosity, loyalty, etc. It 
will be! seen on a little reflection that these are the 
| me
-P-A-G-E-121
THE SOCIAL LIFE 113 
virtues that obtain also in the larger society called 
the community, and that the reasons for their practice 
are the same. If, for example, justice is obligatory 
upon the child in the family, and in the school, it is 
likewise obligatory for him to regard the rights of 
others in his relations to the community. Indeed, 
the practice of this virtue becomes all the more im- 
perative because of the larger interests at stake, and 
the child will doubtless find an infringement on the 
rights of others in the community will not be treated 
with the same consideration or leniency that it re- 
ceives sometimes in the family and the school. The 
same may be said of honesty. Its importance for 
society is apparent at once. The community could 
not exist without it, and the child will soon find that 
here, too, the community is more exacting than the 
family and the school. Men and women jealously 
‘guard their own interests, and dishonesty is treated 
with severity. Truthfulness, too, is just as necessary 
in the community as in the family and the school, and 
it is “enforced” by the same sanctions. Society 
can no more exist on the basis of a lie than the family. 
or the school can. Justice, honesty, and truthfulness 
make for the highest well-being of society, and, there- 
fore, for the individual; for, in the final analysis, the 
real good of the individual is coincident with the good 
of society. 
While the same remarks apply to kindness, the

I14 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
teacher may find it necessary to emphasize this virtue 
in the pupil’s relation to society a little more than in 
his relation to the family and to the school. Mem- 
bers of the community are not as close to the child 
as are members of the school. Hence, the child does 
not feel the force of the moral obligation as it relates 
to kindness quite as imperatively as he does in its re- 
lation to those with whom he is more immediately 
associated. This is true, indeed, with reference to all 
of the social virtues whose opposites are not punished 
with severe rebuke or legal punishment, as is, for ex- 
ample, dishonesty. Hence, it would be well for the 
teacher to emphasize the moral obligation of kindness 
a little more when dealing with the child’s relation to 
the community. He ought to be taught to show 
kindness to, and sympathy for, those in pain or ill- 
ness, in sorrow or misfortune. There is so much 
in every community that calls for sympathy and 
kindness that the lesson can be very forcibly brought 
home to every pupil. 
So far as courtesy is concerned, it may be said that 
it is easier to develop the spirit of courtesy and good 
manners in the child in his relations to the family and 
the school than in his relations to society, for reasons 
similar to those mentioned when speaking of kindness. 
The moral imperative seems less binding, because of 
the apparent remoteness of the community relation, 
and this community relation seems still more remote,
-P-A-G-E-123
THE SOCIAL LIFE 11s 
and the moral obligation less urgent, when it concerns 
those whom the child, for some reason or other, re- 
gards as his inferiors—as servants, the poor, strangers, 
and foreigners. The child should be taught the les- 
son that courtesy, as a moral obligation, is universally 
binding; that it is a duty we owe to all persons — 
to the poor, the aged, the infirm, servants, guests, 
strangers, citizens of other lands, etc. It is for the 
child’s own interests, as well as for the interests of 
society, that he should develop the spirit of courtesy 
and that he should manifest this spirit in becoming 
manners. Now the child may have the spirit of 
courtesy, and yet not know how to expressit. There- 
fore, he should be taught those forms of conduct 
which obtain among cultivated people. Society is 
bound together by convention and custom, and the 
child should know what these are. In his interactions 
with society he should know what is the proper thing 
todo. This should be a part of his school training, — 
all the more, as was previously stated, because in 
so many instances he does not receive such training 
at home. He will learn, of course, by practice in the 
schools, what many of these formalities are. But it 
is desirable also that to the actual practice in the 
social code of the schoolroom should be added that 
indirect training which is given in the class in ele- 
mentary morals. 
In thus training the pupil the teacher has to con-
-P-A-G-E-124
116 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
tend with certain faults and vices, and the faults, if 
not corrected, often develop into vices. They are: 
bashfulness, which is often sheepish in its character ; 
and boorishness, which manifests itself in either ig- 
norant or willful indifference to the social conventions 
orrules. When such boorishness is willful, it, of course, 
amounts to disrespect and contempt. 
Much of the boy’s or girl’s bashfulness is due to ig- 
norance of what is required in good manners. Knowl- 
edge of, and practice in, the social courtesies will 
therefore help largely to cure such bashfulness. Boor- 
ishness is often due to an excess of animalism. Wasn’t 
it Plato who said the boy is the worst of all wild ani- 
mals? Such animalism can be gradually softened 
by daily practice in good manners in the school. 
Where boorishness is willful it should be dealt with 
uncompromisingly, as it is immoral in character, 
showing, as it does, disrespect and contempt for others, 
and for that which society regards as essential to its 
highest well-being, and which is certainly essential to 
the well-being of the school. 
One word more may be added. Although there is 
little danger of excessive ceremonialism on the part 
of children, there is, at least, some danger of excessive 
formalism in the sense that these courtesies may be 
viewed too much from the standpoint of external- 
ism, and thus their real spirit may be lost. The pupil 
should be gradually led to apprehend them, not from
-P-A-G-E-125
THE SOCIAL LIFE I17 
a mere social and esthetic, but also from a moral 
standpoint. He should be taught to apprehend them 
as expressions of good will — of respect, of deference, 
of proper regard. 
Generosity to those outside of the family and school 
circles does not appeal to the child quite as strongly 
as when related to those inside. Children, of course, 
often take a delight in participating in charity when 
the sacrifice involved is really borne by the parent or 
by others. But when it calls for an actual sacrifice 
on their part, the generous or charitable spirit is not 
so ardent. Still their natural altruism is present to 
work upon, and it furnishes a basis for the teacher to 
develop the virtue of generosity. This is an age of 
charitable giving, and the “atmosphere”? constitutes 
a favorable environment for the cultivation of this 
virtue. There is such a variety of needs on the part 
of many that the child’s sympathies can be enlisted, 
and this will often result in action. Generosity to 
the poor, to the unfortunate, and to the erring is a 
virtue that calls strongly for cultivation in a world 
of inequalities, and it will be worth all of the effort 
the teacher puts forth to establish the child in this 
splendid virtue. Literature and history abound in 
noble examples of generosity, and the teacher will 
often find that the child will sympathetically respond 
to them. He will soon be led to see that generosity 
is better than selfishness; that it not only aids the
-P-A-G-E-126
118 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
helpless and the needy, but also proves a blessing to 
society and to the beneficent person himself. The 
esthetic side of the virtue will appeal to him also. 
There is a beauty in acts of charity that arrests our 
attention and calls forth our admiration for the 
charitable person. There is also an ugliness in the 
penuriousness — the stingy selfishness — of him who 
withholds a helping hand. 
All these virtues meet in that quality of the good 
citizen which is called public spirit. This implies a 
consideration on his part, not only for his own family 
and neighborhood, but for the whole community. 
Indeed, public spirit at its best makes one a citizen 
of the world. It is a cosmopolitan interest, which 
concerns itself with international relationships, with 
the commerce of states, and the products of countries, 
with governments, and movements tending to make 
them more free and more beneficial to the people, with 
wars and rumors of wars, with all questions of the day. 
Children may be given this spirit in their studies 
of geography and of history. The wise teacher con- 
nects these studies, so far as possible, with the news 
which is contained in the daily paper, and conducts a 
current events class in which the geography and his- 
tory of the books are vitally associated with the con- 
cerns of the present moment. If there is war in the 
Balkan States, the lay of the land is a matter of 
interest to all alert minds. If Constantinople is in
-P-A-G-E-127
THE SOCIAL LIFE r19 
peril, the teacher will read to the class in history that 
famous passage in Gibbon which describes its capture 
by the Turks, in 1453: “At daybreak, without the 
customary signal of the moving gun, the Turks as- 
saulted the city by land and sea; and the similitude 
of a twined or twisted thread has been applied to the 
closeness and continuity of their line of attack.” 
The words take on a new and dramatic interest from 
the conditions of the immediate present. 
The moral value of such association of the old time 
with the new, and of events with maps, is found in 
the development of a habit of intelligent and sym- 
pathetic interest in the world. This, of itself, elevates 
character. It is of especial importance in some- 
what isolated places, in country schools, where char- 
acter is attacked by monotony. In such places evil 
is often done because there is nothing of interest to 
occupy the mind. In such schools a map of the 
eastern world, on which every morning the teacher 
indicates by the moving of bits of colored paper the 
advance and retreat of contending powers, will have 
the fascination of a moving picture. 
These large interests will find local application. 
The good school is a Good Government Club, or a 
Village Improvement Society, within the limits of its 
own proper abilities. When a child understands his 
relation to the cleanness of the public streets, he has 
learaed the alphabet of good citizenship. The un-
-P-A-G-E-128
120 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
taught child who throws paper about the schoolyard 
is taking daily lessons in that civic indifference which 
is at the heart of most of our political distresses. 
The legend Who Will Pick It Up? may usefully be 
exhibited prominently in the hall of every school. 
The answer to it is one of the first principles of social 
responsibility. If we tear a piece of paper into bits, 
and scatter the bits along the way, one of two results 
must follow: either the torn papers lie there, disfig- 
uring the place, or else somebody must pick them up. 
It is in the direction of good morals that children 
be set to do their part in the work of keeping the town 
clean. The streets in the neighborhood of the school 
may be made an exercise-ground for clubs of boys and 
girls, who have been instructed in the virtue of public 
spirit and are ready to practice it.. This is what 
Ruskin did at Oxford when he sent his pupils out to 
mend a road. The fact that one of these amateur 
road menders was Arnold Toynbee, out of whose 
impulse came the whole mission of social settlements, 
shows that such lessons may have consequences which 
exceed all expectation. 
The school may profitably be made acquainted 
with the city. This will be for the sake of apprecia- 
tion rather than of criticism. The teacher will find 
an immediate opposition among citizens to any at- 
tack upon things as they are. It may be well that 
such an attack ought to be made, but not by children,
-P-A-G-E-129
THE SOCIAL LIFE 121 
Even if they are enlisted in the cleaning of the streets, 
it need not be suggested to them that the city council 
ought to see to that. The right beginnings of civic 
betterment, so far at least as the school is concerned, 
are positive rather than negative. The teacher will 
endeavor to acquaint the school with all the good 
things in the town. The children will be informed 
regarding various public institutions, what they are 
and how they work, and the information will then be 
illustrated by visits to such places. They will be 
taken in little groups to fire-engine houses, hospitals, 
public libraries, art galleries, playgrounds, open-air 
schools, homes for aged people. They will seé the 
Poor Commissioners and the Associated Charities 
in operation. They will visit notable factories in 
which the characteristic products of the town are 
made. They will see the inside of the town hall, meet 
the mayor, and be shown the various departments 
of administration. 
Such instruction and experience as this creates 
and directs public spirit. The children begin to think 
of the city as a beneficent institution, carried on by 
men chosen and employed by the citizens to per- 
form social duties, to maintain order, clean the streets, 
catry out improvements, and provide generally for 
the well-being of the place. They will acquire the 
habit of regarding public officers somewhat as a cor- 
poration regards its paid officials, in the light of the
-P-A-G-E-130
122 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
services which they render to the community. They 
will perceive that public positions are not prizes to 
be awarded to men for diligent political work, but are 
to be given, as other responsible positions are given, 
to the men who are best equipped to do the work. 
They will grow up into citizens who will demand ex- 
pert efficiency in office, and will consider it absurd 
to choose an undertaker for commissioner of streets 
because he was active at the polls. 
The elemental need is a true and substantial in- 
terest in the town, the state, and the nation. Out of 
that all good things may be expected. For the initial 
necessity, if we are to make our city answer to our 
ideals, is to take care that it is inhabited by good 
citizens, beginning with ourselves. 
Here, too, in addition to the methods already 
mentioned, the story method may prove helpful in 
training the child for good citizenship. There are 
" so many fine examples of genuine public spirit which 
history and our present times afford that the story 
of those who have labored for civic betterment can- 
not fail to be morally helpful to the pupil. To pre- 
sent such history and biography to the child will not 
fail to result in a wholesome mental and moral re- 
action. 
The following graded scheme (pp. 124-125) will as- 
sist in training pupils in the virtues relating to the 
community.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SOCIAL LIFE (RELATIONS TO ANIMALS) 
In the economy of Nature man sustains a close 
relation to the animal kingdom. In the later stages of 
his development animals were domesticated by man, 
and some of them, as the horse, the ox, and the dog, 
now render him valuable service. So intimate has 
this relation become that a kind of “‘friendship” or 
companionship exists between them. So marked is 
this at times that examples of notable devotion on the 
part of animals to their masters and mistresses are 
on record. Wordsworth’s excellent poem “ Fidelity,” 
which memorializes the faithfulness of a dog to his 
master, is a poem based on fact, and the fact itself 
is by no means an isolated one. On the other hand, 
so strong is the regard, if not, indeed, affection of the 
master or mistress for the dog or horse, due to this 
sense of camaraderie, that when the animal dies, they 
experience a genuine grief or sorrow. 
Some ethical writers, recognizing animals as not 
only sentient, but social beings, and noting the inti- 
mate relationship between man and animals, have, 
in their classification of duties, spoken of ‘Duties to 
K 129
-P-A-G-E-138
130 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
Animals.” Whether we can properly speak of 
“duties” to beings that are not persons is question- 
able. If duties are based on moral claims, and moral 
claims belong only to personal beings, then moral 
claims and duties are correlative, and, unless the ani- 
mal is a person, we can hardly say that it has a moral 
claim upon us, or that we owe a duty to it. But, 
whether this can be strictly said or not, it is at least 
evident that we owe it to ourselves, as well as to the 
Author of Nature, to be kind and humane to every 
being thatis capable of experiencing pleasure and pain ; 
and, therefore, it practically amounts to the same thing 
as if we said we owe duties to animals. So that kind- 
ness and humaneness in our relation to animals are 
really measures of our moral worth. As Coleridge 
says :— 
“He prayeth well who loveth well 
Both man and bird and beast, 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small; 
For the dear God who loveth us 
He made and loveth all.” 
Now, in our effort to moralize the child in this re- 
spect, there are a number of things that, in a sense, 
constitute obstacles in the way. In the first place, 
all along the line of man’s development he has had to 
contend more or less with beasts and birds of prey. 
In the struggle for existence he has been compelled
-P-A-G-E-139
THE SOCIAL LIFE I3r 
to take a hostile attitude toward a large number of 
such, and, even at this late day, the struggle must 
be kept up, as in the case of poisonous serpents and, 
in certain portions of the earth, in the case of fero- 
cious animals. According to biological evolution the 
struggle has really worked an advantage to man — 
having proved to be an important factor in his de- 
velopment. But, with the extinction of some of the 
more ferocious species, there still survives in man 
some of the earlier ferocious instincts which manifest 
themselves in a useless slaughter of wild animals — 
a kind of wild delight in hunting “big game.” 
Again, man being a flesh-eating animal, in all ages 
animals have been slaughtered to minister to his bod- 
ily needs. Such slaughter continues to-day on a tre- 
mendous scale, and will continue unless the race 
should be convinced of the sufficiency of a vegetable 
diet. This wholesale slaughter, even though it seems 
necessary, and is carried on in the most humane fash- 
ion, has a more or less demoralizing tendency, which 
we must reckon with. 
Again, in the light of modern science, we have found 
that certain animals and insects are bearers of dis- 
ease germs, and these are a menace to the human or- 
ganism. So we find it necessary to destroy them. 
Indeed, we find it expedient often to visit wholesale 
destruction upon them. We teach our children in 
the home and school to ‘swat the fly,” to kill the
-P-A-G-E-140
132 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
mosquito, to destroy cockroaches, mice, and other 
vermin. All this must be done, and it seems right 
that it should be done. But it has a tendency more 
or less to dull our humaneness, and renders it more 
difficult to teach the child to exercise this virtue in 
relations, and under conditions, where the destruction 
of life is not profitable. 
Again, animals are our inferiors, and are utilized 
for our service and pleasure. We take away the 
freedom of many. We harness the horse and ox, we 
stable the cow, we chain the dog, we cage the bird. 
This attitude of dominion over the animal world con- 
stitutes often a temptation to indulge in cruelty to 
animals. So strong is this temptation that organiza- 
tions have sprung up to guard their “rights,” and 
these “rights” are in some instances made the sub- 
ject of state legislation. 
It will thus be seen that in trying to teach the child 
kindness to animals, the teacher is by no means con- 
fronted with an easy task. She has to deal with in- 
herited tendencies, and with certain unfavorable in- 
fluences due to environment. But, on the other hand, 
there are some things that help her in her work. 
It is a very noticeable fact that young children are 
fond of animals. Household pets, like cats and dogs 
and rabbits, figure largely in the social life of the child. 
Indeed, he is often more fond of them than of persons. 
This is doubtless due to the fact that at this time of
-P-A-G-E-141
THE SOCIAL LIFE 133 
life he has, in a sense, more in common with these 
animals than he has with man. This fondness does 
not cease as he grows older. The dog is still the com- 
panion of the boy and girl, and the cat continues to 
be the pet of the girl. 
Still, despite all this, there is both a thoughtlessness 
and cruelty which children manifest in their relation 
to animals and insects which make it imperative ° 
for the teacher of elementary morals to deal with 
these vices, and, because of the prevalence of them, 
it will probably be best at first to put the emphasis 
on the vice of cruelty more than on the virtue of kind- 
ness. In the very young child this cruelty is the re- 
sult of ignorance or thoughtlessness. He will maul 
the cat and dog as though they were inanimate ob- 
jects. He will pull off the legs and wings of the fly 
as though the fly had no feeling whatsoever, and could 
maintain its being without these necessary members. 
A little later in life the child’s ignorance and thought- 
lessness develop into a thoughtlessness of a more 
serious character, which is sometimes attended by 
a conscious cruelty. He seems to delight in ston- 
ing frogs, birds, squirrels, and other animals. In 
many instances, through a misdirected generosity of 
parents or friends, he is made the owner of an air gun 
by which he maims or kills birds or small animals. 
In later life such cruelty is often manifest in brutality - 
when dealing with domestic animals, such as the
-P-A-G-E-142
134 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
horse, ox, and dog. Now all that makes for brutality 
in the child ought to be curbed. It makes for im- 
morality, and the teacher of morals in the schools 
will prove recreant to her trust if she fails to treat this 
vice seriously. 
It may be that cruelty of this kind is to be ac- 
counted for as merely the manifestation of “frag- 
mentary rudiments of past combat, capture, and 
killing of prey and enemies,” ! and that therefore we 
ought not to be too harsh in our judgments of the 
boy’s conduct. But whether it is to be thus ex- 
plained or not, it is nevertheless an evil, and it is the 
teacher’s duty to do what she can to restrain such 
“atavistic tendencies.” ? 
Furthermore, there is a moral obligation here as 
this matter relates itself to society. A large ma- 
jority of the community finds delight in song birds 
and in birds of beautiful plumage. What moral 
tight have we to interfere with such delight simply to 
gratify selfish cruelty? Much will be taken out of 
life if our song birds, and our birds of gay plumage, 
eventually disappear. Furthermore, birds are of use 
to man. They eat insects and worms that destroy 
our trees. Why should man be deprived of this

service to gratify the savage instincts of the boy with 
the shotgun, or the boy after he grows up and makes 
use of the more deadly rifle? Society is awaking 
to the danger, and is beginning a propaganda in the 
interests of protecting our birds. Such a propaganda 
can be best carried on in the school. Here wanton 
destruction of birds should be condemned as a vice, 
to refrain from which is a moral obligation that the 
pupil owes to himself and to society. 
But thus far we have been dwelling largely on the 
negative side of the subject — on the vices of unkind- 
ness and cruelty. Let us now turn to the positive side 
— the virtues of kindness and humaneness. Just how 
much this includes is not an easy matter to determine. 
Whether it means more than merely supplying the phy- 
sical wants of the animals depending upon us might be 
questioned by some. It at least means this much, 
and this alone is productive of moral results. Dr. 
Montessori calls attention to the effects of taking 
care of plants and animals on both the intellectual 
and moral life of young children. What is true of 
very young children is true of older children as well. 
She says :—~— 
“First. The child is initiated into observation of the 
phenomena of life. He stands with respect to the plants 
and animals in relations analogous to those in which the 
observing teacher stands towards him. Little by little, 
as interest and observation grow, his zealous care for the
-P-A-G-E-144
136 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
living creatures grows also, and in this way the child 
can logically be brought to appreciate the care which 
the mother and the teacher take of him. 
“Second. The child is initiated into foresight by way 
of auto-education; when he knows that the life of the 
plants that have been sown depends upon his care in 
watering them, and that of the animals, upon his diligence 
in feeding them, without which the little plant dries up 
and the animals suffer hunger, the child becomes vigilant, 
as one who is beginning to feel a mission in life. More- 
over, a voice quite different from that of his mother and his 
teacher calling him to his duties is speaking here, exhorting 
him never to forget the task he has undertaken. It is 
the plaintive voice of the needy life which lives by his 
care. Between the child and the living creatures which 
he cultivates there is born a mysterious correspondence 
which induces the child to fulfill certain determinate acts 
without the intervention of the teacher, that is, leads 
him to an auto-education. 
“The rewards which the child reaps also remain between 
him and nature: one fine day after long, patient care in 
carrying food and straw to the brooding pigeons, behold 
the little ones! behold a number of chickens peeping about 
the setting hen which yesterday sat motionless in her 
brooding place! behold one day the tender little rabbits 
in the hutch where formerly dwelt in solitude the pair of 
big rabbits to which he had not a few times lovingly 
carried the green vegetables left over in his mother’s 
kitchen |” # 
Observation, foresight, patience, sense of responsi- 
bility, kindness, industry —all result from such a prov- 
1“ The Montessori Method,” New York, 1912, pp. 156-157.
-P-A-G-E-145
THE SOCIAL LIFE 137 
idence which children exercise over animals, and it 
is well to encourage them in it wherever practicable. 
Furthermore, the nature of animals is such, that 
our relation to them involves a further obligation of 
kindness — an obligation to train them for higher 
enjoyment —an enjoyment of companionship with 
human beings. To thus train animals will prove not 
only a kindness to them, but it will enhance our own 
pleasure, also, and the exercise of such kindness 
reacts upon ourselves. It has an excellent moral 
effect. Therefore such kindly treatment really be- 
comes a duty. 
In dealing with the virtue and vice growing out of 
our relations to animals the teacher will find that 
fables and allegories especially lend themselves to 
this purpose. They often deal with animal life, and 
in their personification of animals the moral lesson 
may be impressively brought before the pupil. It is 
rather surprising that modern writers of fables and 
allegories have not made more use of this method to 
teach morality as it bears on this subject. Here, 
again, is a field for cultivation by some clever writer. 
There are, however, a sufficient number of fables 
available so that the teacher will not be handicapped 
in the use of the indirect method here. General story 
literature also will furnish material that relates to this 
virtue and its opposite vice, so that the teacher need 
not be embarrassed because of a lack of material.

CHAPTER IX 
THE ECONOMIC LIFE 
EtuicaL writers emphasize the vital significance 
of the vocational life in the moral development of 
the individual and of society. A vocation tends to 
unify a man’s life, and this unity is itself a moral 
gain. It also identifies him with the community 
in a manner that makes both for his own as well as 
for the community’s welfare. Through it, in a sys- 
tematic way, he makes his contribution to the world’s 
work. He is not only saved from many of the sins 
of idleness, but he also develops many of the per- 
sonal, social, and industrial virtues. He thus adds 
to his own enjoyment and enrichment of character 
as well as to the enjoyment and enrichment of the 
life of society. The more the teacher realizes this, 
the more she will exert herself to impress upon her 
pupils in the upper grades the importance of the 
vocational life, and to establish them in its virtues 
and guard them against its vices. - 
By the economic life we mean whatever concerns 
the earning of one’s living. Many children of the 
seventh and eighth grades are already regarding this 
matter as of immediate interest. Even if they have 
139
-P-A-G-E-148
140 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
the desire to pursue their studies further, their 
circumstances are such as to make an extended course 
out of the question. They must go to work next 
year or the year after. 
The fact is an unfortunate one from the point of 
view of education in general, but it offers a certain 
educational opportunity. It brings into the last 
two years of school some of the elements which enter 
into the preparation for a profession. It is well- 
known that young men who have been indifferent 
students in their college years become interested and 
industrious when they come to study the subjects 
which are evidently necessary for their success in life. 
They do not need to be compelled to work hard. 
If in a like manner the boys and girls who are presently 
to go out of the school into the shop or the mill per- 
ceive that what they are being taught in school bears 
directly upon what they are to do for a living, and 
may determine whether they shall succeed or not, the 
problem of getting their interest is solved. 
This is easy when the work of the school is a direct 
training for the practical life, as is the case in manual 
instruction, and in such subjects as bookkeeping, 
penmanship, and arithmetic. But the wise teacher 
will show that the most important part of the prep- 
aration is that which affects character. The initial 
demand in the world of. business is that which is 
supplied not by mere dexterity or knowledge of
-P-A-G-E-149
THE ECONOMIC LIFE 147 
methods, but by those personal qualities which make 
the work of hands and brains effective. 
One of these qualities is industry. This is the virtue 
which is contradicted by the vice of indolence. It 
is the solid foundation of all achievement. Young 
people are sometimes misled by the dramatic examples 
of adventurers and men of genius who seem to have 
accomplished great things easily, by good luck, 
without trying. They remember that Aladdin was a 
lazy lad in whose hands was placed a magic lamp 
which made him master of the unseen powers. All 
that he had to do was to rub the lamp; that was the 
most serious exertion of energy required. And he 
became rich, and married the sultan’s daughter. 
The honest truth, however, is that in actual life the 
story of the lazy lad is parallel with the story of Aladdin 
only to the end of the first chapter. Down he goes 
along the magic stairs in search of gold and gems, and 
the cover is clapped down upon him, and there he is in 
the dark for good: he never getsout. All things come 
to the industrious. Nothing comes to the indolent 
but shame and failure, and the loss of all the things 
which are to be attained by industry. Indolence 
is the counterfeit coin which is offered in purchase of 
the good things of life, and is refused at all counters. 
The hours of the day are like the blank leaves of a 
check book, being worth only what we make them 
worth. All young people desire to live lives of self-
-P-A-G-E-150
142 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
respect and economic independence. They look for- 
ward to the owning of their own homes, and to the 
successful conduct of their own business. One of the 
most important lessons which they can learn in school 
is that the key to all this pleasant life is industry. 
But in order to make the importance of industry 
plain, young people must have an ambition to be and 
to do that which requires industry for its accomplish- 
ment. Often the indolent pupil lacks aspiration. He 
comes out of an environment of plodding and care- 
less life in which there are low standards of living. 
His parents and his neighbors are contented with 
food and lodging of a poor kind, and are satisfied 
to live from hand to mouth. The school must appeal 
to ambition. It must set forth the possibilities which 
are within the reach of industrious youth. It must 
show how both health and happiness await those who 
really desire them, while those who lack ambition 
get only so much as they actively desire. 
It is indeed true that industrial conditions are diffi- 
cult. There is a feeling in the minds of manual labor- 
ers that they are imprisoned in the midst of discourag- 
ing conditions out of which they cannot escape. All 
their industry, they think, will but contribute to 
the gains of their masters, leaving them as poor as ever. On the other hand, there are many examples 
oe amen of conspicuous success who began their 
g. They are prosperous because
-P-A-G-E-151
THE ECONOMIC LIFE 143 
they worked hard and intelligently, while the other 
boys who went to school with them are poor. They 
laid hold of every opportunity. One might have 
said that they had nochance. The future, it seemed, 
belonged to the sons of the rich, who had every ad- 
vantage to start with. But it did not work out that 
way. They were determined to succeed. Their 
constant ambition opened a way for them over all 
obstacles. They made effective weapons out of the 
opportunities which others threw away. 
“There spread a cloud of dust along the plain ; 
And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged 
A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords 
Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince’s banner 
Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes. 
A craven hung along the battle’s edge, 
And thought, ‘Had I a sword of keener steel — 
That blue blade that the king’s son bears, — but this 
Blunt thing —!’ he snapt and flung it from his hand, 
And lowering crept away and left the field. 
Then came the king’s son, wounded, sore bestead, 
And weaponless, and saw the broken sword, 
Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand, 
And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout 
Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down, 
And saved a great cause that heroic day.” 
These are noble lines for the memory of youth, 
worth being printed in great letters and hung on 
schoolroom walls, for the incitement of high ambition,
-P-A-G-E-152
144 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
and for the assurance that success is won not by favor, 
nor by excellence of tools or weapons, so much as 
by constant determination, and the resolve to do 
difficult things in an heroic spirit. 
Along with industry and ambition as good qualities 
of the economic life goes the virtue of order. There 
is a plodding and unintelligent industry which de- 
feats all the dreams of ambition because it does not 
use the time aright. Order begins with promptness. 
The orderly worker is on hand punctually, at the 
moment. This is plainly one of the virtues for 
which the discipline of the school provides continual 
exercise. The wise teacher shows the pupils how 
promptness, and regularity, and system, and the 
details of order are necessary, not only that the life 
of the school may proceed well, but that the lives of 
the scholars may be affected by it. They are to be 
reminded that this virtue is as essential to all economic 
progress as a knowledge of tools is essential to a 
mechanic. Prosperity is impossible without it. 
Thus the failure of a farm is proclaimed by the im- 
plements which lie neglected in the field. That 
spectacle of improvidence and neglect and disorder 
is not only an evidence that the farm does not pay, 
but an explanation of its poor returns. The trouble 
with the farm is that it is managed. by a farmer 
who sees no harm in leaving his hoes and shovels, 
his plows and rakes under the wet sky. That shows
-P-A-G-E-153
THE ECONOMIC LIFE 145 
what sort of man he is. The failure is first in the 
character of the farmer; then, as a consequence, in 
the farm. 
Order is required, then, in the schoolroom. Desks 
must be kept neat, bells must be obeyed with im- 
mediate response, hours must be observed to the 
minute, quiet must be maintained, the school must 
proceed with the carefulness of a business office, in 
order that boys and girls may be taught this very 
necessary virtue of order. Employers are looking for 
young people, who, together with industry and am- 
bition, have a sense of order. To such the rewards 
of the economic life are given. They get the pro- 
motions. When places of responsibility are open, 
and young men are to be advanced to masterships, 
account is taken of their orderly habits. They 
who would be intrusted with the keeping of order, 
with the conduct of a system, must first be systematic 
and orderly themselves. 
There are two allied virtues which take these quali- 
ties of industry and ambition and order out of the 
enthusiasm of new resolutions, and make them a 
settled part of the working day. One of them is 
patience, the other is perseverance.) These make 
youth willing to wait. For the rewards of - virtue 
are often slow in coming. One says hastily to himself, 
“T have lived according to the principles which ought 
to bring advancement, and I am not advanced. My 
L
-P-A-G-E-154
146 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
wages are no more than they were two years ago. 
I will give up the fruitless effort.” In such cases it is 
sometimes well for the discouraged worker to ask him- 
self: ‘‘Am I really worth more than I was two years 
ago? Am I contributing more to the success of the 
business than I was?” For the unchanged wage may 
mean that the worker is unchanged. But if the ques- 
tion may be answered in the worker’s favor, and still 
his virtues seem to have no recognition nor reward, 
then the needed qualities are those of patience and of 
perseverance. All the virtues are tested by them. 
Men must have virtues which can stand strains. 
They must be enduring. Sometimes the master is 
watching to see if the good qualities of the man are 
real; they may be only the products of a passing 
enthusiasm. The man may work well under pleasant 
conditions, but may have no staying qualities. The 
successful man is he who has met discouragement a 
thousand times. Often he failed when he hoped to 
succeed, and had no recognition, was not appreciated, 
seemed to make no progress. Under these circum- 
stances most of his companions on the way to success 
became discouraged and gave up, and that was the 
end of them. He kept on. 
But patience and perseverance imply discourage- 
ment and difficulty. These conditions are essential 
to their existence. Patience is a virtue only when 
we have good reason to be impatient, and persever-
-P-A-G-E-155
THE ECONOMIC LIFE 147 
ance means nothing unless it is hard for us to per- 
severe. Thus all the difficulties of school life are 
as much a part of the economic life which follows as 
the rigors of practice are a part of the game. The 
purpose of practice is to accustom players to hard 
usage in order that they may take it cheerfully and 
without surprise when they get it from the other team. 
Soft practice makes soft players, as soft studies make 
soft people, unable to meet the difficulties of life. 
The lesson is hard because life is hard, and the school 
is meant to train youth to encounter hardship. 
The virtues of economy and prudence, important 
as they are in the work of the world, are somewhat 
remote from the work of the school. Life stretches 
out so immeasurably before the feet of youth that it is 
hard for the young to realize that they must take care 
of their hours. Why be careful, when there are so 
many hours? And the saving of money is remote 
from most pupils, since few of them are earning it. * 
The value of money is hardly more than an academic 
proposition until one discovers by experience how hard 
it is to get and keep. That extravagance is a vice 
must be taught as a dogma, the lesson being confirmed 
later by reason and experience. 
The teacher may show that time and money are 
the materials of our continual bargains. We are 
forever spending them, and getting what we pay for. 
The instinct to make a good bargain, the reluctance
-P-A-G-E-156
\ 
\ 
148 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
to be cheated, is universal, and makes a basis of 
appeal. Evidently, the permanent is better than 
the temporary, gold is better than brass; to buy 
something to keep is better than to buy something 
to throw away. And if we buy this, we cannot buy 
that. Thus wastefulness may be impressed upon 
the mind as a form of folly. The youth who throws 
away time which might be used for his advancement in 
life might as well pitch his dimes over the bridge. 
Wasted money, for foolish purchases, is a reason for 
derision, like the folly of one who because of ignorance 
or of carelessness is continually cheated. Improvi- 
dence is a thing to be ashamed of as a mark of lack 
of knowledge of life. In the curious color scheme of 
popular morals the youth who is undertaking, as the 
phrase is, to paint the world red is succeeding only 
in painting himself green. 
The list of the more outstanding economic virtues 
closes with the personal qualities of honesty and 
courage. They are closely allied. For honesty, in 
any large definition of the word, means not only 
the keeping of one’s hands from picking and steal- 
ing, but a certain allegiance to one’s convictions. 
He is honest who is true, sincere, and genuine, 
and who does what he believes to be right, 
and declines to do what he believes to be wrong. 
And this calls for courage. It implies self-reliance. 
It demands a measure of initiative and independ-
-P-A-G-E-157
THE ECONOMIC LITE 149 
ence. He who has honesty and courage possesses 
the qualities of leadership. At the least, he will 
not be found ignobly following a crowd to do evil. 
He can be depended upon. He orders his conduct, 
not by the prohibitions of the law, but by the guid- 
ance of his own conscience, and will do well whether 
he is commanded or not, and whether he is observed 
or not. 
These five personal qualities should be developed 
in the school, not by regulation, nor by direct instruc- 
tion, but by the attraction of noble examples. A 
series of ethical school readers that holds up to the 
admiration and emulation of youth honest and 
courageous heroes will be of great service here. The 
stories of their lives help to make a public opinion 
which praises moral bravery. It assists a condition 
out of which boys and girls go into the world with 
certain fine ideals, rejoicing in the strength of the body, 
but rejoicing even more in that strength of the will 
and of the soul which keeps men true to the distinc- 
tion between right and wrong, and makes them in- 
stinctive champions of right. 
The following graded scheme (pp. 150-151) will be 
found helpful as a basis for training children in the 
virtues of the economic life.

CHAPTER X 
THE POLITICAL LIFE 
Lone ago Aristotle defined man as a political animal. 
By this, the great Greek philosopher meant that man 
is by nature a political being — that he has natural 
or constitutional capacities that fit him not only for 
society, but for society as organized under govern- 
ment. This is undoubtedly true, for both the history 
of the race, as well as a psychological analysis of 
man, bear testimony to the fact. Almost as far back 
as we can trace human history we find man existing not 
only in groups but under some form of political 
organization which, in its higher forms, we call the 
State or Commonwealth. 
The state is an ethical institution. It exists for the 
welfare of the people. This is its supreme end. 
However inferior may be the conception of “welfare” 
which the people may form, still it is an ideal that they 
impose upon themselves, and the‘tealization of which, 
in a measure at least, they apprehend as a moral 
obligation.” By its aims, its laws, — prohibitory and 
mandatory, — its aspirations and its inspirations, the 
state proves to be a tremendous moralizing force, and 
153
-P-A-G-E-162
154 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
anything that can be done to promote its highest 
interests should be done. 
The public schools are in a large measure training 
schools for citizenship. Supported as they are by 
the people, this should be their primary aim, and 
they ought to be training schools for good citizenship. 
Here that knowledge and sentiment which makes 
for such ends should be fostered. It is here that the 
individual should be instructed and established in 
those virtues which make for the public weal —in 
that “righteousness which exalteth a nation.” A 
school that fails to realize its duty in this respect 
fails in one of its most fundamental moral obligations. 
‘What, then, are these virtues, and how can we effec- 
tively introduce the pupil to them ? . 
The foundation virtue of the political life is one which 
has a like place both in the school and in the home. 
All discipline, whether domestic, academic, or political, 
begins with it. The lack of it imperils or destroys 
all organization. This is the virtue of obedience. 
The first ground of obedience is authority. In 
early childhood, and in such classes of society as have 
hardly developed beyond the unreasoning stage, 
this is the only basis of obedience. The mind and 
the will must be directed by a superior wisdom and 
strength. The command must be heeded because 
it is a command, whether it is agreeable or not, 
and whether it is understood or not. Prompt
-P-A-G-E-163
THE POLITICAL LIFE 155 
and unquestioning obedience is necessary at this 
period for its own sake, in order to develop habit, as 
various exercises are necessary as an initiation into 
art, or music, or letters, in order to develop dexterity. 
The encouragement of this virtue is in the approval 
of those in authority when it appears, and their 
disapproval when it is lacking. It is assisted by 
examples, such as appear in a series of ethical 
readers, of boys and girls who obeyed splendidly 
under difficult conditions. All the singing, marching, 
and drilling of the schoolroom, and whatever else 
goes to the sound of a bell, are in the direction of 
obedience. 
As years increase, and it becomes possible to make 
more appeal to reason or imagination, the almost 
instinctive interest which children have in soldiers 
and sailors may be made to contribute to this virtue. 
These men obey instantly, and all their strength 
proceeds from that fact. Thus the teacher passes 
from authority as a ground of obedience to lay a 
second: foundation in the fact of efficiency. It is 
plain that a good regiment obeys, and it may be made 
plain that a school, in order to be a good school, must 
obey. All the energies of the captain must be set 
free for use in leading the regiment into action. He 
must not be delayed and distracted by having to urge 
laggards into line. And all the energies of the teacher 
must be set free for teaching. -On goes this regiment
-P-A-G-E-164
156 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
into the battle of life; every inattentive or disobedient 
soldier weakens it. The universal interest of children 
in athletic games affords another opportunity for con- 
necting obedience with efficiency. For the phrase 
“team play” is equivalent to obedience in action. 
Instant response must be made to the word of the 
leader. . 
As children grow still older they may be made 
to understand that school laws are the expression of 
careful wisdom. This understanding is impeded 
in some cases by a conviction based on experience 
that home laws often represent impulse or impatience 
or a failure to appreciate the conditions of child life. 
But even here the reasonableness of the academic 
regulation may be made clear. Much may be done 
by explanation of the reasons for the regulations 
made sometimes to the whole school, and sometimes 
to a chosen group of natural leaders. The wise teacher 
will invite discussion, and be ready to listen atten- 
tively to all counter-arguments. In this way the 
energies of the scholars themselves may be énlisted 
on the side of the constituted authorities. 
The importance of the whole matter is evidenced 
by the continual complaints of the ineffectiveness 
of the public school in teaching respect for law. 
Often a part of the failure arises from the presenta- 
tion of school law on the basis of authority alone to 
boys and girls who ought to be appealed to on the
-P-A-G-E-165
THE POLITICAL LIFE 157 
basis of efficiency and reason. The law is a coercive 
fact by which youth is kept in bondage. The children 
are conscious only of the restraint of it. They con- 
sequently hate it, and on every convenient occasion 
react from it. They are at war with the teacher in 
the school, and they continue to be at war with the 
policeman when they get out of school. Much may 
be learned from the methods of such organizations 
as the George Junior Republic, and from the conduct 
of successful boys’ camps. 
The essence of sound political life is in regard for 
law as a common possession. It is our law, made for 
us by men whom we have chosen for that purpose, 
and enforced by men in uniform whose salaries are 
paid by us in the form of taxes. It is a regulation 
agreed upon by us all as the best method for securing 
order and efficiency in the living of our life. It may, 
indeed, be questioned how far it is possible to introduce 
into secondary schools, and especially into elementary 
schools, the self-government which works so admira- 
bly in some colleges. But some measure of it may 
probably be used to a much greater extent than has 
as yet been attempted. The simplest form is a choice 
by the teachers, or still better by the pupils, of certain 
representatives, with whom the makers and adminis- 
trators of school law may profitably confer. The 
result ought to be a company of youth who shall go 
out of the school accustomed to regard law as a rule
-P-A-G-E-166
158 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
to be not only obeyed but enforced. The pupils 
themselves are enlisted on the side of law. 
Political duty is changed to enthusiasm by the 
fostering of love of country. Children may very 
early be taught to be proud of the land, the nation, 
the city, the locality in which they live. Thus geog- 
raphy becomes instruction in patriotism. The 
children learn in how great and wonderful and beau- 
tiful a place they have their residence. They become 
aware of the large fact of nationality, and are made 
acquainted with the resources, the growth, the possi- 
bilities of the country. They are taught in their 
study of history what has been done for them by the 
pioneers, adventurers, settlers, statesmen, and heroes. 
They perceive that they are entering into a precious 
heritage. They are prepared to take their places in 
‘this march of progress. They come to understand 
how the government, national and local, is adminis- 
tered, and what.is actually being done under the 
leadership of legislators in the national and state 
councils, and in city halls and town meetings, for the 
general good. When they learn this, they will be 
wiser than many of their parents. 
In the course of such teaching instruction will be 
given in the history and nature of our political in- 
stitutions. Such teaching is made especially neces- 
sary by the presence in our public schools of great 
numbers of children whose parents were born under
-P-A-G-E-167
THE POLITICAL LIFE 159 
very different political conditions. The children de- 
rive from their parents the attitude and opinions which 
these conditions cause. Often the elders have left 
their homes because of political corruption, injustice, 
and oppression, and though they may have sought 
these shores as a place of refuge and a haven of hap- 
piness, they cannot quite divest themselves of their 
inherited prejudices. If in the land of their birth 
political authority meant tyranny and oppression, 
and the courts of law meant only extortion from the 
poor, some measure of that feeling will continue, even 
under changed conditions. It must be met in the 
school by teachers who understand that it exists. 
The teacher is dealing directly, indeed, with children, 
but indirectly with full-grown citizens whose preju- 
dices may at any moment give rise to serious violence. 
The instruction which enlightens children to the na- 
ture and meaning of our free institutions, and shows 
them how they intend the best welfare of all citizens, 
is one of the most important pieces of work which 
anybody can do in this country. Under such teach- 
ing the American flag takes on a new significance. 
The fact that our institutions depend upon our- 
selves brings the public school into vital relations with 
the political situation. Indeed, it is primarily for this 
purpose that the school exists and is maintained by 
taxes levied on the citizens. These taxes are collected 
from all taxpayers, whether they have children or not,
-P-A-G-E-168
160 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
because the output of the schools is of universal in- 
terest. All social order depends upon it. Rightly un- 
derstood, nothing in the course of study in the public 
school is so important as that which has hardly any 
recognized place in it, the systematic teaching of 
morals. For that which concerns us all, and makes 
the maintenance of schools worth while, is not merely 
the imparting of a knowledge of letters or figures, 
but the impressing of such moral ideas as shall make 
good citizens. The best product of a school is char- 
acter. 
Thus the love ‘of justice, the love of honesty, the love 
of liberty, the love of peace, are to be nourished in 
the lives of children. A series of ethical readers is 
one attempt to assist the school in fulfilling its su- 
premely important function, but this needs to be sup- 
plemented and enforced in the whole management of 
_ the school. A most important factor is the treatment 
of the daily problems in such a manner as to uphold 
the value of these virtues and to illustrate them in the 
conduct of the school affairs. The just teacher, who 
makes decisions not in haste, nor in temper, but after 
consultation and consideration, with no purpose but 
to be fair, is teaching morality most effectively. And 
the distinction between liberty and license, the whole- 
some advantages of peace, and the essential quality 
of honest dealing, may be taught from texts daily 
supplied in the experiences of the school. The hero-
-P-A-G-E-169
THE POLITICAL LIFE 161 
ism of peace, in the lives of firemen and policemen, 
in the face of accident, are illustrated in the daily 
papers. Courage is to be praised as a moral rather 
than a physical bravery, the test of which is afforded 
by the temptations of the school yard and of the street. 
As for respect for rulers, it begins with respect for 
teachers, a respect earned by fairness, earnestness, 
competence, and sympathy. 
The pupils are to be taught that the highest virtues 
are social and aggressive. To live one’s individual 
life is excellent so far as it goes, but to make one’s 
life count in the furtherance of all that is good, to be 
not only right but a champion of right, to be not only 
a good citizen but a defender and maintainer of good 
citizenship, this is the goal of all the instruction which 
bears ultimately on the political life. This is the 
meaning of the virtues of political interest and politi- 
cal honor. All the emotions of love of country are 
to be focused upon the endeavor to contribute to the 
welfare of the country, and to fight against all agencies 
and influences which degrade its life. The immediate 
aim may be the development of loyalty to the school, 
the endeavor to enlist all children in the making 
of the cleanest, the most orderly, the most attractive, 
the most efficient school in the community. The 
natural zeal which is manifested in the rivalries of 
intercollegiate sports, and in the games between rival 
teams at baseball, may be ultilized in the finer 
Mw
-P-A-G-E-170
162 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
competitions for the attainment of higher standards 
of life. Then it will be easy for the boys and girls, 
grown into men and women, to conduct themselves 
with like enthusiasm in the great work of making the 
cleanest, the most orderly, the most attractive, the 
most efficient city. Out of such a spirit we may 
expect the emergence of better politics. 
Here instruction should be graded also, dealing 
with such political virtues and vices as may be most 
profitably dealt with in the respective grades. The 
following graded scheme (p. 163) is commended to 
the teacher.

CHAPTER XI 
THE ZSTHETIC LIFE 
Tue child by nature is an esthetic being. Consti- 
tutionally, he functions xsthetically just as really as 
he does socially, although not to the same extent. 
Very early in his history he manifests delight in 
beauty. The nature of these reactions will be ex- 
plained as we proceed with the chapter. Because of 
them, education calls for the development of this 
aspect of the child’s nature, and ethical culture de- 
mands its moralization. Morality is especially con- 
cerned with esthetic development, since there is an 
intimate relation existing between the beautiful and 
the good. So intimately related are they that thinkers 
like Plato, Shaftesbury, and Schiller really identify 
them. Whether this be justifiable or not, it is un- 
doubtedly true 2 esthetic factor is an exceed- 
ingly important factor in our moral life, and it should 
receive proper recognition at the hands of our school 
authorities — both for its own sake and for the sake 
of morals. 
It is part of the office of the teacher of morals to try 
to establish the child in the virtues of the zsthetic 
167
-P-A-G-E-176
‘ \ i i ! 
i 
{ 168 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
life. In doing this, however, she sometimes en- 
counters difficulties which are not easily overcome. 
Public sentiment is often hostile to efforts on the part 
of the schools to give the esthetic nature proper recog- 
nition in child culture. It is a utilitarian age, when 
“bread and butter studies” are demanded — studies 
that bear directly on the child’s future vocational life. 
The cry of “fads and fancies” is raised in opposition 
to wsthetic development, and school principals and 
superintendents often find it discouraging work 
to attempt to introduce a little more idealism into 
«the curriculum; The fine arts are regarded as luxuries, 
gad taming “th appreciation “of them is supposed to. 
“pet ‘unnecessary. Music and poetry receiv: ome rec- 
“ognition, but the remainder.of the arts are, to a large 
extent, passed by with indifference, if not, indeed, 
with contempt. 
, of course, in carrying out our educational 
ideals, we must reckon with the conditions under which 
we labor. It is wise for us to remember, in trying to 
tealize ideals, that we are not in an ideal environment. 
We must labor with constant regard for the real 
— the actual. Public sentiment must be considered. 
But it is possible often, by tactful procedure, to 
change public sentiment, — especially when it is in the 
wrong, —- and the teachers and superintendents should 
use their influence to this end. Such sentiment is 
viten based upon:a failure to appreciate how large    
-P-A-G-E-177
THE ZSTHETIC LIFE 169 
and valuable a part the esthetic nature plays in our 
complex life, and it would be well for our educators, 
who are interested in the promotion of esthetic 
culture in our schools, to enlighten the public on this 
point. If it be not specially susceptible to an appeal 
in behalf of the esthetic nature on the higher grounds 
of its relations to the social, moral, and religious 
life, it might be influenced by pointing out the im- 
portance of the esthetic in its relation to the economic 
life, for undoubtedly, estimated from a purely utili- 
tarian point of view, the zsthetic nature demands 
consideration. In a section of a chapter of his — 
“Practical Sociology,” relating to “Art and Social 
Well-being,” such a practical thinker as Carroll D. 
Wright says : — 
“People engaged in artistic manufactures are em- 
ployed in occupations of a higher grade; their wages are 
increased ; their standard of living is raised proportionately, 
and their social well-being is enhanced. 
“If industry to-day had nothing more to do than the 
furnishing of the simple necessaries of human life, it 
would have little field for expansion, and would offer 
meager opportunities for employment. Life would be a 
burden, so dull and monotonous would it be. Trade, 
as we understand it, would cease, and commerce become 
a thing practically unknown. But industry flourishes 
because it is not limited to the production of things that 
are needed for food, raiment, and shelter. It is because 
art has come in to increase the wants of the race that
-P-A-G-E-178
170 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
trade and commerce flourish. Art carries industry be- 
yond our actual wants, and calls upon it to supply those 
things which make for social progress. The future expan- 
sion of industry and of commerce, the future elevation in 
the character of the employment of all classes, the increase 
of their earning capacity, the opportunity of increasing the 
standard of their environment, — all these depend upon 
the cultivation of the industrial arts.” ! 
And, in the section following, which relates to 
“Art as a Source of Wealth,” the same writer 
says :— 
“Looking beyond this, industrial art is a source of 
wealth. Fine art itself is a wealth producer. The payment 
of ten or fifty thousand dollars for a painting enriches 
the community in which the artist lives. There has been 
something added in the way of treasure to a country’s 
assets by the productions of its artistic genius. The 
very presence of great pictures is a local benefit. Take 
the Sistine Madonna from Dresden, rob Paris of the 
Louvre, despoil London of its National Gallery or Antwerp 
of its Rubens collection, take the Art Museum out of 
Boston, destroy the galleries which are growing up so 
richly in our western cities, and we have depreciated the 
commercial value of all these places far beyond the selling 
price of the pictures. 
“Industrial art and a thorough appreciation of the 
fine arts enable the community that cultivates them to 
compete successfully with the community that neglects 
them. All these things — the expansion of industry, the 
1 Qutline of Practical Sociology,” New York, 1902, pp. 338-339.
-P-A-G-E-179
THE ESTHETIC LIFE 17t 
commercial importance of art, the knowledge of its real 
value — certainly contribute, and largely, too, to the well- 
being of the individual. The rich, by their generous 
contributions in establishing art galleries, are doing 
something more than building monuments to themselves; 
they are offering to the poor man the means of improving 
the leisure earned by his hard labor, and giving him an 
opportunity to find cultured occupation.” ! 
Before dealing with the method of developing 
the esthetic nature in the classroom, it might be 
well to call the attention of our school authorities to 
some obvious facts with reference to the potent in- 
fluence of the child’s school environment as bearing 
on his esthetic culture. There can be no reasonable 
doubt concerning the refining and moralizing effect 
of beauty on the children of the upper grades, as 
manifest in school architecture and school landscape 
gardening. At least as early as the tenth year they 
are susceptible to such influences. In many instances, 
however, school buildings and school grounds are 
conspicuous examples of the ugly, and the effect 
of ugliness is demoralizing. Conditions are improving

architects,” but by architects of ine _abilj

excuse for failure in this respect. It really costs no 
more to design ¢ a 2 beautiful school building than_to, 
design anu “Simplicit implicity is _a_ fundamental 
mark of beauty, and sim nplicity makes for economy. 
The school building should be one of the notable 
  buildings in every community, and. ‘it_ought to be 
a heautiful structure. 
The same may be said of school grounds. As a 
tule, the rule, the grounds a about our jails, penitentiaries 
insane insane asylums are far more beautiful and ve 
than our_school I grounds, as if criminals and lunatics 
deserved more consideration at our hands than 
school children ar hool teachers, who so_often 
are compelled to live a_ good share of ‘their time sur... 
rounded ounded by plain dirt dirt ash | courts, with _with compara- 
tively little shrubbery to to relieve the trying rying monotony, 
of ugliness. _. The lunatic can hardly appreciate the 
beauty of his surroundings, and the criminal, even 
if he could, has very little opportunity to do so, and 
the dear public doesn’t feel inclined to go to either 
place to drink in the ‘“‘charm” of the surroundings, 
or even to loiter long about the grounds for esthetic 
edification ! If an expenditure for such surroundings 
in our public institutions is to be made, why not make 
it in the interests of the rational and law abiding ? 
It makes for a higher culture and for a better citizen- 
ship. 
The interior of the school building ought to receive    
     
-P-A-G-E-181
THE STHETIC LIFE 173 
proper aesthetic consideration also. The interior 
decorations, be they ever so simple, should be in good 
taste. Much of this lies in the teacher’s power, and 
should not escape her serious effort. Pictures and 
flowers can be utilized to advantage. If the teacher 
does not feel herself a competent judge of pictures, 
it is often possible for her to avail herself of the judg- 
ment of persons in the community who are capable of 
performing this office. By all means let the school 
room minister to the zsthetic nature of the child. 
It costs little, and it is worth much. . 
If we pass now to the consideration of the subject 
from the standpoint of the curriculum, it would be 
well, in the moral education of children, to encourage, 
as much as is consistent with the child’s other interests, 
the development of his esthetic nature, by means of 
instruction in at least some of the fine arts. Music, 
poetry; the dance, color work, and drawing may be 
introduced into the curriculum in the early grades. 
Investigations along this line have been made, and 
they indicate that the child is prepared at this time of 
life to undertake such work. With reference to music 
and poetry, it may be said that the feeling for rhythm 
is instinctive, and this furnishes a natural basis for 
our educational effort to develop in children a knowl- 
edge and love of these arts. 
Teachers, however, find more or less difficulty in 
trying to interest pupils in poetry. Most children 
    
-P-A-G-E-182
174 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
love to sing, but children, even of the third, fourth, 
and fifth grades, often express a dislike for poetry. 
May this not be due in a large measure to the fact 
that we overlook the necessity of simple rhythm 
in the verse to which we introduce them, in order 
to acquaint them with the content of the poem? 
More simple lyrical poetry in our schoolbooks might 
produce different results. Poetry of action interests 
the child more than mere descriptive poetry, and if 
the action of the poem be presented objectively, it 
often interests the child intensely. 
The dance, also, is regarded by writers on zsthetics 
as a fine art. It, too, has its roots in the feeling for 
rhythm that is native to the child. This instinctive 
feeling mahifests itself in this form very early, so 
that children _are often taught to dance when four 
years old. j Dancing makes for beauty and grace of 
jody, and for-beauty and grace of manner. These 
gs have social and moral value as well. That is 
interesting as well as trut observation of the sage 
cke on the value of dancing to the child from this 
point of view :—     
   
  ... And since nothing appears to me to give 
Children so much becoming Confidence and Behaviour, and 
so to raise them to the Conversation of those above their 
Age, as Dancing, I think they should be taught to dance 
as soon as they are capable of learning it. For tho’ this 
consist only in outward Gracefulness of Motion, yet, I

know not how, it gives Children manly Thoughts and 
Carriage, more than any thing.” ! 
- Much of the religious prejudice against dancing 
which prevailed in former times has passed away. 
And the objections which are sometimes urged against 
it from the standpaint of sex considerations, if valid 
at all, do not apply to children—except possibly to. 
those of the three upper grades of our elementary 
schools. So, because of its hygienic, social, asthetic, 
as well as its moral value, the teacher of morals should 
encourage dancing. It contributes to the well- ‘being 
of the individual from many points of view, and thus 
it becomes necessary for us to look at it from the 
standpoint of moral obligation when dealing with the 
education of the child. 
Another esthetic discipline or study that should 
be introduced into the curriculum is color work. 
Here again investigations in child psychology reveal 
the fact that the child of the early school grades is 
prepared in capacity"to undertake such work. Before 
the kindergarten period the child has learned to 
apprecidte color contrasts and color values, so that 
when he arrives at the age of the children of the grades, 
he is ready to undertake color work as it is taught in 
the schools. Such work awakens esthetic delight, 
and ‘prepares the way for a larger and finer apprecia-

1889, PP. 42-43.
-P-A-G-E-184
2 176 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
tion of the beauty of nature and art. This appre- 
ciation ministers to his moral nature as well. 
Drawing also should be taught, not merely for utili- 
tarian reasons, as Locke urged, but for esthetic and 
moral reasons as well. The child’s appreciation of 
form develops very early, even though, at first, 
it is doubtless influenced by association. It is mixed 
with other feelings. By the time he reaches the first 
grade of school life he has developed some apprecia- 
tion of outline, symmetry, and proportion. Other 
than purely esthetic factors may have assisted in 
this development, but by the time he becomes a 
candidate for the grades, he is ready to undertake 
drawing as a means of zsthetic culture. 
The same thing may be said with reference to 
modeling.. In both of these exercises it is easy to 
secure esthetic reactions. And this is said with a full 
appreciation of the difference between the direct 
esthetic reactions to real objects and the esthetic ap- 
preciation that involves an understanding of repre- 
sentation, or the imaging of objects. This kind of 
esthetic appreciation is later in its development, 
depending, as it does, on a further development of the 
child’s intelligence. But even such an appreciation of 
representation as art involves, as compared with an im- 
mediate presentation of real objects, is understood by 
the child very early in life. As Sully says, with reference 
to pictorial representation: “Children show very 
     
-P-A-G-E-185
THE ESTHETIC LIFE y 7 
early that picture semblances are understood in the 
sense that they call forth reactions similar to those called 
forth by realities.”! Tracy and Stimpfi place the 
dawn of the idea of representation in the child as 
early as the third or fourth year. So teachers of the 
early grades need have no misgivings as to whether 
the child is mature enough to undertake such work 
as a means of esthetic culture. It must be kept in 
mind, however, that the child’s power, as a rule, 
up to the tenth year, is limited to the expression of 
space in two dimensions. The expression of the 
third dimension is a later development.? It ought! 
not to be overlooked that culture along these lines 
in early years prepares for a refined appreciation 
of art later; and this appreciation cannot fail to 
prove, not merely a source of esthetic delight, but 
also a means of moral development, because of the 
intimate relation between the beautiful and the 
good.    
     
         cava in the child a alove of the 1 beautiful, which 
makes for his ‘moral unfolding. In the upper grades, 
this might be supplemented by the introduction of an

art reader that will introduce the child, in an interest- 
ing, concrete, and pictorial manner, to the great 
paintings, architectural structures, statues, etc., of 
the world. Indeed, pictures of some of these should 
adorn the walls of the schoolroom and halls. Stories 
"of the lives of the artists also serve to develop an 
interest in their work. Such biographical sketches 
might be introduced among the biographical material 
which a series of ethical readers naturally includes, 
for many of these artists were heroes in the sacrifices 
which they made in loyal devotion to their art. 
There are other methods by which the teacher can 
supplement the more immediate work done in the 
class for the development of the child’s love for the 
beautiful in art. Every school should be supplied 
with a stereopticon and slides that could be used for 
the purpose of appealing to and educating the exs- 
thetic nature of the child. The child, as well as the 
grown-up, delights in looking at pictures. The pres- 
ent interest in moving pictures demonstrates this, 
and much can be done for the higher unfolding of the 
child if an intelligent advantage be taken of this 
pictorial “instinct.” Gradually the child can be 
taught to appreciate classic beauty in art under 
the skillful direction of the teacher. The parapher- 
nalia for such purposes are now so available at a 
comparatively small expense that there does not 
seem to be any reasonable excuse for a school not to
-P-A-G-E-187
THE ASTHETIC LIFE 179 
have it as part of its general equipment. It can hardly 
be questioned that the lantern slides and canvas, and 
probably the moving-picture apparatus, are to fig- 
ure conspicuously in the education of the near future, 
and they ought to be used for purposes of esthetic 
and moral culture. Of course, this applies more par- 
ticularly to teaching in the middle and upper elemen- 
tary grades, as it is questionable whether children 
of the lower grades possess the power to appreciate 
the effects of a picture, structure, or landscape as a 
total or whole, as will be remarked on later. 
Occasional excursions to art galleries, wherever 
‘this is possible, constitute another method which may 
be used to advantage by the teacher in cultivating 
the child’s love of the beautiful in art. In most of 
our larger cities such galleries may be found, 
and here the teacher will miss a good opportunity 
for developing the esthetic nature if she fails to 
bring the children to view the collections of paintings 
and statuary which such galleries contain. Again, 
many cities have beautiful public buildings, churches, 
and private residences, and it is well to call attention 
to their beauty, not merely as a matter of civic pride, 
but as a matter of esthetic culture. Children of our 
cities are in the presence of such buildings almost 
daily, and in a subtle but sure manner do they minis- 
ter to the esthetic nature of many who are suscep- 
tible to the esthetic influences of environment. The
-P-A-G-E-188
180 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
more the teacher herself is a person of refined and 
developed taste in this respect, the more will she 
appreciate the value of the ministry of such structures 
to the esthetic life, and: the more will she feel it a 
matter of ethical obligation to make use of them as 
an educational force in the mental and moral life of 
the child. 
But beauty is not confined to the arts. Nature is 
clothed with beauty as with a garment, and, so far 
as possible, we should introduce the child to this 
beauty with the educational aim of developing in him 
a love of the beautiful. The child’s first esthetic 
reactions to the beauty of nature occur at an early 
period in his history. At first, of course, it is confined 
to single objects, and gradually extends to a number 
of objects, which are regarded as constituting a 
whole. The child’s esthetic delight in flowers is man- 
ifest as early, at least, as the fourth year. Usually 
itis the beauty or grace of the movement of individual 
things that he first appreciates. This tendency to deal 
with single objects as moving objects, which manifests 
itself in his early appreciation of beauty, largely 
accounts for his failure to appreciate the beauty of 
the landscape. He cannot grasp the unity in the 
variety. He does not see the many as one. This 
power develops later. This, indeed, is true, also with 
reference to his esthetic appreciation of paintings 
and beautiful buildings. Hence, we must reckon
-P-A-G-E-189
THE ZSTHETIC LIFE 181 
with this inability of early years, and await a ma- 
turer development. 
The city school suffers a disadvantage compared 
with the country school in this respect; and yet, in 
many cities, beautiful parks are maintained, which af- 
ford the teacher an excellent opportunity to cultivate 
in the pupil a love of beauty in nature. Among young 
children interest is dominantly focused on individual 
objects of beauty, or small patches of landscapes, 
rather than on the larger aspects of nature. Hence, 
in dealing with the child’s esthetic nature, the teacher 
will act accordingly. But, later, interest in the larger 
aspects of nature — the field, the river, the forest, the 
sea, the mountains, the landscape, the starry heavens— 
arrests his attention, and calls forth esthetic delight: 
He learns to love them for the pleasure which they 
afford, and there is as much. truth as poetry in Words- 
worth’s claim that nature isa moral teacher. Because 
of the subtle relation that exists between the beautiful 
and the good, nature, through her beauty, ministers 
to the child’s moral being. So that the wise teacher 
of elementary morals will take advantage of this 
fact in her efforts to. moralize the life of the child. 
To this end, she will find it advisable to make fre- 
quent excursions into nature with the children. 
Visits to such abodes of beauty as the fields and 
meadows, the seashore and mountains, when such 
visits are practicable, or into the gardens and parks of
-P-A-G-E-190
182 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
our cities, will appeal to the child, and the subtle and 
often potent influences of such contact with nature 
will have a refining and moralizing effect. Such 
excursions, when physically possible, recommend 
themselves on more grounds than one. Their hy- 
gienic and social advantages are apparent at once, 
so that occasional excursions of this kind easily 
win the approval of parents who may not appreciate 
their esthetic value, and who, on such ground alone, 
might be inclined to oppose them, but most of whom 
welcome an opportunity to have their children enjoy 
a good outing. 
In the beginning of the chapter we referred to the 
esthetic as manifesting itself very early in the child’s 
life. Of course, much of his mental reaction, in his 
earliest years, to external stimuli in the form of 
beautiful objects is doubtless chiefly a matter of the 
sensory. But gradually he reacts to beautiful ob- 
jects in the higher forms of esthetic feeling. Even 
though we were compelled to fix the time for such 
a reaction as late as the tenth year, — as Professor 
Tracy and Dr. Stimpfi do, — there would still remain 
four years of the child’s elementary school experience 
in which to develop the really esthetic feelings. 
During these years he “is able to enter fully into 
those feelings which actuate most adults on beholding 
a beautiful landscape, a splendid painting, or a mag- 
nificent product of architectural skill.” The earlier j
-P-A-G-E-191
THE ASSTHETIC LIFE 183 ne 
esthetic training prepares the way for the later 
culture, and, viewed both from the esthetic and the 
moral standpoints, is certainly worth while. The 
teacher of elementary morals should aim to develop 
in the child a moral attitude toward the beauty with 
which he is surrounded. She should lead him to an 
intelligent appreciation and love of the beautiful as 
a moral obligation, — as something that he owes to 
himself in the interests of his higher development. 
This sanction will add to the potency of the purely 
educational sanctions. 
Another potent means of esthetic education that 
should be encouraged whenever practicable is the 
home and school garden. The hygienic and utilitarian 
advantages that accrue from cultivating such gardens 
add to their value. But, in addition, the esthetic 
and moral benefits derived are great, and make their 
cultivation worth while. In England Mrs. Luther has 
gone so far as to establish a basis for a general 
scheme of education through gardening and _horti- 
culture. This is doubtless overestimating the possi- 
bilities of such training, but certainly the cultivation 
of home and school gardens makes for utilitarian, 
hygienic, intellectual, zsthetic, and moral results. 
In Europe such gardens are utilized as a means of 
education.! In America they have been introduced

in many places, and the value has been demonstrated.1 
Such gardens can easily be established by country 
schools, and by schools in villages and small cities. 
The moral results alone would justify the effort and 
expense involved. 
But beauty is not confined merely to art and 
nature. It is also manifest in conduct and character. 
Indeed much of the language that we use in describing 
conduct and character is composed of terms descrip- 
tive of esthetic qualities and relations. We speak 
of fair deeds and beautiful acts, also of foul deeds 
and repulsive acts. We speak of fit and unfit con- 
duct. We characterize a boy’s conduct as clean or

unclean. Such terms are esthetic terms, but we 
apply them to moral qualities and relations as well. 
It reveals how closely related are the beautiful and 
the good. But not only are they closely related, — 
the good is often the beautiful, and the bad is often 
the ugly. There is an actual beauty of holiness and a 
positive ugliness of vice. And these esthetic aspects 
of good and evil prove to be powerful motives in in- 
fluencing us to choose the one and to reject the other. 
So true is this that often our response to good is more 
of an esthetic than an ethical one. The teacher will 
doubtless recall “the glorious devil’? of Tennyson’s 
poem, ‘The Palace of Art,” who was so decidedly 
xsthetic as to love good only for its beauty. But 
this esthetic aspect of goodness is so pronounced 
that it has much to do in winning us over to righteous- 
ness. The beauty of a kindly act; the loveliness of a 
saintly character — these appeal to us. “Many 
enter into the kingdom of God through the Gate 
Beautiful,”’ said a distinguished scholar, and it is.true. 
Were virtue clad in homely garb, she would not have 
such a large nor such a loyal following. And so 
it is with vice. It is the foulness, the downright 
ugliness of vice, that proves often to be a powerful 
repellent, and helps us in the hour of temptation. 
Aisthetic disgust helps to develop a really moral 
disgust. As educators, then, we must take cogni- 
zance of the beauty of conduct and the beauty of
-P-A-G-E-194
186 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
character, as well as of their opposites, in our 
attempts to develop the moral nature of the 
‘vidual. 
Just how early in his moral unfolding the child 
responds to the beauty of goodness and reacts against 
he ugliness of evil it is difficult to say. This does 
not seem to have attracted the serious attention of 
experimental students of child psychology. But it is 
worth their earnest consideration, and a systematic 
course of investigation along these lines would prove 
fruitful and should be instituted._} Certainly children 
are susceptible to the esthetic 
influence of good conduct and good character, and 
it will be well for the teacher of elementary morals 
to avail herself of the advantages of this fact in her 
work. , It is an interesting thing to note that the 
uty in which children are primarily interested 
in the early years is the beauty of movements, and 
that most of their attempts at drawing concern hu- 
man beings as subjects. So, with this early interest 
in motion or action, and with this great interest in 
personality, it would seem that we might early work 
through the child’s esthetic nature in behalf of 
morality. ere is beauty in human life, and its 
highest expression is to be found in the good conduct 
and good character of the individual. Here, too, 
stories of beautiful lives, of beautiful deeds, and of 
beautiful characters should be used as an effective

CHAPTER XII 
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 
Movern biological science has made us familiar 
with the powerful influence of environment in mold- 
ing the individual. The old problem as to the result 
of transporting twenty Boston babies to Timbuctoo 
has no uncertain answer. They would grow up like 
natives. Some advantages of their heredity might, 
indeed, appear, but in their manners and customs, 
and in their standards of life, they would resemble 
their black neighbors. They would be shaped by their 
surroundings. This shaping process is very manifest 
and effective in the power of school environment. 
When a great English schoolmaster spoke of the 
“almighty wall,” he meant that architecture is a 
moral influence in education. The money which 
the community spends in the erection of good school 
buildings is profitably spent, and bears fruit in better 
citizenship. It is important for the spirit of the school 
that the pupils should be proud of it. The great 
schools of England bring to bear upon youth the im- 
pression of their strength, dignity, and charm. The 
lines of their noble walls, the ivy overgrowing them, 
189
-P-A-G-E-198
190 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
the trees and lawns about them, encourage self- 
respect and courtesy. On the other hand, the 
traditional brutality of life in our country schools 
a few generations ago was intimately connected 
with the bare ugliness of the ordinary country 
schoolhouse. The place offered no suggestion of 
gentle manners. 
ie master of a school who found that the boys 
misused the halls, scribbling on the walls, throwing 
things around carelessly, breaking the glass globes 
of the gas jets, and playing rough games, changed the 
situation, not by making new rules or devising new 
punishments, but by improving the halls. He re- 
formed the manners of the boys by repainting the 
dingy corridors, hanging them with attractive pic- 
tures, and improving the general order. For order 
invites order, and the perception that the school 
authorities care for the comfort and the pleasure 
of the children calls out a quick response. 
In like manner a moral lesson is taught by the ap- 
pearance of the schoolyard. Its carefully kept and 
well-painted fence, its inviting gateway, the neatness 
of the playground, the tended trees with seats under 
them, the shrubs which soften the sharp corners, are 
lessons in the possibilities of plots of ground. They 
show how a proper yard should look. They are a 
constant criticism upon the litter, disorder, and bare- 
ness of the yard at home. When it is perceived that       
       
      
  rete teerneeret
-P-A-G-E-199
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 1091 
all papers which are thrown down are regularly picked 
up, especially when the children themselves are dele- 
gated to pick them up, an instruction is given in one 
of the elements of good citizenship. The children are 
aught not only the satisfaction of neatness and order, 
put the obligation of social responsibility. They 
learn that they are individually responsible for the 
general appearance of the school, and they readily 
proceed to a recognition of their similar relation to 
the town. 
In such ways the school surrounds the life of youth 
with esthetic ideals which affect the moral life of its 
pupils. The yard outside, and the halls and rooms 
inside, are clean and neat and inorder. There are 
not only maps, but pictures on the walls, and flowers 
in the windows. The physical aspect of the place 
assists the discipline of the school. For disorder 
without invites disorder within, and there is a 
vital connection between clean surroundings and a 
clean spirit, just as there is between clean hands 
and a pure heart. The child who goes home from 
the public school and begins to pick things up 
and put them in their places, and sets the room 
to rights, and puts upon the wall a picture from an 
illustrated paper (for even poor art is better than 
no art), is not only helping a tired mother, but is 
assisting to make a new home in which peace and. 
happiness may appropriately dwell. It is true that

in the old story the swept and garnished chamber 
was immediately occupied by.seven devils more than 
had resided_there before.{ Order and neatness will 
not insure good morals; but disorder and dirt en- 
courage bad morals. A well-designed and well- 
built schoolhouse, with a well-kept yard about it, is 
an assistance to all good discipline. The least that 
can be said in its favor is that it is an important step 
to remove those conditions which make bad morals 
easy. 
ow far this example of cleanliness, neatness, and 
order may profitably be carried into direct precept 
is a disputed question. A daily inspection of the 
hands and faces of the pupils is an excellent applica- 
tion of the principle to the individual, and corre- 
sponds—as the children may be told—to the 
“similar inspection of soldiers in the camp, and of 
students in the military schools. But the setting of 
good advice in framed mottoes on the walls, and the 
writing and rewriting of moral maxims in copy books, 
is less effective. If-it seems well to teach morals by 
means of such printed counsels, it is necessary to 
keep in mind the need of novelty as an aid to in- 
fluence. The motto which says the same thing day 
after day becomes a part of the conventional environ- 
ment, like the walls and windows, and ceases to at- 
tract attention. But the arranging of a series of 
_ good sentences to fit the same frames, and the chang-    
       
           
-P-A-G-E-201
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 193 
ing of them week by week, takes into account the 
psychological conditions under which actual impres- 
sions are made. . 
The same arrangement holds good in regard to 
school pictures. After the same picture has hung in 
the same place on the same wall for several months 
the children cease to see it. Put in another, and call 
attention to it, with some interpretation of its mean- 
ing, and there is a new effect. The present condi- 
tions of public education in many places forbid the 
use of many pictures which have been found by ex- 
perience to be most uplifting. The only religion 
which the school officially teaches by its books, its 
pictures, and its statues is that of Greece and Rome. 
Even so, the field of selection is still large. The pur- 
pose is to make the walls speak, and whatever pic- 
ture tells an instructive story is in the line of our 
intention. It is now possible to take almost any pic- 
ture in any book and have it so enlarged by photog- 
raphy as to adapt it to the schoolroom, and many 
famous pictures are to be purchased in enlarged sizes 
for such use, at reasonable prices. 
Kindness to animals is easily taught in pictures. 
The happiness of domestic affection; the contrasting 
consequences of idleness, selfishness, and intemper- 
ance; the splendor of courage in the face of peril on 
land and sea; these and other moral lessons may be 
brought to the assistance of youth by means of the 
co

                             illustrations which enliven the walls of the school- 
room, like pictures in a book. 
The morals of good citizenship are naturally en-. 
forced by such pictorial teaching. The pictures will 
show the faces of the leaders and heroes of the nation, 
and of the events in which they enacted their great 
parts. The explorers, the colonists, the soldiers of 
the determining wars will appear in illustration, and 
the children will learn the fact that the nation was 
established by self-sacrifice, and that the blessings of 
our present life became possible by the pain and hard- 
ship of those who suffered for our sake. Other pic- 
tures will show the wonders and beauties of our 
country, its cities, plains, mountains, harvests. 
The morals of international relationships may be 
shown in pictures. The depicting of the actual horrors 
of wars in contrast with the peaceful and just settle- 
ments of the Hague Tribunal may assist a citizenship 
in which patience and intelligence may take the place 
of passion. Other lands may be made to yield their 
interest in pictures of their scenery and people. The 
horizon of human relationship may thus be widened. 
The daily discipline of a good school is a constant 
in morals. The idea of order that is sug- 
gested in the appearance of the school is here perceived 
in action. There is a regu system into which 
the individual must enter. JHe must subordinate his 
own desires and impulses to the general social wel- tea ial 
    
   
 
-P-A-G-E-203
    THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 195 
fare. Thus he learns the elementary virtue of obe- 
dience. He takes orders and obeys them. He be- 
comes accustomed to an authority which he must 
respect. The conditions of home life in crowded 
places often make the enforcement of parental au- 
thority difficult. There is frequently a confusion 
and an irritation accompanying it which naturally 
invite resistance rather than submission. Life often 
is a struggle between the will of a weary or incom- 
petent parent and the will of an active child. In 
the nature of the case authority is discredited. It 
does not command the child’s respect. It lacks the 
elements of calmness, justice, and consistency. Thus 
home is often a hindrance to that citizenship which 
rests on the basis ofstrong authority. The boys and 
girls come out of it into the street without regard for 
law. They lack the fundamental quality of obe- 
dience. This must be supplied, if it is to be had at 
all, by the influence of the school. The conditions 
make the task of the teacher difficult, but they magnify 
its importance. Upon the virtue of obedience depend 
both the happiness and goodness of the child and 
the peace of the community. The daily discipline” 
which demands this virtue is essential to our moral 
welfare. It is a kind of preventive treatment, deal- 
ing with the early symptoms of the disease of lawless- 
ness which menaces our cities like a plague. 
The discipline that is founded on the virtue of
-P-A-G-E-204
196 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
obedience teaches self-restraint, patience, steadfast- 
ness, mastery of difficult tasks, consideration for the 
tights of others, and many other social qualities. 
The quiet room, the enforced attention, the required 
courtesy of speech and conduct, the necessity of 
accomplishment, the obligation of order, are all parts 
of a moral] atmosphere in which children live under the 
school roof half a dozen hours a day. 
Nevertheless, it is plain that this influence is by no 
means universally effective. Boys and girls go out 
from the discipline of the school, some of them greatly 
helped, others apparently unaffected. This is in part 
by reason of the differences in temperament, and of 
the differences in the conditions of the out-of-school 
life, which make improvement difficult or easy. 
Thus the parable of the sower shows the same seed 
growing into very different harvests according to the 
differences in the soil. But a part of the reason why 
some children are unhelped by the moral discipline 
of the school is to be found in the fact that the dis- 
cipline repels rather than attracts them. They hate 
it, and react from it. They regard the school, as in 
many instances children of a previous generation re- 
garded the severity of their homes, as a bondage 
from which to escape. The fact that the school is 
intended for their good prejudices them against it; 
it is associated with medicine, restriction, and punish- 
ment which are also intended for their good. Like
-P-A-G-E-205
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 197 
the man in the psalm, they hate to be reformed. They 
are of the mind of Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah 
the Ammonite who, when they heard that there was 
come a man to seek the welfare of the children of 
Israel, were “grieved exceedingly.” 
On the other hand, children commonly begin to. 
go to school with great expectations. They are de- 
lighted with the new experience. One of the problems 
of education is to discover how to maintain this 
initial interest. It is plain that something is the 
matter. Some misreading of the nature of youth 
changes this palace into a prison. The most serious 
aspect of this common failure of the school is that it 
vitiates the moral atmosphere. It dulls or destroys 
that receptivity on which the moral value of the 
school depends. The lessons of the books are learned, 
because this learning can be made a matter of inevi- 
table obligation, but the lesson of the school itself is 
lost in the child’s resentment at the school’s existence. 
There is a possible solution of at least a part of this 
difficulty in the new liberty which the Montessori 
method would introduce into education. The periods 
of enforced quiet may be shortened, and more op- 
portunity presented for that activity of body which is 
instinctive in the growing child. Then, too, the pro- 
cesses of instruction may be made more interesting 
by relating them more evidently to the conditions of 
actual life. Thus geography may begin with the
-P-A-G-E-206
198 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
facts which are in plain sight, the local river, or hill, 
or plain, and extend gradually into the distance. 
History may be at first concerned with the annals of 
the town, the district, the state, and so on back to 
Greece and Rome, to the Euphrates and the Nile. 
Local geology, local botany, the biology of the fields, 
the chemistry of the kitchen appeal to the natural 
curiosity of youth. In these directions the school is 
making education interesting, and is at the same time 
developing children into intelligent citizens. One 
reason why many children quickly lose interest in the 
school is because they do not understand what it is 
all about. They do not see the good of it. There is 
no plain relation in their minds between their lessons 
and their lives. The school misses that point of con- 
tact which is the initial necessity in all effective in- 
struction. This contact is effected by the more 
definite moralizing of education; that is, by keeping 
the connection ciear between the school’s work and 
the desired result: an intelligent, competent, depend- 
able; and useful citizen. For example, a report on the 
methods of moral instruction in Germany finds “the 
‘lowe of home, city, and country earnestly inculcated”’ 
in the lessons in geography. “‘A sense of natural 
beauty, of admiration for great and good citizens, of 
civic duty and respect for law is cultivated. The 
duty of the city to provide schools, water and light, 
good roads, police, etc., is explained. Small social
-P-A-G-E-207
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 199 
duties are pointed out: ‘If you pick up something 
in the street, what must you do with it?’ ‘If you see 
an accident, to whom must you tell it?’ ““To whom 
do the public buildings and gardens belong?’ and 
the duty following on ownership is made clear. The 
names and services of great statesmen, writers, and 
philanthropists, born in their city, are familiar to 
children of eight and ten.” 
Such instruction, however, is difficult because it is 
_ not provided for to any great extent in text-books. 
The materials are for the most part accessible enough, 
but they are not arranged for the teacher’s use in 
lessons. The moralizing of education by making use 
of local facts and conditions for the training of chil- 
dren to live their immediate lives depends accordingly 
upon the teacher. The moral atmosphere of the 
school, like its physical atmosphere, is determined 
by the teacher. It is the teacher who opens the win- 
dows, or keeps them closed. And this applies to all 
kinds of windows through which children look out 
upon the world in which they live. It is in the per- 
sonality of the teacher, as much, indeed, as in the 
method, that the problems of the interest and value of 
education are to be worked out. 
The teacher whose ideals consist in a quiet school- 
room and a successful examination at the end of the 
term may achieve certain results, but at the same time 
may make school children hate the school, and thus
-P-A-G-E-208
200 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
may bring to naught all the moral opportunities. 
Boys and girls may go out from such a school know- 
ing how to read and write and cipher, but ignorant 
of the value of the virtues, and resenting authority. 
They may be sent out into the community equipped 
to do evil intelligently, and inclined to do it. The 
very excellence of the intellectualized instruction may 
make the school a menace to the state. 
i is only by moralizing instruction that it is 
made either interesting or effective, It commands 
the attention and the respect of youth by being evi- 
dently practical, worth while, and applicable to life. 
The teacher’s true ideal is a good citizen. The 
teacher’s moral problem is to make the school life 
yield that fine result. Everything is to be made to 
bend that way. The conduct of the school, the care 
of the fabric, the pictures on the walls, the songs which 
are sung and learned by heart, the lessons which are 
taught, are all to be in harmony with the flag which 
floats over the school roof. But the first essential to 
that harmony is the spirit of the teacher. 
The most influential moral fact about the school is 
the presence of the teacher. For the most valuable 
contribution which a good school can make to the 
equipment of a growing citizen is a point of view, a 
way of looking at things, a sense of values. And this, 
for good or ill, the teacher gives. It all depends upon 
the teacher’s personality. The details of most of the
-P-A-G-E-209
THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 201 
lessons are eventually forgotten, but the impression 
of the teacher remains. The sincerity, the fairness, 
the sympathy, the kindness, the patience, the cour- 
tesy of the teacher, or the lack of those qualities are 
the ambassadors of moral influence. They prepare 
the way, or block it, for acceptance of the teacher’s 
ideals of life. What is taught is learned, or not, ac- 
cording as these virtues prevail in the teacher’s life. 
They make the school liked or disliked; they make it 
morally effective or ineffective. Without them, the 
teacher may give the most admirable instruction in 
all the aspects of the moral life, and achieve meager 
moral results. With them, the instruction may be 
not so admirable and yet be crowned with splendid 
moral accomplishment. The most important part of 
the moralizing of the school consists in the moralizing 
of the teacher. And, in the hands of a teacher whose 
life itself is an expression of the cardinal virtues, a 
system of moral culture becomes a powerful instru- 
ment in the moralization of the pupil.

CHAPTER XIII 
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 
A Book on the subject of moral training would not 
be complete without some reference to the relations 
of morality and religion, and the significance of these 
relations for moral education. Religion is not an 
artificial thing grafted on human nature. It is an 
integral part of human nature itself. It is native to 
the soul. (Man is just as essentially religious as he 
is social, political, moral, and esthetic in nature. 
Anthropology and psychology bear testimony to 
this fact. The former affirms the practical univer- 
sality of religion, and the latter shows a man’s capacity 
for it, and' the history of the race reveals that religion 
has been intimately associated with his moral develop- 
ment. 
Religion, in its highest form, affirms our relation to 
an unseen order —to a personal God who rules in 
righteousness, and to an immortal life in which virtue 
is rewarded and vice punished. Opinions will differ 
as to the nature of such reward and punishment, but 
Christian believers at least seem to be at one con- 
cerning the fundamental fact that “whatsoever a man 
202
-P-A-G-E-211
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 203 
soweth that shall he also reap” — both in this life 
and in the life which is to come. 
Now belief in a God who approves righteousness and 
disapproves unrighteousness —— who vouchsafes aid 
to the good and punishes the evil — has proven, and 
continues to prove, a powerful factor in the develop- 
ment of character and conduct, both in the individual 
and in the race. To add these religious sanctions to 
the ethical sanctions cannot fail to influence power- 
fully the moral life. Kant conceives of religion as the 
Divine sanction of morality. Whatever else it may 
be, it is at least this, and it can be utilized most 
effectively in the promotion of right living. To be- 
lieve in a God who approves and aids men in the great 
struggle to do right, and thus to feel that ultimately 
right will triumph over wrong; ial ‘and to. believe in the 
imperishability of good character, i in the immortality 
of virtue, cannot fail to be an inspiration to him who 
is fighting the battle for righteousness, both in his 
own life and in the life of society. On the other hand, 
to believe that God punishes evil doing, not only here 
and now, but also hereafter —no matter in. what 
manner — undoubtedly proves a deterrent to wrong 
conduct. The dreams that may come “in that sleep 
of death” “must give us pause”; and “the dread of 
something after death . . . puzzles the will . . . thus 
conscience does make cowards of us all.” The moral- 
ity that is determined by such motives may not be
-P-A-G-E-212
204 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
ity that it restrains. (So that religion is bound to con- 
tinue to bea most powerful influence in the moral 
life of man, 
If we regard moral education from the standpoint 
of religion, we must try to make the religious sanctions 
operative as motives in the child’s moral life. Most 
people, and especially most young people, need more 
than the ordinary moral sanctions. They need the 
supreme assistance that religion affords. Conscious- 
ness of the presence of God, and belief in present and 
future reward and punishment, constitute motives 
which, when they become part of life, carry youth out 
of the protection and constant course of the home and 
school into the independence of the world, prepared 
to encounter temptation. They tend to create a 
goodness that upholds the soul in situations where 
moral restraint alone might not avail. 
The fact that it is helpful to be under observation 
applies not only to childhood and youth, but to the 
whole course of human life. We are all better be- 
cause of the fact that we live under the eyes of our 
acquaintances. But the observation sometimes fails 
us. Boys and girls who have been cared for wisely, 
and watched diligently, go out beyond that kind 
of ministration into the affairs of life. They still 
need it, — more, perhaps, than ever. They should be 
taught to find it in the consciousness of the presence of the highest type, 6 it is better than the immoral- 
S
-P-A-G-E-213

of God. They should be enabled to say to themselves 
in the hour of temptation, “Thou, God, seest me.” 
Furthermore human nature is so constituted as_to 
need to be reminded of consequences. ‘When the 
apostles said to Jesus, “We have left all and followed 
Thee, what shall we have therefore ?”” we perceive 
that the question is not quite in accord with the’per- 
fection of the saints, but we perceive also that in 
it human nature frankly speaks, and the supreme 
Teacher took this into account when he brought the 
future to assist the present: ‘“ Whatsoever a man 
soweth that shall he also reap.” Thus the conse- 
quences are made to depend for their certainty, not on 
a revelation, but on the universal laws of being. Boys 
and girls should come from school not only with an 
absolute conviction that the consequence of adding 
two to two is four, but with a conviction no less ab- 
solute that the consequence of adding sin to sin is 
death, — the death of the soul. The phrase may 
be taken to mean annihilation, or eternal punishment, 
or any other kind of loss. It matters little; the 
main thing is the firm assurance that sin leads to loss, 
as the eating of unwholesome food leads to disease. 
According to the universal laws of the universe, even 
neglect is punished; the neglected soul suffers, like 
the neglected body. : . 
The principal virtues of the religious life based on 
the child’s immediate relations to God are faith,
-P-A-G-E-214
206 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
obedience, gratitude, love, reverence, and prayer. By 
faith is not meant subscription to creed or dogma, 
but simple belief and trust in God and in His goodness. 
Obedience is conformity to His will as the practical 
measure of moral obligation.! Gratitude is thankful 
recognition of God’s kindness as manifested in His 
provision for all our wants, — physical, mental, and 
spiritual. Love involves desire to hold fellowship 
with, as well as desire to serve, the Heavenly Father. 
Reverence is a fitting emotional attitude towards 
God’s greatness and goodness. Prayer is recognition 
of our dependence on God which seeks expression in 
asking for divine assistance, and in thankful acknowl- 
edgment of the same. 
These virtues are closely related and, of course, 
more or less overlap. They should be developed in 
every child, and the best method of cultivating them 
is to give the child sane ideas or conceptions of God. 
Children should be taught the fatherhood of God — 
that they are children of the Heavenly Father, who 
loves them and cares for them. His bountiful pro- 
vision for their physical wants, as manifest in nature, 
can be easily illustrated. The food we eat, the water 
we drink, the clothes we wear, the air we breathe, 
the fire that keeps us warm, etc., all lend themselves 
to illustrate the providential care of the Divine Father. 
1It is not meant by this that God’s will is the ultimate ground of 
moral obligation in the philosophical sense.
-P-A-G-E-215
Me y 
; RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 207 
j Gradually, attention should be called to the higher 
spiritual blessings of God’s fatherly love. To teach 
children in this manner that they. are the children of 
God is to secure a wholesome, natural response in 
t the form of simple trust, obedience, gratitude, love, 
{ reverence, and prayer. When the child knows that 
his Heavenly Father is loving and kind, it is much 
easier to secure reverential obedience. And when, 
@ further, the child is made acquainted with this will 
as a righteous will that approves the good and dis- 
approves the evil, it will be easier to obtain reverential 
conformity to it, and the other virtues naturally 
follow. It is better to appeal to him from this point 
of view than from the standpoint of abject fear. 
Too often kas the child been restrained from wrong 
doing by presenting unworthy conceptions of God as a 
stern and cruel lawgiver and executioner, or concep- 
tions of equal unworthiness. John Fiske, in one of his 
interesting and suggestive books, tells us of hisboyhood 
conception of God as a great big man, sitting behind 
a desk, with an open ledger, keeping account of his 
sins; and Professor Bowne, in commenting upon this 
conception, sardonically adds, ‘And especially down 
on that particular boy.” Unfortunately this is 
representative of much of the kind. of teaching that 
has been indulged in with reference to the nature of 
God and of His relations to us. Instead of drawing 
the child to God, such teaching really alienates him. 
ee a ele lee bi sin i, ali SMM ar ili cs,
-P-A-G-E-216
208 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
God’s will becomes obnoxious and irksome instead of 
attractive. Such teaching means spiritually flogging 
the child into obedience to a kind of arbitrary will 
rather than winning him into a recognition of the 
worth or goodness of a loving Father’s will, Far 
better is it to lead children to feel that God is a kind 
and gracious Father, who loves the good, who is in- 
terested in His children, and desires that they should 
be good, because goodness is better than evil. 
President Hall favors a different mode of procedure. 
He declares : — 
“The child’s conception of God should not be personal 
or too familiar at first, but He should appear distant and 
vegue, inspiring awe and reverence far more than love; 
in a word, as the God of nature rather than as devoted 
to serviceable ministrations to the child’s individual wants. 
The latter should be taught to be a faithful servant rather 
than a favorite of God. The inestimable pedagogic value 
of the God-idea consists in that it widens the child’s 
glimpse of the whole, and gives the first presentiment of 
the universality of laws, such as are observed in its ex- 
periences and that of others, so that all things seem com- 
prehended under one stable system of government. The 
slow realization that God’s laws are not like those of 
parents and teachers, evadible, suspensible, but change- 
less, and their penalties sure as the laws of nature, is a 
most important factor of moral training. First, the law, 
the schoolmaster, then the Gospel ; first, nature, thengrace, 
is the order of growth.” ! 
' Hall, “ Youth, Its Education, Regimen, and Hygiene,” New York, 
2912, p. 355.
-P-A-G-E-217
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 209 
We cannot accept this view. After all, what we 
are aiming at in religious training is to secure a loving 
obedience to God’s will on the part of the child. We 
aim to do this because this will is a righteous will. 
And the question is, How can such loving obedience 
best be secured? The most natural method of pro- 
cedure is to introduce the child to God, and his rela- 
experience the child understands in a measure what 
fatherhood and motherhood mean. In the large 
majority of cases he knows that it means loving care, 
protection, provision for wants, etc. He knows, too, 
that it means acceptance of the parents’ will as the 
measure of right and wrong. It means, too, on the 
part of the child, an association of worth with the 
parents’ personality. This being so, it is a natural 
and easy ascent from such experience with his earthly 
parents to the conception of and belief in the Heavenly 
Parent’s will as the measure of duty, and to the 
Heavenly Father’s personality as representing the 
highest worth. Then obedience to God’s will follows 
quite naturally, and with it, or following closely after 
it, will come the other religious virtues as well. 
If we thus teach the child the Fatherhood of God, 
he understands from his experience with his earthly 
parents that parental love involves both approval and 
disapproval of his conduct. Love involves both, 
and such approbation and disapprobation can be 
P

utilized as powerful motives in the child’s moral life. 
The approval and disapproval of his father and 
mother are at first unquestionably the most infiuen- 
tial motives in his daily life. Dr. Hall does not ex- 
aggerate the case in his admirable words : — 
“The will, purpose, and even mood of small children, 
when alone, are fickle, fluctuating, contradictory. Our 
very presence imposes one general law on them, viz., 
that of keeping our good will and avoiding our dis- 
pleasure. As the plant grows towards the light, so they 
unfold in the direction of our wishes, felt as by divination. 
They respect all you smile at, even buffoonery; look up 
in their play to call your notice, to study the lines of your 
sympathy, as if their chief vocation was to learn your 
desires. Their early lies are often saying what they think 
will please us, knowing no higher touchstones of truth. 
If we are careful to be wisely and without excess happy 
and affectionate when they are good, and saddened and 
slightly cooled in manifestations of love if they do wrong, 
the power of association in the normal, eupeptic child 
will early choose right as surely as pleasure increases 
vitality. If our love is deep, obedience is an instinct if not 
a religion. The child learns that while it cannot excite 
our fear, resentment, or admiration, etc., it can act on our 
love, and this should be the first sense of its own efficiency. 
Thus, too, it first learns that the way of passion and im- 
pulse is not the only rule of life, and that something is 
gained by resisting them. It imitates our acts long before 
it can understand our words. As if it felt its insignificance, 
and dreaded to be arrested in some lower phrase of its 
development, its instinct for obedience becomes almost a
-P-A-G-E-219

passion. As the vine must twine or grovel, so the child 
' comes unconsciously to worship idols, and imitates bad 
patterns and examples in the absence of worthy ones. 
| He obeys as with a deep sense of being our chattel, and 
4 at bottom, admires those who coerce him, if the means be 
wisely chosen. The authority must, of course, be ascen- 
4 dancy over heart and mind. The more absolute such au- 
, thority the more the will is saved from caprice and feels 
the power of steadiness. Such authority excites the unique, 
unfathomable sense of reverence, which measures the 
capacity for will-culture, and is the strongest and soundest 
of all moral motives. It is also the most comprehensive, 
for it is first felt only towards persons, and personality 
is a bond, enabling any number of complex elements 
to act or be treated as a whole, as everything does and is 
in the child’s soul, instead of in isolation and detail. In 
the feeling of respect culminating in worship almost 
all educational motives are involved, but especially those 
which alone can bring the will to maturity; and happy 
the child who is bound by the mysterious and constraining 
sympathy of dependence, by which, if unblighted by cyni- 
cism, a worthy mentor directs and lifts the will. This un- 
conscious reflection of our character and wishes is the 
diviner side of childhood, by which it is quick and re- 
sponsive to everything in its moral environment.” t 
If this be true, as undoubtedly it is true, then why 
not take advantage of this fact in our efforts to secure 
the child’s obedience to God’s will. If his conception 
of God is that of a loving Heavenly Father, then this 
Father’s approval and disapproval, just as his earthly 
1 Ob. cit., PP. 332, 333-
-P-A-G-E-220
212 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
father’s approval, must act as a potent motive in the 
child’s life. 
A difficult problem arises when we try to represent 
the divine disapproval in the form of actual punish- 
ment. It is well to emphasize the fact of divine dis- 
pleasure, but just how to represent the manifestations 
of that displeasure is not an easy task. With very 
young children it is questionable whether it is wise to 
refer to “future punishment” — punishment after 
death. It is better to deal with the present life. We 
can point out the fact that God punishes through the 
laws of his world. This can be illustrated very simply 
by showing the child how, if we violate the laws of our 
physical being, which is part of God’s universe, we 
suffer — we are punished. Gradually we can teach 
him that in a like manner we suffer, not only here, but 
hereafter, if we violate the laws of our spiritual being. 
In dealing with this subject, however, extreme care 
should be taken, not to give the child unworthy 
conceptions of God. Such representations cannot 
develop a wholesome religious life in the child. The 
“Thou shalt nots” are necessary, but the consequences 
of failing to heed them should not be presented to the 
child in such a manner as to lead to conceptions of God 
that would make a development of genuine love for 
Him impossible. 
As God’s will relates largely to man’s duty to him- 
self and to his neighbor we can easily see how the
-P-A-G-E-221
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 213 
religious sanctions can be utilized in training the child 
in the virtues and protecting him from the vices 
growing out of his relations to himself and to society. 
In other words, we can bring the divine approval and 
disapproval to bear on our efforts to establish children 
in the bodily, intellectual, social, political, and e#s- 
thetic virtues, and to guard them against the corre- 
sponding vices. God’s will is on the side of human 
righteousness. It approves and rewards virtue, and 
disapproves and punishes vice. When the child is led 
to understand this, moral training becomes much more 
effective. 
To the above religious teaching in its relation to 
morality might be added the example of Christ. 
This, at least, will be done by the Christian. As 
the old adage says, ‘‘Example is more powerful than 
precept.” Such a notable example of loyalty to the 
highest ideals will probably be more powerful in the 
life of youth than in the life of childhood, for it is 
especially in middle adolescence that the altruism of 
human nature manifests itself in a pronounced man- 
ner, and it is then that the sublime altruism of Jesus 
will strongly appeal to young people. Nevertheless, 
the child is by no means completely self-centered. 
His altruistic nature manifests itself early, and the 
example of Jesus may prove effective, especially with 
children of the age of those in the higher elementary 
grades. This example should figure in the moral and
-P-A-G-E-222
214 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOE AND HOME 
religious instruction of the home and the private 
school. 
Moral training, then, cannot properly be divorced 
from religion. In such training of children we ought 
to avail ourselves of the religious sanctions as they 
telate to duty to self and duty to others. And the 
virtues that grow out of the child’s immediate re- 
lation to his Heavenly Father should also be recog- 
nized and taught. We should also avail ourselves 
of the example of Jesus. All this can be done in the 
home and in the private school without opposition ; 
but a different situation confronts us in the public 
school. 
Having a population, part Jew, part Catholic, part 
Protestant, our public schools must take this situa- 
tion into account. The names stand for differences 
whose significance is not only of the past but of the 
present. They represent mighty and continuing 
controversies which have wrought their arguments 
into deep prejudices. We may deplore the fact, but 
here it is, and we must reckon with it. It means 
that nothing anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, or anti-Prot- 
estant may be permitted to enter into our public in- 
struction in the schools. 
The claim of agnostic or atheist parents to be like- 
wise considered is quite a different matter. We can- 
not take account of individual departures from our 
common customs and opinions. Persons thus depart-
-P-A-G-E-223
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 215 
ing must themselves pay for the luxury of dissent. 
Otherwise, we are under the tyranny of small minori- 
ties. It is obviously absurd to ask a God-fearing 
community to take the name of God out of the text- 
books of the common schools because two or three 
citizens do not believe that God exists. Such a pro- 
cedure would change religious liberty into astate of 
narrow limitation such as now controls the govern- 
ment of France. 
There are French officials who do not dare to go to 
church. A Christian man in public office is debarred 
from the free exercise of his religion by the fear of 
hurting somebody’s feelings. Text-books which teach 
the resources and splendors of France have been 
changed so as to omit all reference to churches. No 
mention is made of the cathedrals which are the glory 
of such places as Rouen and Amiens. The pictures 
of such buildings have been cut out. The only 
people who enjoy religious liberty in France at pres- 
ent are those who do not believe in religion. This, 
of course, is a reaction from a local situation, and 
there are many reasons for it, good and bad. We 
refer to it as illustrating the possibility of bringing 
people into bondage in the name of freedom. It is 
an example of the narrowness of breadth. After all, 
the American people are by history and in fact Chris- 
tians; at least, they are of the religion of the Bible. 
Our brethren and fellow-citizens who dissent from
-P-A-G-E-224
216 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
that large definition of religion are at liberty to hold 
their own negation, and so to teach their children. 
They are not at liberty to deprive their neighbors of 
the privilege of the presence of religion in the schools. 
They may not strike out that great element of past 
and present life. 
The differences between Jews, Catholics, and Prot- 
estants, however, are represented by such large 
sections of our population that they must be con- 
sidered. They cannot be disregarded on the ground 
that they signify individual or local or temporary 
prejudices. But the differences, while immensely 
important, still leave great tracts of essential agree- 
ment. It ought to be possible to present religion in 
such a way as to attain the vital purpose of such 
teaching without getting into the entanglements of 
controversy. 
This might be done by adopting one of the follow- 
ing three methods: In the first place, the relations 
of religion to morality, as explained above, are plainly 
taught in hundreds of pages of the Bible with no 
reference whatever to the religious disputes and con- 
troversies that divide Jew and Christian. To bring 
these pages together in the form of a lectionary for 
public schools ought not to be a difficult task. Two 
hundred such readings would bring before a school in 
the course of a year such reminder and affirmation of 
the presence of God and of our relations to Him, as
-P-A-G-E-225
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 217 
well as of the consequences of conduct, as should for- 
tify children and youth against the inevitable moral 
difficulties in a manner that mere instruction in morals 
will not do. And Jews, Catholics, and Protestants 
could heartily unite in the selection of appropriate 
prayers. 
Another method of training the child in the religious 
life which should be acceptable to Jew, Catholic, and 
Protestant is the use of literary and religious readers 
similar to the ethical readers so frequently referred to 
in these pages. . By means of the indirect method — 
the story method — the religious sanctions, as they re- 
late to the child’s duties to himself and to others, and 
the duties growing out of his immediate relation to 
God, might be systematically presented. Such story 
material is abundant, and it could be carefully ar- 
ranged in the form of readers. They should contain 
nothing that would not prove acceptable to Jew, 
Catholic, and Protestant. Such a religious reader 
might, because of its literary quality, be used as a 
supplementary reader in the class in reading, or it 
could serve as a source book for the teacher in the class 
in morals. She could supplement the moral story 
with a religious story, dealing with the same virtue. 
This would add to the purely ethical motives the 
religious motives as well. / 
A third method, similar to the one: adopted in 
Germany, would be to have the school authorities
-P-A-G-E-226
218 MORAL TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL AND HOME 
grant the churches a half day per week for purposes 
of the religious instruction of children. Or, as in 
Australia, an hour per week. Under such an arrange- 
ment, Jews could teach Jewish children, Catholics 
could teach children of that persuasion, and Prot- 
estants could instruct Protestant children. As in 
Germany, so here, the school authorities might in- 
sist upon competent instruction. Under such circum- 
stances the work done could receive credit just as 
work done in arithmetic or in history. On the whole, 
either the first or second method stated above seems 
to be the simplest and most practicable for our coun- 
try, and it would seem as-though Jew, Catholic, and 
Protestant might unite on such a program for the 
recognition of religion by our public schools, and for 
the benefits that would result from religious instruc- 
tion. If the function of the school, as we maintain, 
is to send out, not merely persons who can read, write, 
and cipher, but good citizens, then it is plain that the 
highest service that the school can render to the com- 
munity is to secure the goodness of these citizens by 
founding it on the soundest possible basis. If what 
has been said on the relations of religion to morality 
be true, then we should not be content in moral train- 
ing with presenting merely the moral sanctions of 
conduct, but should make use of the religious sanc- 
tions as well. 
, In the meantime, and even in the fulfillment of
-P-A-G-E-227
RELIGION AND MORAL TRAINING 219 
these ideals, the most effective reénforcement of mo : 
rality with religion is in the person of the reverent 
teacher. The personality of the teacher is the con- 
stant text-book of the school. The religious teacher, 
conscious of God, devoted to the highest ideals, look- 
ing toward the life unseen and immortal, will over- 
come all limitations and temporary hindrances, and 
make the school a religious influence. Morality will 
be infused with religion as flowers are filled with 
fragrance. :

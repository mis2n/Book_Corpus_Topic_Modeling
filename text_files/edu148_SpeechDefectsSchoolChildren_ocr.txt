EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue school system has grown increasingly flexi- 
ble during the last twenty years. Its effort to 
adapt itself to the peculiar problems of special 
groups of pupils constitutes one of its most 
substantial achievements in efficiency. Special 
provisions for the deaf and dumb, the blind, the 
tubercular, the crippled, the mentally defective, 
and the exceptionally gifted are among the means 
now employed by large school systems to equalize 
educational opportunity. In each case initiative 
has been stimulated the moment the facts of a 
particular neglected need have been adequately 
presented to the school administrator. Then ex- 
periment ensued, followed by the garnering of 
experience’s best results. Once the program of 
practical procedure has been evolved, special 
teachers have been trained for the new respon- 
sibility. Within a decade, what was once a new 
and somewhat startling innovation has become a 
completely accepted tradition of the schools. This 
has been the history of every type of special in- 
struction now included in the school organization.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
At this moment we are aware of another special- 
ized responsibility, one to which schoolmasters 
have been more than half-blind — the correction 
of radical speech defects. In spite of all our theo- 
retic intent in the teaching of reading and elocu- 
tion, we have done nothing for the unfortunate 
group of stammerers and stutterers always found 
in the school system. At best such methods as 
have been employed in these traditional studies 
have been without basis in scientific diagnosis 
and treatment. In consequence they have been 
worse than futile. They have merely permitted 
the social and vocational handicaps of the afflicted 
to persist and become aggravated. The day when 
we may continue this policy has passed. We have 
become sensitive to our neglect and failure and 
we are ready to adopt a program for the pedagogi- 
cal care of speech defects. Already we face a de- 
mand for accurate information upon this subject. 
More, we are asking for practical scientific meth- 
ods in the reconstruction of the speech habits of 
our children. 
As is usually the case, the attempt to deal with 
markedly pathological conditions finally focuses 
attention upon minor disorders that usually escape 
notice. For a long time Americans have been 
told that they possess unpleasant voices. The 
viii

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
monotony, the harshness, the nasality, and the 
slovenliness of American speech have often been 
called to our attention, most frequently by those 
who suffer the sudden contrast and revelation of 
coming into our midst after years of life among 
those British and Latin peoples who have evolved 
a more congenial set of speech habits. These 
lesser handicaps, zsthetic, at any rate, have like- 
wise become part of our educational problem and 
consequently part of the responsibility of every 
school teacher. For the efficiency of every Ameri- 
can classroom teacher, as well as for the better 
development of special teachers of correct speech, 
the editor offers a volume of facts and methods 
on the correction of speech difficulties. It is with 
a great sense of relief that we save the more con- 
scientious of teachers the baffling task of trying 
to collect essential wisdom from scattered medi- 
cal and pedagogical treatises upon this subject. 
It is with a confident sense of service that we 
present an invaluable work by an eminent medical 
specialist with experienced insight into pedagogi- 
cal ways and means. So much practical informa- 
tion on speech correction has never before been 
made accessible to teachers in such handy form.

IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH 
SpEeEcH and its excellences and defects are more 
a matter of habit, more the impress of our en- 
vironment, more due to the speech we have per- 
sistently heard, than we realize. Observing hab- 
its of bad utterance years after they have become 
ingrained, we are apt to lose sight of the long 
periods during which they have been running 
and to look upon them as matters of the present 
moment alone. This, however, is not only a su- 
perficial but a false view of the matter. If our 
results are to be at all trustworthy, we must 
learn to consider every speech problem that pre- 
sents itself in what may be called its historical 
aspect. Methods used for eradication of bad hab- 
its of speech must be based upon a knowledge 
of the way in which those habits were formed. 
It will be well, therefore, to consider some of the 
habits of early childhood before turning to the 
broader aspects of our_subject.

  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
I. Speech habits of childhood hard to 
eradicate 
As we review the history of speech disorders 
through the long years of their persistence, one 
of the first things that we discover is the diffi- 
culty experienced in their eradication.” Speech 
defects are always hard to cure.”This difficulty 
may be illustrated in numerous ways. Recall the 
foreign accent that remains with some people 
and marks their every utterance. A foreign ac- 
cent is often one of the most difficult things to 
live down.»’It is sometimes impossible to cure. 
It gives a good illustration of the difficulty of 
eradicating bad habits planted in early childhood. 
Again, consider the faulty pronunciation of the 
letter s which we call the lisp. This is simply 
one of those bad habits started in childhood 
which has persisted for years without being elim- 
inated, without being outgrown, and all the 
years of faulty pronunciation have so deepened 
this faulty utterance that eradication is made 
very hard; in fact, the difficulty is so great that 
one speech teacher has said that it takes a year 
to eradicate a marked lisp. Compare this to the 
eradication of other physical defects, such, for 
example, as the medical man removes by opera- 
2
-P-A-G-E-13
  GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH 
tion or by a short course of medication. Speech 
disorders are very hard to cure in comparison 
with other more or less quickly removable defects 
of the body. 
We often find faulty enunciation of a number 
of utterances or sounds. The difficulty of cure 
is proportionately increased. An illustration of 
this fact is seen in that all too frequent form of 
speech disorder known as ‘{baby talk,” This is 
simply the persistence in the grown person of a 
number of phonetic defects that the mother has 
implanted in her children by talking “ baby talk” 
to them. (I have known cases that persisted to 
the age of twelve and fifteen! Most frequently 
these cases were eradicated before the age of 
eight years, but occasionally they last longer.) 
In proportion to the length of their persistence 
is their depth of impression, and also in exactly 
this proportion is the difficulty and hardship of 
their eradication. 
vIn this connection should be mentioned un- 
clear speech. I mean by this, not an obvious © 
phonetic defect, but a general lack of clear dis- 
tinct utterance. This, too, may be classed as a 
bad habit started in childhood and carried along 
for years without any attempt at eradication. .It 
is just as hard to eliminate as any of the other 
2
-P-A-G-E-14
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
habits of speech mentioned above. We might 
also mention the child’s imitation of its parents’ 
slovenly speech. Slovenly speech acquired in the 
yet tender years may take a long time to replace 
by that technically exact and clear-cut utterance 
which is so charming in the finished conversa- 
tionalist? ~~ . 
»y Bad grammar is mostly a matter of ea, and 
may be classed, as to hardship of eradication, in 
the same category with the smaller and less ob- 
vious defects mentioned above. Some ungram- 
matical habits of speech are so deeply fixed that 
they are hardly susceptible of eradication. Thus 
we see that without exception early speech hab- 
its are hard to eradicate.y 
2. Some become permanent defects 
It is well, in these introductory remarks, to 
_ emphasize the fact that bad habits of speech 
may become fixed and well-nigh ineradicable. 
When we instill the fear that a speech disorder 
may become permanent, then we give a powerful 
incentive to early treatment; we give a weighty 
reason for initiating methods of prevention. 
Foreign accent becomes permanent. Slovenly 
speech may cling to one throughout life. “ Baby 
talk” occasionally lasts over into the years of 
4
-P-A-G-E-15
  GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH 
adult life. These observations are seen to be 
truisms when we study the past histories of those - 
who are troubled with speech disorder. But we 
are not likely to realize that whenever these de- 
fects start, they are always likely to become per- 
manent. It is the idea and fear of this perma- 
nency that I wish to instill. 
I need scarcely mention the opinion of some 
persons that a permanent speech disorder may 
be an “ornament.’”’ A lisp can no more be an 
“ornament” than any other defect, such as a 
twisted finger, a skin birthmark, or a crippled 
foot. Yet I know of one individual, an author, 
who considers that her lisp is worth retaining as 
a personal ornament. She would not remove the 
defect under any circumstances. Of course, such 
individuals are outside of our consideration. We 
can only trust that they will outgrow their stand- 
ards of taste when they come to realize the 
greater pleasure and the greater excellences to 
be derived from exact and perfect speech. 
Bad as a permanent speech defect may be in 
‘itself, it is still more serious in its effect upon 
the life of the sufferer. As long as it persists, it 
deprives him of much of that success in life 
which he might otherwise attain. For example, 
entrance upon some kinds of business is abso- 
5
-P-A-G-E-16
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
lutely impossible as long as the permanent de- 
fect lasts. As we come more definitely upon this 
subject of the relation of the speech defect to 
the individual we shall see more definitely how 
speech defect deprives one of advantages. 
3. Defective speech marks the inefficient worker 
_~ Efficiency is the order of the day. The ad- 
vice of efficiency experts is being considered in 
the management of all sorts of business. Now, 
the man with speech disorder falls most assur- 
edly into the class of inefficient workers.) He 
cannot deal clearly, quickly, and adequately with 
the people with whom he comes in contact. His 
* faulty speech makes it impossible for him to ex- 
ternalize his own conceptions so as to satisfy 
those whom he serves. 
One or two practical illustrations of inefficiency 
may be cited here to show how greatly speech 
disorders affect one’s efficiency, to show the ne- 
cessity of their elimination, and to show how this 
elimination opens up fields of opportunity hardly 
thought of before. 
Let us first look at some of the fields of work 
where permanent speech disorder precludes suc- 
cess. The mere mention of these will be enough 
to show us that an individual is debarred from 
6
-P-A-G-E-17
GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH \ 
them by speech disorderif For example, take the 
ministry. The stutterer cannot possibly succeed 
in this field. The person who has a few speech 
defects, a foreign pronunciation of vowels, or a 
foreign accent, becomes a burden to his hearers. 
Again, the clerk in a store must not only have a 
pleasant manner and good command of English 
grammar, but she must have a standard of speech 
utterance that attracts no attention to itself. Then 
there are almost innumerable other situations 
where an easy flow of speech free from disord st, 20 
-is almost the first requisite. @ se ; 
All this leads us naturally tothe’ conclusion \j/ ~ ’ 
that speech disorder in the adult results in an Pe 
absolute exclusion from numerous fields of work, 
study, and business, or, at least, renders him ab- 
solutely inefficient if he tries to enter them, This 
indicates that the same defects, even where they 
do not show so clearly, make for inefficiency just 
as certainly. 
- The sufferer with speech disorder, then, is an 
inefficient worker. He is a burden to society and 
a hedger who seeks to do that work in the world 
in which his defect and disorder will count least 
against him or will show up least clearly in his 
dealings with his fellows. / 
Ina time when we are striving to uproot in- 
7
-P-A-G-E-18
  _SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
efficiency in all its forms, striving to bring every 
individual to the maximum of his powers, should 
we not, then, give close and special attention to 
this matter of speech disorder? We have seen 
that it is hard to eradicate, but we have also seen 
that unless it is attacked in time there is grave 
danger of its becoming so ingrained as to be 
scarcely susceptible of cure. Once it has become 
fixed and ingrained, moreover, it is a most serious , 
deterrent to success in any walk of life. These 
considerations make it clear that the correction 
of defects in speech while there is yet time should 
constitute one of the important branches of edu- 
cation. 
4. Social success dependent upon speech 
The social success which I have in mind at 
present is not that which is sought by men and 
women of the deau monde, it does not depend 
upon one’s wealth or the number of his acquaint- 
ances, it has no connection with Vanity Fair, I 
speak only of that social success which is shown 
by one’s ability to mingle easily and freely with 
other people in any walk of life in which the 
social relation is demanded. 
We know that our apparel should not attract 
attention ; we know that our deportment should 
8
-P-A-G-E-19
  GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH 
be free from eccentricity. We should maintain 
this same quiet and unassuming excellence in our 
usual conversation, in our habitual utterances, in 
our modes of conversational communication. We 
should cultivate an easy and natural flow of utter- 
ance that accomplishes its purpose without in any 
way calling attention to itself. Those with marked 
speech disorder cannot attain this conversational 
excellence. Some of the worst forms of speech 
disorders, indeed, cut one off from all social inter-- 
course whatsoever. 
5. Bad habits of speech impede education 
One of the most obvious, far-reaching, and seri- 
ous results of speech defect among young people 
is the interference which it causes in their edu- 
cation.Expert examiners commonly find that 
children with defective speech fail to keep pace 
with other pupils in their own grades where they 
aré-under-teachers who are ignorant of how to 
eliminate that defect,/It is less common but vastly 
more important that pupils with speech disorder 
fail of promotion. Pupils that have brought all 
the rest of their school requirements up to the 
standard that would warrant promotion are kept 
from promotion by some marked speech disorder 
and by this alone. There are more numerous 
9
-P-A-G-E-20
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
cases of this sort than we have any idea of. This 
is not the place to discuss the question whether 
such pupils should be promoted or whether they 
should be kept back. I merely want to call atten- 
tion to the facts as an illustration of the way in 
which speech disorder impedes education. 
There are still worse cases than this” I have 
in mind a stutterer who became so nervous from 
his speech defect that even his physician wanted 
him removed from school. There was no treat- 
ment undertaken in this case. In fact, no effort 
was made to relieve him of his difficulty. His 
education was not merely impeded, it was stopped 
altogether..\Such cases are not numerous, but 
they are numerous enough to afford another illus- 
tration of the importance of our subject. We 
even find numerous children whose defective 
enunciation or total lack of speech does not hin- 
der or impede their education, but prevents it at 
the very start. 
The teacher is not to blame for the impeding 
of education by speech disorders if the superin- 
tendent’s system provides no means of training 
her in the elimination of them. Surely she can- 
not be blamed for failing to promote defective 
children. The defect itself prevents her from 
getting the proper evidence needed for promo- 
10
-P-A-G-E-21
GOOD HABITS OF SPEECH 
tion. But when there is a retardation of two or 
three years, it is time for her to look about and 
see if the trouble is not eradicable. 
There are usually deep-lying causes of speech 
defect which elude ordinary observation. We are 
too apt to think of speech defect as a matter of 
mouth utterance only. We pay too exclusive at- 
tention to the mere speech product. There is 
very much more than this to the speech mechan- 
ism, and the causes of speech disorders often lie 
. back in the mental processes of intakej7A fre? 
quent cause of speech defect is found in the suf- 
ferer’s inability to hear properly. It is clear that 
faulty hearing would make it difficult to repro-\, 
duce properly the sounds of speech. Speech de- | 
  fect is not usually a matter of enunciation alone. / 
It usually includes a defect on the sensory side 
or an inability to interpret sensory registrations 
in a reliable way. The faulty product comes from 
lack in sensory control. ~~ 
Defective ‘utterance is really a very small part 
of the whole problem ; it is, in fact, hardly a part 
of the problem at all. In a larger sense it may be 
called only a symptom of the problem. This is be- 
cause, as we have just seen, the external speech 
defect may be interpreted as a mere sign or symp- 
tom of a deeper defect on the sensory side of the 
Ir
-P-A-G-E-22
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
speech mechanism, the mental intake side, in 
some complex or in the interpretative or thinking 
side; and merely in consequence of this deeper 
defect do we have the faulty vocal output, the 
inability to externalize, the mistakes of utterance, 
and the permanent speech defect. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23

METHODS OF CORRECTING DEFECTS OF 
SPEECH 
AFTER this discussion of the constant and crying 
need for correction of speech disorders in public 
schools, —a need which in many places is not 
noticed and in other places is not met, — we come 
naturally to the consideration of methods of eradi- 
cating these defects. 
~i The methods and systems of cure should be 
uniform, scientific, and based upon a sound psy- 
chology.\; Members of the medical profession 
who have gone out from Boston clinics to es- 
tablish centers of instruction elsewhere in the 
country are doing much to standardize treatment, 
but unfortunately elsewhere there is still little 
general agreement. The methods of eradication / 
which are taught—particularly in the institu- 
tions of higher learning —are still numerous and 
varied. 
It will be well to begin with a brief but careful 
consideration of some ways of approaching the 
problem. 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
I. Some general methods — dividing classes 
In general, the speech-disorder problem re- 
solves itself into an attempt to raise the faulty 
into the normal voice, to eradicate speech defect 
and replace it by normal speech. One reason why 
so many of the weaker efforts made in this line 
result in only partial eradication lies in the fact 
that speech as a whole has not been understood. 
It is very important in studying methods to have 
a large idea of the field. I mean by this that we 
should abandon the usual narrow interpretation 
of speech defects and learn to view the speech 
mechanism scientifically and as a whole embracing 
the nervous system in both its physiological and 
its psychological aspects In this view the mouth, 
which is usually the only factor considered, be- 
comes merely a part of the external speech mech- 
anism : lungs, throat, vocal cords, mouth, nasal 
cavities, and the intricate system of muscles that 
* control these parts. Outside of this we have much 
more: a sensory nervous system and a low brain 
, sensory registration area, a higher brain interpre- 
tation area, and intricate collaborative functions.\, 
On the motor side we have a high motor-control 
area, a low motor-output area, which includes the 
nerves that go down to supply nervous control to 
14
-P-A-G-E-25
CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH | 
the numerous external parts of the speech mech- 
anism. "All this, then, is the field of approach, all 
this is our field of study, all this is the ground- 
work upon which we are to build perfected speech, 
and no one, without a thorough understanding 
of all these things, can expect to do very much 
with the speech mechanism} These considerations 
show the extent of the ground upon which our 
efforts are to be directed. 
__ A few general ideas of method should be firmly 
“fixed in the teacher’s mind and should pervade 
all her efforts and undertakings in the details of treatment..The first of these general ideas is that 
“of the great importance of persistent, long-con- 
tinued drill. My two clinics in Boston illustrate 
some very remarkable cases of improvement. The 
secret of this improvement lies more in the per- 
sistent and long-continued drill gone Paden in 
these cases than in any other one thing.“We often 
think that the mere placement of an external 
speech part where it ought to be is enough, but 
those who are experienced in this line of work 
have found that very long persistent on he 
only means‘of attaining permanent result: By 
w The patient should be held to the exact follow- 
ing of exact instructions. He should not be al- 
lowed to lapse, to practice wrongly, or to practice 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  ‘SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
in a slovenly way. He should be constantly made 
to do his best. ¥ 
It goes almost without saying that‘special at- 
tention must be given throughout the period of 
training to matters of hygiene. The aim should 
be to secure proper rest, exercise, and nutrition, 
so that the attainment of new vocal habits may 
progress as rapidly as possible. ° 
Special attention must be given also to the 
proper division of classes. Speech defects differ 
in their characteristics, in the time necessary for 
eradication, and in their nervous or psychological 
background. They natually fall into the follow? 
ing three large divisions : stuttering, phonetic / 
y / 
defect, and the speech of mental defectives. y,/ yf 
2. Modern treatment of stuttering 
In speaking of the modern treatment of stut- 
tering, I refer to that one which has been found, 
after numerous trials, to be the best in its final 
results. It not only eliminates the trouble itself 
in a majority of cases, but it develops the men- 
tality of the patient at the same time and leaves 
him with a more rounded personality than other 
methods even pretend to give. As far asI know, 
no other method makes any effort to apply devel- 
opmental psychology. Other methods partly re- 
16
-P-A-G-E-27
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
lieve, sometimes wholly relieve, the stuttering 
itself, but they never give the patient a larger 
mental horizon, they never try to send him out 
a larger personality, they never make an attempt 
to broaden, deepen, and widen his visualization 
processes. When a method can not only cure 
stuttering, but can also develop personality, it has 
claims which no other method can put forward. 
Before presenting the modern method of treat- 
ment, it will be well to say a word about some of 
the old methods in order to show the contrast in 
procedure and in point of view. The oldest form 
of treatment of which I know was that in which 
the physician attempted to cure the stutterer by 
the amputation of a part of the tongue. This was 
placing the diagnosis in the external speech mech- 
anism. After this the diagnosis was placed in 
numerous parts of the nervous mechanism on the 
_ sensory-motor side. Not long ago some of the 
lesser lights in the Freudian constellation placed 
the diagnosis in the subconscious mentality. 
After I had made a study of this situation, the 
only unexplored: field seemed to me to be that 
of the conscious mentality. I therefore began a 
series of researches with the attempt to discover 
something constant behind the stuttering in the 
conscious mental make-up, and it is upon discov 
17 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
EER ete eee. Se ee ed 2a Ny Tae a i FT Ace a 
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
eries made in the voice clinic of the Psychopathic 
Hospital in Boston that the modern treatment is 
based. Let us turn now to that. 
Several nofmal individuals were tested with a 
list of some fifteen hundred questions to ascertain 
the conscious content/of their minds during ut- 
terance. This conscious content was found to be 
a visual image. Thén a similar series of stutter- 
ers was put through the same experiment and it 
was found that they constantly lacked this visual 
image while they were stuttering. Upon this re- 
search finding is based our treatment, which, in 
a word, consists in very gradually developing first 
; meager and then larger and then very extensive 
| visualization processes over the speech of the 
stutterer and so giving him that apparently es- 
sential faculty which is found constantly present 
Over the speech of the normal individual. 
From this general idea as to the foundations 
of the modern treatment, let us pass to the steps 
used in initiating this treatment. VWe begin with 
a series of breathing exercises, These are in- 
tended to instill control of the breath and to de- 
velop concentration. After this, the patient is 
asked to hold the voice on a single musical note 
or tone during the prolonged expulsion of the 
breath. Then, in addition to holding this note, he 
(one .
-P-A-G-E-29
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
is asked to pronounce a word. After this, he is 
asked to hold the single note through the pro- 
nunciation of a sentence and of a stanza. This 
method is continued until the patient has devel- 
oped sufficient concentration to hold the single 
note over quite long sentences. We next explain 
that the holding of the note with the voice is 
only an exercise in developing the power of con- 
centration and nothing more than an introduction 
to the really important process — that of hold- 
ing a visual image in the mind during utterance. 
After this has been explained and we think the 
patient has developed enough concentration to 
warrant our passing on to the exercise of the 
mental image, we begin with single words and 
proceed gradually to the use of short sentences, 
tong sentences, verse and prose, short original 
stories, and long pieces of dramatic literature, 
until we have developed elaborate visualization 
processes to the more or less complete elimina- 
tion of the stuttering habit. Uninterrupted sug- 
gestion accompanies these steps. + 
With this brief statement of the method 
which is employed, let us turn to the detailed 
exercises that are given in series from the begin- 
ning to the end of the treatment. The object of 
most of these exercises is to draw the attention

from the words to be pronounced toward the 
notes held in mind and afterwards to the visual 
pictures.

hale as slowly as possible. The inhalation and 
exhalation should be through the nose. At the 
same time the arms are raised during inhalation 
till the hands touch over the head and lowered 
slowly during exhalation. 
Exercise 2, Same as Exercise 1, but on exha- 
lation.sound the syllable “Ma,” keeping it of 
even volume and intensity and prolonging the 
utterance as much as possible. 
Exercise 3. This is the same as Exercise 2, but 
instead of prolonging the “Ma” on an even 
pitch sing the scale with “Ma.” 
Exercise 4. Same as Exercise 3, except that 
“Ma” is sounded on low C, high C, and low C 
again prolonged as before. 
Exercise 5. The word “Mother” is now ut- 
tered. The voice is made to move up and down 
the octave at about the speed of normal conver- 
20 ga ae

sation. This ends the introductory exercises. The 
purpose of all these is to concentrate the atten- 
tion on a mental note. 
Word exercise. The patient is asked to apply 
this octave exercise to every word of the follow- 
ing stanza: 
“Mary had a little lamb, 
Its feet were white as snow, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
The lamb was sure to go.” 
Line exercise. When the patient has learned 
to execute this bit of vocal drill with fluency and 
ease, I teach him to jump the octave on the first 
word in the line, and then to let the voice run 
down the octave through all the succeeding 
words of that line until the note from which he 
started is reached. The stanza used in this exer- 
cise is as follows: 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
How I wonder what you are! 
Up above the world so high, 
Like a diamond in the sky.” 
Following this, I teach him to rise through 
the octave from the beginning to the middle of 
the line and then to let the voice fall gradually 
to the end of the line. The words on which the 
high note is struck are “glorious,” “grass,” 
21  
-P-A-G-E-32
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
* shine,” and “twinkle.” For this exercise I use 
the verse: 
“When the glorious sun is set 
And the grass with dew is wet, 
Then you shine your little light, 
Twinkle, twinkle all the night.” 
I usually follow this by having the patient tell 
stories with a vocal execution like that used in the 
three last exercises. He first tells a story in short 
sentences, the pitch of the voice rising and falling 
with every word until the end of the sentence is 
reached. In the next story his voice is to leap 
the octave on the first word of the sentence and 
to decline on the rest. Finally, he tells a story 
with the voice taking the octave jump on some 
important or easily emphasized word near the be- 
ginning of each sentence and then declining on 
the following words. This series of exercises with 
short sentences might be followed by a similar 
series dealing with stories in longer sentences. 
This sort of exercise is kept up until the patient 
has acquired fluency and ease in applying it to any 
new thing that he tries to learn, say, or repeat. 
The process is suggestive. 
This drill really marks and ends the introduc- 
tory phase of the treatment, and after there is 
sufficient concentration developed to hold this 
22
-P-A-G-E-33
CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH | 
note and apply it consistently on all sorts of ma- 
terial, I start the patient on the processes of vis- 
ualization. First, I ask him to take some single 
word and utter it with the visual image naturally 
called up by that word distinctly in mind. Then 
he does the same thing in pronouncing a sen- 
tence, verses, prose, original stories. By these 
stages he gradually develops until he can render 
some pretty complicated dramatic pieces. 
This description of the method is almost 
enough to enable one to start in and carry it out, 
but for fear that some may need to have a series 
of exercises put down, I will give a series which 
I have used in my own practice. 
The first selection for visualizing is usually the 
word “builders.” I try to secure in the minds of 
my patients as clear and fine a picture of build- 
ers as possible, and I let this stand as the exam- 
ple and ideal for visualization processes in the 
work that follows. Next I turn to a sentence. 
“Under the spreading chestnut-tree 
The village smithy stands; 
The smith, a mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands,” — 
is a very good verse for a wider and more diffi- 
cult application of a visual image exercise. I 
train the patient to see the tree in his mind’s eye 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
before he begins to pronounce the word “ tree,” 
to hold that tree in mind while he is saying the 
word, and, when he comes to the description of 
the blacksmith, to replace the picture of the tree 
by @ picture of the smith standing at his forge 
uncer the tree. 
“The Chambered Nautilus” is another good 
verse to practice on, as it is pretty thickly studded 
with numerous and quickly changing visual pic- 
tures. 
The “Witch Scene” in Macbeth is another 
good piece that may be used here. It runs as 
follows : 
1. Witch. Where shall we three meet again? 
In thunder, lightning, or in rain? 
2. Witch. When the hurlyburly’s done, 
When the battle’s lost and won. 
. Witch. That will be ere the set of sun. 
. Witch. Where the place? 
. Witch. Upon the heath. 
. Witch. There to meet with Macbeth. 
. Witch. I come, Graymalkin! 
. Witch. Paddock calls: Anon! 
All. Fair is,foul, and foul is fair, 
Hover through the fog and filthy air! (Exeunt.) 
After these one may feel at liberty to choose 
whatever extracts from literature seem desirable. 
One of the best ones of which I know is the 
“Dagger Scene”’ from Macbeth, and another one

is the “Mad Scene” in the same play. Sugges- 
tion dominates the whole process. 
The modern method of treatment for stutter- 
ing has been clearly outlined above, but I can 
conceive that some who misunderstand the back- 
ground of this method might apply the exercises 
without reaching the results. I therefore advise 
some little experience in applying this method in 
the clinic or some observation of the process as 
practiced either in the clinics in Boston or under 
some of the numerous teachers who have gradu- 
ated from the Boston courses and become centers 
of instruction in other parts of the country. I do 
not advise this because the method is particu- 
larly difficult. I think it is no more difficult than 
the proper teaching of reading in the schools. 
Teachers are not allowed to give instruction in 
reading, however, unless they have passed a nor: 
mal course in the subject. Therefore I should 
most seriously recommend at least a little “try- 
ing it on the dog” before the method is tried on 
the pupil. 
Now for the school application of this method 
of treating stuttering. I might say that the whole 
class for stutterers should be put through in uni- 
son, perhaps as far as the second stanza, of 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star!” starting at the 
25
-P-A-G-E-36
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
beginning of the year with only one or two exer- 
cises and adding one or two a week. It takes 
from two to three months to get through this 
second stanza. When the class can do any given 
exercise well in unison, I would spend the rest 
of the study period with individual treatment, giv- 
ing each what his own individual case seems to 
demand. 
3. Treatment of phonetic defects 
Phonetic defects are departures from the local 
standard of the sounds of vowels and consonants. 
They are as numerous as are the phonetic utter- 
ances included in our language, multiplied by 
about ten or more to cover the different forms 
in which the defects appear. Some systems study 
minutely the form of the individual defect and 
try gradually to get the patient out of it. Others 
try to instill the correct mouth positions at once, 
with no other sort of exercises whatever. The 
best method differs somewhat from these, and is 
really a larger and more fundamental attack upon 
the whole process of phonetic utterance than any 
of — above processes can ever possibly pre- 
tend to be. 
y The method of phonetic correction may be 
considered under four large divisions: (1) Mus- 
26
-P-A-G-E-37
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
cular development; (2) ear sensitiveness; (3) 
form of motor output; (4) position of motor 
output. I mean by these, briefly, as follows: 
Muscular development as a basis for phonetic 
excellence is brought about by a systematic drill 
of all the muscles of the jaw, mouth, tongue, and 
throat.yThe purpose of this drill is to increase 
muscular control and thereby to increase the pa- 
tient’s ability to make exact and minute vocal 
coérdinations. I consider this the most valuable 
of all possible foundations for the development 
of correct phonetic utterance. 
The development of ear sensitiveness enables 
the patient to differentiate accurately one sound 
from another, and also to differentiate between 
sound forms such as pitch, intensity, and other 
factors in vocal utterance.,I hold that defects in | 
phonetic output may have their seat in defective 
phonetic intake. Sounds ill-heard are likely to be 
ill-pronounced. When intake is perfected, it pro- 
vides a good basis for the perfection of output. 
By the phrase, form of motor output, 1 refer to 
the idea of an acoustic form which may be held 
in mind without utterance of the sound to which 
it corresponds. 
I consider that concentration upon the sensory 
ear intake, and the development of that con- 
37  
-P-A-G-E-38
NT Tn nee a SPs nee a NERF CNS EARS MBER AS OES eRe 
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
centration into the ability to hold the form of a 
sound for motor output, offer excellent training 
in the development of final phonetic excellences. 
Under the heading, position of motor output, 1 
teach the exact coédrdination and position of ex- 
ternal vocal agents—tongue, jaw, teeth, lips, 
and throat — in the execution of a sound held in 
mind. Exercise in exact coédrdinations of motor 
output and in ability to hold these in the mind 
and to correlate them with the form of the acous- 
tic idea is an essential process at the very foun- 
dation of all good speech instruction. We must 
acoustically experience good speech, to have it. 
  4. Management of the special class 
The author was the first to formulate a pro- 
gram for a speech survey among special classes 
for the retarded, and to follow this by the com- 
pilation of a course of lectures, attacking the 
speech problem among mental defectives, illus- 
trating the successful and in many cases marvel- 
ous results that have come from a special vocal 
drill applied to pathological minds and speech 
cases. 
The great mistake commonly made in treating 
the speech of mental defectives has lain in the’ | 
application to them of methods proper only to 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
Be SI SSR ens IgE NE SRE PE ATE HU re ioe oe 
CORRECTING — OF SPEECH 
the treatment of normal pupils. We place these 
pathological mentalities in classes of their own, 
where they do not have the usual educational 
curriculum and are put to what is called “ indus- 
trial drill” —a vastly inferior method of educa- 
tion. Why, then, should the phonetics used in 
classes where minds are average be applied, with 
any expectation of valuable results, to special 
classes where minds are in many ways markedly 
inferior? The situation is ridiculous, unscientific, 
unpsychological, ill-advised, —a work of the igno- 
rant attempter. 
The ideal system of phonetics for pathological 
minds is one that differs as markedly from nor- 
mal phonetics as industrial drill does from the 
work in the normal grades. In other words, to 
reach the mental defective, we should take at 
least as big a step down from the phonetics 
proper to normal minds as we do in passing from 
normal grade work to industrial drill. This is 
what I have done in devising a new system for 
the phonetic training of the mentally deficient. 
The mental defective is first put through a 
series of tests to see how much he can utter. I 
have him say the vowels, thus: “Ah, a, e, aw, 0, ~ 
oo.” When he has said them separately, I note 
how many he can say in series. Then I have 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
him practice them, first those that he can say in 
series, for ten or fifteen minutes three to five 
times a day, for one week. My next step i is gov- 
erned by the advance that has been made during 
the first week. Sometimes I have him repeat the 
first exercise for another week. Sometimes, when 
the patient was originally able to say only two 
vowels, I ,add three to those he can already pro- 
nounce. Or I may add six in series, when he has 
previously been able to say three in series. Then 
I have him begin with some consonant that he 
has already learned, and place that before each 
vowel. After this I have him pass through sev- 
eral other consonants that he already knows, and 
have him place each before each vowel. Then I 
have him place the same consonants after each 
vowel, and finally before and after. In this way 
I give him about one new vowel or _vowel.com- 
bination a week, insist_upon—intensive, constant, 
“~and~prolonged” ail, and then continue the proc- 
ess, making it more and more complicated as it 
advances. If these exercises are carried on for 
two or three months, a great deal of improvement 
results. With these I have known a mental defec- 
tive in eight months to advance two years on his 
Binet scale. 
I go on to familiar words after this and then 
3°
-P-A-G-E-41
  
CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
to very short sentences, then to longer sentences, 
and finally to verse and prose, with the instal- 
lation of visualization processes. The whole 
process is nothing but an increasingly complex 
arrangement of simple phonetic utterances. Each 
step in the process is minutely adapted to the 
capacities of the mental defective. It is not sug- 
gestive therapeutics. a 
5. How parents can help 
One of the most important and valuable ad- 
juncts to speech-improvement classes is to .be 
found in codperative influence of the family¥The 
parents should be called in soon after their child 
has been put in any class for the elimination of 
speech defects and should be given a careful ex- 
planation of the dangers threatening the child 
because of his speech disorder. They should be 
shown that the child is likely to be kept back 
in the grades and to become a laughing-stock ~ 
among his fellows unless his defect is cured. The 
strong likelihood that this defect, unless cured 
early in life, will become a permanent handicap * 
in later life, resulting in retarded education, lack 
of friends, low pay, and general inefficiency, should 
be clearly presented to them. It should be made 
clear that the object of the speech teacher and 
31  
-P-A-G-E-42
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
of the assignment of the child to a speech-im- 
provement class is simply that these dangers may 
be averted. This explanation will inspire interest 
at home, will induce the parents to see that drill 
and practice are carried out, and will enable them 
to help in many other ways. 
I should also call the parents in later at fre- 
quent intervals so that they may observe the 
child’s progress and report upon his faithfulness 
in practice at home. At the same time they may 
be influenced again to help in whatever is being 
done for their child in the class, ' 
More than in any other way, the parents can 
help in overseeing the hygienic measures neces- 
sary to any real speech improvement, They can 
see to it that the child does not play too hard or 
too much; they can see that he gets the proper 
amount of sleep; they can maintain a diet of 
normal and advised standard and amount; they 
can look after the clothing and the baths, and 
minimize the outside work that some children are 
forced into, which saps their vitality to such an 
extent that no good work in phonetics can possi- 
bly be done with them. W 
Sometimes progress is found to be quite im- 
possible unless family codperation— the sympathy 
and good-will of the parents—is obtained and 
32 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
maintained throughout the whole period of treat- 
ment. This matter is of great importance. It 
may make all the difference between success and 
failure. 
6. Function of the school physician 
The teacher of speech disorder should endeavor 
to elicit the interest and the services of the school 
physician. The aid furnished by him may be in- 
valuable to the teacher, mostly in the way of 
eliminating those physical causes of speéch dis- 
order which, with her lay training, she is incapa- 
ble of finding. The school physician can tell when 
adic — that spasm of related muscular movements 
— is interfering with the improvement of a stut- 
terer. The physician can tell when chorea is the 
main cause of a sudden phonetic slump. He can 
explain the incurableness of the congenital syphi- 
litic, as well as the permanent and unremovable 
defect presented in a juvenile case of tabes, Then 
he can discover the cases of speech defect due 
to idiocy and imbecility, and can save the teacher 
unsophisticated in medical subjects much time 
and effort by telling her that in those cases she 
need not expect any great amount of improve- 
ment. It is in this diagnostic service, this deeper, 
internal, medical interpretation of the background 
33
-P-A-G-E-44
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
of speech disorder, that the school physician 
can give the teacher invaluable assistance. The 
teacher should respect his diagnosis and follow his 
medical advice. She should respect the diagnosis 
because it is the outcome of the accumulated 
knowledge of the medical profession and is really 
the physician’s legitimate and exclusive function. 
Much of her success in managing her speech-im- 
provement class depends upon her ability and 
tact in using the services of the school physician. 
While the physician can offer knowledge, diag- 
nosis, and advice in medical matters, the teacher 
should realize the ignorance of the ordinary 
physician in regard to such special work as her 
own. He may advise that speech defects be let 
alone, so that they may be “‘outgrown.” He may 
assert that they really amount to nothing. He 
does not realize the relations of speech disorder 
to the school curriculum. He does not know that 
  the speech defective is also a singing defective, a’ | 
writing defective, a spelling defective, and some- 
times even a mathematical defective. Far less 
does he appreciate the fact that the elimination 
of speech disorder by the methods indicated in 
this book means also, to a very large extent, the 
simultaneous elimination of all those other kinds 
of defects just mentioned. 
34
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
The physician may be able to explain the non- 
progress of medical cases, the background of 
which he has diagnosed and in which he has found 
some condition that makes progress impossible. 
This may excuse the teacher for apparent failures 
in regard to which a superintendent, not under- 
standing the whole field, might perhaps blame 
the teacher, sometimes with a serious outcome. 
The physician can also relieve the teacher from 
much worry and anxiety caused by the non-prog- 
ress of some of these hopeless cases. The physi- 
cian can, in an authoritative way, advise the family 
to carry out hygienic measures where a teacher 
cannot, or he can occasionally remove a case from 
the speech class and put it in a special institution, 
a hospital, or a home for recovery. 
7. What the superintendent should do 
The superintendent’s office should contain 
some one sufficiently interested in the speech 
problem in public schools to engineer the entire 
work. He should be the general supervisor and 
manager of all work done in the schools of his 
city in speech improvement. He should be con- 
stantly bringing new ideas from the outside world 
and inspiring the teachers under him to adopt 
them, as well as to obtain for themselves, in the 
35
-P-A-G-E-46
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
proper places, advanced instruction, practice, and 
knowledge. 
I think one superintendent or assistant alone 
should be relegated to this work. He should re- 
ceive regular monthly reports of the progress 
made in every individual case listed in the speech- 
improvement classes. He should insist upon 
regular, complete, and scientific records of every 
case from the time of its entrance into the speech 
class. The entries should be made week by week 
and month by month, if not oftener, and should 
be sent to the superintendent as monthly reports. 
If of scientific value, they may well be used by 
the superintendent or by the teacher in the forma- 
tion of papers to be read to societies or published, 
thus giving wider scope to the good work of the 
individual teacher. This will lead to increase of 
salary, new appointments, and wider opportuni- 
ties for growth and progress. 
The speech superintendent should acquaint 
himself with the special training of his speech 
teachers. He should understand the educational 
background of the instructors that his teachers 
have had. He should know the different institu- 
tions — medical schools, clinics, and special schools 
—where speech instruction is given. This knowl- 
edge will enable him to advise his present and 
36
-P-A-G-E-47
CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
future teachers intelligently in their search for 
further training. It will enable him to give them 
a timely warning against the fakes, charlatans, 
and untrained impostors that invade this field all 
over the country. All of these should be care- 
fully tabulated and hung up in the Rogues’ Gal- 
lery of his mind so that he can prevent any of 
his teachers from thinking that they have scien- 
tific and expert training in the field of speech 
when they have merely wasted their money on 
pretenders. 
‘The teacher should look to the superintendent 
for all the services that have been mentioned 
above. She should take to him cases that do not 
progress. She should go to him about the removal 
of feeble-minded children from her classes. She 
should go to him for the solution of inexplicable 
backgrounds in cases needing the services of the 
physician, or those in which the service of the 
school doctor has been inefficient, inconclusive, or 
vague. Through the superintendent the teacher 
should get advice about the speech expert to be 
consulted for the solution of her more puzzling 
problems. 
In a word, then, the superintendent is the final 
guiding authority and the final resort for the 
teacher. 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
8. Advice from the medical expert in speech 
The teacher will find that whereas the usual 
- case of speech disorder improves gradually under 
treatment until finally cured, there are some cases 
that progress at first fairly well and then stop; 
‘there are other cases that progress only a little 
and halt ; there are a few that show from the start 
no advance whatever. We may suppose that she 
nas taken these stubborn cases to the school phy- 
sician, or at least has consulted his record in search 
of some solution. She has put the case before the 
superintendent, and satisfactory results are not 
forthcoming. She has asked the other teacher or 
several other teachers, and they are all puzzled. 
The final thing to do is to call in the services of a 
speech expert — the highly trained medical man 
who brings to every case not only a general edu- 
cation, a medical education, and experience in in- 
ternal medicine, but also special study in the nerv- 
ous diseases, neurology and psychiatry, and special 
study of the throat. He should have also a wide 
knowledge of psychology —and not alone that to 
be found in the universities, but also sucha knowl- 
edge of individual psychology as is to be found in 
the schools of dramatic art. Above all this he 
should have had training under the speech experts 
38
-P-A-G-E-49
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
of Europe and America. By bringing to bear a 
large*array of medical knowledge drawn from 
numerous fields of training, and focusing all his 
understanding and learning upon one puzzling 
case, such a man can often solve problems at once 
which have baffled all the other minds that have 
attacked it. 
The advice of the medical speech expert is 
based upon several exhaustive methods of inves- 
tigation. The teacher, therefore, should realize 
that in bringing the case to him she is bringing 
it in line with medical. research, is putting it in 
touch with investigation, is putting it where ex- 
haustive and scientific research of the whole 
problem may be carried through. 
Advice that emanates from such investigation 
can be of great value to the teacher in solving 
her problems, in changing her treatment, in elimi- 
nating incurable cases from her class, in excusing 
her seeming lack of success before the superin- 
tendent. Sometimes if cases are brought early 
enough to the expert, the teacher may be saved 
weeks or months of tedious treatment as well as 
undeserved blame from her superintendent, the 
scorn of her co-workers, and nights of worry and 
anguish for fear she may be blamed. 
39

9. When to return cases to the regular grades 
It should, of course, be the ideal of teachers 
conducting special classes in the public schools to 
return as many of their pupils as possible to the 
regular grades. This ideal, seldom extensively 
realized in classes for mental defectives, is entirely 
reasonable in the case of classes for the eradica- 
tion of speech defects where such classes are 
conducted in a scientific way by properly equipped 
teachers. 
It is important to know, therefore, when to 
make this return. Should the case be sent back 
when improvement has begun? Should the return 
be made when the defect has been eliminated, or 
should the case remain after cure, and, if so, how 
long? Ina brief treatise it is almost impossible 
to give exact and minute advice on every sort of 
case that may be met in the schools. I think it 
will be well to devote a paragraph to each of the 
different headings under which the speech-defect 
problem has been discussed. 
The members of the phonetic class may be re- 
turned after their new pronunciations have be- 
come easy, automatic, and unconscious in every- 
‘\/day conversation and after this condition has 
lasted for a month. I should not even then have 
40
-P-A-G-E-51
f 
  CORRECTING DEFECTS OF SPEECH 
them cease to practice. They should return occa- 
sionally to the class for tests and further advice 
—at first every two weeks, and then, after two 
or three months, every month fora year. In some 
cases this will be unnecessary. It is a matter of 
precaution. I warn teachers that it will save them 
much criticism, will improve their results, and 
will bring those unusual excellences that only 
persistent drill can produce. 
Members of the stuttering class should be 
treated in a similar way, but they should be re- 
leased more gradually and should be watched 
afterwards for two years instead of one year. 
Besides this, they should be advised to return at 
once on any marked relapse. Not only should 
they be made to report themselves, but they 
should bring reports from teachers and parents. 
Stuttering, unlike phonetic defect, is intermit- 
tent, so that to watch it thoroughly one must have 
reports from different sources—from teacher, 
home, and even playmates. 
The members of the class for mental defectives 
are usually non-returnables anyway. Rarely will 
one be sent back to the regular grades, and they 
should all be put under permanent and persistent 
vocal drill for a period of two years, and then 
watched for two years longer. In general, indi- 
4I
-P-A-G-E-52
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
vidual cases are to be returned on their individ- 
ual merits. 
10.4 Value of records on all cases 
I have frequently mentioned the importance, 
may, the absolute necessity, of an accurate and 
regular record. It is time to deal with this mat- 
ter in more detail, to state clearly what a record 
is, how it should be started, what it should con- 
tain, and what services it should render to the 
teacher, to the doctor, to the superintendent, and, 
last but not least, to the case in hand. 
Speech-defect records should begin with the 
statement of a complaint. This may be a term 
expressing what the mother complains of, or a 
summary in a word or two of what has been dis- 
covered by the examining teacher. It should be 
followed by a statement regarding the present z//- 
ness, beginning at the onset. A little history 
should be given of the way the child learned to 
talk —age of walking, talking, and teething— 
and then a notation of the special speech influ- 
ences exerted upon the child, such as foreign ac- 
cent, the companionship of stutterers, the imita- 
tion of home phonetic defects. There should be 
a record of the amount of progress or retrogres- 
sion that the child has made recently, and a de-

tailed statement of the methods of treatment it 
has been subjected to. The next item is past his- 
tory. Here accidents, operations, unusual fright 
occurring previous to the onset, and any special 
peculiarities or background of the speech that 
may help to explain the speech disorder, should be 
tabulated in detail. The family history comes 
next. Here should be mentioned” such factors as 
feeble-mindedness, insanity, mental retardation, 
queerness, other speech disorders in the family 
and relatives of the case in hand. 
The results of the vocal examination should 
follow, with a statement regarding the general 
nature of the speech, pronunciation of vowels and 
consonants, the amount of stuttering, and other 
similar matters. The last item in the teacher’s 
record should be a brief summary and the diag- 
nosis. 
There are other items that should be on the 
record, but which it is not thé function of the 
teacher to obtain or to pass judgment upon. One 
of these things is the summary of the school phy- 
sician’s medical findings. Transferred to the 
speech defective record, this will sometimes eas- 
ily solve a problem which is otherwise impossible. 
Any notes from the superintendent’s office giving 
advice upon the case should be recorded. There 
43
-P-A-G-E-54
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
should surely be here a record of the teacher’s 
visits to clinics and especially a summary of the 
diagnosis and advice of any speech specialists 
who have been consulted. 
Outlines of this sort compose only the begin- 
ning of the record. After this certainly a weekly, 
and sometimes a daily note— concise, and em- 
ploying vocal terms—should be added, with 
date, as the case progresses. These daily notes 
show progress in a way that the first record can- 
not. They show progress which, if not noted, is 
likely to be forgotten, so that when the case is 
finally summed up, the proper contrast with the 
original condition, and hence the proper credit to 
the teacher for elimination, is lost. 
The school physician’s use of the record is 
probably rare, but the original findings and the 
record of improvement may occasionally be of 
some value in leading him to a diagnosis, 
An accurate, well-kept record enables the su- 
perintendent to decide whether to return a case 
to the grades, to remove it to an institution, or 
to keep it in the speech class. 
The child also is served bya record in that his 
case can be taken up more readily by a new 
teacher when she has the previous findings to 
rely upon. His progress is put down as it really

is, and he receives credit and blame as he de- 
serves. 
Over and above all these things, the records 
may be used by the teacher in publication and in 
this way she may gain new appointments with 
wider opportunities for founding departments 
and inaugurating or organizing work in other 
schools. 
School departments for speech improvement 
without records are unscientific and are worthless 
to future comers. On the other hand, scientifi- 
cally kept and complete records of speech cases 
are of inestimable value to teacher, superintend- 
ent, and the patient himself.. No department 
whatever should be started without complete 
consideration of the matter of records, and how 
to start them and maintain them in regular and 
perfect. form. The time given this is well spent.

THE ELIMINATION OF MINOR SPEECH 
DISORDERS 
To satisfy the demand for perfection in vocal 
utterance, not only must we treat of the frank 
defects in speech, but also some less marked 
faults, or inadequacies of utterance. 
For this reason, let us devote a chapter to 
those too frequent and often extremely annoying 
minor speech faults known as “ nasality,” “ mo- 
notony,” “harshness,” “hoarseness,” “hasty,” 
and “slovenly ” speech, 
I. Nasality 
A definition. Nasality is the so-called “nasal” 
tone in the voice caused by obstruction of the 
nasal passages. 
In normal utterances where m, 2, and ug are 
used, the exit for air through the mouth is 
blocked. The stream of air must then find its 
only way of escape through the nose. Thus the 
nares are normally used in the utterance of these 
sounds. When, for any reason, the air cannot 
pass through the nose, there necessarily results 
46
-P-A-G-E-57
  MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
an imperfect enunciation of these sounds. They 
are not stopped, or even changed to other sounds, 
but are slightly varied. This change in vocal 
utterance is called “nasality.” 
Cause. This blocking of the nasal passage is 
brought about in several different ways. The 
simplest cause is illustrated by holding one’s own 
nose during the utterance of those sounds which 
need the nasal air passages for their free expres- 
sion. For those to whom nasality is not clear, 
this is a good way to learn how it is caused, to 
hear it, and thus to learn how to detect it in 
others. Hold the nose and pronounce m, #, and 
ng. Then pronounce the same sounds with the 
nose free. Better still, put these sounds into 
some sentence, such as, “I am going to Ma- 
nila.” Pronounce the sentence with and without 
obstruction. J 
Another cause of nasal obstruction may be 
found in the ordinary cold. This obstruction usu- 
ally extends for some distance into the nasal ori- 
fice and so causes a more complete blockage than 
the mere holding of the nose with finger and 
thumb. When the air is obstructed merely at the 
exit, it can reach to the end of the nose and 
swell it out to some extent. But when the secre- 
tions of a cold in the nose prevent this, the re- 
47
-P-A-G-E-58
eee 
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
sulting nasality is more marked. The greater the 
obstruction, the greater the nasality. 
Another form of nasal obstruction is an ab- 
normal growth in the nasal passages. This may 
be due to accident, to a tumor, or to the over- 
growth of normal tissue. The first two may be 
left undiscussed, as they belong exclusively to 
the province of the medical specialist. The last 
is so common and so often overlooked during 
treatment for nasality that a word about it here 
will be in place. The overgrowths referred to are 
called adenoids. Normally they are small, unob- 
structing glands in the posterior nares and offer 
no hindrance to health or breathing. But in cer- 
tain individuals, mostly young children, the ade- 
noids have an abnormal growth and completely 
obstruct the passage of air through the nose. 
There results not only ndsality, but constant, 
mouth breathing and other constitutional, vocal, 
and mental anomalies. Adenoids form a perma- 
nent, complete, and serious nasal obstruction that 
shows definite physical signs to the: physician _ 
and a marked vocal. sign—nasality—to the 
voice expert. 
Treatment, In all these cases and others un- 
necessary to mention here there is only one cause 
and only one treatment. Our experimental way 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
of causing nasality with the thumb and finger 
illustrates both. The cause is always obstruc- 
tion. The treatment is removal of obstruction. 
The nasality caused by the ordinary cold passes 
away when the cold is overcome. Adenoids must 
be removed by operation. This frees the passage, 
and, if no bad habits have intervened, articula- 
tion assumes its proper form immediately. 
It is clear from this brief consideration that 
nasality due to mechanical obstruction is mostly 
a matter for the physician’s attention. It may 
well be asked, therefore, ‘“‘ Where is the teacher 
‘or vocal expert needed in cases of nasality?” ° 
There is more room, perhaps, for the teacher 
than for the doctor, as the latter often can do no 
more than prepare the ground er for the 
finishing work of the former. 
, , During the years of talking ile vocal ob- 
~ struction, bad habits of enunciation are usually 
formed which continue after the obstruction has 
been removed and cannot be corrected by the 
patient himself without help. These bad habits 
consist in poor breathing, faulty articulation, and 
lack of vocal flexibility. This matter of training 
after adenoid operations offers an important op- 
_portunity to the vocal trainer which will be re- 
served for later discussion. 
49.
-P-A-G-E-60
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
The two points for the teacher and voice 
trainer to remember under the subject of nasal- 
ity are, (1) a precaution, not to treat in a vocal 
way the nasality that is caused by obstruction, 
but to have that obstruction first removed, and 
(2) to devote all effort toward obliteration of the 
bad habits of speech that persist after such nasal 
obstructions have been eliminated. 
2. Monotony 
Monotony of voice is persistent sameness of 
pitch and intensity. Though there are some 
others, these are the principal causes of monot- 
ony that are amenable to treatment and there- 
fore the only ones we need to consider here. 
The causes of monotony are numerous, but 
the following are the most frequently encoun- 
tered: 
Absence of thought and emotion. Students of 
vocal psychology attribute changes in the voice 
to a change in the mental background. Con- 
versely, sameness of voice should be attributed 
to an unchanged condition of mind. Absence of 
thought and emotion, whatever may be the cause 
of it, is a prime cause of vocal monotony. This 
is clear enough in the idiot and imbecile, in whom 
we know thought has a very limited range. It is 
5°
-P-A-G-E-61
  MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
less easy to realize that many of those about us 
have but a slight range of thought and little or 
no emotion. Perhaps it would be better to say 
that they have little change of thought, little va- 
riety in their emotions. Special study of those 
who have monotonous voices will usually reveal 
the fact, after we become acquainted with their 
inner life, that their poverty of thought and emo- 
tion is the cause of their vocal monotony, 
Lack of responsiveness.The. mind cannot ex- 
press itself adequately through the voice unless 
the vocal mechanism — lungs, vocal cords, and 
resonant chambers — is fitted to respond, and to 
respond with an almost infinite delicacy and per- 
fection. But in many voices we find merely a 
rough, limited, hampered response to the de- 
mands of the mind. The deficiency is most 
marked when the voice is called upon to render 
minutely changing thought or sweeping changes 
in emotion. In the case cited above we have no 
variety of mental life to make the voice flexible. 
Here we may have a complicated variety in 
thought and emotion coupled with monotony of 
voice, merely because of a lack of responsiveness 
in the external vocal mechanism. 
Conservatism. The mind dominated by intense 
conservatism shows a peculiar monotony of voice 
5r
-P-A-G-E-62
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
which is hard to define. An acquaintance of 
mine who graduated from Harvard and taught in 
Vermont once said, when blamed for the even 
tenor of his voice, “ Well, you see, I come from 
the old New England families who can’t lose 
their heads over anything modern.” His words 
indicated an adequate cause of his vocal uniform- 
ity. 
Exclusive intellectuality. An unvaried intel- 
lectual life that leaves no room for emotion, en- 
thusiasm, or expressive activity, except in so far 
as these are controlled by the intellectual inter- 
ests, leads to: monotony of voice. A Harvard 
professor once complained to a voice specialist 
that his voice always tired his audiences. The 
reason lay in the monotony of voice resulting 
from his constant preoccupation with intellec- 
tual matters, and particularly those of his own 
specialty. 
Weariness. The monotony of voice due to fa- 
tigue is far from being the same as the monotony 
resulting from a deficient vocal mechanism. The 
former is temporary. The latter is a permanent 
pathological condition, or lack of development. 
Exhausted muscles, vocal cords, and other 
parts of the vocal mechanism lose the energy 
requisite for a sensitive and delicate response. 
52
-P-A-G-E-63
MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
The teacher who instructs from four to six hours 
a day knows that the closing hours — if monotony 
of voice appears — are her worst. The pupils are 
not interested, the work goes more slowly and the 
class learns less. Fatigue is a common cause of 
vocal monotony. 
Disease. Many forms of illness result in a uni- 
form vocal pitch and intensity that is to be 
eradicated only by attacking the disease itself, if 
curable. 
The convalescence of aphasia in its motor form, 
the severer forms of chorea, the bulbar form of 
infection with the spirocheta pallida, permanent 
damage to the muscles of phonation, as found in 
progressive muscular atrophy, and many ‘other 
nerve and brain conditions, affect the vocal mech- 
anism each in its own peculiar way and are to be 
reached and treated only by the nerve specialist. 
Often the physician needs to be called to deter- 
mine that no disease lies lurking in the back- 
ground and that the vocal trainer may feel free 
to proceed. And this suggests the mistake made 
by many voice trainers —especially those who 
try to treat defects in speech — when treatment 
for defects is initiated without a thorough physical 
examination by a competent specialist. Teacher 
and physician should work together, each in his 
33
-P-A-G-E-64
  
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
proper sphere. Neither should attempt to usurp 
the duties of the other, although both work to- 
ward the same end of final cure. 
Treatment. Monotony is easily treated. Sing- 
ing lessons are good. Exercises leading to vocal 
flexibility are often sufficient to correct monotony 
in the speaking voice alone. But in cases in which 
vocal monotony has resulted from a deep-rooted 
conservatism or from a too exclusively intellectual 
life, a more extensive and deep-going method of 
cure must be adopted. Profound psychological 
changes must be effected if permanent vocal va- 
riety is to result. Of course, it must always be 
carefully considered whether such radical and 
protracted treatment is worth while. Most cases 
of vocal monotony are cured by easier means. 
Weariness of the vocal apparatus is cured by 
rest, and disease should be referred to the phy- 
sician. 
It is clear, then, that the larger proportion of 
‘cases falls to the teacher. They are to be treated 
by the ordinary vocal exercises which lead to con- 
trol of the breath and to the flexibility of the 
voice. Through the judicious use of these exer- 
cises the commoner forms of vocal monotony are 
to be cured. i

3: Harshness and hoarseness 
A definition. A harsh voice is one made rasp- 
ing, rough, or husky by the dominance of some 
intense mental state that temporarily or perma- 
nently dispels smoothness, evenness, fine quality. 
In other words, harshness finds its final cause in 
the persistence of a mental complex. This indi- 
cates a distinction between harshness and hoarse- 
ness. The former is due to a mental condition 
which finds its expression through a normal vocal 
mechanism; the latter, hoarseness, has no neces- 
sary connection with any mental state, it occurs 
in connection with all sorts. of normal mental 
states, it is also possible in any abnormal mental 
state. The merely rasping and husky voice is 
caused by some physical change, like swelling, in- 
flammation, or constriction of the external vocal 
mechanism. .Harshness is caused by a mental 
state, hoarseness by a physical state. Vocal harsh- 
ness may be due to a fit of temper. One may be- 
come hoarse by yelling for an hour at a football 
game and so causing some irritation of the vocal 
passages. But no one would say that a fit of 
temper makes one hoarse, or that an hour’s yell- 
ing makes one’s voice harsh. The distinction, 
then, is clear. We may assert that harshness 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
is due to a mental condition reported by the 
voice. 
Harshness and hoarseness are not, however, 
mutually exclusive. Hoarseness often clouds 
harshness, though the reverse condition is never 
found. This concealment of the harsh voice by 
hoarseness is not permanent, but vanishes as soon 
as the physical {cause of the hoarseness passes 
away. Harshness often persists permanently, 
since the mental states lying back of it are often 
more or less permanent. Permanence and mental 
cause are then the distinguishing criteria of harsh- 
ness. 
Causes. As we have seen, the causes of vocal 
harshness must be enduring mental states, con- 
ditions of mind that persist for a long time, atti- 
tudes that have become ingrained characteristics 
or permanent moods. 
Selfishness. 1 intend no reference to the little 
passing selfish acts of everyday life, although 
these are more or less reported by the voice. The 
selfishness here referred to is deep and perma- 
nent — that which results from the feeling that one 
has been maltreated by a cold, heartless world 
and a consequent resolution to live and act only 
for self. Or the deep-seated selfishness which I 
have in mind’ may result from intense conflict 
56
-P-A-G-E-67
MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
with the great selfish interests of the outer world. 
For example, poverty or sudden loss may cause 
and enforce a selfishness so profound that it 
comes to control our every act and finally casts 
its shadow even upon the voice. 
This dominant selfi shpess may take many forms, 
even shapes that under ‘the circumstances seem 
justifiable: self-preservation, dire need, uncalled- 
for self-seeking, the desire for revenge, selfish 
ambition. Harshness dominates in the voice of 
Lady Macbeth. By changing one word in a quo- 
tation from Pope I can illustrate the important 
distinction already made: 
“°T is not enough, no hoarseness gives offense; 
The sound must seem an echo to the sense.” 
That is, a merely hoarse voice never offends. 
It is the ugly voice emanating from ugliness of 
thought that pains us. It is not the bad voice, 
but the bad thought behind the bad voice, that 
gives offense. 
Treatment. Hoarseness needs the doctor. 
Harshness needs the teacher, the psychologist, 
the psycho-analyst. Hoarseness due to inflamma- 
tion and consequent swelling disappears when 
medical measures relieve the inflammation. Ton- 
sillitis requires local treatment. The quinsy sore 
57
-P-A-G-E-68
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
throat must at once employ the services of the 
surgeon. Fatigue, when relieved, takes a conse- 
quent hoarseness with it. Throat spasm demands 
vocal relaxing exercises to relieve laryngeal con- 
tractions. The nervous strain often indicated by 
hoarseness has many forms and as many modes 
of relief. But these are matters that should be 
left to expert medical care and which therefore 
demand no minute consideration in this place. 
The treatment of vocal harshness is quite an- 
other matter. The very foundations of thought 
and action must be tapped, exposed to view, 
studied, and then remodeled. As I have already 
intimated, there is always a question whether such 
heroic treatment is worth while in the individual 
case. On account of peculiarities in environ- 
ment, some lives and minds are made hard and re- 
pellent by the very necessity of self-protection. 
With the cases amenable to treatment a long pro- 
gram of educational remodeling is the only road 
to permanent recovery. That remodeling con- 
sists in instilling higher motives of conduct, 
lasting altruistic interests, and final complete for- 
getfulness of the old, selfish, narrow life. When 
one has learned the joy of living for others, harsh- 
ness of voice disappears. Thus, the teacher is 
called upon to teach and to exemplify a very great 
58  
-P-A-G-E-69
MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
lesson in order to instill a much less important 
one. She must eradicate a great fault — perhaps 
the greatest — before she can uproot this com- 
paratively slight one —vocal harshness. A young 
lady, about ready as far as age was concerned to 
“come out”’ into society, found herself, or, more 
exactly, was found to be meagerly educated, un- 
attractive, unpleasing in conversation. Moreover, 
what none could explain, she was harsh in voice. 
She sprang from an old New England family in 
which the inheritance of an honorable name was 
considered all-sufficient, whether any character, 
accomplishments, or worth accompanied this or 
not. Before her “coming out,” however, she 
wanted to improve. She sought advice, which, 
when followed, made her, as she said, “ entirely 
over.” She was given some all-absorbing, active, 
hard work among poor people, which she followed 
for a few years. Her power to help grew, she 
saw real life among the needy. Previously a novel, 
an evening “dressed” at home, and hours with 
the embroidery needle at the fireside had quite 
satisfied her inherited tendency toward industry, 
but a larger life, real work for others’ good, and 
the demands of altruism showed her that her 
previous life had been narrow, selfish, and really 
low, 
59
-P-A-G-E-70
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
As a result of this profound spiritual change, 
the old voice vanished, when and how she knew 
not. She did know that she was almost another 
person, and others knew that her old voice, hard 
and harsh, had been somehow replaced by another 
voice that was smooth, round, rich and mellow. 
4. Hasty speech 
To define: A hasty speech is one that shows 
undue speed in utterance. By undue speed of ut- 
terance I mean a quicker succession of words 
than is called for by the circumstances in which 
they are spoken. We speak of rash acts, deeds 
that are precipitate, acting without deliberation. 
We are now to discuss, with regard to speech, a 
similar precipitancy, a similar hastening onward 
with speed unwarranted by the circumstances. 
Causes. The causes of hasty speech are many 
and subtle. Jztation is one of the often un- 
thought-of causes. We frequently notice certain 
other modes of speech running in families. Pe- 
culiarities of pronunciation, speech accompanied 
by facial twists, even forms of smiles, run in a 
family. Forms of gestures, ways and habits of 
eating or of removing the hat, of saying good- 
night, and what not, descend from father to son. 
Comparatively seldom do we find the rate of 
60
-P-A-G-E-71
  
MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
speaking inherited, of course through the medium 
of habitual imitation. 
Imagination, vivid and prolific, frequently re- 
sults in hasty speech. Those whose mental crea- 
tions are turned off at a terrific rate feel that 
words are too slow, feel that language retards 
them, It certainly does lag behind in the pace 
set by their imaginations. The market is over- 
stocked, their storehouse of thought is over- 
crowded and seeks relief. Speed of speech is the 
only outlet, and so a terrific speech is maintained 
to keep pace with the sweeping speed of their 
imaginative manufacture. 
The habit of stuttering is another frequent 
cause of speed in utterance. The stutterer sees 
ahead of him certain words over which he knows 
he is going to stumble — certain sounds he will 
have to repeat perhaps ten times with severe 
muscle contractions of his throat, even of his 
face, and sometimes with gross bodily contor- 
tions. He has discovered a trick to prevent such 
anticipated stutter —the trick of whipping up his 
horses and going at a breakneck speed past his 
difficulty. Having succeeded once by means of 
this stratagem, he learns to rely on speed, until 
finally hasty speech becomes his usual mode of 
vocal production. At length, whether occasion 
Or 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
calls for it or not, he habitually rushes his words 
off with terrific dispatch. 
Interruptions. Among refined people it is con- 
sidered impolite for one to interrupt another in 
conversation. In many families, however, the 
members break in upon one another’s speech 
with constant interruptions. Rapid utterance is 
resorted to when one sees an interruption com- 
ing in order to finish what one has to say before 
being cut off—sometimes even to succeed in 
getting a word in edgewise. 
Other causes there are, but since the treatment 
varies little from case to case, whatever the cause 
may be, let us proceed to consider : 
Treatment. In the treatment of this as of all 
other-forms of vocal defect, one must first elicit 
a desire and ambition for normal utterance. With- 
out this desire and ambition for normal speech it 
is impossible to get any one to go through the 
steps necessary to its attainment. 
If the difficulty is due to an abnormally swift 
and prolific imagination —if the unhappy pos- 
sessor of the hasty voice thinks like the three 
witches in Macbeth from one end of the universe 
to the other, in an instant including everything 
between, then I must confess that I know hardly 
any cure. Who can curb the flight of a witch’s 
62 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
         MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
imagination ; who can cut short such copious and 
prolific manufacture of visual pictures; who can 
control a mind thus wildly let loose? There are, 
however, certain precautions which one may at- 
tempt, such as moderation, reserve, inhibition of 
expression. One may use the sedative of self- 
control, and this, after years of practice, may re- 
sult in some change. Here the task is difficult 
and hardly worth while in the face of the truth 
that hasty speech is not such a terrible misde- 
meanor after all. We should count the cost and 
see if the long effort necessary to cure is likely 
to be justified by the result. 
If fear of stuttering is the promoter of rapid 
utterance there is at first but one step to take — 
refer the sufferer to some reliable practitioner 
and voice specialist or to a lay teacher thoroughly: 
trained under the personal direction of such an 
expert. 
Stuttering is a pretty serious condition, as it 
excludes the possessor from all kinds of normal 
social intercourse. It often makes friendships im- 
possible ; it postpones or entirely prevents mar- 
riage; many times it prevents a man from ob- 
taining permanent employment. Such a serious 
condition should be under the care of the vocal ex- 
pert so as to avoid the relapses that so frequently 
63
-P-A-G-E-74
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
occur when the casual, untrained teacher is em- 
ployed. Training for moderate speed of speech will 
not cure stuttering ; it may temporarily, or rather, 
momentarily, sidetrack the malady. A permanent 
cure, however, requires a reformation of the inner 
personality by a long process of psychological 
analysis and synthesis. This subject — the treat- 
ment of stuttering—is too large for adequate 
consideration here. The only phase of it that 
logically comes up for consideration has to do 
with the speed of the stutterer’s utterance. This 
sometimes lasts after the recovery and sometimes 
is the main part of the stutterer’s habit. A good 
way to overcome this is to have the stutterer talk 
with a metronome ticking at the precise rate at 
which you wish him to utter his words. This, 
However, is a mechanistic and external treatment. 
The better and the psychological method is to 
get slowness through mental concepts, and their 
installation, as a permanent mental possession — 
the control of motor output by instillation of sen- 
sory content. 
Summary: Hasty voice comes out of impell- 
ing mental complexes — the demand of imitation, 
the effort to keep up with the flight of imagina- 
tion, the resort to speed to sidetrack a stutter — 
concepts that sidetrack inhibition, and allow ut- 
64
-P-A-G-E-75
  MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
terance in uncalled-for speed. Briefly, the treat- 
ment consists in annulling the causes, reinstating 
a normal inhibition, and implanting new constel- 
lations of ideas that work as complexes for slow- 
ness. 
5. Slovenly speech 
As slovenly dress differs from dirty, faded, 
and ragged dress, so slovenly speech differs from 
nasality, monotony, harshness, hoarseness, and 
hasty speech. It is, in reality, unduly relaxed, 
lazy speech. It results from a lack of careful 
mental guidance, from carelessness in following 
articulation models. 
Mental states of dejection, weariness, submis- 
sion to a power recognized as higher than that 
of the individual’s will, report themselves in the 
voice and show in what is here named slovenly 
speech. Countries in which women are very sub- 
missive, as they are in Russia and certain parts 
of Germany, are likely to be countries in which the 
women are slovenly in attire, physical attitude, 
and voice. The three things are usually found 
together, since they are all equally the exterior- 
ization of one mental state. 
What sort of mental state is this? It may be 
described as a state of listlessness. Where the

dress lacks neatness and refinement, the voice is 
likely to lack precision and subtle gradation of 
tone and quality. In slovenly speech all the life, 
enthusiasm and animation of normal utterance are 
gone. It is like a befogged picture, a misted 
landscape. 
I remember the case of a young man upon 
whom three disasters fell in one day. He failed in 
his entrance examinations at Harvard ; his father 
lost all his money ; his mother, in consequence, 
went insane. The weight of this threefold mis- 
fortune made him for a time utterly dejected, 
purposeless, without interest in life, and the 
whole experience resulted temporarily in a slov- 
enly voice. 
Children who are forced to work too early in 
life and who have not been given adequate in- 
struction in manners and morals are likely to be 
slovenly in speech. So also are the wives of tyran- 
nical husbands and men who spend their lives in 
subordinate positions, always doing menial labor. 
Degradation, poverty, and neglect make people 
slovenly, but not always. Many escape. For this 
reason, it seems clear that there is nothing inev- 
itable in such a result, A will sufficiently alert 
and strong can avoid this consequence, even 
under the most depressing external conditions, 
66

  MINOR SPEECH DISORDERS 
Imitation of older members of the family fre- 
quently causes slovenly habits and slovenly speech 
in children, but this powerful influence also may 
be overcome. 
The treatment for slovenly speech is largely 
psychological and moral. Self-respect and a de- 
sire for the respect of others must be instilled. 
In the case of those who are timid, withdrawing, 
unduly submissive, it is well to instill ideas of the 
moral, civil, and social equality of all men. It will 
be found that as the patient comes to take a more 
exalted view of his own powers and position in 
the world, his slovenly manners and speech will 
fall gradually and naturally away from him.

HOW THE TEACHER MAY ACQUIRE A PROPER 
STANDARD OF SPEECH 
Proper standards of speech are to be attained 
only by taking a larger view of speech than most 
teachers seem to have. When the teacher has 
studied the subject, when she has, for example, 
taken summer courses and has had a year’s ex- 
perience in practical work, then, to be sure, she 
should be capable of this larger view to which I 
refer, but no one can attain it by listening to a 
few words of instruction, by reading a book, or 
even by seeing in class, on the stage, or in the 
clinic, the outward expression of its attainment. 
One really has to pass through the training him- 
self. Here, as in religion, one has to “live the 
life to know the law.” 
To indicate, as far as can be done by the 
printed word, this larger conception, and fuller 
appreciation of speech is the purpose of the fol- 
lowing paragraphs. 
The study of the voice and of speech has many 
phases. Some are more necessary than others. 
68

“A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
A few may seem to the uninitiated quite unnec- 
essary. When speech is understood in a broad 
sense, however, and its scope and complexity are 
appreciated, when one sees the full difficulty and 
importance of the speech problem in schools, 
then it becomes clear that the teacher should add 
to her equipment year by year until finally she 
becomes invulnerable in knowledge and versa- 
tility. 
I propose to suggest places and ways in which 
to obtain this knowledge. Also I wish to show 
the utter inadequacy of the poorly trained and 
the danger, even to the teacher herself, of inade- 
quate equipment. 
I. Time spent in regular grade work 
Teachers know that even when they graduate 
from the normal school they are sufficiently inex- 
perienced. They realize this still more keenly 
after they have taught two or three years. The 
schools where they are first employed realize the 
same thing. ® 
v The speech teacher also needs experience in 
the grades. Without such experience, she does not 
realize how to start with a class nor how to man- 
age a group of children. A teacher who has had 
several years of experience has no difficulties of 
69
-P-A-G-E-80
  - SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
this sort. The experienced teacher knows how 
children learn; she knows how quickly they for- 
get; she knows how frequently they need re- 
view ; she knows, too, how easily they get into 
wrong habits ; how they are prone to evade their 
superiors, and finally, how easily they may be di- 
rected by the tactful guide. 
Regular grade work is an important asset to 
the speech teacher. I should recommend at least 
a year of it. Those who have had two or three 
years are naturally better fitted. Occasionally I 
have found a teacher who has had ten years of 
grade work before starting in speech, but this, of 
course, is exceptional and really unnecessary. In- 
structors in the schools from which speech teach- 
ers are turned out ought to require a year or two 
of training in the grades as a requisite for admis- 
sion, From this word on general grade work and 
its value to the speech teacher, let us pass to 
some other forms of education and personal de- 
velopment, accomplishments that help in ‘the 
management of the class for defective speech. 
2. Value of elocution, music, psychology 
Elocution, oratory, oral English, public speak- 
ing, or whatever one may call it, is a sphere of 
training that adds greatly to the training of the 
40
-P-A-G-E-81
  
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
speech teacher. I do not refer here to that mere 
reading knowledge to be derived from the books 
on public speaking, nor do I refer to the super- 
ficial experience to be gained in a few lessons with 
a private elocution teacher. I do not refer to the 
mere committing selections to memory and the 
giving of them in solitude or even in public. 
Those who have done no more than this are com- 
paratively ignorant of the field and, if they claim 
much, they are mere pretenders. | In order to pur- 
sue the study of oratory worthily and properly 
one should go through one of the recognized 
schools. Only so can one hope to develop step by 
step through the long stages of oratorical evo- 
lution toward anything resembling the mental 
powers and characteristics of the expert actors. 
The proper study of oratory brings personal 
development as well as knowledge of how the 
minds of others njgy be unfolded. It shows the 
scope of imagination and raises one’s ideals of 
vocal and phonetic execution. \ 
Musical ability is another aid to the teacher in 
the classroom for speech disorder and cannot but 
add enjoyment and success to her management. 
The utility of the piano in such a classroom is 
obvious. Singing can be occasionally introduced to 
’ break up the monotony of vocal exercises, and the 
qt
-P-A-G-E-82
} 
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
possession of musical knowledge helps one in the 
understanding of phonetics and mental functions. 
_/ Aknowledge of psychology is invaluable. Elo- 
cution is based upon psychology, but upon an in- 
dividual, living, functional, active, psychology. I 
speak now of academic psychology. This refers 
much more to what is true of the mind in gen- 
eral than to what is true of individual mentality. 
Psychology should be studied in summer courses 
and by reading, by introspection, and by re- 
searches in the classroom. 
3. Phonetics not to be learned from books 
The idea that the whole science of phonetics, 
including, of course, methods of correcting de- 
fects, can be learned exclusively from books, is 
so common a misconception that I have thought 
it worth while to attack it directly and vigorously. 
Granted that something can be learned in this 
way — perhaps a third — in such subjects as this, 
however, the ear is the special avenue of knowl- 
edge. Printed words can give at best a very 
meager description of anything phonetic, whether 
it be the simple description of normal utterances, 
methods of phonetic treatment, or processes of 
evolution from the beginning of utterances to the 
final perfection thereof. 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
Describe the voice, for example, of some great 
man and say that his speech was emotional, had 
volume, flexibility, and clearness. To the initiated 
these terms mean more perhaps than to others, 
but how far is that description from the real voice 
itself! 
Let me add an illustration of this important 
fact that some sorts of knowledge are communi- 
cable almost solely through the ear. The singing 
teachers of to-day feel a real superiority to their 
fellows of the younger generation in being able 
to say, “I have heard Patti.” They really feel 
that they can communicate a peculiar excellence 
because they have a peculiar ideal, that they have 
a sort of refinement gained through the hearing 
of this great singer, which those who have never 
heard her cannot possibly ever possess. 
Ideals of phonetic excellence can be obtained 
only by actual study under the masters of pho- 
netic execution ; by actually hearing the utterances 
that illustrate absence of,different functions in 
the nervous system, by actually seeing experts 
vary and change voices under treatment, by ac- 
tually hearing that change itself and learning to 
interpret it, by actually listening, under direction, 
to a great variety of speech defects as well as to 
normal and highly developed speech. 
73
-P-A-G-E-84
  ‘SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
Books, then, carry but a little way in this study. 
One must learn to hear, he must expand and re- 
fine his interpretations of what is heard, he must 
learn under expert guidance to think upon aural 
sensations, so that all this may formulate an ideal 
output. 
4. Special training for the correction of stutterers 
All sorts of persons consider themselves fitted 
by attainments or by nature to treat stuttering. 
Persons who have been cured of stuttering by 
some one else, others who have cured themselves, 
and —I mention it with a blush and a shudder 
— sometimes even uncured stutterers who, be- 
cause they have the disease, claim a knowledge 
of it, offer their services in the effort to cure 
others. This sounds plausible and right only to 
the ignorant and unsophisticated. 
The training necessary to one who undertakes 
to treat stuttering is more extensive than one is 
likely to imagine. One must show tact in the 
management of patients. Every patient must be 
given a physical examination in order to eliminate 
any physical ailment which may be a cause of the 
speech disorder or may be sapping vitality and so 
preventing recovery. The teacher should know 
something about the history of treatment for 
74
-P-A-G-E-85
A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH ! 
stuttering. She should know the modern psycho- 
logical investigations in both the conscious and 
the subconscious fields, She should know the 
value of visualization processes in relation to 
stuttering. Above all, she should realize the im- 
portance and value of what is vaguely called sug- 
gestive therapeutics. 
Teachers trained for speech improvement 
should not be discouraged by these high stand- 
ards. These standards do not prevent one’s be- 
ginning teaching in a small way. One can begin 
work in speech instruction with only a little prep- 
aration. The bigness of the field coupled with 
the small requirements for entrance to it should 
lure numerous teachers to the undertaking. Let 
us not be satisfied, however, with this modest 
beginning, but let us add constantly to our equip- 
ment. 
5. Special training for the “ special class” 
In the “special class” are included all grades 
of mental defectives from the idiot and the im- 
becile to the moron and the specialized defect. 
The application of speech improvement to this 
class is our present problem. 
Normal phonetics is usually tried upon these 
cases. That this is folly has been shown else- 
75
-P-A-G-E-86
  
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
where. The systems and methods mentioned in 
our closing pagés show this conclusively. The 
speech teacher who is called upon to conduct 
such a special class should seek instruction in 
places where a special phonetic system is applied 
to these pathological cases ; she should learn the 
methods of examination and treatment peculiarly 
adapted to them and should get to know their 
psychological background. 
6. Where to go for training 
Two or three medical schools, one or two uni- 
versities, several private individuals, and a num- 
ber of speech experts abroad, offer expert instruc- 
tion in speech disorders. I will try to mention 
these in the order in which they were founded, 
They are: The Medical School of Philadelphia, 
the Rush Medical School in Chicago, the Har- 
vard) Graduate School of Medicine in Boston, the 
Columbia Medical School in New York City, the 
State University, Columbus, Ohio. I hardly think 
the names of private individuals are needed. 
One should not allow considerations of distance 
or expense to interfere with one’s choice of the 
school that affords the best possible training. 
The fact that schools, like individuals, have spe- 
cialties, makes it advisable to attend several insti- 
76
-P-A-G-E-87
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
tutions in order to complete one’s equipment. 
One should never feel that any single master, 
even the greatest, can teach all that there is to 
know about so complex a subject. One should 
have as many masters as possible. 
The first question, however, is where to begin. 
This somewhat depends upon one’s previous 
study, whether he has already had training in 
psychology, elocution, and regular grade work, or 
whether he is entirely a novice. 
Choice of a master is best made by frankly 
writing to all those who offer courses in speech 
disorder and asking them for details of their - 
courses, with a list of steps in their training and 
addresses of students, Then I should carefully 
compare the answers received to discover which 
are merely throat men, which have studied only 
oratory in addition to medicine, which have stud- 
ied abroad, and which, finally, have thorough 
training in a// the fields of knowledge that can 
be in any way helpful to their work. In all this, 
of course, one should remember the value of the 
specialist. I know, for example, of only one man 
who offers a course in the neuropathology of the 
speech mechanism, I should write to about five 
student references and find out if their courses 
were satisfactory, if they got what they went for, 
7

  ‘SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
if the teachers seemed to know their subject, and 
if the methods they inculcated were really effec- 
tive in actually curing patients. _ 
7. Is medical knowledge necessary ? 
There can be no doubt that the problem of 
speech disorder is a medical problem. The few 
who deny this might as well say that nursing is 
not medical. The fact that much of the treatment 
is educational makes no difference ; the fact that 
a knowledge of psychology is necessary does not 
alter the case. A medical problem it is. The 
question arises, then, is medical knowledge neces- 
sary, and if so, what sort and extent of medical 
knowledge? 
Some physicians have grasped the opportunity 
offered to them in the problems of speech and 
have found the work lucrative, interesting, and 
of great value. There are localities, however, 
where medical men fail or refuse to understand 
the situation. They are like a New York lawyer 
of whom I once heard. One on the opposite side 
of the case asked him, “Can’t you see that?” 
His answer was, “ Yes, sir; but I won’t.” Such 
men finally discover that their exclusiveness has 
succeeded only in excluding themselves. 
Where medical men refuse to take up the 
78 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
speech problem in a diagnostic way I advise my 
own teachers to become acquainted with the medi- 
cal side and to usurp the activities of the physician 
in as full and scientific a way as possible. 
Medical knowledge is a great asset to the 
teacher. It solves many otherwise insoluble prob- 
lems; it explains some of her failures and excuses 
her to herself and to the superintendent. I always 
try first to open the field to the physician so that 
he may take his proper place in the school cur- 
riculum and in the speech circle, but when he 
refuses, I try to inspire the teacher to do what 
the medical man can’t or won’t do. In case this 
induces the medical man to come later, my answer 
is “too late.” Medical men have refused to go into 
the field of specialized suggestive therapy, and as 
a consequence laymen to-day have their patients, 
The speech-disorder problem is similar. It has 
previously been mostly in the hands of charlatans 
and impostors, using veiled, suggestive therapeu- 
tics without knowing the reason for their cures. 
Now this field is being returned to the medical 
profession, but in those cases where he does not 
seize his opportunity, the teacher can do no bet- 
ter than to take his place. 
In a word, speech defect is a medical problem 
and medical knowledge is often necessary. If a 
79
-P-A-G-E-90
  | 
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
physician’s services are available, that is enough. 
If not, let the teacher take the physician’s place, 
do his work, and take his pay. 
8. Value of work in a special clinic 
The teacher’s own standards of speech should 
be as high as possible if she is to carry her pupils 
to the highest possible attainments. We cannot 
lift others in religion or ethics to any higher plane 
than that on which we live ourselves. It is the 
same in speech. The teacher’s class will not rise 
to a standard of speech higher than her own. 
standard of speech than that to be found in long 
service in a spécial clinic for speech disorders. 
This clinical experience should follow the period 
of didactic instruction and should be followed in 
turn by a period in which the learner watches in 
that speech clinic; and following this, a period of 
watching an expert examine and treat cases. This 
observation of the work of others should be fol- 
lowed by an application of the same technique 
to the old and new patients in the same clinic 
under the criticism of the expert speech specialist. 
Besides these there are other things that make 
the service in a speech clinic of inestimable value 
and interest. One of these is the carrying for- 
80
-P-A-G-E-91
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
ward of researches, the compilation of data, the 
reading of papers. I should choose a clinic con- 
ducted by a man interested not only in treatment 
but in research, a clinic in which there are public 
meetings and the reading of papers. All these 
things add zest, interest, and enthusiasm to the 
work, and improve the equipment of students, 
Speech clinics that do no teaching, that carry 
on no researches, get out no papers,and have no 
“ authors’ evenings,” are uninteresting and unpro- 
gressive. Each of these activities increases the 
value and excellence of every other one. Research 
improves treatment. Preparation of papers gives 
research and treatment added momentum, and 
the occasion of the author’s evening or “read- 
ing” adds an enthusiasm to the work of the clinic 
which can be secured in no other way. 
Clinical work -gives the teacher a deeper insight 
into treatment, gives her the research spirit, in- 
cites her to publication. All this leads to new 
and better appointments. By long experience in 
the clinical work she sees the folly of applying 
one and the “ only method ” to every case; she 
learns that every case is different from every 
other and therefore requires a new and different 
method of approach. The teacher should investi- 
gate all these things before she studies anywhere. 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  “SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
9. Visiting other schools 
Didactic lectures, speech-clinic service, read- 
ing, actual experience in teaching — these are 
among the best ways of perfecting that proper 
standard of speech which should be the final pos- 
session of every efficient teacher. 
In the visiting of other schools, however, one 
is likely to find important additions to and correc- 
tions of his own methods, no matter how perfect 
he may think they have been Experienced teach- 
ers who have studied under other masters can 
provide a somewhat different perspective and 
can illustrate points of view that we had not 
thought of. 
The author has made three surveys of the work 
in correction of speech disorders done in the pub- 
lic schools. In all, I have visited some twenty- 
five cities of the United States, trying to ascertain 
what ways and means have been employed and 
what results have been secured. I have learned 
much from these surveys, and I most strongly 
recommend the school visit, therefore, to the 
teacher who has less acquaintance with the work 
than my own twenty years of experience have 
given me. The novice, however, can learn little 
in this way. 
82
-P-A-G-E-93
  
A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
Programs for school visitations should be made 
regularly. Once or twice a year a teacher should 
have a week off and visit a neighboring city. Oc- 
casionally she should travel farther to attend large 
educational meetings, hear the papers of other 
teachers, and in this way get new knowledge and 
new methods. 
10, The pitfalls for the poorly trained teacher 
The ideals of speech work hinted at in the 
previous pages put the standard of attainment 
and the final goal of excellence on a pretty high 
plane. It will be well, therefore, to spend a few 
paragraphs in discussing the dangers which beset 
the specialist who falls short of this high ideal 
of equipment. 
It will be well to begin with the lowest in the 
scale — with utter incompetency and ignorance. 
One does not need to question the sincerity of 
these inefficient practitioners. It is their ineffi- 
ciency with which we are here concerned. A con- 
crete case will illustrate my point. I know of an 
instance in which a child with defective speech 
was written to by a distant private individual who 
had not seen the case or tried to know anything 
about its medical background, but who promised 
complete cure in three months at the rate of one 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
hundred dollars a month. The mother of this 
child had five hundred dollars in the bank. It 
took her other two hundred dollars to transport 
her child, keep him in the distant city for three 
months, and bring him home. After his return 
he was taken to a charity clinic where he paid 
nothing for expert opinion which, in the course 
of about two hours, established the fact that the 
case was one of congenital syphilis. On this basis 
the physician was able to say that nothing what- 
ever could be done to improve the speech. I 
cannot call this performance anything but down- 
right robbery, for no improvement resulted, 
Numerous cases have come to me from teach- 
ers in the public schools. They can be classed 
as stuttering, phonetic, and mentally defective 
cases. I have known stutterers who have been 
treated for two years without any improvement. 
Investigation of the methods employed showed 
that the teachers who applied the treatment for 
stuttering knew absolutely nothing about the 
cause of cure in any successful treatment. They 
put all cases through the same regular routine. 
If a third or so improved, they seemed to think 
that there was no reason why the others should 
not. I have repeatedly asked such teachers how 
the stutterer was cured, and I find that where 
84
-P-A-G-E-95
A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
failures are frequent, there is constantly this ig- 
norance as to the proper cure for stuttering. 
Phonetic cases are attacked by the untrained 
teacher by a parrot-like method. She has been 
studying some book, little knowing that from 
books one can learn little of phonetics, or she 
may have been attending some superficial course 
of lectures in which her attention has been ab- 
sorbed in the mere mechanism of speech. She 
has learned little rules and directions by which 
phonetic defects are supposed to be corrected, 
and she applies them all, parrot-like, to every 
case. She may even have been cured of one de- 
fect, such as lisping, herself. On this basis she 
considers herself competent to teach not only 
other lispers but all mispronouncers. 
This is the condition of those who think that 
speech is not a medical problem. Such persons 
often exhibit, in exact proportion to the amount 
of their ignorance, a happy optimism and a pro- 
fuse array of promises of recovery that often 
stagger the speech expert. Of course they cap- 
ture the patient and entice the ignorant layman. 
The guarantee of cure, which science fears to 
give, allures the unwary. 
Mental defective speech cases are those in which 
the hopeful, altruistic teacher makes her most 
85
-P-A-G-E-96
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
signal failure. I have seen numerous cases of 
mental defect treated for months and sometimes 
for years with little or no progress, We are accus- 
tomed to excuse such performances on the ground 
that the teacher did not know any better, having 
been trained only in normal phonetics when she 
should have been trained also in methods appli- 
cable to pathological cases. Her action is not 
dissimilar to the practice of medicine without a 
license. If there were any danger in the use of 
her appliances, if there were any use of medicine 
in the technical sense, then she would be liable 
in law. The spirit of the law reaches farther than 
the law itself. She is defying the spirit of the 
law when she ignorantly takes up these medical 
cases without proper medical speech training. 
Her ignorance makes no difference in the eye of 
the law, and it should surely make no difference 
here. I consider her action a punishable offense. ~ 
Inadequate training, finally, is dangerous to 
the teacher in her own person. The sense of in- 
adequacy coupled with the sense of great respon- 
sibility which every teacher engaged in speech 
work must feel, is more than the average nerv- 
ous system can endure. Only the calm assur- 
ance of mastery which comes of thorough prep- 
aration can avail to carry one without undue 
86
-P-A-G-E-97
  A PROPER STANDARD OF SPEECH 
nervous strain through the arduous, exacting 
work of the speech teacher. 
Another too frequent blunder in this field of 
speech correction which may be avoided by those 
who choose their instructors wisely is seen in bad 
school management. It is, for example, a great 
mistake to employ a “ special teacher” to give her 
entire time to speech correction in the schools. 
The work is too monotonous for her good and 
her pupils are injured by being temporarily re- 
moved from the grades. She loses contact with 
the normal child minds with which the ordinary 
grade teacher deals. The board loses a grade 
teacher and pays high for a special teacher. 
All these things are avoided by the solution 
which I propose. The “ part-time teacher” con- 
tinues her grade work and allows her speech pu- 
pils to remain in the grades. She meets them for 
a short time after school. This gives her variety 
of work in the place of monotony. The board 
loses no teacher and saves the expense of a high- 
salaried specialist by raising the part-time teacher’s 
salary a little annually. Thus there are obvious 
advantages to pupils, to teachers, and to school 
boards alike.

SPEECH IMPROVEMENT IN KINDERGARTEN 
AND ELEMENTARY GRADES 
PREVENTION in speech disorders has scarcely yet 
begun. The case is similar in other fields. It 
took modern medicine over one hundred’ years 
» to recognize prevention as its most important 
function. But why is this? The reason is that 
we see the problem, so to speak, only in its ad- 
vance guard, and we strike only at the foes that 
we see. It would be better to train our long- 
range guns over the first-line trenches and upon 
the roads and centers of supply which feed them. 
Diseases were first attacked by seeking some 
method of eliminating them directly. It was many 
years afterwards that men sought to uproot the 
origins of disease. In the speech disorder move- 
ment of the present day we have already passed 
through one or two phases. We have seen the 
problem. We have attacked the problem where 
it seems most obvious, in the years, namely, from 
eight to sixteen. Let us take a warning from the 
history of medicine and initiate a program of 
88
-P-A-G-E-99
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
prevention before we are forced into it by find- _ 
ing the old program useless, Let us start at ~ 
once on prevention. 
It is hard to do this. A school committee can 
be made to see that speech defect should be elim- 
inated in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. 
There the problem looms large enough to seem 
worthy of an appropriation of funds, If we sug- 
gest, however, that the problem be attacked lower 
down, on the side of prevention, and advise that 
the work be initiated in the kindergarten and 
primary grades, nobody will be moved an inch! 
Enlightened teachers and superintendents should 
do what they can to change this condition of 
affairs. 
Ideals of prevention, following the aims of 
medicine, lead us to start our program of speech 
reform in the kindergarten. Dare I hint the ad- 
visability of going still farther back? I fear it 
isn’t quite time. I fear we shall have to attack 
the preventive problem in the kindergarten fora 
few years before it can be generally realized that 
still farther back lies the real spring from which 
our speech disorders take their origin. Preven- 
tion in the home, then, will be reserved for another 
time. School managements may balk even at this 
suggestion that they make their chief point of 
89
-P-A-G-E-100
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
attack in the kindergarten, but they would cer- 
tainly balk if we tried to initiate any program of 
prevention in the homes! I see no reason, how- 
ever, why, five or ten years from now, there 
should not be sent out from the superintendent’s 
office a corps of visiting social workers to go into 
the homes of children who are to come into the 
school in a year and give them, where necessary, 
a year’s instruction in speech. Then we should 
naturally find the problem removed from the kin- 
dergarten to a great extent, just as we expect to 
remove it from the higher grades, by concentrat- 
ing our attack upon the kindergarten. 
1. Importance of the child’s speech environment 
/“ Speech disorders in the early grades tend to 
make us look backward to see whence they have 
come, not for the sake of initiating any method 
of treatment, not for the sake of prevention, but 
to get whatever information we need for the treat- 
ment of the cases. 
¥ Imitation plays an important part, as we have 
already noticed, in the child’s speech defects. 
Foreign accent in the home is almost sure to in- 
fluence the child’s speech in school. Almost all 
phonetic defects, and very often lisping, have 
their origin in imitation of some one in the home.

That stuttering is often caused by imitation has 
been recognized for a long time. From this it is 
very easy to come to the final conclusion that the 
speech environment in the years that precede 
the early school years is stamped upon the indi- 
vidual in a most permanent and lasting manner. 
The negative side of a proposition is not al- 
ways so interesting as the positive side. Early 
environment does indeed cause speech defects, 
but it can just as easily set the mould of speech 
in the line of perfection in all the excellences of 
utterance. The ideal kind of speech environment 
can impress itself just as indelibly upon the child 
in his earliest years as can the faulty speech en- 
vironment. It is not our present purpose to in- 
itiate any effort toward the establishment of a 
speech environment conducive to elegant Eng- 
lish upon entrance to the kindergarten, although 
this could very easily be done. Social workers, 
for example, could gather the children together in 
groups and give them speech instruction. Speech 
environment may be improved in numerous other 
ways. Night schools for the parents would elimi- 
nate speech defects and mistakes in grammar, and 
thus improve the environment of those still in 
tender years. Older school children bring their 
speech standards back from school and raise, 
gr
-P-A-G-E-102
  ‘SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
thereby, the general speech standard of the whole 
family. 
The sources of our kindergarten speech disor- 
ders are usually found to lie in the speech envi- 
ronment of the home. They may also be due to 
inherited mental deficiency. Sometimes they may 
be traced to some one in the child’s neighborhood 
outside the home. With this knowledge of the 
sources of early speech defects, we can approach 
the problem of their elimination with better un- 
derstanding. 
2. Importance of the period before speech begins 
The mother listens for anxious months for the 
first word spoken by her child. It is noted down 
with date and hour, and the whole family is called 
in to hear it repeated. Little think they of the 
amount of culture, education, and training that 
the little one must have passed through in order 
to perfect the first tiny utterance. There has 
been a long period of sensory registration of the 
sounds in the environment. All this time has 
been spent in listening, taking in sounds, recall- 
ing them, impressing them upon the memory by 
constant repetition, until finally, after a year and 
a half, the speech arc is completed and one single 
word drops out. 
92

-P-A-G-E-103
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
In this pre-talking period of sensory intake the 
standard vowel and consonant sounds should be 
heard and remembered, the proper use of the 
speech organs should be learned. In these early 
years, also, exact and correct combinations of 
vowels and consonants in words with their cus- 
tomary accent should be heard and learned by 
the listening child. We cannot too strongly em- 
phasize the great desirability that the child should 
hear only perfect English in these years. If we 
would have a correct and ideal utterance when 
speech begins we can obtain it only by the influ- 
ences and the environment of speech which we 
cast about the child in his listening years, 
Montessori mothers allow their children perfect 
freedom in the repetition of any speech mistakes 
they may hear, just as they allow them bad table 
manners and unwarranted freedom on the street. 
The idea is that they should not be thwarted but 
should be allowed to grow out of their slovenly 
ways. This whole idea is absolutely out of har- 
mony with acknowledged psychological principles 
of growth. It is just as easy to begin with cor- 
rect as with incorrect models. The child should 
be shown at the start the correct and customary 
utterance, act, or liberty, with the best technique 
possible in its accomplishment. The growing child

should never hear phonetic. defects, imperfect 
vowels and bad grammar or slang, consonants, 
stuttering, or any speech disorders whatsoever. 
If it does, utterance of the thing taken in is to 
be expected. If it hears only eet English, 
perfect grammar, its utterances reach those ideals 
of English pronunciation which otherwise take so 
long to instill. 
3. The earliest cranes then vce, fort, 
significance | 
The baby’s first word has numerous interest- 
ing phases. There is a whole psychology and an 
interesting anatomy hidden away behind that sim- 
ple utterance. The earliest word may be studied 
under three aspects: the source, the form of ut- 
terance, and the significance. : 
The source of the first word is usually found 
in some phrase, name, or single monosyllable fre- 
quently heard by the child. The name of the 
dog, of the father or mother, of another child, 
or some very frequently used phrase, like “Oh, 
my,” “Oh, dear,” sometimes even an oath, may 
be the first utterance of the infant. This oft- 
repeated word may be caught up from the other 
children. Rarely is it marked by a speech defect, 
and, if it is, it is one that is frequently repeated in 
94
-P-A-G-E-105
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
the family, has been drummed in for months and 
months, and by thousands of repetitions. First 
words are rarely if ever long ones, they are usu- 
ally monosyllables, they are usually names. Al- 
most always they are sound repetitions. 
Knowledge of the sources of early utterances 
helps in tracing speech disorders, and in the treat- 
ment of them. If the first incorrect utterance is 
due to a thousand repetitions of it in the child’s 
hearing, it might be curable by a thousand repeti- 
tions in his hearing of the correct pronunciation. 
I have heard it stated that children never use 
abstract terms, and rarely use adjectives. But 
forms of first words take no definite shape. Some 
think that they should be names, others that they 
should be words of motion, but this is not at all 
so. The form then is entirely immaterial. 
The choice of the first word is determined by 
what has been most commonly uttered in the 
presence of the child, be it noun, adjective, ab- 
stract word, or what not. It does not signify 
that we begin our thinking with nouns, or with 
words of motion. 
Significance in the utterances of the year-old 
or two-year-old child is minimal. It cannot lead 
us to any very profound psychological generaliza- 
tions. The child’s first word signifies that the 
95
-P-A-G-E-106
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
speech arc is’ completed, that a certain definite 
sound has been registered, that some simple col- 
laborative process has been carried on upon that 
registration, and that finally it has been exactly 
taken over and put out through the motor area 
with such exactness that it can be recognized and 
traced to an old environmental utterance long 
and often repeated. 
Observations on first words give us an inkling 
into the origin of speech. They let us see how 
long and frequently the first word had to be heard 
before it was put forth. Let the teacher of speech 
disorders take courage when she finds that she 
cannot correct an imitated lisp ina week. It took 
a year and a half to instill that lisp and, perhaps, 
following that, there have been two or three years 
of repetition. { 
4. Simple speech —how to amplify it 
Passing the early years of speech beginnings, 
we come to a consideration of somewhat more 
complicated utterances, those that we are likely 
to find in the kindergarten. Here the important 
thing is to amplify speech, to make it evolve, to 
encourage it, and to keep it to its proper standard. 
Simple speech includes mostly names, a few 
adjectives, few difficult connecting words, simple 
96
-P-A-G-E-107
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
sentences. All these have their origins in words 
picked up at home. The whole infantile vocabu- 
lary is nothing but an echo of the home vocabu- 
lary. 
Amplification of simple speech should take 
three directions : repetition, application, and addi- 
tion of new words. If these three methods are 
undertaken and carried forward, the speech al- 
ready attained is at once deepened and amplified. 
Repetition of old utterances. When the child 
hears his own words repeated by another person, 
he gains confidence because he sees that his utter- 
ances are understood and that he has made his 
point. Intimacy and confidence, friendship and 
mutual understanding, are insured between the 
child and the teacher by the teacher’s repetition 
of the child’s own words. I have seen a mother 
try always to give her child some new phrases in 
answer to its words, the result being confusion, 
coldness, and misunderstanding on the part of 
the little one. Never hearing its own words re- 
peated, it never felt that its own words had got 
across into the mind of another. 
Application of old words to new situations is 
another means of encouraging and amplifying 
speech. The child should be told, in the words 
he already knows, to do certain things. Obedi- 
97
-P-A-G-E-108
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN’ 
ence signifies that the meaning of the words has 
been understood. Application of the child’s vo- 
cabulary in this way deepens the impression of 
the words he is familiar with and makes them 
less easily forgotten. 
Addition of new words is our third method of 
simple speech amplification. New terms should 
be taught by illustrating their use. The child 
should be shown a given object repeatedly, be- 
fore any word is uttered. Then the name of the 
object should be given and repeated. Next the 
child should be told to use the object named in 
some definite manner. In this way the word is 
kept before the child’s mind for some time. Fi- 
nally, the child’s registration of the new word 
should be tested by asking him to name the ob- 
ject. If the previous steps have been properly 
taken, the name will be immediately forthcoming. 
In a word, then, the steps for acquisition of a 
new vocabulary should be sensory presentation 
of object, followed by repetition; secondly, name 
of the object, followed by repetition ; thirdly, use 
of the object, also repeated ; fourthly, request to 
produce the name of the object at sight. These 
simple steps may be seen to be the logical series 
through which learning processes pass. They 
have an anatomical basis, a physiological back- 
98
-P-A-G-E-109
KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
ground, anda psychological foundation, that make 
just these steps and in this series proper and 
necessary. 
Hints like these as to the beginnings of normal 
speech cannot but serve the teacher in dealing 
with speech disorders by thus giving her an in- 
sight into the nerve series, the physiology, and 
the psychology of early speech. When one sees 
that the normal learning of words takes so much 
time and so many repetitions, it becomes clear 
why the installation of a perfect utterance to re- 
place an imperfect one must needs require an 
equal amount of persistency and repetition. 
5. Delayed speech and its causes 
Study of early normal utterance offers many 
points of departure for attack upon speech dis- 
order in the kindergarten and the early grades. 
For that reason it has been treated somewhat at 
length, but it is time now to turn to our more 
immediate subject and to deal with some of the 
most common disorders found among children 
from two to five years of age. 
Delayed speech is one of the most frequent 
deviations from the evolution of normal talking. 
By “delayed speech” I do not refer to a defi- 
ciency caused by feeble-mindedness ; I assume a 
99 
LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
MIIRFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-110
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
normal brain background. Delay in speech is 
mostly due to environment. It is found in the 
silent home where the parents talk little to the 
baby and little to each other. It results where 
the baby is set down for many hours alone. It 
may also result from great speed of conversation, 
with little effort to utter individual words dis- 
tinctly, to use small words, or to name things to 
the baby. 
All this is quite natural. The same thing oc- 
curs with the eye. Where the stimuli are absent 
the function fails to evolve. Touch and discrimi- 
nations of touch are atrophied similarly through 
lack of use. Delayed speech is really undeveloped 
because unstimulated speech. 
Treatment of normal children who are backward 
in speech development consists in encouraging 
the child by going through the steps mentioned 
above in treating the development of simple speech, 
6. Early speech defects and what they lead to 
The defects observed in kindergarten are most 
frequently not quite the defects that appear later. 
Consonants are likely to be slightly off the stand- 
ard. Words are sometimes mispronounced. Syl- 
lables are omitted. Grammar is wrong. All these 
minor matters are less defects than imperfections. 
100
-P-A-G-E-111
Ree et yer a Cet re Ue mene ene so) gen  e Se ae 
KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
They show an effort at producing what has been 
heard, but the output is a little incomplete. 
Minor matters like these may be massed to- 
gether and treated by constant repetition of the 
correct forms. When, however, one comes upon 
such things as lisping and the absence of conso- 
nants, he should realize the presence of a real 
defect likely to lead to a permanent disorder. 
One’s chief reliance, during these early years, in 
correcting defects, should be more than anything 
else upon imitation in sound. The ear of the 
normal child is very acute. It quickly apprehends 
the difference between a correct utterance and 
its own faulty pronunciation ; it has the faculty 
of trying this and that sound until, by experi- 
ment, it hits upon the correct utterance. There- 
fore, one should begin with the faculty of imita- 
tion and resort to detailed instruction as to mouth 
positions only after it has failed. Any one can 
see that instructions about mouth position are 
uninteresting to little people. They should, there- 
fore, be used only as a last resort. 
It is easy to advise the use of the imitative 
faculty. What one should know about the method 
in teaching is more complicated than at first ap- 
pears. An analysis of imitation and its processes 
resolves the method into a systematic develop- 
10
-P-A-G-E-112
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
ment of hearing, a continuous drill of sound rep- 
etitions, and a building-up of brain cortical areas 
that differentiate between different sounds. So 
that in the pedagogical use of imitation we must 
have not only a way of developing sensory per- 
ception, but a method of developing the recollec- 
tion and interpretation of stimuli, together with 
more or less collaboration upon them. There 
must also be an attempt to correlate the external 
speech mechanism with all this new mental ac- 
quisition, This can be accomplished only by nu- 
merous guesses, miscalculations, and trials, until 
finally the heard, registered, and remembered sen- 
sation is uttered as heard. Many infantile speech 
disorders may be very quickly corrected if their 
treatment is made into a game and the child is 
rewarded for attaining the desired end. 
Exact position codrdination in the mouth may 
be resorted to if the above attempt fails. When 
this method is undertaken, the first sounds to be 
taught are those that are made in the front of 
the mouth, such as m, ~, and 6. Then take up 
those that are made a little farther back in the 
mouth: z, ¢, and d. S, Z, and y may naturally 
follow, or they may be preceded by zg, &, and g. 
Then the order matters little: sh, ch, z, zz. Some 
of these back sounds are difficult to teach. They 
102
-P-A-G-E-113
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
can be acquired easily by imitation. To teach the 
front sounds is sometimes quite easy, sometimes 
quite difficult. 
Stuttering in the early years is unusual. Some- 
times it may be eliminated by proper rest and 
hygiene ; more often it may be cured by change 
of mental environment for two or three months; 
sometimes it may be eradicated by creating a 
more genial atmosphere in the home so that the 
child’s mental processes are not interfered with. 
Aside from these attempts at individual treat- 
ment, the same visualization processes should be 
inaugurated in the kindergarten that were men- 
tioned above for older children. 
Delayed mentality may have an associated 
speech retardation. The speech of the idiot, the 
imbecile, or the moron makes their diagnosis by 
the expert a very easy matter. If of low grade 
and with marked speech defect, they are institu- 
tional cases and should be removed. If of the 
middle grade, with mild speech defect, they 
should be consigned to the special class where 
mental defectives are gladly received. If on the 
other hand they are slightly lacking in mentality, 
they may be retained, and final disposition made of 
them later in the grades, when their capacity for 
progress has been more definitely determined. 
103

7. Special methods in individual cases 
It is hard to give general rules that can be 
applied automatically to individual cases. The 
teacher’s information should be sufficiently wide 
and diverse to enable her to deal intelligently 
with individual cases as they arise. It will be well, 
however, to discuss here one or two special cases. 
Excessive haste in speech is simply one phase 
of great mental activity which overflows also in 
excessive bodily motions and in constant twitch- 
ings. This great speed of utterance requires spe- 
cial care. In this special type of speech defect, 
insistence on slow utterance, modulated expres- 
sion, and the production of exact sounds with a 
long breath, brings out the proper enunciations 
almost every time. This makes it clear that we 
are not dealing in this case with defective pronun- 
ciation, The whole fault lies in the excess of 
speed. Another approach to the cure of such 
cases is needed. Experience shows that the use 
of a series of slow, controlled, evenly executed, 
gymnastic movements results in almost immedi- 
ate improvement. These cases should be put 
through a system of calisthenics of this sort, be- 
ing made to practice for fifteen minutes three 
times a day, for two or three months. I have 
104
-P-A-G-E-115
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
seen cases that have been cured almost entirely 
by this simple procedure, with hardly a reference 
to the external speech mechanism and with no 
hint of imitation. 
Other puzzling cases are somewhat like the 
following one: A case of marked phonetic defect 
appeared. The defects were numerous. It was 
found that clear English was spoken in the fam- 
ily. The ear was suspected as the seat of the 
trouble. When the ear was examined —and I re- 
fer here to the mental ear, like the mind’s eye — 
several marked defects showed up. The child 
could not sing the scale or appreciate tones, har- 
monies, and melodies, and there was no ability to 
differentiate between two notes. 
This may illustrate some of the most puzzling 
cases that a teacher is called upon to undertake, 
and it may open the way to curative methods 
which should be applied primarily to the ear 
rather than to the talking apparatus at the other 
end of speech. 
The method of procedure in a case like this is 
to train the ear, first to sounds with large differ- 
ences, then to sounds with smaller and smaller 
differences. The varieties of sound here referred 
to should be varieties in pitch, intensity, vowel 
form, and consonant execution. Phonetic ear de- 
105
-P-A-G-E-116
  ‘SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
fects last a long while; one may ‘have to train 
a case of this sort for a year or two, but such 
training is the only method by which a proper 
nervous output can be attained. This long, tedi- 
ous drill is profitable, however, in other ways. It 
enables the patient to stand higher in spelling and 
writing and in school music than would be pos- 
sible under other circumstances. 
One might cite innumerable complicated cases, 
such as these. Every case differs from every 
other. Let what has been said suffice to show 
that numerous methods have to be resorted to 
in order to build up the background of perfect 
speech. 
8. Danger of leaving defects to be“ outgrown” 
Criticism is rife in these days. Many people 
are willing to criticize but few are willing to 
do actual work in eliminating speech disorders. 
Criticisms of speech instruction are numerous in 
their forms and their follies. From among them 
all, I have chosen one that will often come up in 
discussions of the school curriculum and which 
may frequently be offered even by the physician. . 
Many people say: ‘Leave the case alone and it * 
will outgrow its defect.” No treatment could be 
more foolish than this. No advice could be more 
106
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES 
ill-advised ; no suggestion could show more ig- 
norance of the problems of speech. Such advisers 
are ignorant of the harm they are doing and of 
the amount of mental drill of which they are 
depriving the pupil. Nor do they know at all 
whether or not these cases will ever “outgrow ” 
their defects. In brief, this advice is without 
foundation, without scientific backing, and should 
never be followed. It really means, “I don’t 
know,” and should always be so translated. 
Granted that a few defects are outgrown. They 
would have been overcome more quickly and 
would have acquired greater speech excellence 
under training than by leaving the matter to time. 
Moreover, no one knows whether a given defect, 
as seen in a child, will be outgrown or not. 
9. How to raise the speech standard in the 
classroom 
Individual methods of attack have been de- 
scribed in some detail, but there are still other 
ways in which the general level of speech excel- 
lence can be improved throughout a kindergarten 
class as well as in the elementary grades. I would 
advise that the class be put through a daily or 
perhaps twice daily series of vocal drills in unison. 
This trains the ear, improves the memory for 
107
-P-A-G-E-118
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
sound, and gives a little enunciation drill. It 
gives the class a sort of stability and unity, 
as music does, and sets a vocal standard that 
is apt to be imitated and followed by all the 
members. 
Programs for such exercises might be outlined 
somewhat as follows : 
Exercise 1. Ah, a, €, aw, 0, 00. Directions: Repeat 
this series of vowels one after the other in the order 
given, on three notes of the scale. 
Exercise 2. Ah, a, ¢, aw, 0, 00. Directions: Re- 
peat in series as above going up the scale and down 
on each vowel. 
Exercise 3. Ah, a, e, aw, 0, 00. Directions: Repeat 
each vowel with a modulation of intensity. That 
is, begin very lightly, increase the intensity to the 
maximum, and then gradually return to the original 
lightness and softness again. Do this on each vowel. 
Exercise 4. Repeat the words, “Papa, obey me” 
— “to dinner” — “cow going.” Directions: Re- 
peat the directions that are given under Exercise 1. 
This will give a drill on the nine consonants and also 
allow for the use of the vowels in the above series at 
the same time. 
Other exercises might be as follows, to include prac- 
tice on all the consonant sounds. Copious prepro- 
nunciation by the teacher is necessary. Also much 
individual drill. The grouping may be made ac- 
cording as each teacher may fancy.

  IO. Value of correct early standards 
The value of ideal standards to start with can 
hardly be over-estimated. They cannot be esti- 
mated at all by those who take the narrow view 
of speech defects. Their value is appreciated only 
by those who hold the tenet, “The boy is father 
to the man,” or, as Pope puts it, “As the twig is 
bent the tree ’s inclined.” 
109

  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
This matter has been mentioned repeatedly in 
these pages, because it deserves repetition. The 
special teacher of speech improvement can do 
nothing better than to implant proper standards 
early, to place the young mind in the correct 
paths and keep it there until it follows them 
habitually, never allowing any lax and slovenly 
relapse, 2 /a Montessori, with the hope that early 
faults are easily outgrown, 
v Correct early standards at once set the young 
mind in the right path. Their repetition and en- 
forcement keep it there until it chooses for itself 
what is ultimately and permanently right. 
Correct early standards relieve the teacher of 
much later patchwork. They instill a better dis- 
cipline in the class. They give an atmosphere to 
a schoolroom which a superintendent feels im- 
mediately on his arrival, which conquers and per- 
vades and guides the newcomer into the class, 
which visiting teachers admire, and which is a 
comfort and a relief to the teacher herself who 
has charge of the room.

SPEECH DISORDERS AMONG ABNORMAL 
CHILDREN AND HOW TO TREAT THEM 
In recent years we have discovered! the possi- 
bility of improving the speech of the mentally de- 
fective — the idiot, the imbecile, the moron, and 
the mental defective generally. These backward 
members of the school grades who are relegated 
to so-called “ special classes ” forinstruction suited 
to their peculiar needs, these deficient mentalities, 
have lately been approached phonetically and vo- 
cally by a new method of drill with surprisingly 
good results. One mental expert has said that 
these individuals should derive as much benefit 
from the right sort of vocal drill as they have 
from the industrial drill already so successfully in 
use. My own experience has convinced me that 
even more is possible. 
I. Speech forms among the feeble-minded 
Although the speech externalization of the 
feeble-minded is extremely various, it is possible 
1 This discovery was first published in an article as follows: 
By Walter B. Swift. “The Development of a Mental Defec- 
tive by Vocal Drill,” Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. 
CLXXII, no. 20, pp. 745, 746, November 11, 1915. 
Tir 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
to devise a rough classification sufficient for prac- 
tical purposes. Such a classification would divide 
speech forms among the feeble-minded into three 
classes: marked, medium, and mild. 
Marked feeble-mindedness shows itself in forms 
of speech very deficient for the age of the indi- 
vidual in whom they are found. One finds chil- 
dren, for example, and even adults, who can utter 
only a few words, or possibly none. In general, 
the speech may be described as monosyllabic and 
limited to a very few words. This is the speech 
condition of the idiot. 
Medium feeble-mindedness presents a speech 
condition somewhat more developed. Imbecile 
speech usually comprises a number of monosyl- 
labic words in addition to a good many short sen- 
tences. No very complicated mental conception 
is possible to the imbecile, however, and ac- 
cordingly the long and intricate sentence is not 
found. 
Mild feeble-mindedness is characterized by 
speech often scarcely distinguishable from that 
of normal individuals. Speech intake and speech 
output areas may be fairly well developed. The 
moron can repeat what he has heard and is some- 
times able to make a good impression in conver- 
sation. He fails, however, in the collaborative 
1i2

processes — complicated thinking, deep compre- 
hension, complex reasoning.

2. Speech in the mental defective 
By the term “ mental defective,” used in con- 
tradistinction to the three terms employed above, 
I here refer to the individual with special and 
minor defect. Where the sense of hearing is 
lacking, for example, or the ability to interpret 
sounds that are heard, the sensory defect may 
prevent proper utterance. A defect of the eye 
preventing correct registration of sight sensa- 
tions and the making of correct visual images 
may cause another form of speech disorder which 
externalizes itself in interrupted or pumped con- 
versation. Again, a moral defect may cause the 
speech to be harsh, rasping, and hasty. 
3. The basis of abnormal speech 
No doubt there is always a pathological back- 
ground for defects of speech, but the study of 
these is of little value for the teacher. Pathology 
of the brain can be studied only in the dead sub- 
ject. After one knows the dead case well, he 
cannot be certain that another subject, still liv- 
ing, is exactly like it. Accordingly, he cannot 
113
-P-A-G-E-124
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
proceed from exact pathological findings to exact 
educational methods. In education, however, we 
deal with the living individual and can instill and 
develop absent functions. If we knew much more 
than we do about the brain pathology causing de- 
fective speech, that knowledge would be of little 
practical service, except, perhaps, that it might 
cause us to proceed more energetically with our 
educational processes, forcing the development 
of functions in localized brain areas whose pres- 
ence we might suspect. 
That the study of function alone is often suf- 
ficient may be illustrated by a certain investiga- 
tion which I once made in a Berlin laboratory, I 
was engaged in studying a dog that could not 
differentiate between two tones. On the basis of 
this lack of function I maintained that the fibers 
and cells which should have performed that func- 
tion had been extirpated. My critics objected 
that this assertion could be proved only by au- 
topsy. The professor under whom I was work- 
ing answered that the functional absence was 
sufficient proof upon which to base the assertion 
of pathological absence. Just so, functional ab- 
sence in abnormal speech is a sufficient basis upon 
which to build a system of phonetic training.

4. Normal phonetics not suited to treatment of 
abnormal minds 
In the early days, all abnormal mentalities 
were treated in the regular grades of the schools, 
it being thought that they would improve under 
the same kind of instruction that was given to 
normal children. The result was a retardation of 
the classes in which they were found —a retar- 
dation that increased as they passed farther along 
in the grades until it became intolerable and the 
school authorities concluded that the methods of 
education for normal and for abnormal children 
would have to be differentiated. From this con- 
clusion sprang the special classes. Their persist- 
ence and existence to-day show the correctness 
of that conclusion. 
The original situation exists to-day, however, 
in the meager approaches to the speech disorder 
problem attempted by vocal teachers in the pub- 
lic schools. They began by the imposition upon 
abnormal minds of a phonetic treatment adapted 
only to normal minds. Their lesson has not yet 
been learned. The lesson is that ordinary pho- 
netics is no more applicable to abnormal minds 
than our ordinary school curriculum is applicable 
to abnormal minds. 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
The regular grade work, suited to the normal 
child, has been replaced by industrial drill for the 
abnormal child. Why, then, should we expect 
that phonetics intended for normal children will 
serve just as well for the abnormal? The differ- 
ence between phonetics for the normal and pho- 
netics for the abnormal should be as great as that 
between the ordinary grade school curriculum 
and industrial drill. 
Understanding of this matter explains many 
apparent failures in the vocal training of abnor- 
mal children. I have repeatedly heard teachers 
say: “I teach the boy to pronounce a sound 
correctly, and then the next day he has forgotten 
all about it. I have done this over and over, and 
have come to the conclusion that it is impossible 
to teach him proper pronunciation.” The diffi- 
culty is that the wrong sort of drill has been 
applied. 
5. Mental background assumed in normal 
phonetics 
For the sake of contrast, it will be well to say 
a word about the psychological background of 
speech in normal minds, Normal speech sub- 
sumes a series of normal nerve functions. The 
sensory intake areas of the brain —those of eye, 
116
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  ABNORMAL CHILDREN 
ear, mouth, feeling — are all intact. Above these 
are adequately developed sensory word combina- 
tions, psychic seeing, position sense, and inter- 
pretation areas. Still higher, there are normal 
collaborative processes, such as imagination, mem 
ory, reason, visual recall. On the motor side are 
the higher motor control areas, which by certain 
delicate motor processes control the lower motor 
output areas and result externally in speech. 
This is the whole round of the speech mechan- 
ism. The functions of all these areas compose 
the mental background that we assume in normal 
phonetics. 
6. Actual mental backgrounds in abnormal minds 
The contrasts here are extreme. Abnormal 
minds present lack of function in any or all of 
the different parts of the speech mechanism just 
mentioned. For example, there may be faulty, 
or even absent, sensory intake in the lowest type 
of idiocy. In imbecility there may be fairly good 
intake, with no functional interpretation. In the 
moron, there may be deficient collaborative proc- 
esses — reasoning, comprehension, imagination. 
The motor output side may correspondingly lack 
because the sensory side cannot furnish enough 
stimuli for its growth. These functional defi 
117
-P-A-G-E-128
  SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
ciencies may depend upon pathological deficiency 
or absence of fibers and cells of the cortex. This, 
however, is not the present question. 
Phonetics for the abnormal, following the ex- 
ample of industrial drill, should begin with those 
functions which the abnormal mind actually pos- 
sesses. There should be a means of ascertaining 
just what these functional activities are and just 
what the vocal capabilities of the individual under 
treatment actually are, no matter how simple 
these may be. 
After the mental level has been discovered, 
the procedure should not be rapid or difficult. I 
begin my own cases by drilling them a long time 
upon those things which they can already do, be- 
fore passing to the development of functions 
which examination has shown to be absent. We 
have to build upon what a man can do, no matter 
how little that is, until the function in question 
enlarges of itself its own scope of activity — shows 
in its speed and variety of action that it has taken 
on new powers and new capabilities. Then, and 
not till then, should the training be carried far- 
ther. The whole procedure should be carried on 
in this way, step by step.

7. Physiological basis for the treatmént of 
mental defectives 
Nature never presses little children beyond 
their capabilities. In their first years, they reach 
for and touch things and take in gross sensations. 
Later, they interpret this mass of sensory intake 
and build up an understanding of life’s processes. 
In still later years comes the development of 
collaborative processes. 
Early in this infantile evolution, and corre- 
sponding to it, speech usually puts out on the 
plane at which the child has arrived those vocal 
expressions which indicate that plane. This vocal 
expression makes a pretty exact externalization 
of the mental evolution which has just preceded. 
Processes like these furnish the model for pro- 
cedure in methods of educational development. 
The normal speech of children, developing along 
certain definite lines from the simple to the more 
complex, gives a hint of method that should be 
accepted as guide in the successive steps under- 
taken by the teacher in the slow processes of 
speech development in the mentally feeble. 
It should be clear, then, that we must start 
with the physiological basis which we find pres- 
ent; that we should emphasize, amplify, and en- 
119
-P-A-G-E-130
SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
large this ; that, as the growth or power advances, 
we should take the hint and develop those func- 
tions that naturally show up to the maximum of 
efficiency, until the entire speech mechanism 
begins to function perfectly. As contrasted with 
the application of normal phonetics, this is a slow 
process. It has to build up the necessary parts of 
the speech mechanism before it tries to make that 
mechanism work correctly. 
8. A system of phonetic drill for abnormal 
children 
Before the drill is begun, the vocal history of 
each of the pupils must be completed. Then there 
should be a vocal examination to determine what 
sounds and words the pupil is capable of uttering 
and to discover the general and particular defects 
of speech to which he is subject. 
Lesson 1. Repeat before the pupil the words and 
sentences which he is himself able to pronounce 
most readily and correctly. This should be done 
three times a day for a week or more, during periods 
of fifteen minutes. 
Lesson 2. During Exercise 1, note whether any 
new mental capacities are brought to light. If so, 
concentrate upon these, one by one, developing each 
as far as possible. This may require six months, or 
more. 
120  
-P-A-G-E-131
  
ABNORMAL CHILDREN 
Lesson 3. After it seems certain that all the func- 
tions have appeared and have been developed as 
far as possible, then assign a series of vowels, such 
as ah, a, ee, au, 0, 00. Have the pupils repeat these 
by ones, then by twos, then by threes, and finally 
all together. Continue until all the vowels are cor- 
rectly pronounced in series. 
Lesson 4. Add to the above vowels the conso- 
nants which the pupils can already pronounce. Have 
these repeated several times a day for three weeks. 
Lesson 5. Try to teach the pronunciation of a new 
consonant or two, and have these added to the vowel 
series. 
Lesson 6. Passing from the known to the unknown, 
as above, devise similar exercises with small words, 
then with long words, and finally with short and long 
sentences, 
9. Remarkable progress of some cases 
It may assist and encourage the teacher to 
enumerate a few actual cases which have come 
under the author’s observation during his use of 
a method of drill similar to that just outlined. 
These cases will illustrate the method and, at the 
same time, show its efficacy. A few will suffice. 
I shall present one from each of the three large 
classes already mentioned above, — idiot, imbe- 
cile, and moron, — with one or two from the class 
of special mental defect.

It should be said that occasionally one has to 
acknowledge defeat in this field. Sometimes one 
sees but little progress as the reward for hard 
labor. Surprising improvement and permanent 
personality changes are the rule, however, in 
most cases. 
The degree and kind of improvement in speech 
and mentality which may be expected to result 
from treatment is shown in the following short 
outlines of typical cases : — 
Case 1. Diagnosis: Marked mental backward- 
ness. Before treatment, this boy sat alone at 
home, doing nothing. His speech consisted of a 
few grunts and the words “Mama” and “ Papa.” 
In the garden he never used the paths, but walked __ 
indiscriminately upon flower beds and plants. Dis- 
tance from the city prevented ‘completion of 
drill, but the boy’s speech is now much clearer 
and he has several monosyllabic words. He is 
now careful to use the paths in the garden, he 
follows his father about the house and imitates 
him at work, and he has several other minor in- 
terests. 
Case 2. Diagnosis: Imbecile. The most pain- 
ful feature of this child’s case before treatment 
was begun was the fact that she was constantly 
in motion, incessantly turning and twisting. Fur- 
122  
-P-A-G-E-133
  ABNORMAL CHILDREN 
thermore, she was very destructive. Hence her 
mother was ashamed to take her out of the house. 
She seemed observing, but she had an extremely 
small vocabulary. This case was given treatment 
for over a year. The girl now uses many words 
and is able to put them together into very simple 
sentences. Her behavior is now quiet and well 
controlled. Those who know her say that she has 
undergone a wonderful change in matters of ob- 
servation, understanding, mimicry, and expression. 
Case 3. Diagnosis: Moron. Before treatment, 
this boy spent all his time at home, having no in- 
terest in sports or in other boyish activities. He 
had no friends. He was treated with the special 
vocal drill, in a more elaborate form than that 
presented above, and in about four months showed 
marked mental improvement, and improvement 
which his mother characterizes as ‘‘a tremendous 
change.” He now has numerous friends, he plays 
baseball and football, and he attends the “movies ” 
and social functions. 
Case 4. Diagnosis: Special mental defect. 1 
have described this case fully in a recent article.

SPEECH DEFECTS IN CHILDREN 
It may be summarized thus: A case of defective 
mentality was subjected to intensive vocal drill 
for eight months, with the result of remarkable 
and unexpected mental development, showing in 
new initiative, wider interests, extended observa- 
tion, and minor manifestations. 
Case 5. Diagnosis: Backwardness in school. 
This boy showed little interest or progress at 
school. He had, indeed, few interests of any sort 
outside of his home. His speech was indistinct, 
monotonous, lacking in flexibility, but he did not 
stutter. He was given about six months of vocal 
drill, with the result that his speech is now clear 
and flexible and correct. Heis interested in school 
work and is making what is called “wonderful” 
progress. He is an apt story-teller and plays much 
with other children. Almost all signs of mental 
backwardness have been eliminated. 
All I can hope to do in these bare outlines is 
to focus attention upon the fact of mental devel- 
opment under vocal drill. I hope to present these 
and other cases in greater detail in a later vol- 
ume, At present, I am not seeking to gain for 
this new method the credit it deserves. I shall 
be content if what I have said leads others to try 
out the method for themselves. Seeing is believ-

ing, and it is only fair to say that some of the 
results which have been attained can be believed 
only by those who have seen them. Critics of the 
method, therefore, should not content themselves 
with hearsay or with even such a report upon the 
work as has been here given. They, too, should 
see the work and the results with their own eyes 
before they speak in praise or blame.

PREFACE 
  Acricutture, as a public school subject, has been rapidly growing in favor during the past few years. 
The results of this teaching have been so satisfactory that it is no longer necessary to set forth the value of 
this subject as a branch of education for the children of our schools, It is conceded by many progressive 
people that the addition of Agriculture to the public school curriculum has done more to arouse a real interest 
in school work than any other branch that has been added in years. The study of this subject produces a 
closer relationship between the home and the school, gives a new significance to farming and farm: life, and 
emphasizes the importance of knowing wy in order that we may know /ow to farm. Farm life is held up 
before the young student as a happy and useful life, and the farm is given its proper consideration. 
Practical Lessons in Agriculture is both a textbook and a laboratory manual. Most of the lessons are 
laboratory or field exercises, and they are arranged, as far as possible, in seasonal sequence. The book is 
adapted for use in the seventh to the tenth grades. 
The authors feel that if a pupil, by the use of this book, is enabled to obtain a clearer understanding of 
how the farm may be used as a laboratory in which he may apply the knowledge gained at school, a great 
step will have been made towards bringing the school into closer touch with the home life of the student in 
the rural community. 
In the preparation of this book many sources of information have been consulted and the authors hereby 
express their indebtedness to all whose writings have been of assistance. For careful reading and criticism of 
the manuscript the authors acknowledge their obligation to B. M. Davis, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio ; 
W. F. Copeland, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio; and E. C. Sell, State Normal School, Athens, Georgia. 
They are also indebted to the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Experiment Station, Wooster, Ohio, Inter- 
national Harvester Company, and others for photographs furnished.

    TO THE TEACHER 
Acricuttvre cannot be taught successfully by the use of the textbook alone. Many observations and prac- 
tical demonstrations are necessary to a full understanding of the subject. The student should be encouraged 
to use hig eyes as much as possible and to record his observations. He should write his notes with pencil in 
the blank spaces. In recording notes, conciseness, clearness, and legibility should be insisted upon by the 
teacher. Each lesson should be made an exercise in language as well as in agriculture. 
It is neither advisable nor possible to give detailed directions for conducting laboratory and field exercises. 
One general rule, however, may be given: do not take up a lesson unless the material to be studied is at 
hand. If beef cattle are to be studied, select the very best examples for observation. If crops are to be 
studied, visit fields in which they are growing. If farm buildings are to be considered, select the best ex- 
amples to be found in the vicinity. In order to get the best results the teacher should prepare the work in 
advance, and be entirely familiar with the demands of each lesson. A great deal of material used in the 
lessons may be collected from time to time and kept in the school for future use. 
A school museum containing typical soils, samples of fertilizers, mounted insects, seeds, and photographs 
of farm animals will be of great benefit. The school library should have a number of good reference books 
on Agriculture, together with many government publications which may be obtained free or at little cost. 
The Farmers’ Bulletins are of especial value and should be in every rural school.

LESSON 1 
SOURCES OF FOOD 
In the early history of man his food consisted of such plant products as he could easily 
pluck from trees and vines and of such animals as he could kill. 
The cultivation of plants and the domestication of animals were the first great steps 
toward a regular food supply. 
From a small, probably accidental, beginning in plant growing, man has developed the art 
of agriculture until now the vegetable kingdom furnishes him with an abundant variety of 
palatable foods. He still depends upon some plants in their wild state, but the larger part 
of his nourishment comes from such cultivated crops as wheat, corn, oats, and garden 
vegetables. With an increased intelligence, he is able to gather several crops from the same 
area and to get a maximum of return for his expended labor. Fromthe uncertainties of the chase 
he has turned to the domestication of food animals and now raises the meats that he con- 
sumes at his table. Still further has he improved his food supply by selection and cross- 
breeding in both plants and animals, thus producing the highest grades of cereals, fruits, 
vegetables, and meats. 
Under the headings below list the sources of human food. Place a line under the name 
of each produced in the United States. Place two lines under the name of each produced in 
your locality.

LESSON 2 
THE SOURCES OF CLOTHING 
The earliest clothing that man wore was probably made of leaves and the bark of trees, 
and was worn as a protection from the weather. The skins of animals were next used to 
cover the body. At first these skins were simply thrown over the shoulders and tied around 
the waist with some vine or thong. Later man learned to fasten skins together with a thread- 
like fiber and thus began to fashion garments to wear. 
When man learned to spin wool into threads and to make cloth, the sheep industry 
started. At first the making of woolen goods was very crude, but as time went on, man’s 
natural ingenuity overcame many of the difficulties of weaving, until to-day he manufactures 
garments of great beauty and fine texture. Other animals, such as the camel, the alpaca, and 
the goat, were found to furnish hair suitable for the making of cloth. Later it was discovered 
that a product of the silkworm could be used, and the making of silk goods was rapidly under- 
taken: 
Early in his history man discovered that certain plants furnished fibers that could be 
woven into cloth; and the weaving of the soft fibers of cotton, flax, hemp, jute, and other 
fiber plants became an important industry. 
Under the headings below list the sources of clothing. Place a line under the name of 
each produced in the United States. Place two lines under the name of each produced in 
your locality.

  THE SOURCES OF SHELTER 
The earliest forms of shelter that man used to protect him from the changes of weather 
were the widespreading trees and the large shrubs, about which he crouched when it rained 
and in whose shade he slept when the sun was hottest. In the branches of the tallest trees 
he found protection from the wild animals that attacked him. After some time he learned 
to make shelters of branches by grouping them together and covering them with leaves and 
grass. Next he wove the branches together and filled the vacant spaces with mud, build- 
ing a sort of hut. As he learned to trap animals, he began to use skins to cover his abode, 
finally finding a way of fastening the skins together into a sort of tent. In different parts of 
the world caves have been found that were once the homes of men. In China to-day there 
live many people whose only homes are caves they have made in the loess deposits of their 
country. 
As time went on, man became tired of his cave or temporary brush tent and tried to 
build some suitable shelter that would be permanent. The first homes of this nature were 
built of stones piled into rude walls with some sort of covering for a roof. 
When man learned to make metal tools*he improved the quality of his shelter, and as he 
advanced toward the use of steel his building became more complicated and complete. 
Stones that were once used in their natural roughness were cut and shaped to meet his de- 
mands, rough roof covering gave place to boards, which in turn were replaced by shingles 
and slate. Soon bricks and plaster entered into the structure of his abode, and with the 
discovery of glassmaking rude huts had passed and the modern home had become a reality. 
Under the headings below list the sources of shelter. Place a line under each that is 
produced in the United States. Place two lines under each produced in your locality.

LESSON 4 
THE INSECT 
An insect is an air-breathing animal having three 
parts or divisions to its body, six legs, and usually one 
or two pairs of wings when fully developed. The life 
history of most insects consists of four distinct periods 
which are easily traced. First comes the egg which 
hatches into a worm-like animal called the larva. 
Most larve are green, as this color forms a better pro- 
tection against their enemies. It is during this stage 
of the insect’s growth that it does most damage to 
the crops. Growth is rapid during the larval stage, 
and so the young animal is a voracious feeder. 
When the period of growth is ended the larva 
seeks some retired place and spins about itself a cocoon. 
This cocoon is often made from a kind of silken thread 
that comes from the body of the insect. Some insects 
build their cocoons by sewing together the edges of a 
leaf, while others build them of dirt and small sticks. 
Within this inclosure the insect passes its pupal stage. 
Here a complete change takes place. It enters the 
cocoon as an elongated, flexible animal, worm-like in shape, and emerges a hardened insect 
fully developed. This last is called the adult or imago state. 
The body of a full-grown insect is divided into three parts, — the head, thorax, and ab- 
domen. On the head are two large prominent compound eyes and from one to four smaller 
ones placed between these, two long tapering rods called antenne, and a very complicated 
set of jaws. The head as a whole is generally long and flat at the front and is attached to the 
thorax by a very short neck. The kind of food an 
insect eats may be told by the structure of its 
mouth parts. 
There are two kinds of mouth structure, — the 
biting, as seen in the grasshopper, and the sucking, 
as seen in the butterfly. Animals of the biting 
type of mouth may be poisoned through their 
food; the sucking type cannot be killed in this 
way. 
The mouth of biting insects consists of six dis- 3 
tinct parts. The upper jaws are called mandibles. Parts oF AN INSECT. 
They work horizontally, and from their shape it may 
be told whether the insect feeds upon vegetable or animal food. Covering these mandibles is 
the upper lip or labrum, which is a part of the front of the head, and seems to have no part 
in feeding. Below the mandibles there is a second pair of jaws, called maxillz, which are 
quite complicated in structure and vary quite a good deal in form. The palpi or feelers, 
the short antenna-like growths about the mouth, are attached to the maxilla. The man- 
  Lire History or an INSECT. 
   
-P-A-G-E-11
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 5 
dibles cut or tear the food, while the maxillz are used to break it up into smaller pieces. 
Below these parts is the lower lip or labium. This lower lip is not as complicated as the 
maxilla, sometimes being formed of one flat plate. 
The mouth parts of the sucking insects are also quite complicated, consisting’ of a long 
tube through which the liquid food is taken, and a series of piercing or probing jaws for cutting 
into the object attacked. 
The eyes of an insect are especially interesting. They are of two kinds, the large com- 
pound eyes formed upon the sides of the head and the small rudimentary eyes between the 
large eyes. These small eyes are called ocelli and are placed in a triangular 
form with the apex down. The compound eyes are made up of a number of 
small eyes grouped together. The compound eye looks much like the comb 
used in honey making, each little hexagonal segment being a complete eye in 
itself. As an insect cannot move its eyes and can only move its head very 
slightly, it is necessary that there should be many eyes with a varying range 
  of vision. Eyes oF AN Insect. 
The thorax of an insect consists of three parts, sometimes so closely % compound eyes; oe cee ae ~~” 8, clypens; grown together that it is hard to distinguish them. These divisions, begin- ¢ ocelli; 
ning at the front, are called prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. Each of 4 ane 
these divisions bears a pair of legs, and in winged insects the last two seg- Perens 
ments bear wings. 
The abdomen of the insect consists of nine distinct segments and a terminating cap or 
pincer-like organ. Each segment has two openings, one on either side, through which the 
animal breathes. These openings are called spiracles. The blood of the insect needs oxygen, 
and as it has no lungs, the air has to enter the body through these little openings. 
The female insect produces her young by laying eggs. These are deposited in many 
places. Some insects lay their eggs upon the water, others in the ground, and many deposit 
them in the bark or wood of trees, and in the tissues of other plants. The complete develop- 
ment of an insect from the egg stage until it reaches full maturity is called its life history.

LESSON 5 
THE CABBAGE WORM 
  Larva Pupa Adult 
Tue CABBAGE BUTTERFLY. 
The cabbage worm is one of our most destructive garden pests. This so-called worm is 
the larva of a small, almost white butterfly that may be seen fluttering above cabbage plants. 
The first cabbage butterflies are the adults that have hibernated through the winter in the 
pupa or chrysalis stage on trees and under stones and boards. Soon after emerging these 
butterflies lay small eggs on the young cabbage plants. These eggs develop into caterpillars 
that later pass into the pupa stage, and in a few days the pupz change to mature butterflies 
that produce another generation of caterpillars during the same summer. 
The caterpillars are velvety green in color, almost like the cabbage leaf, and are often 
overlooked as they lie closely on the plant. As the season advances, these little insects be- 
come more abundant and very ravenous. It is during the larva growth that most of the dam- 
age is done to the plant. The larva or caterpillar eats irregular holes in the cabbage leaf and 
sometimes into the head of the plant itself, leaving dirty yellow excrements wherever it has 
been at work. 
The adult of this insect is a butterfly, rather small, with white or faint sulphur-colored 
wings expanding about an inch and a half. The adult male has one dark spot on each of the 
fore wings, while the adult female has two such spots on each fore wing. The under sides of 
the wings are usually darker and rather powdery. 
Birds are a great aid in ridding a garden of these pests and should be encouraged to make 
their homes near us. But even birds will not remove these larve entirely and so it is,custom- 
ary to spray the cabbage plants with some arsenical poison, as Paris green. After the 
cabbage plant has headed and the caterpillars have entered the head, it is almost impossible 
to destroy them. 
FIELD WORK 
After the cabbages have formed, collect eggs of the cabbage worm.

LESSON 6 
THE GRASSHOPPER 
Grasshoppers, more properly called 
locusts, are found almost everywhere in 
the United States. They are usually very 
abundant in meadows and along the zoad- 
sides. There are many species of locusts, 
but the most destructive one is the Rocky 
Mountain locust, a near relative of the 
insect mentioned in the Bible as furnish- 
ing one of the plagues of Egypt. Al- 
Rocky Movunrarn Locust. though the ravages of this insect have 
been confined to a limited territory, its 
devastation has been so great that it has attracted much attention. 
The female locust drills a hole in the ground with two pairs of horny valves at the end of 
the abdomen and deposits her eggs in the hard soil. The eggs are laid in regular rows and 
covered with a mucous fluid which dries around the eggs and fills up the neck of the burrow. 
Each female lays about ninety eggs in three lots of about thirty each. They are laid through- 
out the summer and early fall, and most of the eggs remain unhatched until the next spring. 
In the larva and pupa stages, the young locust resembles the adult in structure, the dif- 
ference being only in size. The time required for full growth varies with the season and weather, 
being on an average about two months. The life of a grasshopper extends from the spring 
to the autumn frosts, and there is but one generation each year. The young congregate in 
large numbers in warm, sunny places, subsisting upon the green vegetation about their hatch- 
ing places. Migration never takes place until all surrounding vegetation has been eaten off; 
this usually happens by the time they are half grown. They travel in vast bodies in the warm 
part of the day by alternately walking and hopping. 
Grasshoppers are not always destructive to our crops, but where they are, their eradica- 
tion may be accomplished in several ways. Harrowing in the autumn or during a dry spell 
will destroy the eggs. Plowing, if not too deep, will accomplish the same purpose. The 
object is to thoroughly scarify and pulverize the top soil where the eggs have been laid. Crude 
coal oil may be placed in specially prepared pans which are dragged over the infested ground. 
The startled locusts spring up into the pans and expire almost immediately after they reach 
the oil. Burning is the best method to be used in prairie sections where the locusts abound. 
Old straw or hay is piled in heaps about the field, and the locusts are driven into the piles, which 
are then set on fire. When the locusts are making their way from roads to hedges they may 
easily be caught in nets of muslin or calico. The nets are stretched along the path of the 
insects and are made to converge where a small pit has been dug. Into this pit the locusts 
are driven and then destroyed.

LESSON 7 
DISSEMINATION OF SEEDS 
Pupils should bring to school an apple, fruit of milkweed, dandelion, cocklebur, beggar- 
tick, burdock, bean, witch-hazel, pansy, walnut, and hazelnut. 
(a) Seeds that are contained within edible fruits. . 
Cut an apple in halves, cutting at right angles to the stem. Locate the seeds with 
reference to the pulp. What use do animals make of this class of fruit ? 
Are the seeds eaten? 
How may seeds from the apple core become covered with earth? 
How are seeds of blackberries and raspberries disseminated ? 
(b) Seeds blown by the wind. 
Secure the fruit of the milkweed, thistle, dandelion, maple, or elm. 
Drop them from some height. 
Did they reach the earth directly under the place from where they were liberated ? 
Why are farmers who practice clean cultivation often troubled with weeds? 
(c) Seeds that adhere to animals. 
Examine by means of a lens the method by which the fruits of the spanish needle, 
cocklebur, beggar-tick, and burdock adhere to animals. 
Place a few of these fruits in the hair of some domestic animal at your own home. 
How long are they carried ? 
(d) Seeds that are thrown out by the rupturing of the enclosing case. 
. Place pods of the bean or witch-hazel where they willdry. Later on handle these 
pods roughly and record what happens. 
(e) Seeds that float.

SEED MOISTURE 
Select several seeds of various plants for study, such as the lima bean, pea, castor bean, 
and pumpkin. Have the seeds of each kind as nearly alike in color, size, and shape as pos- 
sible. Place the seeds in a dish of water and study carefully. 
What effect does the water have upon the coat of each seed ? 
Where does the wrinkling commence ? 
Draw pictures of a dry seed and one that has been soaked in water. 
Does the water enter the coat at all places? 
Locate the places. where the water enters the coat. 
Submerge several seeds in a beaker of water and heat slowly. Observe closely for air 
bubbles coming from the seeds. Note carefully the openings in the coat of each seed through 
which these air bubbles come. May not these openings admit water to the seed when it is 
in the ground ? 
Place several seeds in a test tube and close the end with cotton. Slowly heat the seeds 
over a flame.

OSMOSIS 
Select a large egg that will just fit the end of a large-mouthed 
bottle without entering it. Remove the shell from the large end of 
the egg without breaking the inside skin. Make a small hole in the 
opposite end of the egg and empty its contents. Rinse the interior 
of the egg thoroughly with clear water. 
Fill the bottle full of colored water (red ink may be used to 
color the water). Fill the empty egg with clear water and place the 
large end in the mouth of the bottle. 
Observe carefully what takes place. 
Empty the egg, rinse out again, and fasten a small tube of 
glass into the small opened end. The tube miay be held in place by 
carefully cementing it to the egg with sealing wax. Fill the egg 
and tube with a strong solution of sugar and water. Place the egg 
again in the mouth of the bottle after it has been filled with pure 
water. Fasten a piece of rubber cloth across the top of the tube. Osmosis APPARATUS. 
After several days note the position of the sheet of rubber. 
The process of a liquid passing through a membrane is called osmosis. The colored 
liquid in the bottle passed through the membrane of the egg into the water contained inside 
the egg. The sugar solution in the tube has a strong affinity for the water in the bottle and 
causes it to pass through the egg membrane and enter the tube. The entrance of the water 
causes the sheet of rubber to become tightly stretched. 
When seeds swell and burst their coats much the same process takes place. The sugars 
and proteins within the seeds have an affinity for water and cause the moisture in the soil 
surrounding the seeds to pass through the outer coating, thus making the interior of the seed 
swell to the bursting point.

GERMINATION OF SEEDS —TEMPERATURE 
In each of three plate germinators put ten seeds of each of the following plants: corn, 
wheat, oats, clover, bean, pumpkin, and tomato. Place one germinator in a warm room in 
which the temperature is 70 to 80 degrees, one in a cool room in which the temperature is 50 
to 60 degrees, and the other in a refrigerator in which the temperature is 40 degrees or less. 
Take the temperature of each place several times to get the average temperature of each.

GERMINATION OF SEEDS—AIR 
Select five bottles of equal size having tight-fitting corks. Fill these bottles to varying 
depths (the first, one sixth full; the second, one third full; etc.) of moist sand. To keep air 
out of the sand, first fill the bottles with water and then pour the sand in gradually. When 
the sand has settled to the bottom, the water may be carefully poured off. Place four well- 
soaked bean seeds in each bottle, put in the corks, and seal thoroughly with sealing wax to keep 
out all air. Note which seeds germinate most perfectly. 
After several days, carefully take out the cork of the bottle about half filled with sand 
and insert a lighted match. If the match goes out, there is little or no oxygen left in the 
bottle. 
What has become of the oxygen in the bottle ? 
Compare the germinated seeds in the bottles. Which bottle contained the best germi- 
nated seed? Why? 
Take a very wide-mouthed preserve jar (one large enough for you to place a small medi- 
cine glass within it). Fill this glass with limewater and place in the center of the jar. Around 
this glass place some well-soaked bean seeds. Tightly cork the jar. Keep the jar under 
conditions suitable for germination. Note any change in the limewater. If the seeds give 
off carbon dioxide, the limewater becomes clouded. The oxygen of the air unites with the 
carbon of the plant and makes carbon dioxide, which turns limewater a milky white. * 
Write a short account of the results of your experiment. 
Fill a bottle nearly full of sand, keeping the air out by means of water. Drain off all stand- 
ing water. Place a few bean seeds, after soaking them, on the surface of the sand. Cork and 
seal the bottle. These seeds will have some air, but it will be in a very small quantity. Note 
how slowly the seeds germinate, if they germinate at all. 
What do these seeds lack to produce germination ?

VITALITY AND PRESERVATION OF SEEDS 
One method of testing seeds for vitality is to place them in a pan of water and to use only 
those that sink, rejecting all seeds that float. Select several seeds (the older the better) and

FOOD SUBSTANCES IN SEEDS 
The principal food substances in plants are (a) protein, (b) fats and oils, and (c) starches 
and sugars. 
For experimental purposes select several good-sized butter beans (any other seeds will 
do as well providing they are large). With a sharp knife cut the seeds into two parts along 
their greatest diameters. : 
Preliminary Tests. 
Place a drop of nitric acid upon the white of an egg. The yellow stain is a character- 
istic test for protein. 
Place a few drops of iodine solution upon a small quantity of thin starch paste. The 
dark blue or blackish color is the characteristic test for starch. 
Test for Protein in Seeds. 
Upon one of the seed halves place a drop or two of nitric acid. Compare with egg test, 
and record the results briefly. 
Test for Starch and Sugar in the Seeds. 
Place several drops of the iodine solution on one of the fresh seed halves. Note the 
result and compare with the starch test. Record briefly the results of your experiment. The 
presence of sugar may sometimes be detected by the taste. 
Test for Fats and Oils in Seeds.

PARTS OF A SEED 
  Bean. Select for study a well-soaked bean. Look for a scar (hilum), which is the point 
where the seed was attached to the pod. With a sharp knife cut through the seed coat along 
the convex, or round, side and separate the seed into its two halves. All of the bean within 
the covering is the young plant or embryo. The two halves are seed leaves or cotyledons. 
These cotyledons are made up of starch and other food substances for the young plant. Notice 
on the inner side of one of the cotyledons a little stem or sprout and a small bud of two tiny 
leaves. Notice also where the cotyledons are attached to the stem. The small bud is the 
plumule, and the stem from the tip to the point where the cotyledons are attached is the 
hypocotyl. The tip develops into the root while the other part of the hypocotyl grows into a 
stem and is the part that comes first above the ground. After the hypocotyl has arched up 
through the soil, it pulls the cotyledons and plumule after it and then becomes erect. The 
cotyledons, after giving the stored-up food to the growing parts of the plant, turn green and for 
a short time act as leaves. 
Corn. Remove the seed coat from a grain of corn that has been soaked. Notice the soft, 
oval body embedded in the grain near the tip. This is the embryo, and is often called the 
“germ” of the corn. The hard part of the grain is not a part of the embryo. It is a reserve 
food supply and is called the endosperm. Only a small part of a grain of corn is the embryo, 
while all of the bean is the young plant or embryo. Carefully examine the embryo of the corn 
and find the plumule and hypocotyl. The corn has but one cotyledon. Plants, like corn, 
having one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous plants; while those, like the bean, having 
two cotyledons are called dicotyledonous plants. 
Draw pictures of parts of the seeds.

WEEDS 
Any plant growing out of its proper place may be termed a weed. Cotton in a corn- 
field or corn in a cotton patch would be weeds. But the term “weed” is generally applied 
to those plants of wide range that are more or less useless to man and that form the habit of 
thriving in cultivated fields. Weeds are objectionable (1) because they rob more useful plants 
of light, food, and moisture, and (2) because it takes time for their eradication which could 
be more profitably applied otherwise. They are only valuable indirectly to the farmer; 
the necessity for their removal causes better cultivation of the growing crop. 
Weeds are divided into three general classes — annuals, biennials, and perennials. 
Annuals are those plants that live but one year, biennials are those that live two years, and 
perennials are those that live on year after year. To destroy annuals it is necessary to pre- 
vent them from going to seed during their year of growth. Biennials should also be destroyed 
the first year to prevent their going to seed the second. Perennials must be destroyed root 
and branch if they are to be removed from the field. If even the roots of perennials are left, 
they will grow and seed again as if they had never been touched. The following table gives 
examples of each class. Add the names of others.

  18 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
Weeds are characterized by a very extensive stem growth, either erect or horizontal, and 
by special adaptations of growth to soil conditions. They are a type of plant almost ideally 
constituted to withstand extreme changes of moisture. Their seeds, akenes, are easily dis- 
tributed and are so made that they will live through droughts and exceeding wet spells. They 
are also so small and insignificant that they are overlooked by animals that would be likely 
to feed upon them. By their special shapes they are easily carried about by animals or the 
wind. Weeds have the most perfect means of seed dispersal of any of the plants and*it is 
for this reason partly that they are so prevalent. Besides seeds, weeds have other means of 
reproduction. 
Harmful Effects. The farmer’s profits are lessened in many ways by the weeds, among 
which are the following: (1) Weeds rob the soil of much moisture and take up water that 
might well be used by other plants. (2) Weeds crowd out other plants, depriving them of 
air and soil. (3) Weeds take food from the soil which ought to go to the growing crops. 
(4) Weeds are great breeding beds for injurious insects, especially when they occur in fence 
rows and in ditches. (5) Weeds often hurt the stock that eat them, sometimes seriously, 
and destroy the flavor of the by-products. (6) Weeds found in hay and other farm products 
make their sale uncertain. 
Keeping Out Weeds. To prevent weeds from entering a field requires eternal vigilance. 
Prevention in the handling of weeds is better than curing after the trouble has come. If the 
ground is plowed as soon as possible after planting, the weeds may be checked. Seed beds 
should be kept clean and all fence rows and pastures should be cleaned of all weeds before 
they go to seed. A rotation of crops will sometimes keep the weeds in check. Any smother 
crop, like clover, will hold the weeds back. A crop that is sown broadcast will cover a field 
and not give weeds room enough or air enough to grow. Fallow land is the most prolific 
source of our weed pests. 
Weeds may be exterminated by applying a strong salt solution to the plants. Spraying 
with iron sulphate will keep them in check. One sure but slow way is to pull them out root 
and branch, but care must be taken that the whole weed is removed or it will grow again. 
If the weed is an annual, plowing or cutting before the plant has gone to seed will destroy it.

STUDY OF THE WILD CARROT 
The wild carrot is one of our most aggressive weeds. It has spread all over the eastern 
part of our country and has been found in several places west of the Mississippi River. It 
thrives well in all kinds of soil and under marked changes of climate. It appears most fre- 
quently in pasture lands and in waste places, and is becoming troublesome over wide areas. 
The plant is easily recognized by its white flowers arranged in cymes at the end of long 
stems. In the center of each cyme there often appears a single purple flower. These cymes 
develop from June to September and are followed by bur-like seeds that readily attach them- 
selves to the hair of passing animals. Frequently these burs are found in unclean clover and 
grass seed. The seed has surprising vitality, keeping its vigor for several years. 
As this weed is not so frequently found in cultivated fields, it is a good indication that 
thorough cultivation will subdue the pest. In permanent pastures, mowing the plants be- 
fore they have flowered will destroy them. Pulling up the weeds by hand is a slow but sure 
way of eradication. Sheep pasturing in an infected meadow will keep down this pest. 
About the middle of September gather several wild carrot plants, being careful to get 
roots and burs. Make a study of the parts, manner of flowering, structure of bur, etc.

POISONOUS WEEDS 
Pokeweed. This weed goes under many names, such as poke, garget, American night- 
shade, and redweed. It grows from 6 to g feet high and is a smooth, rank pérennial. It has 
purplish stems and large alternating leaves. Its flowers come in clusters and are greenish- 
white in color. In the autumn, shining, purple-black berries form. The plant is a native of 
the United States and grows in cultivated fields and waste grounds all over the eastern part 
of the country. Generally the poisoning arises from an overdose when the plant is used as a 
medicine. The root of the pokeweed is sometimes mistaken for that of the parsnip or arti- 
choke and poison results from its eating. The seeds when eaten will sometimes produce 
death. The weed is a slow but violent emetic, affecting the nerves and producing convulsions. 
Death from it is generally due to paralysis of the respiratory organs. 
Woolly Loco Weed. This plant is a native of the Great Plains and grows most abundantly 
in Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. Horses, sheep, and cattle are affected by it, the horses 
suffering most from its poison. It is slow in its action and is not acute in its effect. It is a 
silvery-white plant with silky leaves. It is a perennial that grows about 12 inches high. 
The flowers are pea shaped and usually purple. The first effect of the poison upon stock is 
to cause defective eyesight and a hallucination or mania. After first tasting the plant, cattle 
refuse any other kind of food. After the first stage, comes a period of great emaciation, and 
finally the animal dies from starvation. 
Poison Ivy. This is a climbing or trailing shrub. The leaves are three-foliate and the 
plant has aérial roots. The flowers are greenish and appear in May and June. The fruit is 
smooth, waxy, and white, often remaining on the plant until late winter. Poison ivy grows 
everywhere in open ravines and borders of woods. It spreads along the roadsides and gets 
into cultivated fields. Crows, woodpeckers, and other birds that feed upon its fruits carry 
the seed about. The poison of the plant is a non-volatile oil found in all its parts. It is in- 
soluble in water and therefore cannot be washed off. Alcohol, however, will remove all traces 
of it. An alcoholic solution of sugar of lead (lead acetate) is used to destroy its effects. Strong 
alcohol should not be used; a weaker grade, about 50 to 75 per cent, is desirable. All poison 
ivy plants should be carefully destroyed and never permitted to grow about the home. Many 
persons often mistake the woodbine, or Virginia creeper, for the poison ivy. This is particu- 
larly true in the fall when the leaves of both are red. The woodbine can always be distin- 
guished by its compound leaves of five leaflets, while those of the poison ivy have three leaflets. 
Jimson Weed. These weeds have been introduced into the United States from Europe 
and tropical America. The plant is a rank, ill-smelling annual that grows from 2 to § feet 
high. It has large funnel-shaped flowers and prickly seed pods. The flowers appear from 
May to September and the fruit ripens in August. The symptoms of the poison are head- 
ache, nausea, vertigo, and a general nervous confusion. The seeds are poisonous to eat and 
the leaves have sometimes been cooked by mistake for other wild plants. Cattle have been 
poisoned by eating the plant. The jimson weeds should be destroyed wherever found. 
This can be done easily if cut when the flowers have formed. 
If the plants listed on the next page are found in your locality, fill out the table as sug- 
gested. Add the names of such weeds as are said to be poisonous about your home and 
make a careful study of them.

WHEAT 
Wheat is one of the most valuable crops grown in the United States. This country now 
produces about one fifth of the world’s wheat crop. The fact that wheat will grow success- 
fully in such a large variety of soils and that the plant so readily adapts itself to climatic con- 
ditions, accounts very largely for its being grown over such a large area. 
Preparation of the Seed Bed. The preparation of the seed bed for wheat is of the greatest 
importance. The soil should be plowed, harrowed, and rolled. The object of this tillage is 
to obtain two or three inches of fine loose soil over a compact under soil. This preparation 
of the seed bed should be done as early as the season will permit. 
. Date of Sowing. The time of seeding depends largely upon the climatic and soil con- 
ditions. It is the general practice, however, to sow from September 10 to October 15 in the 
winter-wheat belt. In the spring-wheat belt it should be sown just as early in the spring as 
the soil can be prepared. 
Method and Rate of Sowing. A good variety of home-grown seed should be selected. 
It should be cleaned, graded, and tested for vitality before sowing. It should be sown with 
a drill from one to two inches deep. The quantity sown per acre varies in different parts of 
the country. The amount used is influenced by the character of the soil, climate, and time of 
seeding. In dry regions three to five pecks per acre are used, while in regions of moderate 
rainfall from five to nine pecks are sown per acre. It is usually advisable to consult the lead- 
ing wheat grower of the neighborhood before deciding upon the variety to sow, and the time 
and rate of sowing. 
Types of Wheat. The classification of the cultivated wheats as made by Hunt are: 
einkorn, spelt, emmer, common wheat, club wheat, poulard, durum, and Polish wheat. 
The common, club, durum, and emmer are of the greatest importance in the United States. 
The two types most used for bread are the common and club wheats. The durum, poulard, 
and Polish wheats are used for making macaroni, while the emmer, spelt, and einkorn are used 
mostly for stock feed. 
Yield of Wheat. The ten-year average yield of wheat in the United States is about 14 
bushels per acre, that of Germany is 28, and that of England is 32. The average yield per 
acre in this country would be greatly increased if more attention were given to the preparation 
of the seed bed, the selection of better varieties, the testing and grading of the seed, the 
use of commercial fertilizers, and crop rotation. 
Enemies of Wheat. The common diseases of wheat are the smuts, scab, and rust. These 
are partially prevented by treatment of seed and by crop rotation. The insects that are most 
injurious are the Hessian fly and the chinch bug. 
Harvesting. Wheat should be cut when the stem, blades, and the head begin to 
turn yellow. If it is allowed to stand too long, it will become overripe and shatter 
when handled. The sheaves are placed in shocks to dry out after cutting. If the weather 
is suitable, thrashing may take place in a week or ten days after the wheat has been 
shocked.

PURITY AND VIABILITY OF SEED WHEAT 
Purity. One of the most important considerations in the selection of seed is purity. 
Seed often contains weed seeds and other impurities. Obtain some good seed wheat and 
also a poor grade of seed. Frequently good seed may be obtained from the United States 
Department of Agriculture or from the State Experiment Station. Weigh out a small 
quantity, of each sample. Closely examine and determine the per cent of wheat grains, of 
foreign seeds, and of trash. Classify as wheat the shriveled seeds as well as the plump grains. 
Record the results below.

Poor grade |

| 
Viability. A pure seed may have many grains that are dead or of low vitality. To 
determine the viability of seeds the germination test must be applied. From the sample of 
good seed wheat select 100 grains that will represent the average grade of the whole, and 
place them between layers of moist cloth in a plate germinator. Keep in a warm place 
for three days. At the end of that time count the number that have germinated. What is 
the per cent of viability? Record results. 
In the same manner make a germination test of 100 seeds of the poor grade of wheat. 
What is the per cent of viability of this sample? Record results.

THE HESSIAN FLY AND CHINCH BUG 
Hessian Fly. The Hessian fly is a native of 
the Old World, in the regions of primitive wheat 
culture. Its spread has followed quite closely the 
dispersion of its host plants, — wheat, rye, and 
barley. It is now found in nearly all the most 
important wheat regions of the world. 
The adult female is a small, dark-colored fly, 
about one tenth of an inch long. It is possessed 
of two wings and looks much like a mosquito. 
The male is smaller and more slender than the 
female, darker in appearance, and has longer and 
Hessian Fry. more conspicuous whorls of hair on the antenne. 
The eggs are scarcely visible to the naked 
eye. They are orange reddish in color and change to greenish white as the maggot becomes 
older. When full grown, the larva is about three sixteenths of an inch long, without legs or 
a distinct head. 
The puparium, or “ flaxseed,” consists of the pupa within the cast larval skin. The 
common name is at once suggested by the resemblance of the puparium in form and color to a 
flaxseed. The true pupa is white in color and is inclosed in the puparium. 
The fly appears both in the spring and fall, the former period extending from April to July, 
and the later, or fall brood, from August to November. When the eggs are deposited in the 
spring, the young go down to the first or second joint above the root as soon as they are hatched, 
but in the fall, when the plants are much smaller, they usually go down to a point just above the 
roots. The effect on the wheat in the fall is to prevent the plant from sending up shoots that 
would bear heads the following year, and to reduce the growth to a mere bunch of rank growing 
leaves that die during the winter. In the spring, the maggots go down to the first or second 
joints above the roots and become embedded in the straw, thus weakening it when the grain 
comes:to ahead. Straw thus weakened will topple over and become what is known as “ straw 
fallen” grain. The insect passes the winter in the flaxseed stage about the plants just above 
the roots. It usually passes the summer in the stubbles that are left in the fields after harvest. 
The adult flies take little or no nourishment; their chief business in life being to repro- 
duce their kind, and they live but a few days after emerging to the adult stage. 
Some preventive measures are (1) avoid sowing too early, (2) maintain a rotation of crops, 
(3) burn the stubble every few years where this can be done, and (4) use decoy crops, which 
should be plowed under as early as possible after they have been attacked by the fly. Well- 
screened seed from a variety possessing a large or medium straw with excellent stooling quali- 
ties should be chosen for seed, for by this means the crop will be more resistant to this pest. 
Chinch Bug. The chinch bug is a small, oblong-shaped insect, blackish brown in color, 
with soft white wings. In spite of its small size, less than one fifth of an inch long, the 
pest is quite conspicuous owing to its strong coloring. It feeds upon grass crops of all kinds, 
but is especially destructive to wheat and corn. It probably causes as great a money loss 
as any of our field or garden insects.

PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE : 27 
Two broods are produced in a summer, and a single 
female chinch bug is said to lay five hundred eggs. When 
the first brood become adults they generally migrate. If 
the brood has been reared in wheat, this tendency to 
migrate is almost certain. This is due to the fact that 
when the brood becomes full grown the wheat is well 
matured and does not suit as food. Corn is favored by 
the bug on account of its juiciness. When migrations take 
place from wheat to corn, protection may be obtained by 
trenching, as the adults seldom resort to flight. Dry 
warm weather is favorable to a large increase of this pest, 
while wet cold weather is unfavorable to its development. 
The remedies suggested in regard to the chinch bug 
are more preventive than eradicative. All of the damage 
done cannot be prevented. Clean cultivation and the re- Cumcx Buc, 
moval of all trash from fields and fence rows will keep 
down the pest somewhat. As the insect travels on foot, trenches may be dug and the insects 
burned after they have fallen into them. Spraying the trenches with kerosene emulsion will 
killthem. The residents in those regions infested by the chinch bug should inform them- 
selves upon the latest methods of ridding the fields of the pest. The loss sustained annually 
in the states of Illinois and Kansas have led the various experiment stations of the infested 
regions to take up the study of best methods to clean the field of these insects.

LESSON 22 
A STUDY OF THE CORN PLANT 
The corn plant bears staminate flowers upon the tassel. These flowers furnish the pollen 
for seed fertilization. The ears are the pistillate flowers and the long-flowing silk threads are 
the pistils on which the pollen from the tassel lodges and fertilizes the seed. Since the tassels 
are above the ears it is easier for the pollen to reach the pistils than it would be if their positions 
were reversed. 
The roots of the corn are distinctly fibrous and spread through the soil in all directions. 
This is done in search of food and also to give the plant a better hold to support itself. In 
cultivating corn, care must be exercised not to plow too deep, as the tender roots are easily 
cut and broken. As the corn plant offers a large surface to the wind, it is easily blown down. 
To help support its heavy stalk and long leaves, other roots are sent out from the stem a short 
distance above the ground. These roots are large and heavy. Unless something happens to 
the underground roots, these supporting roots do not give the plant any food. If, however, the 
lower roots cease to bring enough food to the plant, these supporting roots will take up the work. 
Few plants have as wide a range of distribution as the corn. It is a native of warm climates, 
but it can be grown as far north as Canada. It requires at least three months of warm weather 
and a moderate amount of rainfall. It will grow best on a well-drained loamy soil. Owing 
to the great length of its roots and to their fibrous nature, the soil should be well broken up 
and plowed deep. Like most crops, corn needs a nitrogen fertilizer and, like all grains, it 
requires much phosphoric acid. Different types require a slightly different fertilizer, and the 
nature of the soil used also influences the fertilizer ingredients to be employed. 
There are a great many products that may be obtained from the corn plant. Besides the 
corn meal and the fodder, we obtain starch, glucose, oil, and alcohol. Every part of the corn 
plant may be utilized for some purpose. Corn is so important a crop to mankind that every 
means in our power should be employed to improve it and to introduce and cultivate new and 
better varieties, of all the different types. 
Select a well-developed plant for class study. The plant should have ears, tassel, and as 
many roots as possible upon it.

LESSON 24 
SELECTION OF SEED EARS 
The breeding of seed corn of high productive capacity is one of the most important 
things that a farmer can do. In order to obtain a fair return for the labor expended upon 
any kind of a crop, the seed must be pure and strong. The careful selection and breed- 
ing of seed require much thought and study and an exact knowledge of just the kind of 
plant desired and the qualities of seed that will produce such a plant. 
In order to know how to select good seed ears, it is necessary first to know what are the 
essential characters of a good corn plant. A good corn for any section is one that matures 
in time to escape the frost and at the same time is sufficiently late to take full advantage of the 
growing season. That plant is also considered the best that has no offshoots or suckers, is 
thick at the base, has well-developed roots, and grows gradually tapering toward the top. 
The ear or ears should grow a little below the middle point. It is not desirable to have the 
plant over ten feet in height. The ears should be attached to the stalk by a four or five inch 
shank, and the leaves, twelve to sixteen in number, should be well formed and of a good color. 
If good corn is to be grown, it is necessary that seed should come from well-formed plants. 
Seed ears, therefore, must first be selected from the growing plant and must be first judged by 
the qualities of that plant. This selection should be made from the standing stalks at ripen- 
ing time. ; 
Good seed ears must be properly cared for after they are taken from the stalk. They 
should be put away on drying racks that are protected against mice and rats. The racks 
should be put in a dry place where there is good ventilation. If corn is thoroughly dried 
out before cold weather, there will be no damage done from freezing. Large seed firms have 
gone to great expense building drying houses for corn in order that a large per cent of the 
grains will germinate. The farmer must not neglect the proper care of his seed after it is 
selected, if he is to secure the best results. 
The next point to be considered is the desirability of the ear selected. A well-rounded, 
cylindrical-shaped ear affords the largest percentage of grain to the cob. The cob should be 
of medium size and should dry well; the kernels should be regular and fit closely together. 
The kernel which represents the greatest length in proportion to the cob is generally considered 
the best for seeding purposes, but the size of the cob should not be sacrificed to gain increased 
length of the kernel. The typical kernel shape is that of the wedge. 
The work of breeding a productive corn should be begun with the best corn available on 
the farm. Having in mind the character of the corn desired, select about ripening time those 
plants in the field that most nearly approximate the standard desired. Mark them by at- 
taching a piece of string or cloth so that they may be easily seen and left undisturbed. A 
hundred or more such plants should be selected. Watch carefully the development of this 
marked corn, and if early corn is desired, select those plants that are maturing early and whose 
ears are drying well. 
' From the marked corn plants select a hundred or more ears that have fully developed and 
that seem to possess the qualities desired. These should be placed upon boards or tables with 
the tips pointing in the same direction. Those ears that most nearly approach the type needed 
should be selected and the others discarded. From each of these selected ears take two ker- 
nels about equal distances from the butts and tips. Compare these kernels as to length and 
ai

  32 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
general shape, being very careful not to mix the kernels from the different ears. From this 
comparison, select the ears that present.the best-formed kernels. These ears are the ones to 
be used for seed breeding. 
When the time comes for planting the seed corn, a breeding plot is carefully chosen away 
from all other corn in order to remove all chance of deterioration due to cross breeding with 
inferior strains. The size of this plot should conform to the amount of seed corn ready for 
planting and to the labor available. It is essential.that the soil of the plot be uniform and 
well drained. Each ear of selected seed corn should be given a row to itself and a careful record 
kept of its growth. It is customary to detassel all the undesirable stalks that grow in the 
plot, letting only the healthy and well-formed plants mature. Some corn breeders advise 
detasseling each row from end to middle, alternate ends of adjoining rows being detasseled ; 
this insures greater vigor of growth. Seed selection from this plot may be undertaken as 
before and the discarded ‘ears used for seed in the general field crop. If the plot is continued 
from year to year, it will not be long until a superior breed of corn is obtained. 
Work out by means of a diagram the plan of the corn plot described in this lesson.

LESSON 25 
HARVESTING CORN 
Most of our corn is harvested by husking the ears from the standing plants, and the 
stalks are left to be pastured during the winter months. This is a wasteful method, for by so 
doing about half of the feeding value of the stalks is lost. Cutting the corn insures a more 
profitable use of the entire plant. The corn should be cut when the lower leaves of the 
stalk have begun to ripen and when the kernels of the ears have glazed over and begun to 
dent, and the husks have begun to dry up. Corn is cut both by hand and with corn binders. 
When cut with a binder it is tied into bundles. The fodder, which is the entire plant before 
the ears are husked, is placed in a shock to dry out. The corn is dry enough to husk when 
the grains will shell off the cob. When it is husked by hand, the stover, which consists of 
the fodder after the ears are removed, is placed back in the shock or taken to the barn. It 
is a good farm practice to get the stover under shelter as soon as possible in order that loss by 
weathering may be prevented. If this stover is cut or shredded, it will make better feed and 
be more convenient to handle. If the corn is husked and shredded by machine, the shredded 
stover is placed in a mow by a blower attachment on the machine while the ears come out 
husked and ready for the crib or market.

LESSON 26 
CORN JUDGING 
The estimating of the value of corn ears for seeding purposes is called corn judging. It 
requires an accurate knowledge of the different parts of the corn ear and their values in seed- 
ing properties. Different kinds of corn vary somewhat in characteristics, the ears being of 
different shape, size, and appearance. A good judge of seed corn is able to tell from a study of 
the ear which corn is best for planting. To aid in this work a score card, giving the chief 
points to be observed and their values, is used. 
Ten ears of any one kind of corn are deemed sufficient to judge the seeding qualities of 
that corn. These samples for scoring will differ according to the kinds of corn they represent 
and should be judged accordingly. Varieties that mature early are generally smaller than 
those that mature later. Corn plants growing in a region of little rainfall show a shallow kernel 
and are generally smoother than varieties growing where the rainfall is heavy. Varieties will 
also differ in color of kernel. 
In order to judge any kind of corn a standard must be set. The points by which corn 
ears are judged differ slightly, but in the main have certain general characteristics true of all 
breeds. The ideal ear will approximate the following description which is an explanation of 
the points to be observed in filling out the score card given in this lesson. 
(1) Trueness to Type. The ears selected should be uniform in size, shape, color, and 
indentation of kernels. Uniformity or trueness to type is essential to progress in corn im- 
provement. Ten ears that are uniform are much more likely to produce good corn than ten 
ears that differ widely in general characteristics. 
(2) Shape of Ear. The typical corn ear is nearly cylindrical in shape. A well-shaped 
ear permits of even rows from butt to tip. The rows should run the full length of the ear. 
(3) Purity of Color in Grain and Cob. A uniform color of the kernels indicates purity. 
A mixture of color shows a cross breeding in the corn. Yellow varieties of corn generally have 
red cobs, and white varieties have white cobs. A variation in such coloring shows mixture in 
breeding. ihe 
(4) Vitality. Vitality is life strength. Small, shriveled kernels do not show much 
life strength and would probably not grow well when planted. If the corn ear is well matured, 
the kernels will show good vitality. Soundness of kernels on the cob is also an evidence of 
strong vitality. 
(5) Tips. The tips should be well covered by rows of kernels, uniform in shape and size. 
(6) Butts. The butts should also be well filled out with kernels. 
(7) Uniformity of Kernels. Uniformity of kernels shows trueness to type. Uniform- 
ity of kernels is also essential to machine planting. 
(8) Shape of Kernels. The typical kernel is wedge-shaped. The thickness of the 
kernel should be about half the width. Uniformity of size and shape at different parts of the 
ear is desirable. 
(9) Length of Ear. Standard lengths for different varieties of corn are given. The 
ears of the corn to be judged should approximate this length as nearly as possible. 
(10) Circumference of Ear. A deficiency in circumference denotes a small relative 
amount of corn. Too large a circumference indicates immaturity. Circumference is de- 
termined by measuring the ear one third the distance from the butt to the tip.
-P-A-G-E-41
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 35 
(11) Furrow between Rows. These should be narrow. Too wide a furrow indicates 
a small per cent of corn. 
(12) Space between Kernels. Kernels should be close together on the cob. Large spaces 
between the kernels indicate low vitality. 
(13) Proportion of Corn to Cob. Too small cobs and too large kernels or too large cobs 
and too small kernels show poor germinating properties. Generally the ear with medium-sized 
cob is preferable. 
  Ten CHAMPION Ears OF Corn. 
The following rules to be used in judging corn are suggested by the University of Wis- 
consin : — . 
(1) Length of Ear. The deficiency and excess in length of all ears not conforming to 
the standard shall be added together, and for every inch thus obtained a cut of one point shall 
be made. 
(2) Circumference of Ear. The deficiency and excess in circumference of all ears not 
conforming to the standard shall be added together, and for every inch thus obtained:a cut 
of one half point shall be made. The circumference is measured at one third the distance 
from the butt to the tip of the ear. 
(3) Percentage of Corn. The per cent of corn should be from 85 to 87. In determining 
the percentage of corn, weigh and shell every alternate ear in the sample. Weigh the shelled 
corn. Divide the weight of the corn by the total weight of the ears, which will give the per 
cent of corn. For each per cent short of standard, a one-point cut shall be made. 
(4) Color of Corn and Cob. A red cob in white corn or a white cob in yellow corn shall 
be cut five points. For each mixed kernel a cut of one tenth of a point shall be made. Kernels 
missing from the ear shall be counted as mixed. Difference in shade of color, as light or dark, 
white or cream color, must be scored according to variety characteristics. 
(5) Scoring Tips. When one inch of the cob is exposed, a cut of one point shall be made 
and a proportionate cut as the cob is less exposed. Regularity of the rows near the tip, and 
the shape and size of the kernels, must also be considered in scoring tips. 
(6) Scoring Butts. If the kernels are uniform in size and extend over the butt in regu-  
-P-A-G-E-42

lar order, give full marking. 
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
Small-and compressed or enlarged and open butts are objec- 
tionable, as are also those with flat, smooth, short kernels, and must be cut according to the 
judgment of the scorer.

SILAGE 
In the gathering of fodder crops 
and in the storing of them for feeding 
purposes much of the nutriment is lost 
and the crops are less digestible. Farm 
animals relish such crops as grass, corn 
fodder, clover, and cowpeas much more 
when these are fed to them green than 
after the same crops have been cured. 
The method employed in the South of 
stripping the corn plant of its leaves 
and storing the fodder in cribs is very 
wasteful, since about one fourth of the 
digestible matter is lost in the natural 
curing process. Corn fodder can be 
stored in air-tight buildings and little of 
its food value lost. Clover and grass 
cannot be kept in a fresh green state 
by storing in air-tight buildings, but 
they can be kept without much change. 
Specially constructed buildings to 
hold these green crops are called silos. 
A silo may be built within or on the ene i 
outside of the. barn. Quite frequently ecto 
silos are built partly underground. The 
main matter of importance is to make the building air-tight. Round silos are the best form 
as they hold more silage than square silos of equal size. Silage can be packed more easily 
in the former, and the silage settles more evenly than it does in a square one. The silage at 
the top of the silo generally decays and forms an air-tight mass that protects the rest of 
the silage below. Any green matter may be put in silos for keeping. Besides corn, alfalfa, a 
beets, cowpeas, and soy beans are used for silage. Before the green crops are placed in the 
silo they are generally cut into fine pieces, as in this shape the fodder is more easily handled 
and more easily eaten by the cattle. 
Fill out the following table from information gained by visiting farms having silos.

LESSON 29 
ORIGIN -OF THE SOIL 
Soil is the thin layer of surface earth that is capable of growing plants. Its importance is 
very great, because from it all plants derive their food; and plant life is necessary for the 
existence of animals and man. The soil is very complex in its structure, being composed of 
finely divided rock, decayed plants, and the remains of animals. This surface layer of earth 
has been formed by natural forces and agents, and is being continually changed; so that the 
soil cultivated to-day is not the soil our forefathers cultivated two hundred years ago. Rains 
washing the hillsides and uplands carry off soil to enrich the meadows and bottom lands, rocks 
are being broken up by the changes of temperature, swamps are being filled by vegetable 
growth, and the comparatively level and dry lands are being changed continually by the 
work of ants and earthworms. 
The principal forces and agents that have been instrumental in soil making are (1) water, 
(2) ice, (3) changes of temperature, (4) winds, (5) plants, (6) animals, and (7) gases. 
(1) Running water is one of the most important agents in making soil. Rain beating upon 
the soil breaks it up into smaller particles and will even wear depressions in solid rock in time. 
Rivers do extensive work by wearing away or eroding the soil, and if a river is of sufficient size, 
flows swiftly enough, and carries sediment to help in the grinding process, the work done is 
sometimes enormous. ‘Then rivers build up soil by depositing their loads in shallow places, 
making what are called alluvial or flood plains. 
(2) Large sheets of ice moving slowly across the surface grind the solid rock into very fine 
particles. The whole of the northern part of North America was once covered by a conti- | 
nental glacier that extended as far south as the Ohio and Missouri rivers. After the ice 
melted away much of the surface that had been covered by the great glacier was left with a | 
deep layer of rich glacial soil. 
(3) Rapid changes of temperature will cause rocks to break up or to chip to pieces. If 
rocks are heated, they will expand, and this force of expansion is sometimes greater than the 
force that holds the particles of the rock together. Ifa heated rock becomes suddenly cooled 
by rains, it will contract rapidly and break. Water entering the cracks of a large rock will 
expand on freezing and split the rock in pieces. 
(4) Winds not only transport fine soil but they will wear away heavy rocks by blowing sand 
against them that gradually cuts them away by the impact of the sand. Dust blown about 
the city streets is a familiar example of wind-transported soil. In some countries large areas 
are wholly built up by this wind-deposited soil called loess. 
(5) Many forms of plant life break up rocks by producing acids that aid in dissolving the / 
rock particles. Plant roots also grow into the rock cracks and break off pieces. Plants decay 
in the soil and become an organic part of it called humus. 
(6) The earthworm increases the porosity of the soil by digging tunnels and bringing par- 
ticles of soil to the surface. Ants do work of the same character and are very active agents 
in pulverizing the soil. All animals that burrow help to make soil. Man in his agricultural 
activities is also a potent agent in soil development. 
(7) Carbon dioxide has a dissolving action upon some kinds of rock. Limestone is 
especially affected by water having this gas and is easily worn away. Oxygen also combines 
with minerals in rocks and causes them to disintegrate.

CLASSES OF SOILS 
Bring to school samples of all the leading types of soils found in the school district. Quart 
samples will be large enough for experimental purposes. Place each sample upon paper and 
compare. Reduce the number of samples by combining those that seem to be of the same 
type. Place the soils in boxes for future use. New soil may be added now and then that the 
supply may always be sufficient for schoolroom work. The samples brought into the school 
will probably represent gravel, sand, clay, loam, and muck. 
The mineral particles of the soil are divided according to size into four general classes, — 
clay, silt, sand, and gravel. The smallest particles are clay. They are so small that they 
cannot be seen without a microscope. Grains of sand are chiefly of quartz and are large 
enough to be seen with the unaided eye. Silt particles are intermediate in size between clay 
and sand. -Every fertile soil contains a considerable amount of decaying organic matter, 
which the farmer calls humus. This organic matter increases the capacity of a soil to retain 
moisture and furnishes plant food to the growing crop. 
A sandy soil contains 80 per cent or more of sand. Such a soil is open and allows air and 
water to pass readily through it. When rubbed between the fingers, it feels gritty, and does 
not become sticky when wet. A clay soil consists of 60 per cent or more of clay and silt. A 
clay soil is sticky when wet and likely to become cloddy if cultivated when wet. It holds 
water well, but the passage of air and water through clay soils is slow; hence surplus water 
drains very slowly from such a soil, and in tough clays germinating seeds and the roots of 
plants may suffer from the lack of a free access of air. Loam soils contain sand, silt, clay, 
and humus in such proportions that the soils are neither too friable nor too sticky. The 
loams have enough fine particles to hold water well and enough sand to give ready access to 
water and air and to make cultivation easy. The student must understand that loam is not 
a substance but a condition of soil. Although we speak of a sandy loam and a clay loam, we 
really mean a loamy sand and a loamy clay. The addition of sand or humus to a tough clay 
will make it loamy; while the addition of clay or humus to a sandy soil, by binding the grains 
of sand, makes it more loamy in character. Muck and peat soils contain large amounts of 
decaying vegetable matter. Such soils have been formed in swamps or marshes. 
Place side by side a sample of each class of soil obtained. Examine each sample as to color 
and fineness. Rub the particles between the thumb and forefinger. Wet a handful of each 
and note which crumbles most easily. Which is most sticky ? Note the differences briefly

Place some soil in a glass jar nearly filled with water. Shake well and allow the sediment 
to settle. Note the layers of different-sized sand particles. 
Fill four tumblers nearly full of water and add 10 grams of sandy soil to one, the same 
weight of clay soil to another, of loam to the third, and of muck to the fourth. After the sand 
of each sample has settled, pour off the water containing the other particles. Weigh the 
sand after drying it, and find what per cent of each soil is sand. 
Weigh a good sample of muck or other humus soil that has been thoroughly dried. Heat 
over a flame so as to burn off all the humus. Weigh again and compute the proportion of 
humus by weight. Record the results. This gives only the approximate quantity of humus, 
since some of the mineral elements may also be drtiven off by the heat. 
Weigh a quart of finely pulverized clay soil and another quart of sandy soil. Which is 
the heavier ? 
The terms “light” and “heavy” as applied to soils have nothing to do with their weight. 
The terms are used to indicate the difficulty in plowing them. The strength of cohesion 
between the particles of the soil gives rise to these terms. A sandy soil plows easily and is 
therefore “light.”

GRAVITATIONAL AND CAPILLARY WATER 
Use the same apparatus as in the preceding lesson. Fill the bottles with new samples of 
the five kinds of soils. Shake until the soil is well settled in each, and have the surface as 
nearly level as possible. On the top of each soil place a circle of cloth to prevent soil wash 
when water is poured in. From a graduated quart measure add water to the soil of the first 
bottle until it is saturated. Catch the dripping water in atumbler. When the soil is thor- 
oughly saturated, add more water until its level is about an inch above the surface of the soil. 
At the moment when the loss by dripping lowers the water level to the surface of the soil re- 
place the tumbler with another containing no water. Pour the water in the first tumbler 
back into the quart measure. The difference between the amount now in this measure and 
the amount at first is the quantity of water held in the saturated soil. 
All the water that will pass from the saturated soil is to be collected in the tumbler ora 
larger container if necessary, and since the dripping will continue for hours, the top of the 
bottle should be covered with oilcloth or oiled paper to prevent loss by evaporation. A simi- 
lar covering for the same purpose should be placed over the tumbler. 
In the same manner.add water to each of the other bottles, and determine the amount held 
in each soil when saturated. 
Which soil holds the most water ? 
Which soil holds the least water ? 
List the soils in the order of the amount of water held by each, beginning with the one 
holding the largest amount. 
When the dripping is finished, determine the quantity of water that has dripped from each 
soil. 
List the soils in the order of the amount of water lost by dripping. 
Calculate the quantity of water remaining in each soil. 
List the soils in the order of the quantity of water retained by each after dripping has 
ceased. 
Of the total amount of water in a saturated soil, the amount that drains away is called 
gravitational or free water. When a soil is thoroughly soaked, it is the gravitational water 
that seeps into a hole dug in the ground. It is the gravitational water of the ground that 
supplies our wells and springs. The water that dripped from each bottle was the gravita- 
tional water of the soil in the bottle. 
As the gravitational water escapes, what takes its place in the pores or spaces between 
the soil particles ? 
The water that does not escape by drainage but is held as very thin films around the par- 
ticles of soil is called capillary or film water. It is only the capillary water in the soil that the 
roots of most crops can use. The gravitational water is detrimental to such plants, for its 
presence excludes the air that is needed by their roots. 
Can a crop stand a drought better in a clay soil or in a sandy soil ?. Why? 
How can we increase the capacity of a soil for capillary water ?

CAPILLARY MOVEMENT OF WATER IN SOILS 
Place about a quart of dry soil in a conical mound upon a plate. Pour water around the 
base of the mound and then watch the upward movement of the moisture through the soil. 
Add water as long as the soil absorbs it by capillarity. After the soil has taken up all the 
capillary water it can, remove any surplus water that may be in the plate. Flatten the top 
of the pile of soil and add a small quantity of dry soil. Note what takes place. Record. 
Remove from the plate the moist soil and place on it another mound of dry soil. Care- 
fully moisten the upper part of the soil without saturating it. Does the capillary water of the 
upper part spread through the whole mass ? 
In a dry time, after a shower has fallen upon a cultivated field, notice the depth of the layer 
moisture by the rain. Near the same spot notice the depth of moistened soil several hours 
later. Explain. 
The upper surface of the layer of earth that is saturated with water is known as the water 
table. In wet seasons the water table may be at the surface of the ground, but in dry seasons 
it is several feet below. In dry weather the soil near the surface receives moisture from the 
saturated zone by capillarity. If the water table sinks too low, the capillary water may fail 
to reach the surface soil or the capillary action may be so slow that the roots of crops may 
suffer from lack of moisture. 
Why do crops in a river bottom stand a drought much better than crops on uplands ? 
Upon a plate place a conical heap of gravel containing no sand, and pour water around the 
edge of the gravel. Does it rise through the whole mass ? 
What is the effect upon the rise of capillary water if a layer of gravel separates the surface

SAVING MOISTURE BY MULCHES 
Add an equal weight of the same kind of soil to each of four tin pails of gallon size. Tall 
cans will serve as well. Add water to the soils, placing an equal quantity in each. Do not 
saturate the soils; add only enough to furnish capillary water. Number the pails of soils. 
Cover the soil of No. 1 with a two-inch layer of chopped straw, with a table fork pulverize 
the soil of No. 2 to a depth of two inches, pulverize the soil of No. 3 to a depth of one inch, 
and leave untouched the soil of No. 4. The pulverizing of the soils of Nos. 2 and 3 should be 
continued until a mulch of fine, dry soil is obtained in each. Weigh each pail and contents, 
and place them where they may be kept dry for several days. At the same hour each day, for 
five days or longer, weigh each pail and calculate its loss of water. Enter the record in the

Which mulch is the most effective protection against loss of water by evaporation ? 
A layer of loose, dry soil or foreign matter, such as leaves or straw, that retards evaporation 
is called a mulch. The formation of a soil mulch by shallow cultivation is a very common 
method of conserving moisture in dry periods. During the dry months of summer, farmers 
often keep a mulch of loose soil in their cornfields to reduce evaporation of the soil water 
which is so necessary to the growing crop. A shower of rain destroys the mulch, and so after 
each shower it is necessary to prepare another soil mulch. Even if no rain falls, after an 
interval of several days, it is a good plan to renew the mulch, for dew and moist air gradually 
change the mulch to a crust that will allow capillary water to reach the surface, where it es- 
capes by evaporation. In desert climates the soil mulch is absolutely necessary to the grow- 
ing of crops. In pictures of citrous orchards, note the soil mulch that covers the ground 
between the trees.

PROTECTION OF TREES AGAINST RODENTS 
The loss to tree fruits in the United States caused by rodents (mice, rabbits, and wood- 
chucks) is a matter of great concern to the fruit grower. This loss is confined principally to 
newly set orchards, replants in older orchards, and the younger plantations generally. Mice 
rarely injure trees except where grass, strawy manure, or trash of some kind about the base 
of the tree provides a hiding place. 
In mounding fruit trees for protection against mice, first clear away the grass and teal 
from the base of the tree for a foot or more in all directions. Then take a post tamper and 
thoroughly pack the surface of the soil. This is to fill runs or burrows that may be below 
the surface. Last, secure a few shovelfuls of fresh soil, or better, take cinders, and form 
a mound, Io to 15 inches in diameter at the base and 6 inches high, about the stem of the 
tree, firmly packing the soil. 
Another preventive is the use of the wire screen. This is the ideal all-round protector 
among mechanical forms. It is light and open and presents the least obstruction to strong 
winds, the air and sunshine are freely admitted, and no secure place is provided for the hiding 
of the woolly aphis and other forms of insect life. The screen is made of galvanized wire 
cloth of one quarter inch mesh (four 22-gauge wires to the inch) and may be purchased from 
supply houses in rolls of 100 linear feet and in any width from 24 to 36 inches. For apple 
trees, many use the 24-inch width. This is cut in 12-inch sections, making pieces 12 X 24 in 
size. These sections are bent into cylinders two and a half to three inches in diameter. The 
edges should be lapped about one inch to give strength and rigidity. 
Small-meshed poultry netting is sometimes used. This protector is made of ordinary 
galvanized wire poultry netting of one inch mesh. It is just as effective against rabbits as 
the closer woven wire cloth, but will not protect trees from mice. 
There is no device more effective against rabbits and woodchucks (ground hogs) than the 
cornstalk protector. Five or six stalks, after having been neatly stripped, may be bound 
firmly together about the stem of the young tree with twine. By mounding the bases as 
stated above, stalk-protected trees are quite secure against all rodent enemies. 
A thick paint of lime, soap, carbolic acid, and sulphur is recommended to protect trees 
from injury by rabbits, sheep, and mice. The lime-sulphur mixture, such as is used for spray- 
ing for scale insects, is effective in preventing injury by rabbits in the orchard and nursery. 
If young trees are girdled by rodents in late spring, just as growth is beginning, they may 
be treated by binding about the wounded parts a heavy covering of smooth soft clay. A new 
bark will form beneath the clay if the cambium (growing layer of wood) is not destroyed. It 
is safer, however, to resort to bridge grafting. 
In bridge grafting, make the wound clean and smooth and cover with grafting wax. 
The scions should be cut slightly longer than the span to be bridged so that, when they are 
inserted, their curving form will tend to keep them firmly fixed in position. The two ends 
of the scions are cut to a thin wedge form. Incisions are made in the bark with a narrow chisel 
and the scions are inserted. Then melted wax should be poured about the points of union 
of the scions with the body of the tree.

FOOD SUBSTANCES IN PLANTS 
The substances found in plants are woody fiber (cellulose), sugar, starch, gum, fat and 
oil, protein, water, and ash. These various parts of the plant are composed of certain chemi- 
cal elements derived from water, soil, and air. The following table gives the most important 
of these elements and the sources from which they are derived.

All but the first three of the above elements come from the soil. Leguminous crops, 
such as clovers, alfalfa, and velvet beans, are the only ones able to obtain nitrogen directly 
from the air. Three of these elements, — nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, — are often 
deficient in the soil and have to be supplied by some artificial means. 
Each of these three substances has its own work to perform in plant building and its 
presence in the soil is very necessary to the farmer. Nitrogen gives strength and growth to 
the stalks of the plant and is the most essential element in the protein of the plant; phosphorus 
is necessary if the plant is to produce a perfect seed; potassium adds health to the plant,and 
gives it power to resist disease. 
Testing Plants for Food Substances. Perform the following exercises to show the pres- 
ence of food substances in plants. Record your results. ; 
Water. Select a well-grown, healthy plant. Weigh carefully and then expose for 
several hours to a dry heat. Weigh again and the loss in weight will represent the water in 
the plant driven off by the heat.

Ash. Burn up the plant over a hot flame. The residue is the ash of the plant composed 
of mineral matter that the heat could not consume. 
Protein. Mix up a stiff dough of wheat flour. Wash out the starch in running water. 
The gray, tough mass left is the gluten or albumin of the wheat. 
Fat and Oil. Crush a castor oil bean on a sheet of white paper. Heat slowly and ob- 
serve the grease spot made. 
Gum. Notice the gum exuded upon many fruit trees. Some trees are noted for the 
chewing gum they furnish. 
Sugar. Chew some cane and note the taste. Apples, beets, turnips, and many other 
plants also give a sweet taste when chewed. 
Starch. Upon a slice of potato or a grain of wheat, place a drop of iodine. The result- 
ing color is characteristic of starch. 
Cellulose. Tearacornstalk to pieces. Note howthe parts hold together. Pull a cotton 
stalk to pieces and observe how hard it is to separate its parts. These parts are held together 
by tough, woody fibers called cellulose.

LESSON 38 
COMPOSITION OF FEEDS 
The substances in plants are termed dry matter and water. When we drive the water 
from the plant by applying heat, dry matter remains. When we burn this dry matter, a large 
proportion of it passes off in the form of invisible gases. This material that passes off is known 
as organic matter, and what is left is called ash or mineral matter. The organic matter is 
composed of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. The ash or mineral matter is made up of 
sodium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulphur, silicon, and other mineral elements. 
Protein. Protein includes all the nitrogenous compounds found in plants. This sub- 
stance in feeds produces muscle, skin, horn, hair, and milk, when fed to animals. The protein 
in the tissues of animals is obtained only from the protein substances of feeds. For this 
reason, and because most feeds contain relatively small amounts of protein, it is considered 
the most important component of feeds. 
Fat or Ether Extract. Substances in feedstuffs that are dissolved out or extracted by 
ether are called ether extract or fat. Examples are cottonseed oil, olive oil, and linseed oil. 
Fats furnish fuel to keep the animal warm, produce energy, and aid in the production of 
fatty tissue. Fats are 2.25 times more valuable as heat producers than carbohydrates. 
Carbohydrates. Starch, sugar, and crude fiber are the most important carbohydrates 
in feeds. The carbohydrates contain no nitrogen, but are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen. These three elements come from the air and water, and therefore the formation of 
carbohydrates in the crops does not exhaust the fertility of the soil. Carbohydrates are 
the chief sources of heat and energy, and in fattening animals are converted into fatty tissue. 
In a chemical analysis, when a portion of a feed is treated with a weak acid and then a 
weak alkali, all substances are dissolved except the woody fibers, or crude fiber. The carbo- 
hydrates that are dissolved are known as nitrogen-free extract. Thus the chemist in reporting 
an analysis uses the terms nitrogen-free extract and crude fiber. For practical purposes the 
nitrogen-free extract may be regarded as starch and sugar. 
Ash. This substance supplies materials for the bones and the framework of the animal. 
It also helps to build up the blood, tissues, and the digestive fluids. 
Water. All feedstuffs contain water. The green grasses contain about 80 per cent; 
root crops, 90 per cent; and grain feeds, like oats and corn, 10 per cent, of water. 
The common feeds are divided into two classes, — nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous. 
Feeds containing proportionately a large amount of protein are called nitrogenous foods, 
and those containing proportionately large amounts of carbohydrates and fats are called 
non-nitrogenous foods. 
Digestible Nutrients. Not all of each of the food materials in feeds is digestible. The 
digestible portions of feeds are called digestible nutrients. In 100 pounds of corn, .10.3 
pounds is protein, 72.6 pounds is carbohydrates, and 5 pounds is fat. Of these food materials, 
the following amounts are digestible: 7.8 pounds of protein, 66.7 pounds of carbohydrates, 
and 4.3 pounds of fat. In 100 pounds of timothy hay, 5.9 pounds is protein, 74.0 pounds is 
carbohydrates, and 2.5 pounds is fat. Of these food materials the following quantities are 
digestible: 2.8 pounds of protein, 43.4 pounds of carbohydrates, and 1.4 pounds of fat. As 
a rule, the starches and sugars (nitrogen-free extract) are most digestible, the fats and proteins 
rank next, and-the crude fiber is least digestible. Grains have little crude fiber and therefore
-P-A-G-E-57
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 5r 
they have large amounts of digestible matter; while roughage, such as timothy hay, contains 
a large amount of crude fiber, and therefore has a relatively small quantity of digestible matter. 
In the timothy more than half of the carbohydrates is crude fiber, and this accounts for the 
small proportion of digestible matter in the carbohydrates of the hay as compared with that 
in the carbohydrates of corn. 
The table below shows the per cent of each of the digestible nutrients and also the total 
dry matter in some of our farm feeds.

LESSON 39 
BALANCED RATIONS 
The food that is fed daily to an animal is called a ration. When an animal is: working 
hard, there is a heavy tax on the muscles of its body. When it is at rest, there is no such 
strain on the muscles. The idle animal should be fed a lighter ration. If the heavy ration 
that is needed by the working animal is given to the idle animal, the latter will not be able 
to utilize it; and animals thus fed often become sick. Many experiments have been made to 
determine how many pounds of each of the digestible nutrients an animal should receive in 
its daily ration, but the problem cannot be very accurately solved. This is because the amount 
needed is influenced by so many conditions. A few of these are the age of the animal, tem- 
perature under which it is kept, and the condition and purpose of the animal. [Experts have 
arranged in tables the digestible nutrients necessary for all animals of various ages and condi- 
tions. These tables are called feeding standards. These standards serve as guides to intelli- 
gent practice. Every successful feeder must study his animals and the feed which he has 
available, and learn to use such a ration at such a time as will net him the largest returns 
possible with the least possible outlay of money and labor. 
When all the digestible nutrients in feedstuffs are combined in the proportions that pro- 
duce the best results, we have what is called a balanced ration.. The proper balance for the 
ration depends largely on what the animal does and the kind of animal that it is. A balanced 
ration for a cow giving milk would not be balanced if she were being fattened for the market. 
A balanced ration for a sheep would not be a balanced ration for a horse. 
The proportion of digestible protein to digestible carbohydrates and fat is called the 
nutritive ratio. When the proportion of protein is large, the nutritive ratio is said to be 
narrow; when the proportion is small, the ratio is said to be wide; and when the proportion 
is medium, the ratio is said to be medium. 
To determine the nutritive ratio of a feed we multiply the digestible fat by 2.25, because 
(Lesson 38) fat will produce 2.25 times as much heat as carbohydrates. The sum of this 
product and the digestible carbohydrates in the food is divided by the digestible protein in 
the food and the quotient is placed as the second term in a ratio with 1 as the first term. For 
example, — one pound of corn contains the following digestible nutrients : — 
Protein .078 
Carbohydrates .668 
Fat 043 
For convenience in figuring a hundred pounds of corn is taken. This gives 7.8 digestible 
protein, 66.8 digestible carbohydrates, and 4.3 digestible fat. 
4.3 X 2.25 = 9.7 (carbohydrate equivalent of fat) 
66.8 + 9.7. = 76.5 (carbohydrates and fat equivalent) 
76.5+7.8 = 9.8 
The nutritive ratio is 1:9.8. 
Refer to Lesson 38 and calculate the nutritive ratio of a ration consisting of 4 pounds of 
oats, 2 pounds of corn meal, and 20 pounds of alfalfa.

HAY 
The grasses, clovers, cowpeas, soy beans, and vetches are the most common plants used 
for hay. The grasses most commonly grown for forage are timothy, orchard grass, redtop, 
millet, and blue grass. 
Grasses. Timothy grows best on clay and loam soils. It is generally sown at the rate 
of about 15 pounds per acre with wheat or rye in the fall. After the grain crop is harvested 
the following summer, the timothy plants make a rapid growth. The following year the tim- 
othy is ready to be cut for hay. When the seed is sown alone in the fall, it sometimes makes a 
crop the next year. Timothy hay is most valuable for feeding horses. Orchard grass seed 
should be sown in autumn or spring at the rate of two bushels per acre. This grass should 
not be sown with timothy, as it matures earlier. Redtop does best on a soil that is rich and 
moist, but will grow on soils that are too wet and too poor to produce good timothy. It is one 
of the best grasses for winter and spring grazing, and should be used on the damp places in 
every pasture. 
Clover. The red, mammoth, crimson, alsike, white, and sweet are the clovers most 
generally grown. Red clover, one of the most widely grown of the clovers, requires for its 
successful growth a well-drained rich soil that is free from acid. The seed is sown with grain 
in the spring at the rate of a bushel to six or eight acres. If the season is good, it will produce 
some fall pasture and a hay crop the following summer. The second cutting is often used for 
seed. Red clover and orchard grass may be sown together, as the time of maturing of both is 
about the same. Mammoth clover is larger than the red and matures about one month later. 
This clover matures about the same time as timothy and is often sown withit. Mammoth clover 
produces but one crop in a season. It is not so good for horses as the red, because of fuzz on 
the stems, which causes the hay to be dusty. Very dusty hay should be sprinkled with water 
before it is fed to horses. Crimson clover is an annual that was introduced into this country 
from Europe. It will not stand the cold winters of the Northern States, hence is not exten- 
sively grown north of the Ohio River. It is used more for pasture and crop manure than for 
hay. This clover grows best on loose, sandy loam soils. The seed is sown at the rate of 20 
pounds per acre. Alsike clover is the best of the clovers for wet, acid soils. It is smaller than 
the red and is less subject to disease and injury by root borers. It produces one crop a 
season but lives for many years. Alsike and timothy are frequently sown together for a hay 
crop. 
Alfalfa. Alfalfa is said to be the oldest hay plant now grown. It is a native of Western 
Asia, and was brought into the United States in 1854 from Chile. It grows best on a well- 
drained, sandy soil; but may be successfully grown on nearly every kind of soil that is well 
drained. Failures of alfalfa are usually due to drought, weeds, or a lack of manure, lime, or 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Alfalfa is often sown with a nurse crop, but this plan is not likely 
to be successful unless the crop is cut early for hay. Experiments in nearly all the states 
east of Colorado have shown that it is best to sow it in late summer or early fall on land that 
was plowed in the spring and kept free from weeds by harrowing. This plan affords cppor- 
tunity for fertilizing or liming in the spring when the ground is plowed. The seed should 
be sown at the rate of 20 to 25 pounds per acre. Alfalfa when properly started will live for 
many years. Ina good season three or four crops of hay can be cut from the same field.

Cowpeas. The cowpea has been grown in the Southern States for over a century. In 
recent years it has been grown in many of the Northern States. Cowpeas, in their relationship 
and habit of growth, are really beans and not peas, as the name would indicate. They are 
annuals and are closely related to the lima bean of our gardens. The cowpea, like all other 
leguminous plants, is a good soil builder, especially when plowed under in the green state. 
The seed may be sown in rows 28 to 32 inches apart, using 2 to 3 pecks per acre. This plan 
permits cultivation of the plants. The cultivation should be carried on when the dew is off, 
to prevent injury to the leaves. The seed can also be drilled solid, using 6 to 8 pecks per acre. 
The black cowpea is a good variety for hay. 
Soy Bean. The soy bean, a native of Japan, is very extensively grown in this country. 
The time and method of sowing and cultivation are about the same as for cowpeas. When 
drilled in rows so it can be cultivated, a half bushel of seed is required per acre. If sown broad- 
cast, a bushel of seed per acre is used. The crop is cut for hay when the pods are about two 
thirds grown. When seed is desired, cut or pull the plants when the first pods begin to open, 
and thrash as soon as dry enough.

BEEF CATTLE 
The best breeds of cattle are 
descended from the wild ox of 
Asia and Europe, and have 
attained their present values 
through careful breeding. 
Cattle have been bred for 
two distinct purposes, — for beef 
and for milk. Each of these 
products demands a_ special 
breed, and so there are beef 
and dairy cattle. The pro- 
duction of either of these prod- 
ucts has lessened the value of 
the animal as a producer of the 
other. The production of milk 
has been attained at the sacrifice 
of flesh, and the cow that puts on A Beer Cow. 
meat does so at a sacrifice of her 
milking qualities. In this way the breeds have become distinct in structure, habits, and 
keeping qualities. 
The modern facilities for handling meats in cold storage have developed the industry of 
beef cattle to a remarkable degree. Cattle may be slaughtered, their meat stored for some 
time on ice, and finally shipped across the ocean without any deterioration. The beef breeds 
are built rather heavy, on square, stocky lines. The outline of the body is a rectangle. The 
body is well rounded, the bones not protruding, and the flesh tender. The aim of all beef- 
cattle raisers is to produce animals that will give the greatest amount of flesh with the smallest 
amount of food. 
Hereford and Aberdeen Angus. The principal breeds of beef cattle found in the United 
States are Hereford and Aberdeen Angus. The Herefords are distinctly a beef breed. They 
are square in shape, solid in structure, and vigorous in health. They grow rapidly, mature 
early, and are easily fattened. The color of the Hereford is usually red and the animals are 
large, weighing as much as 1600 pounds. They can live well under ordinary conditions. 
The Aberdeen Angus is a Scotch breed. The color is shiny black, and the animals possess no 
horns. They are large, fatten easily, and are vigorous of body. .They are easily kept, as 
they can adapt themselves to a variety of conditions. As a beef type, many authorities 
place the Aberdeen Angus in the lead. 
Some cows, besides producing good beef, give a full supply of milk and are sometimes 
classed as dual or general purpose cows. Cows of this type are very popular with the small 
farmer, as they supply sufficient milk for home use and also give meat for the table. They 
are generally used as milk cows for some years and then killed for beef. 
Shorthorn and Polled Durham. The Shorthorns and Polled Durham breeds are suitable 
for both milk and meat. The Shorthorn cow combines good dairy qualities with good beef-

  56 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
producing qualities. The breed lives and thrives in all places except very high lands. The 
back of the Shorthorn is level from head to tail and its colors are red and white mixed. The 
cow is a quiet animal and easily kept. The milk is of good quality and the cow fattens easily. 
The Polled Durham is a hornless variety of the Shorthorn and has been bred in the Mis- 
sissippi Valley. The breed originated in this country and is better for beef than it is for milk.

LESSON 42 
DAIRY CATTLE 
Dairy cattle are of different 
breeds from those of beef cattle. 
The milk or dairy cow shows a 
distinct wedge-shaped body when 
seen from the front, side, or 
rear. The line of the back in- 
stead of being straight and well- 
fleshed as in the beef cow is 
crooked and the hip bones are 
especially prominent. The udder 
of the dairy cow is, of course, the 
most important feature, as the 
cow is bred for milk and this 
organ is the milk receptacle. 
The udder should be full but not 
fatty, and should be strongly at- 
tached to the body behind and 
should extend well forward. It should be large, as the larger it is the greater its capacity 
for holding milk. The skin of the milk cow should be fine in texture, soft, and pliable. The 
hair should also be fine and smooth. 
Because the energy of this animal goes toward producing milk, its flesh is of little value 
as meat. A beef cow gives little milk, and a milk cow does not readily put on flesh. As soon 
as a dairy cow begins to put on meat, she loses in the quality and quantity of milk she produces. 
Better milk cows may be obtained by breeding the best cows to full-bred bulls of dairy breeds. 
Only the best calves should be saved for future breeding purposes. The exact value of any 
cow in a herd may be obtained by carefully weighing the milk when given and testing it for 
butter fats from time to time. Care should be taken that milk cows do not get too fat or too 
angular. Good food, clean water, and proper stabling will protect the herd and lessen the 
chances of failure. : 
Jersey. This breed takes its name from the island of Jersey, from which its ancestors 
came. These cows produce milk that is very rich in butter fat. About two gallons of Jersey 
milk will make a pound of butter, and the milk is sometimes so rich that it has to be diluted 
before the calves can use it. The Jerseys are small, nervous, and delicate. The breed is very 
adaptive, that is, mixes well with other breeds. The color of the cow varies from brown to 
deep black, and there are many Jerseys that are yellow and tan colored. Color has ceased 
to be a distinctive mark of this breed. The Jerseys are large feeders and will stand rich 
fodder. When they have passed the milk-giving stage, they are of little use for other 
purposes. 
Guernsey. The origin of this breed is very like that of the Jersey; both breeds probably 
descended from Normandy ancestors. The Guernseys are very closely allied to the Jerseys 
in their characteristics. They are light yellow in color with considerable white, and the skin 
is orange-colored. They give rich milk, and stand next to the Jerseys as butter producers.

Holstein. This is one of the oldest milk breeds. There were two distinct breeds of 
Holsteins in olden times, one a pure black breed, the other a white. The mixing of these two 
breeds has given the present race of Holsteins found in this country. The Holsteins have 
strong constitutions, and are heavy feeders. They produce more milk than any breeds; 
the quality of the milk produced is not as good as that of the Jersey or Guernsey. 
Ayrshire. This breed comes from the county of Ayr in Scotland. The breed is one of 
the youngest of the well-established dairy breeds. The cows are not large, but they give a 
fair supply of milk. Their meat is of good quality.

LESSON 43 
MILK AND ITS PRODUCTS 
Milk is made up of water, fat, casein, milk sugar, 
and salts. Water is present in milk in a large pro- 
portion, but it is not the most important part. The 
water of the milk is used to dissolve the salts and 
to hold the fats and casein in suspension. The fat 
found in milk is used in the making of butter. The 
casein, which is the curd in sour milk, is the part 
from which cheese is made. The milk of the cow 
gives the young calf all the food substances for rapid 
growth, the casein furnishing muscles, and the fat 
giving warmth and energy. 
Milk requires a great deal of care, as it is very 
susceptible to odors and germs. If milk be left in 
a room with any strong-smelling foods, as fish or 
onions, it will readily take up the odors and become 
very distasteful. Butter made from milk so exposed 
has a very unpleasant taste. Too much care cannot 
be taken to keep the milk clean and free from contami- 
nation of all kinds. The food sometimes affects the 
milk of acow. A cow fed upon clean, wholesome food 
and given a clean, well-drained pasture for grazing will 
produce sweet, rich milk. Strong-smelling herbs should A CREAM’ SEPARATOR. 
not be allowed in the pasture. 
The butter fat of the milk floats about in small globules in the milk itself. These glob- 
ules are very small. Cream is made up of globules of butter fat. Being lighter than the milk, 
they float on the surface when the milk is allowed to stand. There are two ways to separate 
the fat or cream from the rest of the milk.’ The old method is to allow the milk to set in 
pans and dishes until thick cream is formed at the top. When all the cream is formed, it is 
skimmed off and used to make butter. The later process is to use a cream separator. The 
separator is a machine so arranged that the milk may be rapidly rotated in a large receptacle. 
As the milk is rotated very rapidly, the heavier or watery particles fly to the sides, and the 
cream, which is lighter, remains in the middle. Spouts arranged upon the sides and in the 
center take each of these products into separate cans or dishes. Thus separated or skim milk 
runs out at one spout and almost pure cream runs out at the other. The advantage of the 
separator over the older method is very marked. The cream separator extracts as high as 
98 per cent of the cream, while the old method obtained only 80 per cent. By the older method, 
the milk must stand for some time before the cream is formed, and the liability of the milk 
to absorb disagreeable odors is very great. The cream derived from the separator is much 
more uniform than that obtained by setting. ‘ 
When the cream has ripened, it is placed in a churn to make butter. The object of churn- 
ing is to break up the envelopes around the butter globules. After a while the small butter 
globules adhere together and make butter grains. The liquid part of the milk, called butter-

-P-A-G-E-66
  60 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
milk, is drained off. After the buttermilk has been removed, fresh water is added and the 
churning continued. This water is withdrawn and a new supply added several times and the 
churning is continued until the butter is of the right consistency. The water is used to 
4 h i Cen wash away all the milk that surrounds the butter 
      grains. After the butter is removed from the churn 
it is worked by hand or machinery to press the grains 
into solid cakes of butter. 
There are many kinds of churns on the market, but 
they all act on the same principle. A dashing motion of 
any kind that will break up the fat globules is the main 
thing for which a churn is used. Butter fat placed in an 
ordinary bottle and violently tossed about will in time 
form butter. The commercial churn is, of course, espe- 
cially built to do this work in the easiest possible way. 
Some churns work by hand, while others may be run by 
an engine or some other source of power. 
Butter is as sensitive as milk to odors and germs of 
many kinds. For this reason, when handling it, the hands 
should be clean and every vessel into which the butter is 
put should be thoroughly cleansed and sterilized. Too 
much working and too high a temperature will ruin but- 
ter. Salt is added to butter to preserve it and to give it a required flavor. Salting should 
take place when first the grains are removed from the churn. The salt should be thoroughly 
mixed with the butter or else the product will be streaked and will not bring a good price in 
the market. After the salt is added, the butter should stand for a time before final making is 
begun. ¢ 
Butter prepared for the market should have a rich straw color and a good flavor. It 
should be firm and not greasy. It should be protected by being wrapped in good, slightly 
oiled paper. An attractive pound of butter will find a more ready sale than an unattractive one. 
There are many kinds of cheese made from milk. They differ from each other in flavor 
and appearance. These differences are due to different foods given the cows and to the dif- 
ferent methods of curing and ripening the cheese. In making cheese, the new milk is strained 
and run into large vessels that can be heated or cooled as the cheese maker desires. After 
the milk is placed in the vessel and the required temperature is obtained, rennet is added. 
This product, derived from the stomach of the calf, causes the casein to coagulate or curdle. 
Curdling begins at once and the curds appear in the vessel in solid masses. When they are 
formed sufficiently, they are cut out with a knife. The liquid portion of the milk with the curds 
is called whey, and is run out of the vessel by means of a spout or tap. The curd mass is 
heaped up and allowed to drain that all the whey may escape. Salt is next mixed thoroughly 
with the curd, and it is then cut into small pieces by a mill and placed on a cheese form. Great 
pressure is exerted upon these forms until the cheese is made firm and free from whey. Cheeses 
are made from goat’s milk as well as from that of cows. Some fancy cheeses are allowed to 
ripen underground in limestone caves. Age gives to some cheeses a much-desired flavor. 
Cheese making is very difficult and is not now undertaken by farmers as it used to be before 
modern invention perfected machines to make the product more rapidly and more easily. 
Large cheese factories make much of the product now found in our markets.

THE HOUSING AND CARE OF COWS 
The barns in which cows are 
housed should be warm, well 
ventilated, well ‘drained, and 
strongly built. They should be 
free from drafts, as cows are 
very liable to catch cold if air 
blows in upon them. They 
should be so placed that they 
will get as much of the winter 
sun as possible. When cows are 
fastened up, they should have 
plenty of room to lie down and 
to move about. Some of our 
best cows are kept in box stalls, 
as our thoroughbred horses are. 
The light should never enter 
the barn so that it will fall 
directly in the eyes of the cows. 
Windows placed well toward the ceiling will be found to give the best light and also best 
ventilation. The gutters back of the cows should be so arranged that the refuse may be 
easily removed and the floors flushed with little trouble. All of the stanchions or other fas- 
tenings should be as smooth and clean as it is possible to make them. The cow’s bed should 
be well attended to and should consist of the best straw. 
One of the most dreaded diseases prevalent among our cows is tuberculosis. This 
disease is caused by poor attention to the health of our cows. Insufficient light, no ventila- 
tion, poor drainage, and too close herding are the principal causes of this disease. Sensible 
feeding and right care will obviate trouble from many diseases that are now lowering the value 
of our cows. 
The cow should be treated with kindness and consideration. Rough handling will ruin 
them. There is no good reason why cows should not be curried as often as our horses are. 
Such a practice will more than repay for itself. At least, they should be brushed and washed 
frequently. Cows that live in dirty surroundings become matted with the refuse of the stable 
and cannot give as good returns as they would with proper care. Plenty of exercise should 
be allowed; both milk and beef are improved by fresh air-and exercise. 
Find a farmer in your neighborhood who treats his dairy cattle well, and make a study 
of his methods. Write a short description of his methods.

CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 
A horse should be well fed, well 
housed, and well cleaned. An animal 
that has proved to be so valuable to 
man deserves the best of care and atten- 
tion. If proper shelter and good food be 
given the horse, the work to be done can 
be more easily accomplished. Too many 
farmers keep their faithful horses in poorly 
built sheds that have little or no conven- 
iences, often drafty and ill-drained. 
The first care of the farmer should 
be given toward properly stabling his 
horse. The stable should be well built, 
light, well ventilated, and warm. Drains 
should be arranged so that all offensive 
odors may be removed. All drainage 
should lead to some receptacle on the 
outside of the barn that can be covered and protected from the weather. Drafts should 
be carefully excluded from the barn, as a horse is susceptible to even the lightest draft. 
A horse will not catch cold in a field, however cold the weather may be, but in a building where 
the wind blows in through crevices he will easily take cold. The light in the stable should be 
good but not strong. The eyesight of the horse is very keen, and a poorly lighted stable will 
cause a horse to shy when he gets into the open day. The bedding used in the stall should 
be carefully cleaned every morning and all the wet portions removed. Only good straw 
should be used, and the stable should be flushed with water after the bedding is taken out. 
If a horse is to be kept in good health, he should be-thoroughly cleaned at least once a day, 
preferably in the morning when the stable is cleaned. A stiff brush and currycomb should 
be used. Besides removing all dirt and opening the pores of the skin, currying assists the 
flow of blood and thus brings new nourishment to the skin and ‘hair. The feet of the horse 
should be carefully washed and cleaned every day. Many farmers allow their horses to 
stand in stalls until the hoofs are caked up with the refuse of the stable. This is very bad 
for the horse and causes many foot troubles. All muck and refuse should be carefully re- 
moved from the frog of the foot and the shoes kept in good condition. In the city, care 
must be exercised to see that the shoes are in perfect condition, as a horse’s foot will soon 
split and become diseased if neglected. 
A horse ought to be regularly fed. The kind of food and the times for feeding depend 
somewhat on the kind of horse and the kind of work he has to do. The horse has a small 
stomach and should therefore be fed small quantities and frequently. Early morning feeding 
is very important. The best feed for the working horse is oats. This grain has a high nutri- 
tive value. Care should be taken not to feed grains that will produce fat at the expense of 
muscle. Especially should care be taken in this regard in summer, when the heat-producing 
feeds are not necessary. Oats, corn, and other grains take the place in a horse’s diet occupied

by meats in that of man. Roughage, that is, hay or grass, should be given with the oats, as 
it does for a horse what vegetables do for man. Grain should be crushed and mixed with finely 
ground hay. If the whole mass is moistened with water, it will be appetizing and easily 
digested. 
As much care should be taken to relieve the horse of over-exertion as is possible. The 
harness should be so adjusted that,the maximum amount of drawing power may be obtained 
from the horse. Horses should never be stopped in drawing a heavy load up hill except for 
rest, and the team should be placed at that time so that there will be the least weight drag- 
ging upon the animals. High checking, besides being extremely hurtful, is also a very waste- 
ful way of using the horse. No horse can give his full strength to his task when his head is 
so highly checked that he is in pain. There is no more graceful position in which a horse holds 
his head than that naturally assumed when he is free. High checking and other atrocious 
ways of handling this faithful animal only show the vast ignorance of the horseman. Another 
very fashionable manner of treating the horse is the docking of the tail. Sometimes this 
method of torture is carried to an extreme. The tail of the horse is one of his means of de- 
fense. Flies are the most tormenting enemies of the horse. Their bites are often poisonous 
and always irritating. The tail is used expressly for the purpose of ridding the animal of 
these pests. If it is docked, flies cannot be driven from the body and the horse will suffer in 
consequence. 
In treating a horse, firmness and kindness are the two essential qualities. Never let a 
horse conquer you, but have him understand you are the master. This can easily be done 
without resort to cruelty of any kind. If obedience is taught early, the horse will never give 
any serious trouble. The best way to train a horse is to train yourself; keep control of your 
own temper and never lose your self-control. Patience is the cardinal virtue in overcoming 
opposition upon the part of your horse. A good horseman seldom strikes his horse with a 
whip or other instrument of torture. The human voice is sufficient in most cases to bring 
about desired results. 
Everything you do about a horse may easily be associated with your tone of voice. Very 
soon the animal comes to understand what you want and how you want him to do it. It is 
surprising how quickly a horse understands every tone of your voice. Cases of shyness may 
often be overcome by a simple encouraging word. Shyness is generally due to nervousness 
and unfamiliarity with some object. If the horse is allowed to examine that which has fright- 
ened him, the shyness soon disappears. 
If the right start is made, there will be little of this trouble. A horse should never be 
frightened. The horse is timid and sensitive, and we should always remember it. If a horse 
has confidence in you, he will work faithfully and give you little trouble.

BREEDS OF HOGS 
The hog is a descendant of the wild boar of Europe and Asia. In many places the wild 
hog is still found. It is an active and powerful animal, roaming about in well-wooded places, 
subsisting upon fruits, grasses, and nuts. When very hungry, the animal will eat snakes, 
worms, and sometimes the higher animals. The first domesticated hogs were captured wild 
animals. Careful breeding has eliminated the ferocious nature of these animals and caused 
them to fatten and produce a good quality of meat. 
There are three classes of hogs, based upon size, and there are many examples under each 
class. The principal breeds are the following : — 
Larce BREEDS Mepium Breeps SmaLt BREEDS 
Chester White Poland China Suffolk . 
Tamworth Berkshire Small Yorkshire 
Improved Yorkshire Duroc-Jersey Victoria 
Cheshire 
Chester White. The Chester White 
breed is of American origin, being de- 
veloped in Chester County, Pennsylvania. 
As its name implies, the breed is pure 
white in color. The head of this animal 
is short, with long thin ears pointing for- 
ward. The Chester White is the largest 
of any of the breeds. These hogs are es- 
pecially adapted for corn feeding and fat- 
ten very rapidly. They are quiet, lazy, 
and not suited to warm climates. 
A CHESTER WHITE. Poland China. This is also an Amer- 
ican breed. Ohio is the state in which 
it was developed. The breed is a mixture of several other breeds and required careful breed- 
ing to fix the type. The color of the Poland China is black with white spots; either color 
may prevail. The hogs are large, weigh- 
ing sometimes as much as 650 pounds. 
The face is dished, the ears are large, thin, 
and drooping. The Poland China hogs 
are not so good grazers as the Berkshires, 
and do not take so good care of them- 
selves when put to pasture. They are, 
however, very quiet, not excitable, and 
not likely to lose weight. 
Berkshire. This is an English breed. 
Berkshires are probably the most common 
of our hogs. They were first imported in 
1825 and since then have received much A BERKSHIRE,

attention at the hands of swine fanciers. They reach the weight of 600 pounds at maturity 
and generally gain this weight evenly and rapidly. The color of the Berkshires is black with 
white feet, with a small line of white on face and with white tip to tail. The face is short 
and well dished. The ears are erect, thin, and delicate. They are good foragers and easily 
make a living for themselves. 
Duroc-Jersey. The origin of this breed is not known. The color is reddish. The face 
is only slightly dished and the ears not large. The Duroc-Jerseys are among the largest of 
the medium breeds. They are very long-bodied animals and make a great deal of side meat, 
which is by some farmers considered a valuable trait. These hogs are quiet, heavy feeders 
and do well in pastures. They are especially good for Southern conditions.

THE CARE OF HOGS 
The best feed for young pigs during the first few weeks is the mother’s milk. After four 
or five weeks some food in addition to the milk is needed, therefore provision should be made 
to feed some light, muscle-forming food, as skimmed milk with a little meal added. In order 
that the pigs may secure this additional feed, a small run may be made adjoining their pen in 
which trough room is provided. This run should be so arranged that the large pigs cannot 
enter. 
Only clean, wholesome feed should be fed to small pigs and all trough space should be 
kept clean. Feed only as much as the pigs will eat. The sow and pigs should be turned out 
as early as possible in order that they may secure the proper amount of exercise. As soon as 
the grass has a little start they should be given the freedom of the pasture. A pasture furnishes 
the cheapest food on the farm as well as one of the best kinds of feed. If the pigs are given a 
chance to eat as described above, they may be weaned with little difficulty at any time after 
they are eight or ten weeks old. If the sow is doing well, it is usually better to leave the pigs 
with her until they are about twelve or fifteen weeks old. After the pigs are weaned they 
should be carefully and regularly fed, and given access to a good pasture. If pigs are kept 
in good growing condition, the process of fattening will be more readily accomplished. 
  A Turirry Harr Dozen. 
To fatten hogs, it is simply necessary to supply them with plenty of food, as they usually 
have a good appetite and are not easily injured by overfeeding. It is wise, however, to 
change them from one feed to another gradually; that is, when they are being fed all they can 
eat. Do not confine hogs too closely when fattening, as they are more likely to become diseased. 
During the early part of the fattening period considerable green and succulent feed can be 
fed to advantage. Plenty of good pasturage, especially in a field growing legumes, is also de- 
sirable at this time. If one wishes ‘“‘to hog off the corn,” that is, turn the hogs in the field 
without husking the corn, green feed can be provided by sowing rye or rape in the corn at the 
time of last cultivation. By this plan a large amount of green feed will be supplied at a very 
small cost and will be relished by the hogs in connection with the corn. 
In fattening animals of any kind, comfort is an important factor. A good shelter with 
dry bedding should be provided as a sleeping place for hogs. They should always have ac- 
cess to plenty of water.
-P-A-G-E-77
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE FT 
The selection and care of good brood sows are important to the success of the farmer. 
In the first place, a sow of good type and of the breed desired should be selected. If several 
litters of pigs are raised, it is well to have some method of marking young pigs so that when they 
are grown it will be easy to tell from which litter they came. It is desirable to have brood 
sows that will have large litters of pigs. A brood sow from a large litter is more likely to have 
a good number of pigs than one selected from a small litter. If pigs are not marked at birth, 
sows are liable to be selected from small litters as the sow with a small litter feeds her pigs 
better and as a consequence the pigs are usually a little larger and better looking than pigs 
from large litters. 
Brood sows should not be permitted to run with the fattening hogs, for besides being a 
waste of feed, the sows are injured by getting too fat. Brood sows should have the run of the 
pasture with only enough grain to keep them in a good thrifty condition. 
Preventive measures should always be taken to keep off disease. This can be done by 
regular feeding, keeping the pigs in healthful quarters, and by giving them plenty of exercise. 
Pools containing stagnant water should be drained and plenty of fresh, pure water furnished. 
Salt, ashes, and charcoal may occasionally be fed; and a good disinfectant should be placed 
in the slops from time to time. If cholera breaks out in the community, every precaution 
must be taken to prevent the germs being brought to the farm. If the disease gets very close, 
it is well to dispose of all the hogs that are fit to sell unless they have been vaccinated.

BREEDS OF SHEEP 
Sheep are raised either for 
their wool or their meat, called 
mutton. Sheep that are raised 
on the plains in the western part 
of our country have not been bred 
to any distinctive type, while the 
sheep that are raised as farm ani- 
mals have been carefully bred. 
The quality of the wool varies 
greatly in the different classes of 
sheep. The sheep that is bred 
purely for wool produces a very fine quality, while the sheep bred for mutton gives but a 
medium quality of wool. The third general type of sheep is produced for both wool and meat, 
a general purpose class. In this latter type the wool is long and not of as fine a texture as the 
first-named type. 
The chief wool breeds are the American Merino, Rambouillet, Delaine Merino, and 
Cheviot. The leading mutton breeds are Southdown, Horned Dorset, Shropshire, and Hamp- 
shire. The Leicester, Cotswold, and Lincoln breeds are general purpose sheep. 
The Merino. This is an important Spanish breed of sheep. The wool from this’breed 
is used in every country of the world. The sheep weigh, when mature, from 100 to 130 pounds. 
They are fully covered with wool, down to the tips of the nose, and have a wrinkled skin. This 
wrinkled skin has been bred out in the Delaine. The color of the Merinos varies much in 
shade. 
Southdown. This breed comes from southern England. The mutton of the Southdown 
sheep is the best on the market. The animals are hardy, easily kept and fattened, and the 
wool is of good average quality. Next to the Merino, the Southdown is the most widely 
raised sheep in the United States. 
Cotswold. This is one of the oldest breeds of sheep. It is an English breed and comes 
from the southwestern hills of England. The color is white, the face and head are smooth, with 
the exception of a curly forelock, and the legs below the knees are white or grayish. The Cots- 
wold ranks among the large breeds, the sheep weighing as much as 300 pounds.

LESSON 51 
INSECT PESTS 
Most insect pests are parasites. A parasite is an organism which obtains its food and 
lodging of another organism called host without rendering it any service. A permanent para- 
site passes its entire life in one host, a good example being the common scab found on so 
many farm animals. The intermittent parasite is one that visits the host for nourishment, 
as the fly and the flea. 
Most of the pests that attack our animals are insect parasites. The life growth of these 
pests is very interesting. Most of them pass through the four stages of life that are char- 
acteristic of all true insects. First there is the egg, which in a short space of time hatches 
into the larva. It is during this larval stage of the insect’s life that most of its feeding is done. 
After a short while the larva passes into a quiescent stage called the pupa. In this stage 
many life changes go on, and most insects pass from the pupal stage entirely changed in struc- 
ture and habits. The last stage is that of the full-grown insect and is called the adult period 
of life. 
Botfly. This is the commonly known botfly of the horse. It is a species of gadfly of 
which the larva is called a bot. The fly is about the size of a small honeybee, and is yellowish 
brown in color. The eggs are laid on the hairs of the fore limbs and breast of the horse. The 
larve crawl over the skin, producing a tickling sensation. The horse licks the affected parts 
for relief and gets the larve into the mouth and thence to the stomach. A larva attaches 
itself to the pyloric end of the stomach and to the duodenum by two hooklets. The larva 
develops here for about ten months, passes out of the host, and burrows into the ground, where 
an earthy cocoon is formed. Six or eight weeks is passed in the pupa stage when the adult 
appears. The entire life cycle occurs in about twelve months. Eggs are deposited from 
June to October. Serious injury to the host is seldom inflicted. 
Botfly of Cattle. The larve of this fly are called grubs or warbles. The fly is large 
_and black. The female deposits her eggs on the hair around the heels of the cattle, attaching 
them by a cement-like substance. On licking the affected parts, the animal gets the parasite 
in its mouth, whence it passes to the esophagus, where it remains about four months. At the 
end of this time the parasite migrates to beneath the skin. Small tumors are formed by these 
pests, and the tumors develop as the larve grow. The larve leave the tumors from March 
to May, usually in the morning. The pupal stage is passed in the ground, and the life cycle 
occupies about twelve months. The pests cause a commercial loss by damaging the hides. 
Hog Louse. The eggs of lice, called nits, are white and oval. They are generally 
cemented to the hairs of swine. Their presence may be told by an itching and a desire of 
the hog to lick the infected parts. When the hog cannot reach the parts where the lice are, 
rubbing against some object, as a post or the corner of the stable, brings relief. The head of 
the hog louse is long, slender, and conical with three hairs on each side. The thorax is short. 
Hog lice are most abundant in the hollow back of the hog’s ears. 
Sheep Tick. The sheep tick passes its whole life on its host. Its head is small and 
sunken in the thorax, which in turn is slender. The abdomen is large and globular in form. 
The body and legs of this pest are covered with soft short hair and the legs are provided with 
hooklets. The proboscis is strong and long for sucking blood. The parasite lives on blood, 
grease, and the yolk of wool. The female does not lay eggs, but gives birth to young in the

larval stage. Therefore there are but three stages to the life development of these ticks, — 
larval, pupal, and adult. 
Eradication of Insect Pests. Hog lice and sheep ticks can be eradicated by dipping. The. 
coal-tar preparations are efficient insecticides. Another good dip can be made by using 10 
pounds of tobacco stems, 10 pounds of sulphur, and 40 gallons of water. Dipping has proved 
to be an effective method of ridding cattle of the Texas-fever ticks. Lice on horses may be 
killed by a boiled decoction of 4 ounces of stavesacre in a gallon of water. If the weather is 
warm, clip the hair and apply the solution with asponge. Four ounces of quassia chips to 1 gal- 
lon of water may also be used. Repeat in 10 days to kill all the nits. Fleas on dogs may be 
overcome by a bath in a 4 per cent solution of creolin. Clean kennels and dust with sulphur 
or tobacco dust. Formaldehyde gas may be used to rid the kennels of these pests.

LESSON 52 
THE CATTLE TICK \ 
The losses sustained by the Southern States to its cattle 
industry through the spread of Texas fever have been esti- 
mated at $40,000,000 yearly. This disease is spread entirely 
by the cattle tick. Badly infested cattle lose flesh and in 
many cases die. The losses sustained from a depreciation 
of meat value is equal to that of actually diseased cattle. 
Shipment of cattle to various parts of the country have in 
some cases been prohibited on account of the presence of 
these tick pests. ) 
The ticks are related to the spiders. They are small, Gace ance 
oval in form, with eight legs. They are not insects although 
sometimes erroneously so called. The mouth parts are generally somewhat united to form a 
beak. Most ticks live upon other animals, but some use vegetables for their hosts. One of 
the ticks produces the disease known as mange in dogs, horses, and cows. 
The presence of the tick is so detrimental to the raising of good cattle that a very careful 
study has been made of its eradication. There are three ways in which cattle may be freed 
from these parasites. The first of these, used by our government experts, is a direct treatment 
by means of insecticides of oils and other substances. A rotation of pastures will keep 
down the pests. A third way is to starve the ticks by the removal of all animals from certain 
fenced areas. In the rotation of pastures, the horses and cattle must be kept off the infected 
areas long enough for the ticks to disappear. After the pastures are free from the pests, no 
cattle must be allowed on them until all ticks have been removed from the animals. This 
may be done by dipping or other means. If infested cattle be allowed to enter the cleaned 
pasture, it will become reinfested at once. Feed lots should be separated from the. pastures 
by roads at least ten feet wide, and it is preferable to have two feed lots that may be used 
alternately until the cattle are free from the ticks. The period in which the tick is attached 
to cattle varies from nineteen to forty days, and eggs may be laid and new ticks infest the 
animals before the old ones are totally removed unless feeding lots are changed. - If the animals 
are removed to the second feed lot, at the end of twenty days it is unlikely that they will become 
reinfested. 
After the cattle are put in the free fields, the lots should be immediately plowed and 
thoroughly cultivated. Fence corners and any place not reached by the plow should be 
sprayed with kerosene or crude oil of some kind. By keeping cattle upon cultivated land until 
the following spring, the infested area becomes free of pests through their starvation.

LESSON 54 
SELECTION OF MEAT ANIMALS 
Health is the first consideration in the selection of animals to be slaughtered. It makes 
no difference how fat an animal may be or how good its form, if its health is not good, the meat 
will not have the desired flavor. If the animal is suffering from any disease, the meat will not 
be a wholesome food. Animals are often killed that are infected with serious diseases and 
offered for sale in the markets. Such animals should never be bought for meat, for, however 
incipient the disease may be, it is always dangerous to take any risk of infection. ‘Tuberculosis 
in cows, cholera in hogs, and other diseases of harmful nature are sometimes not infectious to 
man in their early stages; but the danger comes in not knowing exactly how far the disease 
has advanced. It is always best to destroy a meat animal that has been found to have any 
disease harmful to man. Bruises also have a harmful effect upon meats, although the effect 
is generally local. A sudden rise in temperature just previous to slaughtering causes the meat 
to become undesirable. 
First-class meat cannot be obtained from animals that are poor in flesh. The fatter 
an animal is, within reasonable limits, the juicier the meat will be. An animal that is losing 
flesh should not be killed for meat, as the muscle fibers are shrinking and contain too little 
water to make the meat palatable. An animal that is gaining flesh is always desired for 
slaughtering purposes. . 
Poorly bred stock seldom gives good meat. Scrub stock is never profitable for any 
purpose. Fine bones, soft hair, mellow flesh, are good points by which to judge the qual- 
ity of meat of the animal. The care of the stock has also a very marked effect upon the 
quality of the meat. Animals that are properly fed and housed produce meat of a higher 
grade to those ill fed and ill housed. 
The age at which the animal is killed affects the value of its meat. Meat from older 
animals is more likely to be tough than that from younger ones. "Too young an animal gives 
meat that lacks flavor and is watery in its substance. An exact age limit for killing cannot 
be given; but a little experience will determine when any class of animals should be killed for 
meat. Cattle are generally fit for beef between the ages of 18 and 20 months if properly fed. 
Meat from animals as young as this lacks something in flavor. If cattle are killed between 
the 30th and 4oth month, the meat will be better, although the killing may take place at any 
time between the extremes of these dates if the cattle are well fed and well tended. A calf 
should not be used for veal under 6 weeks of age, and it will be better if killed at the end of 
the roth week. Hogs may be used at any age after 6 weeks, but the most profitable time is 
between the 8th and 12th month. Sheep may be used when 3 months old and at any time 
thereafter up to the end of the second year.

LOCATION OF MEAT CUTS 
In cutting up meat, the 
farmer should have a_ small 
curved knife; a steak knife, 
about twelve inches long; a 
good 26-inch saw and an 8-inch 
cleaver. An ax may be used in 
place of the cleaver, but will not 
be found as handy or useful. A 
cross section of a large log makes 
the best cutting table, but an 
ordinary table may be used if it is strong enough. All meat should be cut across the grain 
if uniform pieces are desired. The meat should be cut to the bone before the saw is used. 
Beef should not be cut up until the muscles have thoroughly hardened or “‘set.’’ When 
the meat is ready for cutting, divide the carcass into halves, and then cut each of the halves 
into hind and fore quarters along the line S-T. Remove the kidney and suet from the hind 
quarter and cut off the flank along the line N—P. Turn the quarter over and cut off the loin 
along the line O-N. WN is about 2 inches in front of the stifle joint and O is the middle of 
the sacrum. If the cut is made along this line, little or no use need be made of the saw. The 
rump may be cut by following the line R-J, which runs parallel to the backbone. 
In cutting the fore quarter, begin at P, a point about 12 inches down the rib from the 
backbone, and cut along P—X, a point in the armpit. Next cut down between the ribs to M 
and then across the shank to B. Cut the cross ribs from H to X. The prime ribs are taken 
out between the fifth and sixth ribs, counting from the front. This cut is taken out in one 
piece and consists of seven ribs. Cut off the chuck ribs, the remaining five, making the 
division between the first rib and the shoulder bone. Cut off the neck along the line G—H. 
These cuts may be made smaller as desired for table use 
by cutting up into other sections. 
In cutting mutton, the carcass is first split into # 
halves and then the flank and breast are cut off along the 
line ABCD. Cut the leg along line 4-K. The leg of 
mutton is generally used whole, although it is sometimes 
cut up into steaks. The line, which is used for chops, may 
be cut by following line E-B. Chops should be cut one rib thick. To cut the rack, follow 
line F-C. The shoulder is cut along the lines G-H and J—J. To cut the plate and shank, 
follow the line B-K. The breast and 
flank are used for stews and the neck and 
shank for soups. 
Pork should be cut as soon as it has 
cooled and not allowed to become set, as 
beef or mutton. The carcass should first 
be split to aid cooling and then the head

The shoulders should be cut off between the fourth and fifth ribs. Cut off the hams about 
two inches in front of the pelvic bones. Split the hams and trim them smoothly. The feet 
may be removed by sawing off about two inches above the hock joints. Remove the loin and 
spare rib, leaving the lean meat, which may be used for fresh chops or for roasting. All meat 
cut from ribs should be separated as closely to the ribs as possible. Cut the side lengthwise 
into three evenly sized strips for smoking. If the sides are 
to be cured instead of smoked, they should be cut into two 
pieces instead of three. The upper third, called the back 
strip, is used for salt pork or lard, and the lower two-thirds, 
called the bacon strip, is used for bacon. In cutting up 
pork, the edges should always be trimmed square and the 
scraggy portions removed for sausage or lard. The ribs 
and neck bones should be taken out of the shoulder. The hams, shoulders, and bacon are 
cured or smoked; the loin is used fresh; and the snout, feet, and ears pickled. The head is 
sometimes boiled for headcheese. 
The class should visit farms when animals are being butchered. A study of living ani- 
mals also should be made to locate the cuts of meat and to become familiar with the animal 
structure so that the various parts used for food may easily be recognized.

have placed its use within the means of every farmer. 
Concrete may be used for many purposes about the farm. Foundations to the farm 
buildings are often made of this substance and are found to be cheap and lasting. Walks 
about the house may be made of concrete. Silos are frequently built of this substance and 
fence posts are found to be very much more lasting when built of concrete than when built of 
wood. The floors of the milk rooms and stables, in fact all places that need to be frequently 
cleaned by flushing, are more durable and easier to handle if built of concrete. 
The materials necessary for the making of concrete are sand, gravel or crushed rock, and 
cement. The sand used should be coarse and clean. Varying sizes in the grains of sand used 
give strength to the concrete. All dirt should carefully be removed from the sand as this 
often causes failure in making durable concrete. A small amount of clay in the sand will 
not do any harm, providing it is not in lumps. 
In the use of gravel all pebbles whose diameter is greater than one inch should be dis- 
carded. There should be no decayed stones in the gravel and no dirt. The best crushed 
stone to use is that which is clean and hard. The stone should be in angular fragments that 
the cement may more solidly adhere to it, and they should not be larger than one inch in diam- 
eter. Trap, granite, and limestone are the best to use for this purpose. All dust should be 
removed from the stone. 
There are two kinds of cement in the market that are generally used for the making of 
concrete, — the Portland and the natural. Portland cement is a mixture of about one fourth 
clay and three fourths limestone. These two minerals are ground to fine powder, thoroughly 
mixed, and then heated in ovens until hard clinkers are formed. The clinkers are then ground 
into fine dust. Natural cement is a product derived directly from a natural cement rock. 
It is manufactured in much the same way as Portland cement. On account of its cheapness 
and ease of handling, Portland cement is generally employed in making concrete. The cement 
can be bought in any local market and is not at all expensive. 
In making concrete it is necessary to build a mixing board. The size of this board will 
vary with the amount of concrete needed and the labor employed. A level platform is erected 
near the place where the concrete is to be used. This platform is often portable and is moved 
about from place to place as the need arises. For two men employed in mixing the concrete, 
the board should be at least 8 by 12 feet; for four men it should be 14 by 14 feet. It should 
be built of matched boards and have sides about 4 inches high to keep the concrete from running 
over. c 
The tools necessary are very simple. A shovel of the short-handled “paddy” type, 
No. 3, should be used. Wheelbarrows to carry the ingredients and the finished products are 
necessary, and a good measuring box to get the exact proportions of gravel, sand, and cement. 
The varying quality of the ingredients used call for different proportions in making the 
concrete. If unscreened “bank-run” gravel is employed, the proportions should be 1 part 
of cement to 4 parts of gravel. For crushed rock or screened gravel, 1 part of cement, 2 parts
-P-A-G-E-89
PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 83 
of sand, and 4 parts of rock or gravel should be employed. The amount of water necessary 
in mixing cannot be fixed exactly, as the amount of moisture in the sand, gravel, or stone varies 
so much with weather conditions. Sufficient water, however, should be used for the concrete 
to be wet enough, when the mixing is complete, to tremble under a blow from the shovel and 
to run easily into the molds that are to be used. This amount of water will cause a rich mortar 
to form on the outside of the mold after the form is removed from the concrete. 
To use concrete in building structures it is necessary to make molds of the desired shape 
in which the concrete is wanted when finished. These molds are generally made of wood and 
oiled or soaped where the concrete is to touch them. This prevents the cement and other 
ingredients from adhering to the sides of the molds. The molds should be laid flat, filled 
evenly, and allowed to stand until the concrete has thoroughly hardened. After this hard- 
ness is reached, the molds are removed in sections and the concrete block is ready for use. 
One mold, if constructed in sections so that it may be taken apart, may be used over and 
over again.

LOCATION OF FARM BUILDINGS 
Healthfulness of the Home. 
The first thing that should be 
considered about the home is 
healthfulness. No matter how 
beautiful and comfortable a house 
may be, if it is not a healthful 
place in which to live, no one will 
desire to live in it. One who is 
building a new house should select 
a site that will give good drainage, 
ventilation, and plenty of sun- 
shine. If a farm is bought with 
the desire of living upon it, it is 
wise to consider the healthfulness 
etieeranne Batic: Hone of the situation as well as the 
fertility of the soil. 
Drainage. There should be a good slope away from the house, so that the cellar and 
grounds around the house may be dry. The well should be so situated that no surface water 
or seepage from the house, barn, or any other building can get into it and contaminate the 
water. It should be located four times the distance of its depth away from any of the 
outbuildings. It is of the. greatest importance to the health of all in the home that the drink- 
ing water be kept pure. If one finds that he is living in at house where water stands in the 
cellar, and the yard is wet and muddy, he may be sure that the sanitary conditions are not 
good. A system of drainage should be carefully planned and put in place to carry off all 
surplus water. 
Barn and Outbuildings. The barn and other farm buildings should be located back of 
the dwelling house. All buildings should be located a short distance from the road. This 
will give an opportunity to prepare an attractive lawn. The buildings should also be near a 
good gravel driveway that leads from the road to the barn. If a silo is used, it should be at- 
tached to the barn on the side or end where it is most convenient to the feeding stalls. 
All buildings should be placed within a reasonable distance of each other for convenience 
in feeding. If space will permit, they should be located about fifty yards apart in order that 
a fire breaking out in one may not spread to the others: 
  Sketch the plan of the farm buildings that seem to you to present the best features of 
location among the farms found in your neighborhood.

THE THERMOMETER 
The thermometer is an instrument to measure temperature. With an b 
increase of temperature the mercury expands and ascends the tube; with X 
the lowering of temperature the mercury contracts and falls in the tube. 
The scale upon all thermometers is based upon the freezing and boiling | 
temperatures of water. Between these two points scales vary in their 100° t 
divisions. There are two thermometers in common use, the Fahrenheit 
and the Centigrade. In the F. scale the freezing point is marked 32, and 
the boiling point 212, thus making 180 divisions between the freezing point 
and the boiling point. In the C. scale the freezing point is marked 0 and 
the boiling point 100. Thus in the F. scale 180 divisions equal 100 of the 
C. scale; hence 1 C. degree = 2 F. degree, and 1 F. degree = $C. degree. 
To change a Centigrade reading to a Fahrenheit reading use the follow- 
   
  Centigrade Fahrenheit ing formula : —

THE BAROMETER AND HYGROMETER 
The barometer is an instrument to measure the pressure of the air. It consists, 
in its simplest form, of a glass tube closed at one end, filled with mercury and in- 
verted in a cup containing the same liquid. The tube is about 34 inches long. 
When the tube is inverted, the mercury sinks until the weight of the column in the 
glass tube exactly equals the pressure of the air on the mercury in the cup. At 
sea level the height of the mercury in the tube under ordinary conditions stands at 
about 30 inches. Air exerts a pressure of 15 pounds to the square inch, so the 
weight of the mercury left standing in the tube must equal 15 pounds to the 
square inch. If this were not so, what would happen? 
With a change of air pressure the column of mercury will vary in height. The 
greater the air pressure the higher the mercury will stand, so heavy air is spoken 
of as high pressure. Air that is light causes the mercury to stand at a lower 
level, and thus light air is termed low pressure. Areas of high and low pressure 
pass alternately around the world and have much to do with the weather at any 
place as they pass it. Winds, of course, go from a high pressure to a low pressure. 
The barometer now in general use is not as simple an instrument as the above 
description would indicate, but the principle upon which it works is the same. 
The simplest form of hygrometer consists of two thermometers arranged side by 
side on a board. One of the thermometers is kept wet by means of a muslin wick, 
one end of which surrounds the bulb while the other end rests in a cup of water. 
Such a hygrometer is termed a wet and dry-bulb thermometer. 
The work of the hygrometer is to indicate the relative hu- 
midity of the air. When air is thoroughly saturated with vapor, 
evaporation does not take place; when air is dry, evapora- 
tion goes on rapidly. The air at any given temperature can 
hold only a certain amount of moisture, and when that point 
is reached, saturation is said to have taken place. The actual 
amount of water vapor in the air, measured in grains per cubic 
foot, is its absolute humidity. The ratio between the amount 
of water vapor in the air and the amount it could contain under 
the same conditions is its relative humidity. The relative hu- 
midity may be indirectly obtained by measuring the rate of 
evaporation. 
The moisture that is in the muslin wick about the bulb of one of the 
thermometers evaporates as fast as the air takes up the moisture. Evap- 
oration always cools surrounding objects. The faster that evaporation 
takes place, the cooler becomes the bulb and the lower the mercury in that AHS GROMEE. 
thermometer falls. By comparing the reading of the wet-bulb thermom- 
eter with that of the dry-bulb thermometer, which is merely registering the temperature of the 
atmosphere, an idea of the relative humidity may be gained. If both thermometers register 
alike, the air is saturated. The farther apart the readings, the lower the humidity of the 
air.

LESSON 64 
ANIMAL MANURES 
Composition of Manures. The composition of animal manure varies according to the 
condition of the animal producing it, the quality of food upon which the animal is fed, and the 
purpose in feeding. Manure produced by full-grown animals is of greater value than that pro- 
duced by young animals. Animals fed upon hay and straw without grain'yield manure of 
less value than when grain constitutes a part of their rations. Manure made by beef cattle 
while fattening is richer in plant food than that produced by the dairy cow on the ordinary 
dairy rations. The composition of manure is affected by the kind of bedding used and the 
protection that is given it after it is secured. The liquid part of the manure contains a large 
per cent of the nitrogen and potash that was in the food. For this reason a bedding should 
be used that will quickly absorb all the liquid excreted by the animal. Straw is a bedding in 
common use. Shredded corn stover that has been uneaten by animals is most generally used 
in the corn belt. 
Protection of Manure. When cleaning the stables, if the manure is placed out of 
doors it should be protected by a covering. This will prevent the washing away of the potash 
and phosphoric acid and the loss of nitrogen by fermentation. Many farmers haul out the 
manure and place it in piles in the field. When this is done, it gets hot, ferments, and much 
of the nitrogen is lost. A better method would be to allow the manure to remain in the 
stables, providing, plenty of good bedding is used. The tramping causes it to keep moist and 
fermentation is prevented. The greatest protection can be secured by building a covered 
pit with a bottom made water tight by a cement floor. 
Preservation of Manure. Another method of preventing the loss of the important plant 
foods contained in animal manures is by the use of preservatives. Land plaster, acid phos- 
phate, and kainit are the materials most commonly used for this purpose. Land plaster at the 
rate of a pound per day per grown animal, in stables, placed on manure heaps, and in manure 
pits, partially prevents the loss of nitrogen by fermentation. This plaster has the power of 
fixing and retaining the volatile gases. Phosphoric acid is often used on the manure instead of 
land plaster. This is done because the phosphoric acid content of stable manure is too low for 
some soils and the reénforcement by means of acid phosphate is a good practice even if the 
acid had no preservative effect. The use of fifty pounds of acid phosphate to each ton of 
manure will assist materially in preserving the nitrogen, and the gain in the phosphoric acid 
content will repay all the cost for material and labor. The acid should be used daily on the 
moist manure, as it is made in the stable. It should be scattered in the stalls before the 
bedding is added, so it will not come in direct contact with the feet of the animals. Some 
farmers use one half acid phosphate and one half kainit. The kainit is a carrier of potash and 
also preserves the nitrogen. 
Distribution of Manure. The manure spreader furnishes the best method of scattering 
the manure over the ground. The hand method with the use of the ordinary wagon is slow 
and unsatisfactory. It is also a very slow method and does not give an equal distribution of 
plant food. Manure is distributed over the land at the rate of from five to twenty tons per 
acre. The amount used depends upon the kind and the quality of the manure and the crop 
to be grown. From six to ten tons per acre is considered sufficient for the ordinary farm crops. 
A larger amount is often used by gardeners. Manure should be distributed over the land as  
-P-A-G-E-102
  96 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
soon as possible after it is made. This is especially true if no water-tight pits or covered sheds 
are maintained for protection of the manure. 
Plowing under Manure. Plowing manure under as soon: as distributed on the field is not 
necessary. The plant food that is washed out by the rains will go into the ground where needed 
and will soon be used by plants. Manure that is plowed under adds humus to the soil and 
also gives more plant food to the crops. It aids the land in holding water and makes the soil 
looser by preventing it from packing so completely. 
Value of Manure. A thorough application of well-preserved manure is often notice- 
able for years on every crop grown on the field thus treated. 
In the following table note the different methods used in protecting and distributing ani- 
mal manures on the farms about your school.

CROP MANURES 
Or@anic matter is added to the soil by plowing under certain crops for the purpose of 
improving both its physical and chemical conditions. These crops are usually plowed under 
in their green state and the process is called ‘“‘ green manuring.” The addition of this vegetable 
matter or humus aids the soil in retaining moisture and puts it in better condition for cultiva- 
tion. Any plant may serve for this purpose, but the ones most commonly used are rye, red 
clover, crimson clover, cowpeas, soy beans, and vetches. Many farmers prefer to use the clovers, 
cowpeas, soy beans, and vetches, because they add more nitrogen to the soil. An acre of an 
average crop of red or crimson clover or of cowpeas contains one hundred and fifty pounds of 
nitrogen, an amount equivalent to that contained in fifteen tons of average stable manure. 
Crimson clover or cowpeas may be sown in corn or cotton at the last cultivation. In 
the northern sections of our country, rye is more extensively used because the seed is less 
expensive and the plants live through the winter and furnish a good protection for the soil. 
It should be plowed under in the spring before it gets too large and while green enough to rot 
readily. The plowing under of crop manures while green prevents the loss of water which 
they have absorbed from the soil. 
It is poor farm practice to always plow under crops that are worth harvesting. Usually 
it is better to cut thé clover or cowpeas for hay, feed them to the stock, and later return the 
manure to the land. 
Crop manuring is particularly useful in the improvement of light lands deficient in humus, 
and on land where continuous cropping has been practiced without the addition of animal 
manure or other forms of organic matter. By the use of legumes as green manures and the 
addition of potash, phosphoric acid, and lime, poor soils may be made fertile. 
Fill out the following table of crop manures raised by the farmers about your home.

NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS 
The most important commercial fertilizers used are divided into three generaleclasses : 
those containing nitrogen; those containing phosphoric acid; and those containing pot- 
ash. Most fertilizers contain more or less of all three of these food substances, but some 
brands contain only two and others only one. Fertilizers containing all three of these food sub- 
stances are called complete fertilizers. A nitrogenous fertilizer is one in which nitrogen is the 
most important element. While other fertilizing elements may be present, it is purchased 
mainly to supply nitrogen to the soil. The most common nitrogenous fertilizers, obtained 
from organic sources, are dried blood, tankage, dried fish scrap, and cottonseed meal. 
Dried Blood and Tankage are obtained from slaughterhouses. Dried blood contains 
from 13 to 14 per cent of nitrogen. The raw material for making tankage is composed of the 
intestines and other parts of the slaughtered animals that cannot be used in a more profitable 
manner. Tankage used for fertilizing purposes only, is known as crushed tankage and con- 
centrated tankage. The difference in these two kinds is due to the different process of manu- 
facture. The crushed tankage contains from 4 to 9 per cent of nitrogen and 3 to 12 per cent 
of phosphoric acid, while the concentrated tankage contains from Io to 12 per cent of nitrogen, 
Dried Fish Scrap. The solid matter obtained by extracting the oil from dried fish is 
ground and made into a fertilizer. The material contains from 6.5 to 10.5 per cent of nitrogen 
and from 5 to 16 per cent of phosphoric acid. 
Cottonseed Meal. After removing the hulls of the cottonseed the kernels are ground 
and the oil extracted by pressing. The residue obtained by this process, when ground, is called 
cottonseed meal. Cottonseed meal contains from 5 to 7.5 per cent nitrogen and from 1.5 to 
3 per cent phosphoric acid and 1.3 to 2 per cent potash. 
Sulphate of Ammonia and Nitrate of Soda are the most common chemical sources of nitrog- 
enous fertilizers. Sulphate of ammonia contains 20 per cent of nitrogen and is a by-product 
from the manufacture of gas and coke. Nitrate of soda or Chile saltpeter is found in Peru 
and Chile. It contains about 15 per cent of nitrogen. This salt is very soluble and should 
be applied only when the roots of plants will soon absorb it. 
Make a survey of the commercial nitrogenous fertilizers used in your school district and 
fill out the table below.

Phosphoric acid fertilizers obtained from organic sources are (1) ground raw bone,

Ground Raw Bone. This form of bone is secured by grinding bones. It contains 22 
per cent of phosphoric acid and from 3 to 4 per cent of nitrogen. The available phosphoric 
acid in this form of bone is from 4 to 8 per cent. 
Ground Steamed Bone. This form is made by steaming the bone to take out the fat. 
The bone is steamed before the grinding process is done. Ground steamed bone contains 
from 18 to 32 per cent phosphoric acid and 2 to 4 per cent of nitrogen. Thé available phos- 
phoric acid in ground steamed bone is from 5 to Io per cent. 
Bone Black. This form contains from 32 to 36 per cent of phosphoric acid. 
Phosphoric acid fertilizers obtained from chemical sources are (1) phosphate rock, and 
(2) Thomas slag. 
Phosphate Rock. Large quantities of phosphate rock are found in Tennessee, Florida, 
and South Carolina. The phosphate rock found in Tennessee contains from 30 to 32 per cent 
phosphoric acid, that found in Florida 18 to 40 per cent, and that found in South Carolina 
26 to 28 per cent. 
Thomas Slag. This fertilizing material is a by-product in the manufacture of steel. 
It contains from 15 to 20 per cent of phosphoric acid. It is also called basic slag.

POTASH FERTILIZERS 
Potash fertilizers obtained from organic sources are (1) wood ashes unleached; (2) wood 
ashes leached; and (3) tobacco stems. 
Unleached Ashes. Waod ashes that are unleached contain from 4 to 7 per cent potash, 
I.5 to 2 per cent phosphoric acid, and 30 to 33 per cent lime. 
Leached Ashes. Wood ashes that are leached contain little fertilizing value. They are 
of little use to the soil except for the lime they contain. The leaching is caused by water 
running over them and washing out the fertilizing materials. Leached ashes contain 1 to 
2 per cent potash, 1 to 1.5 per cent phosphoric acid, and 27 and 29 per cent of lime. 
Tobacco Stems. The stems from tobacco are good for use on lawns and on ground to 
be used for garden purposes. They contain 5 to 10 per cent of potash and 3 per cent of lime. 
Potash fertilizers obtained from chemical sources are (1) kainit; (2) muriate of potash; 
(3) sulphate of potash. 
Kainit. Kainit is a salt mined in Germany. It contains 12 per cent of potash. 
Muriate of Potash. Muriate of potash or potassium chloride is the form of potash gen- 
erally used in the United States. It is also manufactured from kainit. It contains 49 to 59 
per cent of potash. ‘ 
Sulphate of Potash. Sulphate of potash is manufactured from kainit. It costs slightly 
more than muriate of potash but is preferred when fertilizing some plants because it does not 
injure their quality. This form of potash contains from 50 to 52 per cent potash.

HOME MIXING OF FERTILIZERS 
The materials that furnish nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash can be obtained from 
dealers, and the farmer can mix them together and make his own fertilizers. Home-mixed 
fertilizers can be made to suit the crops grown and the particular needs of the soil. The fol- 
lowing table shows the percentage of the essential element in each of several of the most com- 
mon fertilizer materials.

Preparation for Mixing. The mixing can be done on a barn floor or a dry, hard dirt 
floor. The tools necessary are a shovel, a sieve to sift out the lumps that will be found in the 
nitrate of soda, a box or barrel, a wooden pestle for pulverizing the lumps. A steelyard or 
platform scale will be a convenience, but as the materials come in weighed sacks, they may be 
put together by sackfuls and a fairly accurate mixture obtained. 
Mixing a 1-8-2 Fertilizer. Such a fertilizer contains 1 per cent of nitrogen, 8 per cent 
of phosphoric acid, and 2 per cent of potash. In a ton of this fertilizer there are 20 pounds 
of nitrogen, 160 pounds of phosphoric acid, and 40 pounds of potash. The 20 pounds of 
nitrogen can be obtained from 130 pounds of nitrate of soda containing 15.5 per cent of nitro- 
gen. The 160 pounds of phosphoric acid can be obtained from 1150 pounds of acid phosphate 
containing 14 per cent of phosphoric acid.. From 80 pounds of muriate of potash containing 
50 per cent of potash, the 40 pounds of potash can be secured. The total weight of these 
materials is 130 + 1150 + 80, or 1360, pounds to give the constituents required for making 
2000 pounds of a 1-8-2 fertilizer. The remainder of the 2000 pounds, or 640 pounds, may 
as well be common dirt from the field as dirt shipped from Chicago or Baltimore with charges 
for collecting and the freight added. 
Nitrate of soda sells for $5.50 per sack of 200 pounds, muriate of potash at $4.60 for the 
same quantity, and 14 per cent acid phosphate can be purchased from any local dealer at $16 
or $18 per ton, while in carload lots it can be secured at from $14 to $15 per ton. Taking the 
prices above quoted, a ton of home-mixed 1-8-2 fertilizer would cost : —

  102 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
One half dollar per ton will cover the cost of mixing, and the farmer who purchases these 
materials and mixes for himself may be sure that he has used the most effective carriers of the 
fertilizing elements. 
It is, of course, unnecessary to put in the dirt “filler” required to bring the fertilizer up 
to the 2000 pounds. Simply use less of the fertilizer when distributing over the field. Be- 
cause of the tendency of nitrate of soda to absorb moisture, it is well to use the fertilizer within 
a few days after mixing; with this precaution it may be applied without difficulty through 
the fertilizer drill. 
Nitrate of soda is not used in ready-mixed fertilizers for the reason that nitrogen can be 
bought more cheaply in dried muck, tankage, and other slaughterhouse refuse; but while 
these are cheaper to the manufacturer, they are more expensive to the farmer. 
Frequently the nitrogen in a fertilizer is expressed in terms of ammonia, which is largely 
nitrogen. To find the needed weight of nitrate of soda necessary to yield the desired amount 
of ammonia, calculate on a basis of 19 per cent instead of 15.5 per cent. 
Calculate the value of a ton of fertilizer containing 3 per cent ammonia, 9 per cent 
phosphoric acid, and 2 per cent potash, using the prices quoted above.

GOOD ROADS 
The general condition of a community may be known by its roads. Good roads help trade 
and raise the value of property along them. They beautify the country through which they 
are built and save a great deal of wear and tear of the farm wagons and carriages that pass 
over them. Nearly every farmer has had the experience of being stuck in the mud when carry- 
ing goods to market upon heavily loaded wagons; children are often kept from school because 
the country roads are impassable; and churches in the country districts lose much in attend- 
ance through the poorness of the roads leading to them. Wherever a community has good, 
durable roads, trade increases and the people are more social. 
   A Poor Roap. A Goop Roap. 
There are several factors to be considered in road building. Grade, drainage, foundations, 
surface structure, materials to be used, and workmanship are some of the things that must 
be taken into account whenever new roads are to be built. As far as possible, grades should 
be slight. Heavy loads cannot be economically transported over roads where there are steep 
hills to climb. It is better to have the road level and winding than it is to have it straight 
and hilly. If the road is to be saved from washing, especially during the spring freshets, the 
drainage must be good. The foundations of the road must be firm and not water-soaked. 
If the top of the road is to be paved, it is very necessary that the foundation be secure and 
strong. The surface of the road should also be firm, with a correct slope to allow the water 
to run off easily. Wherever necessary tile drains should be used to facilitate the removal of 
surface water. 
The quality of the materials used should be the best. The lasting quality of the rock used 
is of prime importance. No road will last that is built of bad material. 
No matter how good the material used may be, if the workmanship is poor, the results will 
be unsatisfactory. An overseer who knows the art of road building should be employed. 
Money spent in this way will benefit the community. It is not to be expected that the ordi- 
nary farmer will be conversant with the details of good road building, and it would be better 
for him to employ some one who does know than to try to do the work himself. 
Many of the natural roads through the country are very sandy. The method of handling 
these roads differs from that employed with roads of other soils. ‘ A sandy road should not
-P-A-G-E-111
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE ‘ 105 
be rounded. Water easily seeps through sand and if allowed to run off the top surface would 
badly wash it. Sandy roads are poorest when dry, so it is not advisable to drain such roads. 
A top-dressing of clay has been found of great advantage to improve sandy conditions in our 
roads. In the South many of the roads have been greatly improved by mixing clay with the 
top sand and applying a layer of this mixture to the depth of seven or eight inches. When 
this is done, the surface may be rounded and rolled. Clay roads are poor because clay holds 
water and the roads become soft and muddy during the wet seasons of the year. If sand and 
gravel are mixed with the clay of such roads, it will improve the roadbed. 
In preparing an earth road, all stumps, brush, and large rocks should first be removed. 
Holes should be filled up and all high places leveled to the general grade of the road. Large 
machines called scrapers, drawn by horses, are used to get the right grade. After the floor 
of the road is laid, the top layer is put on by means of road machines, and thoroughly rolled. 
Rolling should always be done with machines for this purpose, and not left to vehicles, 
for the action of narrow-tired wheels tends to cut ae roadbed. Split-log drags are often 
used in farming communities to prepare the top of the road. 
Earth roads can often be improved by the use of gravel. If this is used, it should be 
rolled firmly. Shell roads are built in some sections of this country. A thick layer of shells 
is applied to the road top and heavily rolled into the surface. Macadam roads are exten- 
sively used in many places. In this road structure, the foundation is built of large stones 
which permit of under drainage. Over these, smaller stones are tightly packed and these 
in turn are covered with small pebbles and gravel. A top-dressing of stone dust is then 
rolled closely and compactly over all. The success of such roads depends upon the quality 
of the foundation and the skill with which the work is done. 
The cost of road building depends upon many things. The quality of the material used, 
the kind of machinery employed, the availability of labor, and the ease with which road build- 
ing materials may be obtained are some of the chief factors in the cost of construction. A road 
over which there is extensive travel will admit of more expense in building than would one 
over which there is little travel. A road should not be too costly, especially in the farming 
districts. f 
Under the headings below list the kinds of roads found in your community and suggest 
improvements to same.

LESSON 72 
PACKING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS 
A farmer not only must produce what people want, but he must put his goods on the market 
in such a form that they will be glad to buy them. Neglect of ordinary precautions along this 
line not only prevents sale, but in many cases destroys the chance of obtaining future orders. 
_ The three great considerations in preparing goods for market are neatness, cleanliness, 
and uniformity. Two products‘of the same kind offered for sale, one attractively and neatly 
displayed and the other displayed without any care, will bring far different prices. The first 
lot will be bought often at a fancy price and the second lot will remain on the market until 
everything else is sold and then be disposed of at a loss. Cases that are stained by the juices 
of the products will repel a possible purchaser. The presence of rubbish, sticks, and other 
foreign matter in the product displayed will hurt the sale. Neatness is essential if a ready 
market is to be desired. Uniformity of product requires very little extra effort and is very 
attractive to the possible purchaser. Eggs varying greatly in size and color are not as likely 
to be sold as eggs that are more nearly uniform in all respects. Peaches, melons, apples, and 
all the other fruits shipped to our markets should present the best possible appearance. 
One of the most important principles to be observed in preparing products for the market 
is honesty. If a trade is to be built up, this principle is of vital importance. A farmer who 
places his best apples at the top of the barrel and fills the rest of the space with imperfect fruit 
will not command the respect of dealers as will one whose fruit is uniform throughout. Wher- 
ever the farmer practices deception, the results inevitably reflect upon his future orders. 
After the quality of products, packing is next to be considered. There are several factors 
that determine the way in which farm produce is to be packed. The kind of products to be 
shipped, the season of the year in which shipment takes place, the distance of the market, 
and the means for shipping all tend to shape the manner of packing. If much of the farm 
produce is to be shipped, there should be a packing shed erected at some convenient place. 
A tight roof supported on poles will generally be found’ sufficient for all ordinary needs. Heat 
and moisture are the greatest promoters of decay; and therefore, wherever possible, the prod- 
uce to be shipped should be allowed to cool from the heat of the day before packing. All 
fruit and vegetables should be perfectly dry before being placed in boxes, barrels, or crates. 
Care should be taken to prevent bruising in packing, as bruises permit rapid decay. Either 
too tight or too loose packing will tend to bruise the products. Some fruits have to be shipped 
green or unripe and allowed to ripen during transit. With all fruits, the degree of ripeness is a 
factor that governs the choice for the shipment. If possible, the farmer should personally see 
to the loading of the car that is to take his produce. In this way he may be sure that his 
goods have sufficient air and the right temperature to prevent decay during transportation. 
Most farmers are obliged to sell to a commission merchant; he is the agent of the shipper 
or producer, acting for him and representing him in the large markets of the city. It is to 
the interest of the commission merchant to secure the highest price for the goods he handles ; 
and he desires that those goods should have high quality as well as attractiveness. Commis- 
sion merchants are usually divided into four classes according to the particular line that they 
handle. These classes are: butter, cheese, and egg dealers; poultry and game merchants; 
fruit and vegetable dealers; and specialists. Most commission merchants will handle any 
line, although they generally prefer consignments in the special produce they handle. Farmers
-P-A-G-E-113
    
PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 107 
who ship extensively know each class of merchants and generally open trade accounts with 
one or more of them. When goods are consigned to a commission merchant, he becomes the 
agent of the consignor; when goods are bought directly, the commission merchant ceases to 
be the agent, although he may not have paid cash for the produce. Care should be exercised 
when shipping goods to be bought outright. When a direct sale is made, a draft should be 
attached to the bill of lading received from the railroad. The express company or bank will 
present the bill of lading and draft when the goods have reached their destination and are 
ready to be delivered. The bill of lading in such a case will not be surrendered until the draft 
has been paid. 
Make a study of the methods employed in shipping products from the farms in your 
neighborhood. List below in a few words the various ways in which the listed crops are 
shipped from your home town.

FARM COOPERATION 
Need of Codperation. The farmer is at a great disadvantage in purchasing his supplies 
because they are usually bought in small quantities, and hence he must pay the retail price. 
When an organization is effected, including a large number of farniers, they can buy supplies 
for the farm in large quantities and by so doing can get wholesale prices from the manufacturer 
or from the wholesale dealer. 
The farmer is again at a disadvantage when he sells his products because he has such a 
limited amount to offer for sale. When a large number of men in the same locality unite 
‘their efforts in producing a similar grade of animals or grain, the quantity and quality offered 
by the group attracts the large buyer, and consequently the persons composing the group get 
a higher price than they could if each sold his products separately. Buyers can afford to pay 
more because the expense of purchasing the products is less when they are only required to 
travel over a small area in order to secure the desired amount and grade of products. 
Purchasing Agent. When a group of persons form an organization for buying seeds, 
fertilizers, farm machinery, farm animals, or anything needed on the farm they frequently 
appoint a purchasing agent. This person is usually an expert in judging the thing he is asked 
to buy, and can select a better quality than the inexperienced man. He visits different 
markets and finds out where he can secure the best prices. 
Selling Agent. A farm organization that is formed for selling products frequently 
appoints a selling agent whose business it is to find out the best market in which to sell. 
Codperative Selling Organizations. Organizations formed for codperative selling include 
farmers who are engaged in dairying, fruit growing, truck gardening, poultry raising, grain 
growing, stock raising, and general farming. 
Fill out the following table showing the farm codperative associations that exist in your

LESSON 74 
THE USES OF TREES 
In settling the forested sections of our country the first work of the settler was to cut 
down the trees in order to clear the land for farming. Destructive cutting by lumbermen, 
forest fires, fungus diseases, overgrazing, and windstorms have 
aided in the destruction of the forests. These processes have 
been going on continually until the situation has become alarm- 
ing; and steps are being taken to protect the forests that still 
exist, and to reforest many steep hillsides and other places not 
suitable for agriculture. 
There are many uses for trees on the farm, among which 
are the following : — (1) wood, (2) protection, (3) bird homes, 
and (4) beauty. 
(1) Most farmers use considerable wood both for burning 
purposes and for repair work, and this comes from the wood lot. 
Fences, small bridges, and buildings demand wood: for their 
structure. This may often be obtained at home if the farmer 
has a good wood lot. 
(2) A good growth of trees protects buildings and stock 
from severe storms. ‘Trees are often planted in rows to shield 
growing crops from the driving storms and winds that sweep 
across the open farm lands. A forest on a hillside preserves 
the soil from erosion, the tree roots and leafy mold holding 
back the surface water that would otherwise wash away the 
top soil. Much of the poor land of the South is due to in- 
discriminate cutting of trees and thus allowing the soil to 
be washed into the valleys. 
(3) If it were only for the protection of our birds, it would 
be well worth while to save our trees. The cutting down of 
our farm trees deprives many of our best friends of their homes 
and causes them to seek shelter elsewhere. “Trees are the 
natural homes of most birds, and they will congregate in the 
wood lot, build their homes, rear their young, and help our 
crops by devouring the insect pests. It is not always easy 
to see that our birds are worth more to us than the trees we 
cut down. We must have lumber for many purposes, but we 
can, at least, plant a young tree for every one cut down. 
(4) Besides the purely material value attached to our trees 
there is another value just as important. Anything that adds 
to the beauty of life is well worth preserving. A farm without © 
any trees is cold and dismal. One of the chief things that we 
want when we buy a farm is attractiveness, and good trees cer- 
tainly add to the attractiveness of any place. The location of 
a few trees will often change a forbidding farm into one of beauty.

LESSON 75 
FARM FORESTRY 
Farm forestry has to do with the management of farm wood lots. Most of the wood lots 
are remnants of former forests. On the prairies, they are artificial tree plantations. Many 
of the farm wood lots consist largely of species of small value; and, due to lack of attention, 
a large number of the individual trees are diseased or of poor shape. In order to obtain a 
future supply of timber, the farmer must give the wood lot a share of his attention. Diseased 
trees and those of worthless species should be cut out and young trees planted in their places. 
Care should be taken to plant only those trees that are adapted to the locality and that will 
be of some future use. If seeds are planted, it is of great importance that they have been 
gathered from healthy, vigorous trees. “Information concerning the planting of trees can be 
secured from a local forester or the State Experiment Station. 
In starting new wood lots it is necessary to give the young trees for two or three years the 
same care that is given to ordinary field crops. Good results need not be expected by merely 
planting the trees and allowing them to care for themselves. Trees always grow faster under 
cultivation than in sod or when allowed to compete with weeds and brush. Clean cultivation 
gives best results, and trees should be properly spaced to permit of proper cultivation. In 
order to facilitate cultivation and pay for the cost, a crop may be grown between the rows for 
a year or two. Potatoes and legumes are the best for this purpose. Cultivation may be 
  A Grove oF Brack Locusts, THEse TREES ARE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD.
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE Tit 
carried on in the same manner as for any field crop, and should be started as soon as neces- 
sary after planting, and should be carried on as long as possible. The species most commonly 
grown can be cultivated for three years. 
Care should be taken the third year, for by 
this time the root systems of the trees are 
developed and too deep tillage may destroy 
the young fibrous roots. A five or seven- 
toothed cultivator is a good implement to 
use. Cultivation both ways is the most 
effective. When cultivation is discontinued, 
cover crops, such as cowpeas or clover, may 
be sown. These crops should be permitted 
to fall and form a mulch, but they should be 
raked a foot or two away from the trees in 
the late fall to prevent injury by mice. 
The next important step after the proper 
cultivation of the wood lot or plantation is to 
learn the best methods of pruning trees. This 
should be done in such a way that ragged 
wounds will not be produced. The cut should 
be clear and smooth and near the trunk. 
Care should always be taken not to tear the 
bark of the trunk. The fundamental principle 
to be observed is the elimination of forks and 
the securing of straight trunks. The winter 
months offer the most opportune time, and 
in many respects are the best period for prun- 
ing. Many prefer February and March. Do 
not prune forest trees in the late summer. 
  A Grove oF ASH SAPLINGS. 
The catalpa is not self-pruning as are some of the common forest trees, and close plant- 
ing will not clear the trunks of branches. Unlike the catalpa, the locust is self-pruning, and 
the only operation necessary is the removal of branches that form forked trunks. The osage 
orange and the mulberry are not self-pruning. Careful attention should be given to the elim- 
ination of forked trunks and also the lateral branches as fast as they die. Ash, tulip, poplar, 
oak, walnut, and practically all of the native trees are self-pruning, and the removal of dead 
lateral branches is usually all that is necessary. Evergreens seldom fork, but when they do, 
one of the branches should be removed.

POULTRY 
  Pure Brep Pourtry. 
Turkeys, ducks, geese, guinea fowls, and chickens come under the head of farm poultry. 
It has only been within recent years that poultry on the farm have received scientific attention. 
In the past, hens, ducks, and geese were looked upon as a side issue for the farmer; if they 
laid eggs, it was a small profit that could be used to meet household expenses. The poultry 
were fed the refuse and the scraps of the table and were allowed to roam about at will. Now 
all this has been changed, and the care of our poultry has become as important as the care of 
our cows or horses. 
Most of the modern breeds of poultry are descendants from some European or Asiatic 
ancestors that roamed wild in the forested and grassy regions. ‘With care and time, man has 
adapted the various breeds to fulfill purposes that supply some of his needs. Eggs, feathers, 
and meat are the principal things for which the different breeds of poultry are used. Some- 
times the animals are raised as insect destroyers, although this is generally a secondary con- 
sideration. With a better understanding of the nature of the various fowls has come a better 
system of breeding, a more careful regard to housing, and a more scientific method of feeding. 
The products derived from poultry are well worth every care and consideration. Full-blooded 
stock is always cheaper than scrub stock, whether it be poultry, cattle, or horses. A scrub 
hen will eat more and return less than a well-bred animal. 
Of all the animals classed as poultry, chickens are the most important and most profitable. 
Turkeys are more delicate and require careful attention, although their meat is in much de- 
mand and always brings a high price. Guinea fowls are raised extensively on some farms and 
are considered to be-excellent egg-producers. Ducks may be raised easily, especially if there 
is water in which they may swim, although this is not an absolute necessity. The food of the 
duck consists mostly of grasses, insects, and small fishes; and for this reason, the animal should 
not be fed much hard grain. Geese, on the other hand, must have a free range of water if 
they are to be raised successfully.

MEAT BREEDS OF HENS 
   A Licut BranMa. A Burr Cocuin. 
Hens bred for meat are seldom very prolific egg layers. Among the principal breeds that 
are used for the production of meat are the following : — 
Brahma. The Brahmas are Asiatic fowls. There are two varieties, — the Light and the 
Dark, of which the former is much more popular. The Brahmas are the largest of all our 
domestic poultry. They are excellent table birds, but do not develop early. Their eggs are 
very heavy. The Brahma hen is very hardy and a fair sitter. 
Cochin. There are four varieties of the Cochin and they all stand next to the Brahma as 
meat fowls. The different varieties are the Buff, the Partridge, the Black, and the White. 
The Buff variety is the one most commonly raised. They are all fairly heavy, and make 
excellent table birds. The Black Cochin is the most easily raised of all the varieties.

EGG BREEDS OF HENS 
Farmers raise hens for their 
eggs. Besides being used on the 
home table, eggs are a conven- 
ient source of revenue to pay the 
small bills of the farm. Gener- 
ally, the farmer thinks of his 
hens only as small producers, but 
the annual revenue from eggs 
alone, in the United States, ap- 
proximates one hundred and 
fifty millions of dollars. A little

varieties are the White and the Brown. These hens occupy a place in the poultry 
family similar to that occupied by the Jerseys among cows. The Leghorns are active, good 
foragers, mature early, and cost less to raise than nearly all other breeds. They are the 
best egg layers of all the hens. Their eggs are pure white in color and heavy in weight. 
Hens should be carefully housed in winter, as they are sensitive to cold.

they are very much like them in appearance. ‘They too are hardy, easily raised, and mature 
early. They are better for table purposes than the Leghorns, but do not lay as many eggs,

GENERAL PURPOSE BREEDS OF HENS 
A Prymouts Rock. 
  Hens that are to be used on the farm for 
their meat as well as their eggs are termed 
general purpose hens. Among the most 
prominent breeds of hens that answer the 
purpose of supplying eggs and meat are the 
following : — 
Plymouth Rock. The Plymouth Rock 
is the most popular of all the poultry breeds. 
This breed probably came from a cross of 
the American Dominique and the Black Java. 
The two leading kinds of Plymouth Rock 
fowls are the Barred and the White. The 
hens are of medium size, well-proportioned, 
and hardy. They mature early and make 
excellent broilers. They are good layers, 
especially during the winter months. The 
plumage of this breed is very beautiful, 
and sometimes the hens are bred simply for 
their feathers. 
Wyandotte. This general purpose fowl ranks next to the Plymouth Rock. Wyandottes 
are not quite as large as the Plymouth Rocks, but they are easily cared for and bear confine- 
ment very well. They are good layers and good meat producers. There are eight varieties, 
having much the same characteristics but differing in color. 
Dominique. The Dominiques are bluish colored fowls, much like the Plymouth Rocks 
in structure. They have a rose comb and bright yellow legs. They are hardy, good layers, 
and dress well for the table.

THE HOUSING AND CARE OF HENS 
  
  APARTMENT House Pian. 
There are two systems of housing hens widely different in their general characteristics. 
One system is known as the colony plan; the other, the continuous apartment plan. The | 
colony plan consists of many small houses for small flocks of fowls placed far enough part 
that each colony may have free range. The apartment house plan consists of a series of sepa- 
rate pens all under one roof and opening directly into a hallway in the rear. Sometimes 
there is an entrance from pen to pen by means of doorways, and sometimes the pens are distinct 
from each other. Each plan has its own advantages and disadvantages; and each is advo- | 
cated by special breeders as meeting their individual wishes and purposes. In the colony 7 
plan the flocks are free to range; no expensive fencing is needed ;. there is less need for atten- 
tion to the cleanliness of the houses; and fresh range is easily obtained by moving the houses. 
The disadvantages are in the initial cost of construction; the greater labor in feeding, espe- 
cially during bad weather; and the limited number of birds that can be kept on an acre of 
ground. Some of the advantages of the apartment house plan are (1) the hens are all under | 
one cover where they may be reached rapidly, (2) more birds can be accommodated to the acre | 
than under the first plan, and (3) it is easier to feed and care for them when the birds are | 
in one house. The disadvantages are mainly due to the liability to disease rising from confin- | 
ing so many birds in close quarters. | 
In using either system, the first consideration is the location of the poultry house or 
houses. An elevation with good drainage should be selected. The grounds used by the 
chickens should not be damp, for colds will be caught and other diseases contracted by the 
fowls under such conditions. A dry, porous soil is preferable to a clay soil that holds much 
moisture. If the soil is not dry, it can be rendered fit for the use of the hens by draining. 
Sunlight and warmth are very essential, and houses should be placed with this in view. 
If permanent houses are to be built, it is well to erect them on good foundations. Bricks 
or concrete should be used wherever possible. The foundation should be deep enough to 
keep out the frost. The floors may be either wood or cement, but they must be dry. 
About one square foot of glass surface should be allowed for every eighteen feet of floor 
space. Too much glass makes the house hot in summer and cold in winter. The windows 
should be placed high and vertical.   
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  120 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
  Cotony House Pran. 
All interior fixtures should be built so that they may be easily removed. Comfortable 
roosts should be made with a board about 10 inches below the roost to catch droppings. The 
rail used for roosting should be smooth and long enough to allow about 10 inches for each 
fowl. The nests should be placed in the darker parts of the house. Directly beneath the 
roost platform is an excellent place. Each nest should be from 12 to 14 inches square and 
high enough for a hen to conveniently enter it. Dust boxes should be provided if the hens 
have no opportunity to cleanse themselves in the dry soil of the yard. Fresh water should 
always be kept where it is available and the drinking vessels should be frequently cleaned. 
Feed troughs and grit boxes should be so constructed that the hens cannot get their feet 
in them. Several boxes containing meat scraps and grits can be fastened to the walls at a 
convenient height, about 14 inches, above the floor. 
Fresh air, dry conditions, and plenty of sunshine should be found in every house. These 
are cardinal points necessary in good henhouse building. If convenient, it is also desirable 
to have double yards for the hens to enter. If these are possible, a rotation of green crops 
may be obtained and the hens given green feed at all times necessary. Clover, rye, and blue 
grass are good crops for hens. 
All fowls should be fed carefully. They should have empty crops in the morning and the 
crops should never be full except at night. Some poultry men feed three times a day and 
some only twice. If the fowls have a large range where they can pick up much to eat, feeding 
twice a day isenough. The feed may consist either of dry grains or of a moistened mash. The 
dry feed consists of cracked corn, wheat, and oats mixed'together in about the proportion of 
2, 34, 14. This mixture should be scattered in the litter so that the hens will get exercise in 
scratching for it. The mash feed consists of ground grain moistened with milk or water. 
The mash should never be sloppy, but should be a fairly dry, crumbly mash. A good mash is 
composed of the following ingredients, roo pounds corn meal, 150 pounds ground oats, 150 
pounds wheat bran, 30 pounds linseed meal, and 30 pounds beef scraps. Ordinarily a hen 
does not get enough lime to form egg shells readily. If crushed shells of some kind can be fed 
to a hen that is a prolific layer, she will the more readily lay. Oyster shells are very good for 
this purpose; old mortar will also supply the lime. 
Disinfectants should be used frequently about the houses and yards, and care should be 
taken to prevent diseases common to fowls. If the ordinary precautions of cleanliness are 
taken about the chicken houses, disease will be greatly lessened.

PLOWS AND HARROWS 
The use and care of implements are 
important items in a farmer’s life. The 
selection of implements for the farm is 
an important task. It is best to get 
good machinery, even if the initial cost 
is a little more. The wearing quality of 
all the implements should be carefully in- 
spected as they will have hard service 
and they must stand up under the strain 
of varying conditions. 
Having purchased suitable imple- 
ments for his work, it will pay the farmer 
to take care of them. All worn parts 
should be immediately replaced, and all 
cutting tools should be kept sharpened. 
No implements should be left out in the 
field. Farmers often spend hundreds of 
dollars in plows, harrows, and other im- 
plements and then let them stand out 
exposed to the weather. 
The most common implement the 
farmer uses is, perhaps, the plow. There 
are a number of different kinds of plows, 
of which the following are important : — 
Landside Plow. This is the com- 
imonest type of plow. A plow of this kind turns a furrow only in one direction, usually 
to the right. 
Swivel Plow. This plow is made so that it will turn a furrow either to the right or to 
the left. With this plow the furrows in a field may be all plowed in one way and no dead 
furrows left. The swivel plow, sometimes called a hillside plow, is often used on hillsides for 
the reason that it does not leave dead furrow which may become a deep gully by the action 
of heavy rains. For general purposes it is not as good as the landside plow. 
Sulky Plow. This may be either a swivel or landside plow mounted on wheels. Fre- 
quently two landside plows are attached to this sulky. This kind of plow cannot be used on 
land that is not comparatively level; it is of no use on hillsides. 
Gang Plow. The gang plow consists of several landside plows mounted on a frame. 
It is used only where large level areas are to be cultivated. In the West, where farms are 
large and level, the gang plows, pulled by traction engines, are used extensively. 
Disk Plow. This implement is being used more extensively every year. It consists of 
steel disks, from 25 to 30 inches in diameter, set at an angle to the soil, so as to turn the soil 
  A Surxy Piow.
-P-A-G-E-132
      126 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
over and pulverize it. It is mounted on wheels like the sulky plow. A scraper attached so 
that it will rub against each disk keeps the surface from clogging with the turned-up soil. 
This implement is valuable in hard, sticky soils, but is not likely to supersede the landside 
plow. 
Harrows. Good plowing is but the beginning of thorough cultivation. It must be 
followed by harrowing, which prepares the land to receive the seed. The following are 
harrows in general use: — 
Spike-tooth Harrow. The: spike-tooth harrows are either square or A-shaped, with 
teeth set vertically upon the cross and side pieces of the frame. The more modern form of 
this harrow has teeth so arranged that they may be run either vertically or slanted back- 
ward at various degrees. The more the teeth slant backward, the smoother is the work that 
the harrow does and the more shallow is the tillage. When it is desired that tillage be 
deep, the teeth should be set vertically. 
Spring-tooth Harrow. The spring-tooth harrow, as its name implies, lee spring teeth. 
The teeth may be set at various depths and their springy nature enables them to clear 
obstructions in the field without 
injury. This implement leaves 
the soil in ridges, which is a dis- 
advantage in many cases, as it 
causes a loss of water from an 
excess of surface evaporation. Its 
‘advantage lies in the fact that it 
leaves the soil lighter than most 
other harrows, owing to the up- 
ward pull of the spring-teeth. 
Acme Harrow. These har- 
rows are sometimes called coulter 
harrows, as their teeth are twisted 
resembling a plow coulter. The 
teeth first cut the soil, as a small 
plow does, then turn and pul- 
verize it. : 
Disk Harrow. This is a form 
: of harrow in which the earth is 
Attias Td eeow, : broken up by means of one or 
more series of parallel upright 
disks arranged at an angle to the line of draft. This harrow cuts and pulverizes the soil.

LESSON 87 
CULTIVATORS 
A cultivator is any toothed 
implement used to stir the soil 
chiefly for the purpose of destroy- 
ing weeds and making a mulch 
to preserve soil moisture. Some- 
times harrows are used as culti- 
vators. Most cultivators are 
small harrows with handles at- 
tached and are sometimes called 
horse hoes. 
Of the many kinds of culti- 
vators the following are in gen- 
eral: use: — 
Shovel-tooth Cultivator. 
This is sometimes called a coulter 
cultivator. Most of the cultivators in use belong to this class of farm implements. The 
teeth of these cultivators yary much in shape, but they all enter the ground at an angle. 
The teeth enter the soil to a depth of from two to five inches, depending upon the position 
in which the teeth are placed. If the teeth are near together, the soil is left fairly smooth; 
if they are far apart, ridges are left which often have to be smoothed down. 
Spring-tooth Cultivators. These are like the spring-tooth harrow. They work deeply 
into the soil and are serviceable on heavy soils. As most cultivation should be shallow, this 
type of implement is not generally used. 
Spike-tooth Cultivators. This is an A-shaped spike-toothed harrow with handles attached 
to guide it. It is of great advantage as it leaves the surface of the soil very level. The teeth 
are straight at one end and are bent forward at the other and are interchangeable so that either 
end may be used. This cultivator is of great advantage in making a mulch; but it is not of 
much use in getting rid of weeds. 
Sulky Cultivator. These are riding cultivators and are used mostly in the West where 
cultivation is extended over large areas. The teeth in this implement are placed in two gangs 
with room between for the rows of corn or other plants. Two horses are used to pull it. Most 
cultivators of this type have coulter teeth. 
Weeders. These implements consist of rounded teeth that stir the ground a good deal 
as a rake does. They are useful to destroy weeds and to create a shallow mulch. They are 
not very effective unless used often. In market gardens, this form of cultivator is in extensive 
use. 
Rollers. These are large cylinders of wood or metal that are used to compact the surface 
of the soil. By rolling, the surface soil turned over by the plow is brought in closer contact 
with the subsoil and thus the upward movement of capillary water is increased. 
Hoes. Some cultivators have sweeps or wings attached to them that act as a hoe does. 
These wings lightly sweep across the soil and remove the standing weeds. For killing weeds 
there is nothing better than the old-style hoe, but its hand use is very expensive in labor.

HARVESTING MACHINERY 
In the early days of agriculture, grain was cut with a small sickle. The reaper seized a 
handful of the standing grain in one hand and with the other cut the stalks with a curved 
knife. This method was both slow and cumbersome, and seems to us to-day as being very 
crude. The first great improvement over the sickle came with the introduction of the scythe. 
This was merely the old sickle blade attached to a long handle. With this implement a man 
could cut ten times as much as he could with the small sickle. Next there was attached to the 
handle of the scythe a number of long prongs placed parallel to the blade. These prongs 
held the stalks from falling to the ground and deposited them in one bundle at the end of the 
sweep. The parallel prongs are called the cradle. In very hilly and stony places the cradle 
is still the best instrument to cut the grain. 
The first machine to harvest grain cut the stalks without placing them in bundles. A 
later reaper not only cut the stalks but gathered them into bundles which were bound by the 
harvest hands. In 1873 the self-binder was invented. This harvesting machine cuts the 
stalks and binds them into sheaves, and then discharges the bound sheaves upon the ground. 
After the sheaves have been deposited upon the field, the farmer has to shock them to 
protect them from rain. After the sheaves have remained in shocks until quite dry, they are 
hauled to threshing machines which separate the grain from the straw. 
While the self-binder is the most practical harvester for farms of ordinary size, yet on a 
few very large wheat farms, especially those in the Northwest, a combined harvester and 
thresher is used. This large machine cuts the stalks near the heads, and then a traveling apron 
of canvas carries the heads of wheat into the thresher, where they are threshed and the grain 
is cleaned and loaded into sacks ready for shipment to market.

FARM MACHINERY 
Some farmers about your home use improved machinery upon their farms. Visit such 
farms and make a careful study of their structure and use. Write a description of how they 
are made, how they work, and find out how each farmer protects them from the weather. 
The following are some of the more common machines found on farms : — 
Manure spreader; hay rake; cotton gin; cane mill; corn sheller; corn shredder; seed 
drill; stump puller; hay press; threshing machine; mower; windmill; corn planter.

PURITY AND VIABILITY OF OATS 
Purity. The common seed impurity found in oats is chess or cheat seeds. These so 
closely. resemble the oat seeds that it is difficult to tell them apart. When studying all small 
seeds, use a good hand magnifier, placing a good seed beside the seed in question and noting 
their differences. 
Select some good oat seeds from a newly-gathered crop or some that have been raised near 
your home in the past year and that you know are good. Obtain seed from some dealer. Take 
equal weights of each sample and determine the seed purity. Record your results below.

LESSON 91 
TREATMENT OF OATS FOR SMUT 
Smut is caused by a parasite plant growing in the tissues of the oat plant. It usually 
appears as a black, powdery mass and may destroy the whole head of the grain. Smut spores 
become ripe when the grain has headed and are distributed over the infected field by the 
wind. When the wind blows the spores to other plants, they cling to the newly infected 
heads and when the seeds are planted the next year the smut develops. 
A good treatment for oat smut is a solution made of one pint of formalin (a 40 per cent 
solution of formaldehyde) to fifty gallons of water. The grain to be treated is submerged 
in this solution. After treatment, the selected oats to be used for seed should be put in a 
bin or sack that has never been exposed to smut. 
This treatment is effective with the stinking smut of wheat, the sorghum grain smut, and 
the covered smut of barley. It is ineffective with the loose smut of wheat. 
If the grains are left in the formalin too long their vitality will be destroyed. To 
determine the proper length of time samples of oats should be treated for different periods 
of time. Select a half bushel of oats and obtain from a druggist an ounce of formaldehyde. 
Add the formaldehyde to 3 gallons of water and stir thoroughly. Place about two pounds of 
the oats in a sack and submerge in the formalin solution for half a minute. Empty the sack 
and spread the grains out to dry. Repeat the same, keeping the next lot of seed submerged 
for one minute. Repeat with another sample for 5 minutes, another for 10 minutes, another 
for 20 minutes, and one for 30 minutes. Reserve some of the original seed for the germina- 
tion test. Care should be taken when submerging the seed to have the grains thoroughly 
covered with the solution. This may be done by twisting the sack when in the formalin. 
Germination tests should next be made of the untreated and treated samples. To per- 
form this test, take several seeds from each sample, say about fifty, and place them between 
paper blotters and moisten well. Seeds from the different treatments should not be mixed 
but kept between separate blotters. Keep the temperature of the blotters at from 70 to 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, Examine the seeds every few days. Count and record the number of 
seeds that have sprouted.

OATS 
Oats were first cultivated in northern and central Europe, but like many other of our 
cultivated plants were carried westward from their place of origin by the migration of the early 
inhabitants of that region. This cereal was used almost exclusively as food for farm animals 
until comparatively recent times. When great improvement in milling machinery was made, 
its preparation for human food was more easily accomplished. 
Soil for Oats. A well-drained clay loam is a good soil in which to sow oats. They 
should not be planted on very rich soils because of their liability to lodge under such condi- 
tions. Sandy lands containing plenty of plant food and underlaid with a stiff subsoil will 
produce good oats. This crop often fails because the seed is planted in undrained clay soils 
that are wet and cold. 
Preparation of Seed Bed. Oats do best when sown in a good seed bed with from 2 to 4 
inches of loose mellow soil on the surface. If they are to be sown on land that has been in 
corn the previous year, the stalks should first be broken. This can be done by dragging a heavy 
pole broadside across the field on a cold frosty morning. After the stalks are broken they 
should be thoroughly cut with a disk harrow. Disking both ways cuts the stalks better and 
assists in getting the seed bed ready for planting. The disks should be set to run four inches 
deep. After the disking has been done the field should be gone over with a spike-tooth harrow. 
This should place the ground in condition for sowing. After sowing the seed the ground should 
be harrowed again to cover the seed, to level the ground, and to make the soil mellow. 
Selecting Seed. All seed of both wheat and oats should be carefully graded before plant- 
ing. This can be done by the use of a cleaning mill. This mill will take out all small and 
inferior seed as well as free the seed from trash and other impurities. If the seed show any 
signs of smut, they should be treated before planting (see Lesson 91). 
Sowing the Seed. The seed should be sown just as early as the seed bed can be prepared. 
The exact time varies in different localities. Eight to twelve pecks are sown per acre. Less 
seed is required when the seed is drilled than when it is sown broadcast. Most Experiment 
Stations favor shallow seeding. About one inch is the proper depth to plant. 
Varieties. Oat varieties differ in size, color, shape of grain, shape and size of head, 
yield, and ability to withstand cold weather. A reddish brown (Red Rustproof) and a gray 
variety (Winter Turf) are suitable for the South; a yellow variety (Sixty-Day Oats) for the 
Central States; and the Clydesdale and Silvermine, both white varieties with large grains, 
do better when grown in the Northern States. 
Harvesting. Oats are harvested with the regular grain binders, placed in shocks, and 
allowed to cure for about two weeks. They are then stacked or hauled to the barn to dry out 
unless weather conditions favor proper drying in the shock. When this is the case, thrashing 
is done in the field direct from the shock. The grain when thrashed, unless it is taken direct 
to the mill, should be stored in clean dry bins in which it will be protected from the weather 
and kept free from insects.

LESSON 93 
COTTON 
Varieties. The cotton grown in the United States belongs to two classes, — the Upland 
or short-staple cotton and the Sea Island or long-staple cotton. The seeds of the short-staple 
cotton are covered with short greenish hairs, while the seeds of the long-staple cotton are 
smooth and black in color. The flowers of the short-staple cotton are white or light cream in 
color when young, turning to pink as they grow older. The flowers of the Sea Island cotton 
are bright yellow. 
Climate and Soil. — Cotton is a warm-climate plant. If the daily maximum temperature 
reaches 90 degrees and the minimum temperature at night does not fall below 70 degrees, 
cotton will grow well. The plant grows very slowly as long as the nights are cool. Cotton 
sends out long roots and so can endure drought. If good cultivation is given the plant, this 
power to resist dry spells is largely increased. Too much rain, especially if it comes late in the 
growing season, is bad for the crop. Frequent rains in the early season followed by dry 
weather are the best weather conditions for growth. Nearly all soils will,grow cotton, 
providing the drainage is good. Standing water is very injurious to the plant. If the 
soil is too rich, as frequently happens in 
river-bottom lands, the plant tends to run 
to stalk at the expense of fiber. A rich, 
sandy loam makes a good cotton soil. A 
clay soil is not good for the cotton plant 
although a clay loam may sometimes be 
made available for cotton culture. 
Fertilizers. | Commercial fertilizers 
containing nitrogen, potassium, and phos- 
phorus are generally used. ‘These are es- 
pecially valuable on old, thin uplands. 
The proper proportions of these three 
elements in the fertilizer are dependent 
upon the soil conditions. If the farmer ‘A Fiecp om Corton, OZUAROMA. 
will study his soil and the type of cotton 
he desires to raise, he can select the fertilizer needed to meet his demands. Ina general way 
it may be stated that if the cotton plant grows tall and rank, goes to stalk, more phosphoric acid 
should be used and less nitrogen employed. If the plants tend to bear a great deal of fruit but 
are weak in stalk, more nitrogen is needed. If the leaves become sickly, fall off too early, or 
spot, the amount of potassium should be increased. Cotton should not be grown after cotton, 
as the plant tends to deplete the soil in important plant-food elements. A carefully selected 
rotation should be practiced so that the right balance of plant foods in the soil may be 
conserved. 
Planting and Cultivating. Cotton is planted in ridges. A single-shovel plow is used 
to open up a furrow. Fertilizer is placed in the bottom of this furrow and is covered by throw- 
ing up furrows on each side with a turning plow. When the two furrows are turned over the 
first furrow, a hill or ridge is formed in which the cotton is to be planted. 
When it is time to place the seed in the ground, a one-horse cotton planter is run along the 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
134 ‘ PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
tops of the ridges. This machine plants the seed in a continuous row. After the young 
plants have grown about three inches high, the first cultivation is given the crop. If the field 
slopes to any extent, a heel sweep is generally used. When the plants have reached about six 
inches in height, they are thinned out with a hoe, leaving from one to three stalks in each hill. 
This is called “ chopping cotton.” The cultivator should be used frequently to keep down 
the weeds and grass and to forma mulch. Sometimes it is necessary to go over the cotton fields 
with a hoe, but usually this can be avoided if cultivation is properly done. 
Harvesting. Cotton picking is done by hand and is therefore the most expensive labor 
item in the growing of the crop. The picking usually begins in August and lasts through 
November, and sometimes into the next year. The amount of labor available for picking 
limits the acreage of cotton. «After the cotton is picked, it is weighed and stored until a suffi- 
cient quantity is on hand to make a trip to the gin profitable. Ginning removes the seed from 
the fiber or lint, which is then packed in bales and tightly bound with iron bands. These 
bales usually weigh 500 pounds. When the cotton is to be shipped to a great distance, these 
bales are subjected to greater pressure at a compress that reduces them in bulk, so that they 
can be more easily handled. Much of the fiber is manufactured in the Northern mills, but 
within recent years the South has established many large and valuable cotton-manufacturing 
mills. 
Uses. Cotton is grown primarily for its lint, which is the most important fiber used by 
man. Formerly most of the cotton plant was discarded as useless; now every part of it is 
utilized. The manufacture of the oil from the cotton seed has become an important industry, 
. and the sale of the seed adds much to the profits of the farmer. The cake left after the oil 
is pressed out of the seed is valuable as a feed for cattle. It is ground into cottonseed meal, 
which is used as a feed and also as a fertilizer. The cottonseed oil is used as a substitute for 
lard and for olive oil. The stalks of the plant are utilized to some extent in the manufacture 
of paper.

LESSON 94 
COTTON BOLL WEEVIL 
The cotton boll weevil is about a quarter of 
an inch long, gray or reddish brown in color, and 
has a stout snout. This beak-like proboscis is 
rather long in proportion to the insect’s body. 
This weevil belongs to the family of beetles that 
breed in pods and seeds. It feeds only on the 
cotton plant. As it has a hard shell and spends 
the early part of its life inside the cotton bolls, it 
is very hard to kill. 
The adult weevils spend the winter in the 
trash, grass, and dead stalks in the field. Some- 
times shelter is found under the bark of trees in 
forests near the cotton fields. The weevils can 
stand severe cold although many of them are 
killed by frosts. Birds also destroy many weevils 
whenever they can find them. In the spring, 
when the cotton begins to form squares, the 
weevils that have survived the winter enter the 
cotton fields and the females begin to lay their 
  eggs in the squares, generally one egg to each Corron Bott WEEVIL. 
square. When the squares become scarce, the The lower part of the picture shows a cotton boll damaged

% a in the life history of this insect. 
three eggs are deposited in each boll. The 
female beetle eats a hole into the boll, deposits an egg in it, and then closes the puncture with 
the parts of the boll eaten out. The juices of the plant glue these pieces to the boll and the 
only mark left to show the damage done is a small wart-like protuberance. ‘ The young grub 
hatches in two or three days and eats the square, which falls to the ground. In about ten days 
the grub becomes a pupa without leaving the square. In about a week more the pupa develops 
into the adult and eats its way out and attacks the bolls. These are punctured and new eggs 
are laid in them. The grub this time hatches in the boll, where it remains until it is full grown. 
After it eats its way out of the boll, dampness and moisture can enter and the boll begins to rot. 
This process keeps on until the.cold weather comes and drives the beetles to winter quarters. 
The weevil is very hard to destroy. Poisons do not seem to affect this tough-shelled 
weevil, and therefore it is impossible to kill it by spraying. Many experiments have been 
tried to eradicate this pest but none has so far given general satisfaction. The only remedy 
that seems to be of any use is to use a strain of cotton that matures so early that the weevil 
cannot do much damage. Recent experiments carried on by the national government and 
by several state governments, seem to have established a breed of cotton that will prove to be 
immune from this insect. 
The annual loss to the cotton growers of the South from the devastation of this weevil 
is enormous. The weevil came into this country from Mexico through Texas and has now 
crossed the Mississippi River and is threatening the southeastern cotton states.

TOBACCO 
Tobacco belongs to the nightshade family of plants, which includes potatoes, tomatoes, 
and peppers. It was one of the crops that was grown by the Indians at the time America was 
settled. Sir Francis Drake is said to have carried the first tobacco from Virginia to England. 
Since then the use of tobacco has become common in every part of the world. 
Soil. Tobacco will mature in almost any part of the United States, but can be grown prof- 
itably only where the soil and climate are both suitable to producing a good odor and flavor. 
Loamy soils are best for tobacco. 
Planting. The tobacco plant is unlike most other farm crops, since it must be started in 
a seed bed. The seeds are sown in carefully prepared beds in which the soil has been heated 
to destroy all weed seeds. They should be covered very shallow, and will usually sprout in 
from one to three weeks. The beds should be covered with cheese cloth to protect the young 
plants from the spring frosts and from insects. When the danger of frost has passed and the 
soil is warm, the young plants are transplanted by hand or machine into the field. The 
plants are set in rows three to four feet apart, and from one to three feet apart in the row. 
Cultivation. Tobacco requires frequent shallow cultivations. When the flowers appear, 
they are broken off to keep all the strength of the plant for the leaves, which are the only 
valuable part, and as soon as the suckers or side branches appear these are also broken off for 
the same reason. 
Harvesting. There are two methods of harvesting. In one case the leaves are 
broken from the plant and hung in a shed to cure. In the other method, the stalk is split 
to within three or four inches of the ground and the entire plant is cut off at the top of the 
ground. Five or six plants are then strung with the tops down on a lath; and the laths are 
hung on poles in the barn. 
Marketing. The separate leaves or the stalks and leaves are allowed to hang in the barn 
until they are well cured. The leaves are then taken down and, if on the stalks, are stripped 
off and tied into bundles, called “hands.” The tobacco is graded during the stripping pro- 
cess. It is then ready to market. Cigar varieties of tobacco are put through a further pro- 
cess called “ fermentation,” be- 
fore being made into cigars. 
The price which is paid for the 
leaf when ready for manufac- 
ture depends on the uses to 
which it can be put and the 
quality of the crop. Much de- 
pends on the skill with which 
the crop is grown and cured. 
Diseases. Bed-rot troubles 
are common in many tobacco 
sections. This disease affects 
the growing plants in the beds.

PREVENT CROSSING, For checking it, treat tobacco

is fairly moist, with formalin drench, at the 
rate of 24 to 3 pounds of formalin to 50 
gallons of water; this to be applied to 
beds at the rate of 1 gallon per square 
foot, after spading up thoroughly. All 
stable manure should be placed on the bed 
before the treatment is applied. After the 
treatment no stable manure should be 
applied, although mineral fertilizers may 
be‘used. If the treatment is delayed until 
spring, do not sow seed until two weeks 
following the drench. 
House burn or pole sweat is a disease 
that causes the tobacco to rot in the barn 
during the curing process. It is most 
likely to occur during damp weather and 
when the tobacco is crowded in the barn, or is in barns that are poorly ventilated. Thorough 
ventilation of the barn is necessary to prevent the disease, especially during unfavorable 
weather conditions. Farmers should avoid overcrowding the sticks on the rails, or the 
stalks on the sticks. 
Common broom rape or hemp broom rape are parasites that attack the roots of tobacco. 
When much damage is being caused by this parasite, it is advisable to rotate crops on the 
infested land, which will aid in starving and destroying it. 
Insect Enemies. Cutworms are often common in a tobacco field if the land has just the 
year before produced a crop of grass, clover, or a similar crop. These crops favor the multi- 
plication of cutworms. Such land, if intended for tobacco, should be plowed in the fall. 
This causes the cutworms to be killed during the winter months, and gives the sod a chance 
to rot before transplanting time. Tobacco worms are perhaps the most injurious of the 
insect pests. Fields that have just matured a crop of tobacco should be plowed late in the 
fall after the crop has been removed and seeded to rye or wheat to prevent washing of the land 
during the winter months. This cultivation will also destroy the majority of the tobacco 
worms that are in the pupal stage in the ground. Tobacco worms that are eating the crop 
while growing in the field may be killed by spraying with arsenate of lead at the rate of 5 pounds 
per acre, or with Paris green at the rate of 1 to 13 pounds per acre. Many growers prefer to use 
a dusting machine to dust the tobacco with dry Paris green. The worms that are not poi- 
soned should be picked off by hand, otherwise they will continue to feed upon the crop. 
Shortly after the tobacco harvest, spray or dust the remnants of plants left in the field, 
and the weeds around the borders of the field with arsenical poison. Such insects as the 
tobacco flea beetle congregate on these remnants after the removal of the crop and may thus 
be poisoned in large numbers. If the trash in the fence corners is destroyed by fire late in the 
fall, many of the adult flea beetles that are hibernating in this trash will be destroyed. 
Varieties and Distribution. Some of the leading varieties of tobacco are: Pryor, White 
Burley, Zimmer Spanish, Dutch, Seed Leaf, and Havana. Our chief tobacco-producing 
states are Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Hotbeds are used for the production of early plants. In preparing a hotbed a pit is dug 
from two to three feet deep and from five to six feet wide. The exact size usually depends

about half the width of the one used on the north side. This arrangement permits the sash 
to slope toward the south in order to get better results from the sunlight. The ends of the 
bed are enclosed with boards and soil is thrown up around the entire framework to keep out 
the cold. The pit should be dug and the framework arranged in the autumn. The hotbed 
sashes are usually in sections about six feet long and three feet wide. The sections are some- 
times made to slide in and out on strips of wood set into the sides of the frames of the hotbed. 
The sashes may also be raised or lowered by placing hingesonthe north or south plank. The rais- 
ing of the-sash is frequently made necessary in order to secure the proper ventilation of the bed.

The pit is filled with well-heated stable manure about ten weeks before the time of outdoor 
planting. This manure is then covered with six or eight inches of rich soil that was collected 
in the fall in order that it might be ready for spring use. The soil should be kept moist while 
it is being heated by the fermenting manure. A thermometer is placed into the soil and care- 
fully watched for a few days. When the temperature falls to 90 or 85 degrees seeds may be 
sown. If the hotbed has been carefully constructed it will produce sufficient heat to grow 
plants during a period of five or six weeks. : & a WKY WW ROMA)

COLD FRAMES 
The cold frame is made like a hotbed, except that no manure is used. Sufficient heat is 
secured from the sun. The chief object of using a cold frame is to harden plants that have 
been grown in the hotbed. If plants like the tomato were to be taken directly from the hot- 
bed and planted in the open field, they would probably die. They cannot stand the great 
change from a warm toacold condition. If, however, such plants are first "hardened by being 
transplanted to a cold frame, they are able to stand considerable cold without injury. 
In the middle of the day, when the air is warm, the glass above the cold frames may be 
raised. This permits a better ventilation for the plants and at the same time hardens them. 
The sash must be replaced as night approaches. Later on the glass may be removed for the 
greater part of the day. It is usually the practice to have the sashes off both night aut day 
for a few days before the plants are removed to the garden. 
In our northern states it is impossible to grow early plants in a hotbed and cold Phe un- 
less additional protection is given. This is sometimes done by placing straw or hay over the 
glass. Hay mats are convenient for this purpose.

PLANTING PLANS 
Garden Plans. The farm garden should be located near the house. The soil should be 
rich and well drained. To obtain maximum fertility considerable stable manure and com- 
mercial fertilizers should be applied each year. 
In laying out the garden make the length much greater than the width. This will permit 
cultivation with a cultivator that is pulled by a horse. This method of cultivation will be 
cheaper than that done entirely by hand. 
Vegetables and fruits should be planted in rows and not in little patches. The fol- 
lowing plan is often used by gardeners. '

The garden, when arranged as shown above, can be tilled early in the spring and tended 
throughout the growing season with little labor, as the work can be done by horse-drawn 
cultivator. 
Farm Plans. Plans for planting all farm crops should be carefully outlined by the farmer, 
if he desires his farm to present a neat appearance. He should avoid planting orchards im- 
mediately in front of the house, as this space should be taken up with a well-planned lawn. 
The crops should also be planted in such a way that the ground will be occupied with some 
growing plant throughout the entire growing season. For example, in the corn region, at the 
last cultivation of the corn, rye can be planted. This will keep weeds down and add humus 
to the soil. Some legume can be substituted for rye if preferred. 
If an orchard is to be planted, select some protected spot if possible. Such a location 
can sometimes be found near a forest or on a hillside. Plant the trees in rows so that cultiva- 
tion can be carried on both ways if desired. Plant the early maturing varieties together to 
avoid driving over the whole orchard in gathering the fruit. The same course should be 
pursued regarding the medium and the late varieties. Where the ground is level and there 
are no forests to protect young orchards, trees are often planted to serve as windbreaks. 
A farmer should avoid planting his crops in such a way that many of them will mature 
at the same time. When this is done labor cannot always be secured to care for so much 
at once; hence a part of the crop must suffer. Where the crops mature at different times, 
all may be properly cared for. The farmer, therefore, to be successful in his work, must have 
some knowledge of the early, medium, and late varieties of all the different farm crops. This

is necessary in order that he may plan all his planting activities in such a way that the crop 
may be harvested at the proper time and that his labor may be employed regularly through- 
out the entire growing season.

LESSON 102 
SPRAYING 
A spraying mixture that will rid our 
trees of biting insects would be wholly 
inadequate to remove the sucking insects. 
Biting insects are those that really masti- 
cate parts of the plant; they consist of 
most of the injurious larve, many beetles, 
and the grasshoppers. To destroy such 
insects, spraying by arsenical poisons is 
generally sufficient. The sucking insects 
pierce the plant and draw the interior 
juices into their mouths. As the mark 
they leave is very small, it is difficult: to 
detect their work. Exterior spraying 
would manifestly be of no use in removing 
these pests, for their food supply is beyond 
the reach of poisonous sprays. To rid a 
plant of such insects it is necessary to use 
some strong spray that will kill them when it comes in contact with their bodies as they are 
feeding, or else some powerful gas that will stifle them. 
If the poison to be used upon plants is a powder, it may be easily put on by use of a 
dusting bag. This consists of a piece of sheer cloth, through which the powdered poison can 
easily sift. [wo of these bags are tied to the ends of an eight-foot pole, through the ends of 
which holes have been bored. The bags are so fastened over the holes that they may be filled 
by introducing a funnel into the holes and pouring the poison through the funnels. This 
insures protection to the one who handles the poison. After the bags are filled with the dry 
powder, the apparatus is carried on horseback through the field between the rows of infected 
plants. Generally the movement of the horse will be enough to jar out the dust as the plants 
are passed. If an insufficient supply is dusted on the plants, more may be added if the pole 
is jarred by hand. If only a small area is to be dusted, one bag may be attached to a short 
stick and the work done by hand. For garden work, some of the small bellows that may be 
obtained from any agricultural supply house are excellent. 
If liquid poisons are to be used, some machine must be employed that will break up the 
liquid into a fine spray. An apparatus that will do such work consists of a force pump, suit- 
able hose to reach the spot to be sprayed, and a nozzle or spray tip. There are many such 
machines on the market designed to meet nearly every requirement. For limited garden work 
a hand atomizer is sufficient, and even a sprinkling can will be found useful in small work. 
The barrel pump is one of the most convenient forms of sprayer for liquid poisons. The 
barrel is generally arranged upon wheels so that it can readily be moved from place to place 
as occasion arises. For larger operations it is better to have a specially constructed tank of 
large capacity. This tank is mounted on a wagon and has a platform erected over it from 
which the spraying can be done. With a machine such as this, the one spraying can reach the 
tops of all but our highest trees.   
  
A Power SPRAYER, 
   
-P-A-G-E-154
  148 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
If spraying is to be effective it must be done thoroughly. If the poison is a liquid, power 
enough must be employed to break it into a fine spray. To properly atomize the spray it is 
necessary to have a power of at 
least 75 pounds. If every part of 
the plant is not reached by the 
poison, the work will be wasted. 
More of the liquid is left on the 
leaves and other parts of the plant 
if the spray is fine. A heavy ap- 
plication causes the globules of the 
poison to gather together and run 
off the plant. Fruit trees of an 
average size require from 3 to 7 
gallons of spray to wet them 
thoroughly. For small trees, such 
as the cherry and plum, one gallon 
is sufficient. In spraying orchard 
trees, it is best to spray one side 
A Barrer Pump Sprayer. first, and then to return and spray 
the other. In this way a more thorough work will be done. If heavy rains closely follow 
spraying much of the poison will be removed and a new application will have to be made. 
Light rains produce little or no effect.

LESSON 103 
SPRAYING FORMULAS 
Arsenicals. Arsenical compounds are very useful in ridding our trees of the biting insects. 
Paris green is the best known and most commonly used of these compounds. It is a chemical 
compound of white arsenic, copper oxide, and acetic acid. It comes in crystals and should 
be ground to a fine powder to give the best effect. Copper arsenite is simply arsenite of copper 
and differs from Paris green in lacking the acetic acid. Arsenite of lime consists of white arsenic, 
sal soda, and water. Arsenate of lead, which is another of the common arsenical poisons, 
may be prepared at home. It consists of 3 parts crystallized arsenate of soda with 7 parts 
of crystallized acetate of lead (sugar of lead). Each of the ingredients should be dissolved 
separately in wooden vessels and poured into the spraying tank. 
Soaps. Any good soap is effective in getting rid of soft-bodied sucking insects. The 
aphids and soft larve of many insects are killed by it. Whale-oil soap and the different fish- 
oil soaps are very useful as insecticides. A soap made of caustic potash (not caustic soda, as is 
so often used) not having over 30 per cent of water is effective and is easily sprayed. For 
some aphids, a solution of a pound of potash fish-oil soap to 6 gallons of water is sufficient. 
For a winter wash for the San José scale, 2 pounds of whale oil soap boiled in a gallon of water 
makes an excellent spray. 
Pyrethrum. This is a commercial powder that may be bought from any dealer in insecti- 
cides. It acts on insects externally through their breathing pores. It is not poisonous to 
man or higher animals and is therefore safe to handle. It is very valuable against household 
pests, as ants, flies, and cockroaches. It is used as a dry powder or is mixed with flour. It 
should be dusted over the room or plants. If used on plants, it should be dusted at evening 
so that it will be retained by the dew of the next morning. If used as a spray, a solution of 1 
ounce to 2 gallons of water should be prepared. This should be mixed twenty-four hours 
before using. If immediate use is necessary, it may be prepared in boiling water. 
Sulphur. Flowers of sulphur is one of the best remedies for plant mites. It is generally 
dusted over the plants with a bellows when the leaves are damp with dew or rain. If used in 
a liquid form, it should first be made into a paste and then diluted with water in the proportion 
of about 2 pounds to 50 gallons of water. In making a lye-sulphur wash, 20 pounds of flowers 
of sulphur should be mixed into a paste with cold water and then 10 pounds of pulverized caus- 
tic soda (98 per cent) added. Water must be added from time to time to prevent burning 
until about 20 gallons of the concentrated solution is formed. Two gallons of this is enough 
to make 50 gallons of spray. 
Kerosene Emulsion. There are two kerosene emulsions in general use, — the soap and 
the milk. The soap emulsion consists of 2 gallons of petroleum, } pound whale-oil soap (or 
I quart of soft soap) and 1 gallon of soft water. The soap must first be finely divided and 
dissolved in boiling water and immediately added, boiling hot, to the oil. This operation 
should take place away from the fire on account of the danger from the oil. The whole mixture 
is stirred thoroughly and forced back upon itself by the force pump for about five minutes. 
The emulsion will keep indefinitely and can be diluted as needed. The milk emulsion is made 
by taking 2 gallons of kerosene and mixing with 1 gallon of sour milk. Heating is unnecessary. 
This emulsion should be prepared from time to time for immediate use. 
Washes. The resin wash has been found to be very valuable against certain scale insects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
150 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
This wash cannot be used where rains are frequent, but has been found useful in the arid 
regions of the West. It is made by using 20 pounds of resin, 5 pounds of crude caustic soda 
(78 per cent), 23 pints fish oil, and 100 gallons of water. The first three ingredients are placed 
in a kettle with water to cover them 3 or 4 inches, and boiled for two hours, water being added 
continually until the compound resembles black coffee. Dilute the final bulk with hot water, 
making a stock mixture. When used, the spray is diluted to full amount of recipe. The 
spraying mixture should be free of sediment. The lime-sulphur wash is another insecticide 
that is in common use. It is made by using 20 pounds of unslaked lime, 15 pounds of flowers 
of sulphur, and 50 gallons of water. The sulphur is mixed to a stiff paste and added to the 
lime, which has been slaking by the addition of water. The sulphur should be added while 
the lime is slaking and not left until it has become slaked. The whole mixture is then boiled 
for at least an hour in an iron kettle out of doors. After the boiling the full quantity of water 
may be added, and the mixture should then be immediately applied in order to get the full 
strength of the sulphides. 
Time to Spray for Biting Insects. For leaf-feeding insects, as thé Colorado potato beetle, 
blister beetles, maple worm, and shade tree caterpillars, the applications should be made as 
soon as the injury is seen, and repeated at frequent intervals. Fruit trees should never be 
sprayed in bloom, as there is danger in killing the bees that are very beneficial as agents of 
cross fertilization. 
Time to Spray for Sucking Insects. For aphids and other sucking insects that are present 
on plants during the summer months, the spraying should be immediate. The strength of 
the spray should not be great enough to injure the growing plants. For scale insects a winter 
wash of great strength is good if followed by a summer wash not so strong. Insects that hi- 
bernate upon the trees in winter may be killed by a strong spray without danger of hurting 
the trees. The summer washes are most effective against the young and should be commenced 
with the first appearance of the larva and should be followed by two or three additional appli- 
cations at intervals of two or three days. Winter washes may be used when it is impossible 
to give good summer treatments. Winter washes are especially valuable to deciduous plants 
with dense foliage, as spraying will reach all parts of the tree better when the leaves are off 
than when the leaves are present. Much less liquid is required in winter washes than in 
summer washes.

CHILDREN’S GARDENS 
Gardens for the instruction of children have been maintained in different parts of the world 
for centuries. It is said that Persian boys received instruction in agriculture and horticulture 
in gardens set apart for the purpose, over two thousand years ago. In the Middle Ages, 
gardens for educational purposes existed throughout central Europe. In 1869 a law was 
passed in Austria instituting gardens in connection with all schools in country districts. Much 
work is done to-day in France, Sweden, and several other European countries to encourage 
gardening among the children. The first school garden in America is said to have been started 
by Henry S. Clapp of Boston in 1890. This garden was originally intended for wild flowers, 
but so well did the work succeed that a large vegetable garden was added to the flower garden. 
CHILDREN’s GARDENS, Dayton, OHIO. 
   Children’s gardens may be carried on at school, at home, or on vacant lots near the school 
orhome. In speaking of a school garden, it properly means a garden constructed on or near 
the school grounds. If these gardens are impossible, owing to lack of space, or not desirable 
for some other reason, then the home or vacant lot garden is advocated. As a means for show- 
ing pupils how to plan their work, a sample garden is conducted at the school and similar gar- 
dens are made at home by the children. These home or vacant lot gardens should be visited 
during the growing season by the teacher or supervisor of gardening or some other person 
who may be selected to do this work. .The one visiting the garden can encourage the children 
in their work and also offer suggestions from time to time on the improvement of the garden. 
It is impossible to offer plans for making these gardens that would be suitable for all local- 
ities. Each school and home must work out plans suitable to its conditions. 
Each plot that is intended for a garden should be plowed and manured in the fall before
-P-A-G-E-158

it freezes. The freezing and thawing during the winter will assist in pulverizing the soil and 
will enable the child to prepare a good seed bed in the spring. The rectangular form of indi- 
vidual beds is best, and if not made more than four or five feet wide, it allows weeding and 
cultivation to be done from the walks. The length may vary to suit the grounds or rules 
adopted. The beds should be laid out according to plans that are adopted by those having 
the matter in charge, remembering to allow walks at least two feet wide on all sides of the 
individual beds. 
Pupils should not undertake the cultivation of plots or gardens that are too large, but 
should attempt to care for only an area that they can do well. It is important to so arrange 
the varieties planted that vegetables maturing at nearly the same time could be placed near 
each other, that these may be cleared away when matured and others planted in their places. 
This will not only admit of a continual use of the space but will also improve the general ap- 
pearance of the garden. 
Rules and regulations governing all work to be done by the pupils should be adopted. 
Few rules are needed for home gardens because only a small number of children are working 
in them. Judges who have had some experience in gardening should be selected to score the 
gardens and they should use a score card for all school and vacant lot gardens and another 
score card for all home gardens. 
The following score card is suggested for the school and vacant lot gardens.

LESSON 106 
PRUNING 
Pruning is the cutting back of the roots or branches of a tree or shrub to insure a better 
growth. Under natural conditions, where plants grow close together, all superfluous branches 
are crowded out. But in artificial conditions there is no such crowding, and the tree or shrub 
is not pruned by natural forces. The increased amount of food, light, and air, enjoyed by 
plants artificially planted, tend to make them grow more rapidly; and the branches each year 
grow longer than they would under natural conditions. By a proper use of the pruning knife 
a gardener may shorten this annual growth, reduce the distance between branches, and con- 
trol to some extent the shape of the tree or shrub. 
There are many reasons for pruning besides this desire to head: back tree growth. 
Pruning of trees is necessary as a protection against storms. The increased branch growth 
makes the tree less able to withstand high storms. Frequently, branches broken by a strong 
wind are found below large trees. With fruit trees, pruning is used not only to check growth 
but to thin out the fruit and to better the quality of the fruit left. Besides retarding growth, 
pruning also accelerates growth. If weak stock is cut back, new energy from the roots may 
be forced along one line of growth and not dissipated throughout a mass of branches. The 
result will be a better, hardier growth than before pruning. Old trees, especially apple trees, 
are severely pruned back to make them throw off new shoots. Pruning is also important in 
controlling plant diseases. 
When trees are removed from the nursery, some of the roots are necessarily cut and lost 
in the operation of digging them up. If the nursery stock is moved any great distance, some 
of the roots die. All mutilated or dead roots should be removed. When this removal takes 
place, care should be exercised to see that all root cuts are smooth and so made that when 
the root is placed in the ground it will bring the cut part in contact with the soil particles. 
With most ornamental evergreen trees, as little root area should be cut away as possible, but 
the fruit trees, as the apple and pear, will bear much more severe root pruning. When a tree 
has reached fruit-bearing size and does not show any evidences of bearing fruit, the roots 
should be pruned. If pruned about the first of August, such trees will put on fall buds that 
will develop into flowers the next spring. The process of pruning such trees is very simple. 
A circular trench is dug from three to six feet from the trunk of the tree and from two to four 
feet in depth. All roots that are reached by this trench are cut and the soil taken out is re- 
turned to the trench and the surface evened off. 
The food supply of the plant will determine to a large extent the growth of the branches. 
As the transplanted tree will have more room under its artificial conditions, the growth of the 
branches will be excessive in some cases. This is a condition that is not good for the tree 
and can be remedied by pruning. Top pruning should be more severe than root pruning. 
By branch pruning, the proper height of the tree and the arrangement of its branches may be 
controlled. In cutting out useless branches some definite plan should be in view. The 
branches that are left should be disposed about the trunk at nearly equal distances. If proper 
pruning in this respect is done, the main branches will be well placed and will provide a base for 
the symmetrical development of the other parts of the tree. The branches left should not be 
in the same plane, but should form a whorl about the axis of the tree. It is better to have the 
main branches of the tree composed of three or five equal-sized branches than of two
-P-A-G-E-161
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 155 
ill-formed branches. A tree that divides into two main 
branches and then subdivides into many others is apt to 
split and be very weak. It should be the care of the 
gardener to see that the tree is properly headed so that 
it will not branch into two parts. 
During the early years of both ornamental and fruit 
trees it is necessary to prune them severely. Trees 
generally make more rapid growth during the first ten 
years of their existence than later. At the close of the 
first season the growth of that year should be shortened 
at least a foot and each of the body branches should 
carry not more than three subdivisions about eight inches 
long. At the end of the third year, the same operation 
should be done, but the subdivisions should not be al- 
lowed to number more than two. The arrangement of 
the side branches should follow that of the main body 
of the tree. 
After the tree has grown to large size there will 
be found limbs that should have been pruned off earlier. 
The cutting out of these large limbs requires much 
care. All cuts should be made in such a manner that 
the wound will heal and not decay, thereby threaten- 
ing the life of the tree. In order to aid the healing 
of such cut wounds, they should be made as smooth ROOT DEBE eee CEES 
as possible, particularly around the edges. The best re- 
sults are often obtained by making two cuts. If the limb is very heavy, it should first be 
cut off a foot and a half from its origin; this will relieve pressure due to the weight of 
the limb. If the remaining part of the branch is now supported, it may be removed from 
the trunk without danger of splitting. Sometimes two cuts are made, one below the limb 
halfway through the branch and then a second above and close to the first cut. When 
annual growths are to be removed, the cut should always be made directly above a bud. 
Pruning can best be done in the spring months. Late winter or early spring is the time 
that most orchardists prune their trees. Some trees do better when the pruning takes place 
immediately before the first flow of sap. 
As pruning involves the wounding of the tree, it is very necessary that instruments should 
be used that will do as little damage as possible. Sharp, smooth cutting implements should 
always be at hand. Where a knife will serve the purpose of cutting out parts of the tree, 
the hawkbill knife is found best. Where larger branches are to be removed, the hand pruning 
shears are used. For high branches that cannot be reached easily, an arrangement of the 
pruning shears on the end of a pole is employed. Where still larger branches are to be re- 
moved, a saw is necessary. Pruning saws are generally curved and arranged with teeth on 
both edges. 5

GRAFTING 
If an apple seed be planted, the tree resulting from its growth will not be like the tree 
that produced the seed but may be similar to the wild apple trees that were the ancestors of 
our cultivated forms. Other fruit trees and some other plants produce 
wild, worthless forms from seed: and therefore, if we wish to grow 
trees of value, we must use some other method of reproduction than 
that by seeds. If we wish to start young apple trees that will produce 
a desired variety of apples, we graft small branches of an apple tree 
that bears such fruit, to young apple trees that have grown from seeds. 
The part to be placed upon the growing tree is called the scion; the 
growing tree which is to furnish life to the grafted part is called the 
stock. 
Whenever a scion is grafted to a stock, the resulting growth is of 
the same nature as the scion, never that of the stock. Grafting is 
done more to apple trees than to any other variety. First, it must 
be decided what variety of apple is desired to be grown. Having 
decided upon the variety, a branch must be cut from the tree about the 
same size as the part of the tree to which the scion is to be attached. Only healthy branches 
should be chosen as scions. 
There are many ways in which a scion may be joined to the stock. Whatever way is 
chosen, the principle of the grafting remains the same. Beneath the bark is a layer of grow- 
ing cells called the cambium. If growth is to take place in the scion, its cambium layer must 
be fitted exactly to the cambium layer of the stock. When these cambium layers join, a 
living connection between scion and stock has been established. All the different ways of 
grafting are but various methods of placing these cambium layers together. 
Tongue Grafting. Select the scion and stock, being careful that the scion is healthy and 
about the same size as the stock where the grafting is to take place. Cut the scion and stock 
obliquely, as a boy’s whistle is cut. Make a vertical slit across the cut surface. Join the cut 
end of the scion to the cut end of the stock, fitting the tongue part carefully so that the cam- 
bium layers will coincide. Wind the grafted part with grafting cloth or waxed yarn. Graft- 
ing cloth is made by waxing strips of muslin of the desired width. A 
grafting wax is used for this purpose. This method of grafting is used 
where the scion and stock are small. 
Cleft Grafting. Larger trees cannot be grafted by the tongue 
method. For these, cleft grafting is used. To use the cleft graft, the 
larger limbs of the trees are sawed off horizontally where they are at 
least two or three inches thick. The cut should be smooth and the 
bark should not be loosened from the wood of the tree. Split the stub 
vertically with a clean cut. The scion chosen for grafting should have 
several buds on it and its grafting end should be cut wedge-shape. 
Pry open the cut in the stock and insert the scion, being careful that 
the cambium layer in the scion comes in contact with the cambium 
Cunrr Grarrine, layer of the stock. If the stock is large and the scions small, two

scions may be introduced at opposite ends of the cleft. After the scions are introduced the end 
of the stock should be covered with a grafting wax made by melting together one ounce 
of tallow, two ounces of beeswax, and four ounces of resin. Grafting wax when made at 
home should be worked until it is light yellow in color. 
With a very few exceptions, trees can only be grafted when the scion and stock are closely 
related to each other. This method of propagating trees is used to increase the number of 
any one kind of tree in the orchard or to select a better variety of fruit. 
Select several branches of trees and shrubs and practice the various cuts until you become 
proficient in making a graft. Scions should be cut before they begin to grow in the spring and 
the whole grafting process should be completed before the sap has begun to flow freely. Select 
several apple trees in an orchard and graft selected scions upon them. Watch them as they 
grow throughout the succeeding years and note what improvement you have caused.

LESSON 108 
BUDDING 
Budding is another method of grafting. It is the simple process of cutting a bud from 
one tree and placing it under the bark of another so that the cambium layer of the bud will 
join that of the stock. Budding is usually done in late summer or 
early fall. 
Scions should be cut from a year-old twig of the fruit tree desired to 
graft. Only lateral buds should be used. With a sharp knife cut the bud 
out from a point half an inch below to a point half an inch above. A 
little of the wood may be taken out with the bud and bark; it is 
necessary that all the cambium layer possible be cut out with the bud. 
The lateral buds grow just above the petiole or leafstalk; and since 
budding is done while the leaves are still attached, a handle for the bud 
may be made by cutting away the leaf in such a way that about an 
inch of the petiole remains. 
To prepare the stock for the bud, make a horizontal cut across the 
stem where the bud is to be placed. From the middle point of this cut, 
draw a cut straight down the stem long enough to allow the bud to be 
inserted without crowding. Twist the knife sidewise to loosen the bark 
from the wood of the stock. 
Place the prepared scion inside the cut on the stock, pushing the 
bud down until it is firmly in place. The bud may easily be handled by the remains of the 
petiole. All of the bark that comes with the scion must be inserted in the cut in the stock; 
if any projects above, it must be cut off. Push the outside bark closely against the bud and 
tie the graft up carefully with rafhia or heavy twine. After three weeks the wrapping may 
be removed, as the budding will then have become complete. The bud will lie dormant 
through the winter and will grow the next spring. 
Budding, like grafting, can take place only between trees and shrubs that are related. 
Apples, crab apples, quinces, and the hawthorns are related close enough for budding purposes. 
Pears will grow on some hawthorns, and some chestnuts may be budded and grafted on some 
kinds of oaks. '

SHRUBS ON THE FARM 
Shrubs are useful for their own sake as individual specimens and for the foliage they 
give. Ordinarily shrubs are used for the first purpose, but they are far more valuable in heavy 
masses about the lawns and along the borders of the farm. They should be used to con- 
tribute to the general landscape design of the home. ‘Their decorative effect is a very im- 
portant one about the lawn and house. If they are planted in masses, their flowers will add 
much to their attractiveness. The heavy backing of foliage always sets off the colors of 
the flowers to great advantage. When planted in masses, they are more easily cared for than 
when distributed singly over the lawn. 
Single specimens are often ragged and untidy; but when planted in close proximity with 
other shrubs, they lose their irregularity and become artistic. If individual specimens are 
used in the borders of our lawns they will not need the pruning that they would need when 
standing alone in the midst of the lawn. The center or main part of the shrubbery mass 
should be planted in stronger, sturdier shrubs; and the lighter, more tender plants placed 
about the sides. If the shrubs are delicate and have highly colored leaves, they may be 
planted near the inner edge of the plantation. Shrubs that are chiefly valuable for their 
flowers, as the hydrangea, for example, may be planted just in front of the shrubbery bed. 
The area where the shrubs are to be set should be plowed or spaded thoroughly before 
the plants are set out. For at least two years the ground between the shrubs should be tilled 
regularly with hoes or rakes. Quick-growing flowers may be planted between them if grass 
will not grow readily. Larger shrubs, such as the lilac, should be set 4 feet apart, while 
the smaller ones may be planted as close as 2 feet. If the mass becomes too crowded after 
several years of growth, some of‘ the specimens may be removed. A mulch will greatly 
improve growth. Leaves falling among the shrubs should be left on the ground, as they 
make a fine natural mulch. Heading back young shrubs is of advantage; but when the 
shrubs become older, they should not be pruned. 
There are many shrubs to be found in all parts of our country that are valuable for 
decorative purposes upon our lawns and grounds. Those that grow well in the North do 
not generally do so well in the South. 
Make a list of the shrubs in your locality that are used for decorative purposes upon 
lawns and grounds. 3

LESSON 110 
FARM DRAINAGE 
Soils that contain too much water may be rendered fit for the growth of crops by drain- 
age. Surface indications of this need of drainage may often be found in the kind of plants 
growing in the soil. If the soil be too wet for proper cultivation, water-loving plants are the 
most common varieties of vegetable life that flourish. Sedges, mosses, and rushes will spring 
up where soil conditions are too moist for agricultural crops. If in plowing doubtful land, 
water oozes out behind the plow, the soil is in need of drainage. To verify these surface 
indications it is only necessary to dig a hole in the field five or six feet deep. If water stands in 
this hole, during the growing season, to within three feet of the top, plants will not find 
room enough for suitable growth. 
Any method that removes water from the soil is termed drainage. Ditches and open furrows 
are used to take off surface water, and underground passageways to drain the water standing 
in the soil. Surface drains are shallow channels made by the plow or hoe. Open-ditch 
drains are permanent surface channels. Covered drains are underground and are made of 
brush, planks, stones, or tiles. The great advantage of covered drains is that they allow 
cultivation of the ground above them. 
Drainage is valuable because (1) it deepens the root zone of the soil; (2) it increases 
the warmth and porosity of the soil; (3) it improves the texture of the soil; and (4) it enables 
plants to resist drought better. 
In all drains, gravity is the means employed to take off the surplus water, and the system 
of drainage used on the farm must be planned with this in view. The outlet of the drains 
should be at the lowest part of the farm and the main drains should be located in the lower 
part of the field, indicated by the direction taken by the surface water after a rain, and all 
converge toward the outlet. The grade, or fall of the drain, should be sufficient for the surplus 
water to run off easily. In open drains the fall should not be so great that washing of the 
‘banks takes place. 
Tile ditches are dug from 25 to 200 feet apart, depending upon the quality of the soil, 
and from 3 to 5 feet deep, this depth varying with the distance apart the drains are laid. 
A hollow, cylindrical tile is laid end to end so as to make a continuous passageway for the 
water. The ditches are then filled with the excavated soil so that cultivation may go on 
above the drain. The size of the tile used depends upon the length of the drain and the 
amount of water to be carried; the lateral drains always being made of smaller tiles than the 
main drains. Where a lateral joins a main drain, the union should be made at an acute 
angle to prevent a check in the current. The outlet of a drain should be protected with 
brickwork and a strong wire screen.

LESSON 111 
SOIL TEMPERATURE 
Soils must be warm if crops are to grow well. If the temperature of the soil falls much 
below 45 degrees for any length of time, seeds will not germinate. Temperatures between 65 
and 70 degrees are the best for the growth of crops. 
Draining a soil tends to warm it by diminishing the quantity of standing water in it and 
reducing evaporation. As much as a difference of 10 degrees may be reached by well draining 
the soil. In the spring, warm rains will frequently raise the temperature, but at all other 
times of the year the action of rain is just the reverse. 
The position in which the soil lies is a factor in determining its temperature. A southern 
exposure is always warmer than a northern one, as it receives the rays of the sun more directly. 
The farther north a farm is situated, the less heat it receives from the sun; land located in © 
the northern states is not as warm as land situated in the southern states. The color of a 
soil also influences its temperature, a dark-colored soil absorbing more heat than a light-colored 
one. Tillage influences temperature. Deep plowing makes the soil cooler, while surface til- 
lage, if it be thorough, raises the soil temperature by preventing evaporation. Decaying or- 
ganic matter liberates heat and therefore the addition of manure warms the soil. The dark 
color of organic matter is another source of heat. 
Prepare three beds of sand, clay, and humus soils. These beds may be made in pots or 
boxes, and should be placed out of doors under the same temperature and light conditions. 
Insert a thermometer in each soil to the depth of two inches. For five days record the ther- 
mometer readings as indicated below. For another five days keep the soils moist and record 
the temperatures as formerly. Study the results carefully.

RAINFALL OF THE UNITED STATES. 
The distribution of rainfall in the United States is determined by the direction of the pre- 
vailing winds, the presence of large bodies of water, and the topographic features of the country. 
The United States lies in the belt of the prevailing westerly winds and therefore the Pacific 
States receive the heaviest precipitation from the moisture-ladened breezes of the Pacific 
Ocean. The high mountain ranges near the Pacific coast cause condensation of the water 
vapor carried by these winds, and copious rains occur on their western slopes. After passing 
these ranges, the westerlies cross the plateau section as dry winds, and in this region the rain- 
fall is very slight. The eastern part of the United States receives its rainfall from the mois- 
ture brought in from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean by the cyclonic storms. 
Agriculture cannot be successfully undertaken wherever the rainfall is much less than 20 
inches annually unless irrigation is employed.

LESSON 113 
CROP ROTATION 
The growing of certain crops on the same field in such a way that they follow each other 
in regular order is called crop rotation. A rotation in which corn is planted in a field the first 
year followed by wheat the second and clover the third year is known as a three-year rota- 
tion. Some farmers grow the same crop on the same field year after year and hence do not 
practice crop rotation. 
Advantages of Rotations. Some of the advantages to be gained by practicing crop rotation 
are :— 
(1) Certain plant diseases, insects, and noxious weeds are destroyed by rotation. Finding 
anew field for the potatoes frequently eliminates the potato scab. The Hessian fly frequently 
disappears from a neighborhood when wheat fields are planted in corn or some. other crop. 
The thistle or “white top” that is so frequently seen in old meadows disappears when 
these fields are plowed and planted in corn or some cultivated crop. 
(2) Rotation permits the taking of plant food from different depths in the soil. Some 
plants like wheat, beets, and onions have short roots and thus secure their plant food in the 
first five inches of the soil. When corn or alfalfa is grown, because of the longer roots that 
these plants possess, the plant food is secured from a greater depth. 
(3) Humus may be added to the soil in fields that were formerly planted with tilled crops. 
If oats or corn were continually planted on the same field, the humus supply in the soil would 
soon be exhausted. Plowing under green manure plants replenishes the humus supply. 
(4) Rotation distributes labor throughout the year. In farming districts it is often 
difficult to secure labor for short periods. 
(5) Rotation furnishes a variety of crops which when sold at different times of the year 
produce a steady income to the farmer. This enables him to buy supplies when needed and 
pay cash, thus often securing a lower price. 
(6) The growing of one crop leaves the ground bare at certain seasons of the year, while a 
variety of crops permits a more continuous covering for the soil. 
(7) Rotation permits the use of legumes to improve the soil. 
(8) Rotation promotes the raising of live stock, since a variety of food is supplied for their 
support. When live stock are raised on the farm the farmer can feed his crops at home. 
This will furnish him with a large amount of manure and hence return to the soil a great 
deal of the plant food that was taken out by the growing of the plants. This plan will lessen 
the need for commercial fertilizers and reduce the cost of maintaining soil fertility. 
Types of Rotation. The farmer should select the type of rotation that is best suited to the 
local conditions. When selecting this rotation he should consider the soil and climatic condi- 
tions, the demands of the market, the cost of labor to produce the crop, and the presence of 
insect pests and plant diseases. 
In selecting the crops to be used in any rotation system the following kinds are usually 
cons:dered : — 
(1) A soil improving crop. Legumes are generally chosen for this purpose, as they supply 
nitrogen to the soil, but any crop that will furnish plant food could be grown. 
(2) A feeding crop. Feeding crops include all the fodder and grain crops and any others 
that supply food for the farm stock.  
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  164, PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
(3) A weed-destroying crop. Weed-destroying crops include those crops that are planted 
broadcast, or are grown and tilled in a manner that checks or prevents weed growth. 
(4) A money crop. A money crop is one that is grown to supply funds to keep up the 
farm expenses. Wheat, tobacco, and cotton are money crops. Corn is a money crop if it is 
sold instead of feeding it on the farm. 
The following are a few of the most common rotations that are used in different parts of 
the country : — : 
(1) The Terry rotation for building up a run-down clay farm consists of (a) clover, 
(b) potatoes, (c) wheat. 
(2) A three-year rotation generally used in the corn belt is (a) corn, (b) oats or wheat, 
(c) clover. 
(3) A three-year rotation in the tobacco-growing districts is (a) tobacco, (b) wheat, 
(c) clover. The clover is either cut for hay or plowed under. 
(4) A three-year rotation in the cotton belt is (a) cotton, (b) corn with cowpeas between 
the rows, (c) oats followed with cowpeas. 
(5) A three-year rotation in potato-growing sections is (a) potatoes, (bd) cana: or oats, 
(c) clover or clover and timothy. 
(6) Where alfalfa can be grown successfully it may be continued three years, followed by 
corn two years and some small grain crop one year. 
(7) A five-year rotation suitable for live-stock farming includes (a) corn, (b) crimson 
clover followed by cowpeas, (c) wheat seeded to a mixture of clover and grass, (d) hay, (e) hay 
or pasture.

PLOWING 
  A Piow. 
Parts of a Plow. The following parts are found in every good plow: — 
Standard. The main or central part to which the other parts are attached. 
Beam. The heavy iron or wooden part to which the power is attached. 
Handles. Used in guiding the plow. 
Clevis. A draft iron on the front of the beam, so arranged with a series of holes that 
the depth of plowing may be regulated by altering the place where the power is attached. 
Share (or point). The metallic point of the plow that first enters the soil and slices it 
from the land. 
Moldboard. The broad, flaring side that turns and breaks the furrow slice. The 
angle of this board may be changed and the shape of the furrow altered to suit the needs of 
cultivation. 
Landslide. The piece that locks the parts and keeps the plow in place. 
Coulter (not used in all plows). A sharp knife attached to the beam in front of the plow 
that cuts the furrow slice. Its tendency is to lessen the drag of the plow. 
Jointer. A part attached to the coulter to cut the grass or stubble before the plow gets 
to it. 
Truck. A wheel attached to the fore end of the beam to make the plow run steadier. 
Objects of Plowing. The objects of plowing are: — 
(1) To pulverize the soil so that the roots of plants may easily enter it and get the plant 
food. 
(2) To make the soil porous so that it can the more readily absorb moisture as rains fall 
upon the ground. 
(3) To allow air to enter and circulate through the soil and to get to the plant roots. 
(4) To prevent evaporation. 
(5) To alter the temperature of the soil. 
(6) To thoroughly mix manures or fertilizers with the soil. 
(7) To kill insects and weeds that are a hindrance to plant growth.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  166 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
. Time for Plowing. The time for plowing depends somewhat upon the kind of crop cul- 
tivated. Most of the plowing is done in the spring, but there are many reasons why a good 
deal of plowing should be done in the fall. Spring plowing tends to dry out the soil and should 
be done as early as possible. Early plowing allows the soil to become warm before planting 
and at the same time conserves the water in the lower soil for future use. If a cover crop be 
turned under in early spring plowing, humus will be ready at planting time and the growing 
crop will not have depleted the soil moisture. 
The advantages to be gained by fall plowing are: — (1) insects are killed by exposure to 
the fall frosts, (2) weeds are more easily destroyed, (3) the soil is acted upon both physically 
and chemically by frosts and water and more thoroughly pulverized, and (4) the land is much 
easier to work in the fall, (5) more water is stored in the soil. 
Depth. As a rule most farmers do not plow deep enough. If the lower soil is exposed 
to the air and allowed to disintegrate before planting, much new plant food will become avail- 
able. Deep plowing should be done gradually, a half inch or an inch of subsoil should be 
turned up each year until ten or twelve inches of depth is finally reached. Shallow soils do 
not allow plants to obtain a good root hold. The deeper the plowing, the less the land will 
wash and the better reservoir of moisture and air it will become. Clayey soils, when they are 
not liable to puddle, are benefited most by fall plowing, because it exposes them to weather- 
ing. Sandy soils, on the other hand, may be greatly injured by fall plowing, because they 
are alréady too leachy. In the sandy lands of the South, much harm is done to the soil be- 
cause the plowing is done at the wrong time.

TESTING GARDEN SEEDS 
Garden seeds may have a low per cent of viability. Very often they are too old. Onion 
seeds, for example, have low germinating power after the second season. Sometimes, un- 
favorable conditions of development or harvesting may cause seeds to lack vitality. Again, 
methods of storage may decrease germinating power. Some seeds may germinate and yet not 
possess sufficient vitality to develop into vigorous plants. Because of these facts, the germina- 
tion test should be applied to garden seeds. 
Place in plate germinators 100 seeds of each garden crop listed in the table below. In the 
blank spaces at the bottom of the first column the names of additional garden seeds may be

A STUDY OF BIRDS 
The prosperity of any state or nation depends largely upon agriculture, and any agent 
that serves to increase or protect the crops is one well worth studying. Birds, as they 
depend very largely upon de- 
structive insects for their food, 
are one of the most valuable 
of these agents that help the 
farmer. Were it not for the 
birds the loss to our crops from

         ee mS ane insects would be ss 
«' NS < 5 &, much larger than it is. 
knowledge of the birds that 
protect his crops is therefore 
very valuable to the farmer. 
While most birds are useful, 
there are only a few that never 
do any harm. Insectivorous 
birds, besides destroying in- 
sects that feed upon plants, 
often rid the crops of parasitic 
diseases. Sometimes useful parasites are destroyed, and then the birds become harmful to 
the growing plants. But in general the good that birds do offsets the harm. 
Birds that are often classed as troublesome really do much more good than harm. The 
only way to learn whether a bird is harmful or beneficial is to observe closely what it eats 
and when it is liable to attack the growing crops. The crow is very troublesome in the spring 
when the young grain is growing and sometimes destroys the eggs and young of useful insects 
and game birds, but its habit of feeding largely upon white grubs, cutworms, and field mice 
must be placed to its credit when we come to judge the economic importance of this bird. 
Most hawks and owls are useful, despite the general bad reputation that these birds have. 
On account of their wonderful powers of flight, birds are enabled to gather at short notice 
wherever there is an abnormal gathering of insects. An unusual abundance of grasshoppers 
will attract birds from a great distance and the ravages of these troublesome pests are greatly 
reduced until, as a rule, no grasshoppers are left after a visit of the birds. The increase in 
any locality of small rodents, such as field mice, will cause the birds to gather in great numbers 
until these pests are reduced. No other creatures are so well adapted to capture flying 
insects as our nighthawks, swallows, and swifts. The woodpecker saves many of our trees 
with its wonderful adaptations for removing insects found under the bark. Each kind of 
bird has its own special field of activity and in that field is generally very useful. 
The movements of birds are so rapid that increased circulation is necessary to furnish 
sustenance for muscles and breathing organs. For this reason their temperature is very PRIMAR | S-c

  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 169 
high and much food is necessary to sustain the active energies of the little creatures. Field 
observations of birds are generally not very accurate unless great care is taken. The pres- 
ence of a bird in the cornfield is not conclusive evidence that the bird is harmful. It may 
be seeking insects and not the grain. The indiscriminate killing of birds simply because they 
are found to be present in our crops is to be discouraged, and a more careful investigation of 
just what the bird is doing and what its food is, should be undertaken. A knowledge of just 
which birds are friends and which are enemies is therefore very important to our farmers and 
orchardists in order that the beneficial ones may be protected and the harmful ones driven 
off or killed. 
The bill and feet of the bird are adapted to the work that they are called on to do; thus 
the woodpecker has a chisel beak and the duck a spoon-shaped beak. The birds that perch 
on tree limbs have three distinct toes to their feet, while birds that swim are web-footed. 
Birds are generally classified into groups by the shape and structure of their bills (or beaks) and 
feet. Size, color, and habits are important, but are not as characteristic as these structures. 
Feathers are skin modifications like scales and hair, and are used for protection and 
flight. Feathers do not lie closely together upon the body of the bird but allow air spaces 
between them, thus giving warmth. Beneath the outside feathers is a covering of down which 
also adds warmth to the body. Plumage feathers are generally very valuable for their beauti- 
ful coloring, and many kinds of birds have almost been exterminated by hunters desiring to 
get their plumage feathers. Laws have been enacted in many states to protect these plumage 
birds from the ravages of the hunters. 
The wings of birds are suited to the special kind of work they have to do. The way in 
which a bird gets its living or escapes its enemies has a great deal to do with the structure of 
the wings. Birds that soar, like the gull and hawk, have large wings; while birds that live 
mainly upon the ground and have to rise quickly, like the sparrow and robin, have smaller 
wings. These latter birds do not need the power of long flight, but they do need the ability 
to rise quickly, so the wings are adapted for this special kind of work. The humming bird 
hangs suspended over the flower from which it gets the nectar; for this reason its wings have 
to move rapidly to sustain it. Some birds cannot rise unless they first run or swim quickly 
in order to get momentum. This speed enables them to rise into the air, their wings being 
too long for quick rising but large enough for continued flight.

BIRD MIGRATION 
In your locality some birds are permanent residents, some remain during the summer 
only, others remain during the winter only, and others are transients. The transients spend 
the summers north of your region and the winters south of it, and therefore you do not 
see them except for a few days in spring and fall, when they are migrating between their 
winter and summer homes. 
List the birds in your home neighborhood under the following headings.

LESSON 118 
FAMILIAR AND BENEFICIAL BIRDS 
Birds are a natural and practical means of ridding us of many of our insect pests. It is 
easy to exterminate birds but very difficult to get rid of the troublesome insects, so we should 
be very sure when we kill a bird that we are not destroying a real friend instead of an enemy. 
If birds are protected and encouraged about a farm, many of our noxious insects will disappear. 
Field observation of a bird eating is not always the best way to judge whether it 
is harmful or not. In order to be positive as to its food, the stomach of the bird must be 
examined and the kind of food determined from its contents. A careful examination has 
been made of most of our common birds in this way, and dependence may be placed upon 
the results of these investigations. 
The Quail. This is a well-known bird throughout most of the United States east of the 
Rocky Mountains. In the South it is called the partridge. Its familiar call has given it the 
common name of “ bobwhite.’’ In New England the bird is becoming less abundant, owing to 
its having been hunted so much for food. It is a ground bird and offers a fine study of pro- 
tective coloring. About 15 percent of the quail’s food consists of insects, and the rest consists 
largely of weed seeds. As a weed destroyer the quail has no equal. The bird is a good ranger 
and if unmolested will go from field to field hunting its food. It should be protected as far 
as possible, as its value on the farm is greater than its value on the table. 
The Woodpecker. There are five or six familiar species of woodpeckers. These birds 
are somewhat migratory, although some species never leave their homes. The woodpeckers 
do no damage to trees, although farmers are apt to look upon them as tree pests. A little 
careful investigation of their work upon the trees will easily show that instead of being harmful 
they are extremely beneficial. The two best known species are the hairy woodpecker and the 
downy woodpecker. These birds range all over the United States. The males are dis- 
tinguished by a bright scarlet patch upon the head. About three fourths of the food of the 
woodpeckers consists of destructive insects. Wood-boring beetles and their larve, and the 
insects that generally inhabit trees, seem to be their choicest food. These they get by drilling 
into the bark and dragging the insects from their burrows. The beaks and tongues of the 
woodpeckers are especially adapted for the work they have to do. Their beaks are chisel- 
shaped for digging into the wood of trees, and their tongues are so arranged that they can 
be thrust out very quickly to catch insects. 
The Phoebe. The phcebe breeds throughout the United States east of the Mississippi 
River and spends its winters in the South. It builds its nests under some overhanging cliff, 
bridge, or rock. The phoebe shows a great preference for farm society, and in the more 
thickly settled parts of the country is seldom seen very far from some farmhouse. The food 
of the phcebe consists almost entirely of insects, which are caught on the wing. Ninety- 
three per cent of its food consists of insects and spiders, while the rest is composed of wild 
fruits. Grasshoppers are eaten to a considerable extent by this bird, while wasps, many 
flies that annoy cattle, and garden bugs are consumed in large quantities. 
The Robin. The robin is found in almost all parts of the United States. It is a migra- 
tory bird and spends its winters in the southern parts of our country. The food habits of the 
robin have caused many fruit growers much apprehension. The bird is fond of cherries 
and other small fruits. It is, however, too valuable to be destroyed just because of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  174 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
depredations in our orchards. Over 42 per cent of its food consists of insects, while the re- 
mainder is made up of small fruits and berries. Beetles, grasshoppers, snails, and earth- 
worms are eaten. Of the fruits, the wild varieties seem to be preferred. The depredations 
of this bird seem to be confined to the earlier fruits. As the robin eats ten times as much wild 
fruit as it does cultivated fruit, it seems unwise to destroy it. The wild fruits that the robin 
likes are ones that man does not use at all. 
The Bluebird. The bluebird is one of the most common of our birds. It winters as 
far north as southern Illinois and southern New York. It frequents orchards and gardens, 
where it builds its nests in hollow trees or in box houses erected for this purpose. The bird 
does not prey upon any of our crops. Its food consists mostly of insects and their allies. 
It is an excellent friend to the farmer, destroying innumerable grasshoppers, caterpillars, 
and spiders.

POTATOES 
Irish Potatoes. The Irish potato is a native of America. After its introduction into 
Ireland and its general use there it became known as the Irish potato. It is a staple food in - 
the United States and in many countries of the Old World. It grows on many varieties of 
soils, but thrives best on a well-drained sandy loam abundantly supplied with organic matter. 
Seed Tubers. Seed potatoes should be of such size that their halves or other divisions 
would not be extremely small. The potato should be cut in such a way that each division 
should contain two or more “eyes” or buds. If the seed potatoes show any sign of scab, 
they should be treated with a formalin solution before planting. One half pint of formalin 
to fifteen gallons of water makes a solution of sufficient strength. If several acres are to be 
planted, use one pint of formalin to thirty gallons of water. This will not cost more than 
seventy-five cents and may be used repeatedly until all potatoes have been treated. Soak 
them in this solution for about two hours before cutting. 
Planting and Cultivation. It is very difficult to frame a general rule for giving the dis- 
tances for planting, as much depends upon the variety, season, soil, and fertilizers. They are 
generally planted in rows three or more feet apart, and from twelve to fifteen inches between 
plants. They may be planted by hand or with a potato planter. Potatoes require frequent 
shallow cultivation. Abundance of water is necessary for their growth and the moisture 
should be conserved by cultivation. 
Insect Pests and Diseases. The potato beetle is very injurious to potatoes. The plants 
should be sprayed with Paris green or arsenate of lead. If this is done promptly on the first 
appearance of the beetle, it can be easily controlled. Two diseases that attack the leaves 
are early blight and late blight. Spraying for early blight should begin when the plants are 
five to eight inches high, two applications of Bordeaux mixture being given two weeks apart. 
If affected with late blight three or four applications of Bordeaux mixture should be given at 
intervals of from one and one half to two weeks apart. Leaf burn is another leaf disease. 
The leaflets die from the tips and margins. Damp weather followed by hot sunny days are 
conditions favorable to the development of this disease. 
Harvesting and Storing. When the vines turn brown, die, and fall to the ground it is 
time to dig the potatoes. Very early potatoes are sometimes removed before this condition 
is reached. The large tubers are taken from the growing vine, while the small ones are re- 
covered to continue growing. The best method of digging a small plot is with a potato fork, 
while in harvesting a large area a potato digger is often used. Extreme care should be taken in 
digging not to break the tender skins of the potato, as this lowers their price in market and 
makes decay possible. In storing as well as in harvesting, potatoes should not be exposed to 
unnecessary light. While they will not stand a temperature below 32 degrees, too warm a tem- 
perature causes the sprouts to start. 
Varieties. Some of the well-known early varieties are Early Ohio, Early Rose, and 
Triumph. The Burbank, Rural New Yorker, Sir Walter Raleigh, and White Star are some of 
the well-known medium late and late varieties. 
Sweet Potatoes. The sweet potato differs from the Irish potato in that it is a thickened 
root and not a tuber. It is a native of the South and the best quality is produced in this 
section, but it is grown in many of the northern states. It is best adapted to a sandy soil.   
   
-P-A-G-E-183
PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 177 
It has no eyes as has the Irish potato and is started by planting the seed potato in hotbeds. 
When sprouts are from five to eight inches long they are pulled off and reset where they 
are to be cultivated. Sweet potato plants are set in rows three or four feet apart. In many 
sections of the country they are planted in ridges. They should be planted as soon as the 
ground is warm and dry, that they may mature before the killing frosts in the fall. If they 
are in the ground and the vines attached, the vines should be cut before the frost, as freezing 
of the tops injures the quality of the potato. After harvesting, the potatoes should be stored 
in a dry place which has a temperature of 35 or 40 degrees.

LESSON 121 
PEAS AND BEANS 
PEAS 
The garden pea is said to have existed in western Asia before it was cultivated as a 
garden crop. It has been one of the most important vegetables grown in the United States 
for many years and is a leading crop in many commercial gardens. It is one of our most 
nutritious vegetables. The pea is a legume and therefore is a soil improver. 
Soil and Climatic Requirements. The largest yields are secured on a cool, moist, but well- 
drained soil. The pea should be planted as early as the soil can be prepared, for it does best 
in cool weather. Considerable rainfall is required for a good crop. 
Planting. The method of planting depends upon the disposition that is to be made of the 
crop. When planted for a cannery, peas are either broadcasted and harrowed in or sown with 
a grain drill. When sown with grain drills the space between the rows varies from 18 to 36 
inches. Early plantings should be covered shallow, and as the season advances the seed should 
be planted slightly deeper. They are harvested with a mowing machine and a hay rake. 
Supporting the Vines. When peas are planted for the cannery, low varieties are used and 
hence no support for the vines is necessary. Brush is often used by the small gardener to sup- 
port the vines. Some gardeners plant in double rows 6 to 8 inches apart and stretch poultry 
netting between the rows to support the vines. 
Harvesting and Marketing. Peas should be harvested before they get hard. Small ~ 
gardeners usually sell their crops in the pods. The pods will present a better appearance in the 
market if sprinkled thoroughly with cold water after they are placed in the market baskets. 
If peas are raised for the cannery they are shelled and graded by machinery at the cannery. 
After peas are canned the cans are placed in boxes and shipped to all parts of the world. 
Insect Enemies. The pea aphis and pea weevil are the two most serious enemies of 
the pea. Kerosene emulsion should be applied on both sides of the leaves to prevent attacks 
of the aphis. This should be done as soon as the insects appear. Sprinkling the young plants 
with water in which tobacco leaves have been soaked sometimes prevents the aphis from 
seriously injuring the young pea vines. - The pea weevil injures the pea seed the same as the 
bean weevil injures bean seed. To prevent injury from this insect pea seed should be treated 
with bisulphide of carbon at the rate of 1 to 2 ounces to 100 pounds of seed. 
Varieties. Varieties of peas are classified as smooth and wrinkled, also dwarf, half-dwarf, 
and tall. There are dwarf and tall varieties of both the smooth and wrinkled kinds. The 
Alaska and Extra Early are important varieties of the Early Smooth Type and the Gradus 
and Thomas Laxton are good varieties of the Early Wrinkled Type. The Improved Stratagem 
and Telegraph are good medium varieties, while the Duke of Albany, Pride of the Market, 
and Lincoln are used for late planting. 
BEANS 
The common or kidney bean, from which all of our field and garden varieties have been 
produced, is said to have originated in tropical America. When the early settlers came to 
America they found the Indians growing beans. These early settlers considered beans a 
valuable crop. 
Classification. Beans are divided into two general groups, the field type and the garden 
type. It is only the garden type that is discussed in this lesson. The two divisions of the
-P-A-G-E-185
PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 179 
garden type are the bush and pole beans. Both the bush and the pole are again divided into 
the kidney and lima varieties. The kidney is further divided into the wax and green pod. 
Other names are sometimes used to designate different types of beans. Snap or string 
beans are those that may be eaten with the pod while green. Green-shell beans are those that 
are shelled and used before fully ripe while dry-shell beans are allowed to ripen completely 
before they are harvested and cooked. If the green-shell type is allowed to fully mature and 
ripen they can then be used the same as the dry-shell kind. 
Soil and Climate. Beans are grown on all types of soil and hence are raised in nearly all 
parts of the world. They are more widely distributed than any other vegetable. The lima 
grows best on light sandy soil. If early maturity of any type is desired it should be planted 
on either a sandy loam soil or a sandy soil that contains a good supply of humus. A very rich 
muck soil produces too much vine and not enough beans, hence is not satisfactory. No type 
of beans can stand a heavy frost, but the bush varieties are more hardy than the pole, and 
consequently are planted earlier. The limas are very tender and require a long season for 
growth. The dwarf varieties of the string type mature in six to eight weeks and are some of 
the first beans to be found on the market. 
Planting. Bean rows are made from 16 to 18 inches apart for hand cultivation and 30 
inches apart when horse-drawn tools are to be used. Beans may be properly planted with the 
corn drill if a bean plate is used. They should be planted about four inches apart in the rows 
and covered with sufficient soil to insure the required amount of moisture for germination. 
From three to six pecks of seed are used per acre. The amount depends upon the type of 
seed used and planting distances. The pole types are generally planted in hills 4 by 4 feet 
apart with from three to five beans in the hill. Poles 6 to 8 feet high are placed soon after 
planting for the beans to climb. This type is sometimes planted in the cornfield and the vines 
climb the corn stalks. They are also planted in rows and the vines permitted to run on wire 
netting placed for that purpose. 
Cultivation and Harvesting. Beans should not be cultivated when wet with dew or rain. 
Frequent shallow tillage with implements having narrow teeth or shovels is necessary for a good 
crop. Level culture is best until the last cultivation, when a small ridge can be thrown up to 
support the bean stalks. 
Marketing. Commercial bean growers ship their string or snap beans in hampers by 
express or refrigerator freight. Green-shell beans are usually marketed in small baskets. 
Bean Weevil. The bean weevil is the most destructive insect enemy of the bean. This 
insect is about one eighth of an inch long and is covered with a gray and olive down. The 
eggs are generally deposited before the beans are harvested. The most effective treatment 
to prevent the weevil is to fumigate the beans with bisulphide of carbon. This may be 
done in the following manner: Secure a tight barrel that will hold three bushels of beans. 
After filling the barrel with beans pour three ounces of bisulphide of carbon on the beans and 
cover the top of the barrel with a tight lid as soon as they are treated. Leave the cover 
over the barrel at least forty-eight hours. This treatment should be done in an open lot away 
from buildings, during daylight so no artificial light will be needed. This precaution is neces- 
sary because the vapor of bisulphide of carbon is-very inflammable. 
Anthracnose. Anthracnose is a fungous disease that attacks all parts of the bean except 
the root. . The infection even spreads to the beans in the pods. This disease can be detected 
by the spots or cankers that are black with reddish or yellowish margins. It may be 
prevented by planting healthy seed and by rotation of crops.

LESSON 122 . 
BEETS AND TURNIPS 
BEETS 
Soil and Climate. The beet is cultivated in almost every garden in the country but does 
best in a moist well-drained soil. It produces larger yields in a cool climate, consequently 
the best crops are grown in the north. 
Planting, Fertilizing, and Cultivating. The so-called seed is not really a seed but a fruit 
containing several seeds which are surrounded by a corky pericarp. The early varieties can 
be planted as soon in the spring as the ground can be prepared. ‘These varieties are usually 
ready for market in six or eight weeks. The long and half-long varieties are planted in April 
or May as they require four to five months for maturity. The oval and turnip-shaped varie- 
ties are better for a late crop because they can be planted after two crops of other vegetables 
have been produced. 
The planting distances between the rows are 15 to 18 inches when cultivation is done by 
hand, and 24 to 30 inches when horse-drawn tools are to be used. Seeds are planted by hand 
or with a drill about one inch apart in the row. The plants are afterwards thinned to the 
proper distance apart. The plants taken out may be reset to other rows or used for greens. 
Shallow cultivation is essential to the best growth of beets. 
The beet requires considerable plant food to produce an early crop of good quality. Ex- 
periment Stations advocate the use of from 600 to 800 pounds of nitrate per acre. This is dis- 
tributed at different times during the growth of the plants. The largest application is usually 
made the first time, when 100 to 200 pounds per acre are used about three weeks after sowing. 
Marketing. Beets are usually sold when small and tender to enable the gardener to 
prepare his land for another crop. When sold in large quantities the roots are packed in 
crates for shipping. Beets may be stored in cellar or pit if the air is dry and the roots are 
covered with moist sand or soil. 
Insect Enemies and Fungous Diseases. Flea beetles are the most destructive insects that 
live on the beet. They may be destroyed by spraying the plants with Paris green and arsenate 
of lead. The potato scab and the leaf spot injure the beet. These diseases may be avoided by 
planting healthy seed in soil that is free from the fungus and by practicing rotation of crops. 
Varieties. The common garden varieties are the Early Model, Eclipse, Crosby Egyptian, 
Yellow Turnip, and Long Dark Red. 
TURNIPS 
The turnip is supposed to have originated in Eurasia. It is grown very extensively as a 
root crop. Turnips are eaten by man and they are also fed to domestic animals on the farm. 
Many farmers bury turnips in the fall and keep them for green feed for their stock during the 
winter and early spring. 
Climate. The turnip grows in nearly all sections of the country but does best in a cool, 
moist climate. Because of its hardy qualities it is an important crop in cold latitudes. 
Seed Sowing. Two crops can be raised in one year in many sections. If an early crop 
is desired the seed should be sown in very early spring; for a late crop, sow from the last of 
July until the middle of August. If the turnips are to be cultivated by hand, plant in rows 
from I0 to 20 inches apart, and if a horse cultivator is to be used, make the rows from 25 to 35
-P-A-G-E-187
       PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 181 
inches apart. When an early crop is desired seeds are planted from 2 to 4 inches apart in the 
row, but if the later varieties are grown the seed should be planted from 5 to 6 inches apart. 
The seed should be thinly covered with loose, fine soil. Turnips are often sown broadcast 
at the rate of 23 to 3 pounds of seed per acre and raked into the ground with the ordinary 
garden rake. 
Enemies. Clubroot is the most serious disease of the turnip and cabbage. This disease 
also attacks the cauliflower, brussels sprouts, kale, radish, and kohl-rabi. The trouble is 
caused by a slime mold. When the disease has advanced for several weeks, the deformed roots 
are incapable of supplying the plant with sufficient moisture and nourishment. The disease is 
less serious with the early than with the late crop, and thrives best in acid soils. The use of 
stone lime to the extent of 75 bushels to the acre has proved to be a preventive of the disease. 
Roots, stems, and leaves from infected fields should be burned. Maggots are also destructive 
to turnips, radishes, onions, and cabbages. The application of carbolic acid emulsion is the 
most effective treatment. This emulsion is made by using one pound of soap, one gallon ot 
water, and one pint of crude carbolic acid. The emulsion is injected into the soil about the 
roots. Root crops should always be grown in rotation to avoid losses from attacks of insects 
and diseases. 
Varieties. The popular varieties of English turnips are the White Milan, Purple Top, 
White Egg, and Yellow Globe. The varieties of the rutabaga are the Kangaroo and the 
Holborn Elephant.

LESSON 123 
ONIONS 
The original home of the onion is supposed to have been in southern Asia or in the countries 
bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. The onion holds third place among the truck crops 
grown in the United States. In 1908 about 14,000,000 bushels, valued at $10,000,000, were 
produced, practically all of which were consumed in this country. New York, Ohio, Indiana, 
Florida, and Texas are leading states in the production of onions. 
Soil. Onions do well in well-drained loams that contain a large amount of humus. 
Large crops are raised on muck soils of reclaimed marshes. Green crops, fine manure, and com- 
mercial fertilizers are used to enrich the soil for onions. 
Propagation. Most of the onions grown in the United States are propagated from seed. 
This is done by three methods: (1) by sowing the seed in rows where the crop is to be grown; 
(2) by sowing the seed in beds and transplanting the seedlings; and (3) by first growing 
sets from the seed and then, after keeping them through the winter, planting them in the 
field to produce a crop of mature onions. Large growers practice the first method. Small 
gardeners often use the second method. If only a few rows are to be planted, sets are 
generally used. 
Planting the Seed. The planting of onion seed should be done as early in the spring as 
the soil can be placed in the proper condition. If hand cultivation is to be carried on the rows 
should be about 14 inches apart, but if horse-drawn cultivators are to be used they should be 
from 30 to 36 inches apart. Four pounds of seed per acre are usually used when the rows 
are 14 inches apart, and 1} to 23 pounds when the rows are 30 to 36 inches apart. 
By the transplanting process we secure an earlier crop, a uniform stand, and bulbs of 
more regular size. In growing onions for transplanting the seed is sown in hotbeds, cold 
frames, or greenhouses. ‘The rate of sowing is 4 pounds for each acre to be planted. 
When onion sets are planted they are placed about 3 inches apart in furrows and covered 
2 inches deep. From 8 to 10 bushels of sets are required per acre. 
Cultivation. Onions require thorough cultivation, which is usually done by hand. In 
some sections the rows are placed 3 feet apart and horse-drawn cultivators are used. In all 
cases frequent and shallow cultivation should be practiced. The weeding and thinning must 
be done by hand. 
Harvesting and Storing. Onions are ripe when the outer skin of the bulb is dry and the 
tops have fallen. They are then pulled and placed in windrows to dry out. After the tops 
are thoroughly dry the onions are taken to a drying shed. They are afterwards screened and 
placed in storehouses that are frost proof and well ventilated. 
Marketing. Large quantities of onions are sold and shipped directly from the field. Some 
of the best grades are held for the later markets. The Bermuda crop is usually put on the 
market in April and May, after most of the storage onions are sold. ye six pounds of dry 
onions are generally considered a standard bushel. 
Enemies. Onion smut and downy mildew are serious diseases of the onion. Smut 
attacks the entire plant and prevents the proper development of the bulb. It may be 
partially prevented by treating the seed with formalin solution at the rate of one ounce of 
formalin to one gallon of water. Soaking the seed for twenty minutes in a solution consist- 
ing of one ounce of formalin in one gallon of water is recommended for destroying the spores 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 183 
that may adhere to the seed. The mildew can.be prevented by spraying with Bordeaux, 
composed of 3 pounds of copper sulphate, 6 pounds of fresh lime, and 50 gallons of water. 
Cutworms and onion maggots do considerable damage to the young seedlings. No satis- 
factory means of preventing the work of these two pests has been found. 
Common Market Varieties. Important varieties of the yellow globe class of onions are 
the Yellow Danvers, Yellow Globe, and Ohio Yellow Globe. The white varieties are the 
New Queen, the Silver Skin, and the White Silver King. The Red Globe, Red Wethersfield, 
and the Australian Brown are among the most important red varieties. The important 
Bermuda varieties are the.Red Bermuda, White Bermuda, and Crystal Wax.

LESSON 124 
TOMATOES : 
Tomatoes are cultivated in nearly every American garden. They are also a field crop in 
sections in which canning factories are located. The leading tomato-growing states are New 
Jersey, Maryland, and Florida. 
Starting Tomatoes. Tomatoes are started in window boxes or hotbeds. The seeds are 
usually planted in March and the young plants are put in the garden or field when danger of 
frost is over. Sometimes the plants are started in small paper boxes, a single one to each box. 
In transplanting, both plant and container are placed in the soil. The paper soon decays and 
the tomato continues to grow without being retarded, as is usually the case in the ordinary 
method of transplanting. 
Soils and Fertilizers. ‘Tomatoes grow well in many kinds of soil and it is difficult to say 
which soil is best. Some gardeners, however, claim that a fertile sandy loam with a well 
drained clay subsoil produces the best crops. The most common fertilizer used by truck 
farmers is nitrate of soda. Stable manure produces a vigorous growth of vine and delays the 
fruiting season. For this reason, it is not extensively used in growing this crop. 
Cultivation. Cultivation is necessary to keep the ground free of weeds and to conserve 
soil moisture. In small plots, hoes and hand cultivators.are used. In fields, tomatoes are 
planted in check rows four feet apart in order that horse cultivators may be used. Three or 
four cultivations are given during the season. 
Frames for Plants. Where only a small number of plants are desired for the home garden, 
training of the plants is recommended. Some of the advantages of this plan are (1) the fruit 
ripens earlier, (2) the fungous diseases are diminished, (3) spraying, cultivation, and harvesting 
are more easily accomplished, (4) since the tomatoes ripen earlier, the ground may be used for 
some other crop. 
Harvesting. All the tomatoes on a vine do not ripen at the same time, and therefore 
several pickings are necessary. If grown for the cannery or the local market, the tomatoes 
are allowed to ripen before picking. If grown for distant markets, they should be picked 
as soon as they begin to turnred. When picked before they are mature, the individual 
tomatoes are wrapped in thin paper before being packed in boxes or baskets. 
Insects and Diseases. Flea beetles and cut worms are common insect enemies. The 
tomato is subject to many fungous diseases, most of which may be prevented by rotation 
of crops and by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. The spraying should begin in the seed bed 
and be continued about every ten days after transplanting to the field or garden.

MELONS 
The Watermelon. The watermelon is a very important crop in the Southern. States. 
Georgia and Texas lead in the production of this fruit. 
The seed should be planted in rich ground, well manured, and in hills about 8 by 8 feet 
apart. The manure used should be well rotted and the seed should be planted about an 
inch deep in the soil. A sandy topsoil with a well-drained subsoil is considered ideal for 
melons. Melon seed should never be planted until the ground is thoroughly warm and all 
danger from frost is over. The seed is usually planted in the open ground where the crop is 
to mature. In northern districts, however, the farmers have found three distinct advantages 
in starting the plants in hotbeds or greenhouses. These advantages are: (1) the melons 
ripen from a week to ten days earlier than in open air planting, (2) it makes possible the grow- 
ing of melons where the summers are short, and (3) serious trouble from the attacks of the 
striped cucumber beetle and other insects is avoided. 
Cultivation must be shallow and frequent. Many growers continue tillage until the crop 
is well advanced. ‘This is done by shifting the vines. Hand hoeing should be practiced dur- 
ing the entire growing period. Thinning should not be done until the plants are well started. 
One or two plants to a hill produce the best crops. 
Melons must be sent to market at the proper stage of ripening. If they are green, the 
quality will be poor; and if overripe, they will not carry well on wagons or cars. Experience 
enables one to determine the proper time to pick melons. The sound heard when the melons 
are “thumped ” is the most reliable means of determining the state of ripeness. Watermelons 
are shipped in bulk in box cars. 
The striped cucumber beetle is one of the most destructive insect pests to watermelons, 
muskmelons, and cucumbers. As poisons are not successful in controlling this pest, preventive 
measures are usually employed. Where only a few hills are planted in the garden, the plants 
can be covered with squares of mosquito netting, but this is too expensive for a large field. 
Air-slaked lime or tobacco dust may be used to prevent attacks. The melon louse is a serious 
enemy in some seasons. ‘The usual insecticides for these insects may be used, but it is difficult 
to kill them, as they feed on the underside of the leaves. 
Bacterial wilt is a serious disease of melons. Wilting is caused by the germs of the 
disease filling up the water ducts and preventing circulation in the plants. No reliable means 
have yet been discovered to combat this disease. Rust or blight often causes heavy losses in 
various parts of the country. This disease is most likely to be destructive in warm, showery 
weather in low altitudes, and where there is little circulation of air. Rust may be controlled 
by spraying with Bordeaux mixture, the spraying being done when the plants begin to vine 
and every few weeks afterwards to keep the plants free from the disease spores. 
The Kolb Gem, Pride of Georgia, Dixie, and Sugar Stick are popular varieties. 
The Muskmelon. Large quantities of muskmelons are raised in California, Colorado, 
New Jersey, Indiana, and Maryland. 
What has been said regarding the planting, cultivation, and enemies of the watermelon 
applies equally well to the muskmelon. 
The Rocky Ford is decidedly the most important variety grown in the United States. 
Other varieties are the Jenny Lind, Emerald Gem, Paul Rose, and Hackensack.

APPLES AND PEARS 
APPLES 
The apple which was introduced into North America at a very early date, is our most 
valuable fruit. It grows in nearly all parts of the United States, but the chief apple-growing 
section is the region bordering the Great Lakes. The fine orchards near Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario make New York the leading apple-producing state. Oregon and Washington are 
also noted for their large orchards of choice apples. 
Propagation. If the seeds of an apple tree are planted they will not grow into trees like 
the parent tree. In other words, a variety of apple does not come true from the seed as a 
variety of corn or wheat comes true from the seed. Therefore to propagate certain varieties 
of apples we must do so by means of budding or grafting. Usually young trees are produced 
by grafting buds of desired varieties on seedlings. Some trees are propagated by grafting 
scions to the roots of seedlings. 
Planting. Inthe second year after budding or grafting, the young trees may be taken from 
the nursery and planted in the orchard. The orchardist should select his trees from nurseries 
situated in the region in which they are to be planted. Thus, his trees are adapted to the cli- 
mate in which they are to grow. They should be planted in a well-prepared soil. Planting may 
be done in the fall or spring, and the trees should be set 40 feet apart each way. The hole in 
which an apple tree is to be planted should be sufficiently large to permit the roots to be placed 
in their natural position. Fine, rich soil is then placed about the roots and packed firmly. 
After the hole is filled, some fine, loose soil is scattered on the surface as a mulch. 
Tilling and Fertilizing. An apple orchard to bear good crops continuously must receive 
proper care. Tillage improves the texture of the soil, saves moisture, and makes plant food 
available. Barnyard manure should be applied and cover crops should be planted frequently 
to furnish humus to the soil. Commercial fertilizers should also be used. 
Pruning. After a tree is planted it should be pruned. Three or four side branches are 
chosen for the main limbs and these are cut back to within six inches of the stem. All the other 
branches are removed close to the stem and then the top is cut back. During the life of the 
tree pruning should be done. Summer pruning is said to éncourage fruit production, while 
winter pruning is said to increase the growth of wood. 
Spraying. The insect enemies and some plant diseases of the apple may be partially 
controlled by spraying. Fire blight and canker which affect the apple crop cannot be controlled 
by spraying. Branches affected with either of these diseases should be cut off. 
Varieties. Some summer varieties of apples are Yellow Transparent, Red Astrachan, 
Duchess, and Early Harvest. Fall varieties include Rambo, Fall Pippin, Maiden Blush, Bell- 
flower, Grimes Golden. Ben Davis, Wine Sap, Rome Beauty, and Winter Banana are winter 
varieties. 
PEARS 
The pear is a native of Europe and was brought to America by the early colonists. It 
thrives best in America in the regions extending west from the New England States to the 
Great Lakes, and in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. The growing of the 
pear tree is becoming more common in the Southern States, where the climate is too hot for 
the successful growing of the apple.
-P-A-G-E-193
  PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 187 
Propagation and Care. Pear trees grow best on a heavy clay soil. The trees are started 
in the same manner as those of the apple. They are planted from twenty to twenty-five feet 
apart each way. Pear trees demand good care to make the crop a success. They suffer 
more from the lack of proper attention than do apple trees. When the fruit appears, if the 
pears are too thick on the tree, they should be thinned to four or five inches apart. This will 
improve the fruit. Pears are usually picked before fully ripe and stored in a moderately cool 
place to ripen. 
Diseases. Pears are often attacked by a disease known as leaf blight, which causes the 
leaves to die and fall off, the twigs to become black and dead, and the fruit imperfect. Bor- 
deaux mixture is the most common remedy for the disease and should be applied as soon as the 
first leaves are opened. Fire blight or twig blight is also a serious disease of the pear, quince, 
and apple. When the tree is affected by this disease, the leaves look as though they had been 
scorched by fire, but they do not fall off. The fire blight is caused by bacteria that grow in 
the cambium layer. The plant suffers because the nourishment in the cambium, where the 
growth of new wood takes place,' is utilized by the bacteria. These bacteria are carried to 
healthy trees by insects. Treatment that will destroy insect pests of the orchard will assist 
in keeping the trees free from fire blight. In addition to the apple and quince, the crab, haw- 
thorn, and mountain ash trees must be carefully watched, as the disease is often transmitted 
from them to the pear. When a tree shows blight, every diseased twig should be cut off and 
burned to destroy the bacteria. These twigs should be cut off about twelve inches below the 
blackened portion. This plan will make sure that the diseased parts are removed. The 
blade of the knife used in cutting should be dipped in a solution of carbolic acid after each twig” 
is removed. The acid will kill all the bacteria clinging to the blade and thus prevent the 
spread of the disease. If several large limbs are affected, it is advisable to cut and burn the 
entire tree. Trees should be examined in both fall and spring for evidences of the blight. 
Varieties. The varieties that have proven most satisfactory over the greatest range of 
territory are the Bartlett, Keiffer, Flemish Beauty, Seckel, Clapp’s Favorite, Duchess, and 
Wilder’s Early. Some varieties cannot fertilize their own blossoms and must be planted near 
other varieties so that cross fertilization may be accomplished.

PEACHES AND PLUMS 
PEACHES 
Peaches were grown in Virginia previous to the year 1650, and New Jersey and Delaware 
were famous for their peaches as early as 1800. This fruit thrives in nearly all parts of the 
United States except New England. Georgia, Alabama, Maryland, Michigan, and Cali- 
fornia are states that have become famous for their crops of peaches. 
Propagation and Care. Near the end of summer a bud from a peach tree of the desired 
variety is budded to a seedling grown from a seed planted in the spring. In the next spring 
the portion above the bud is cut off and the bud develops into a shoot four or five feet high. 
In the fall of the same year the young peach tree is removed from the nursery and sold. Peach 
trees are planted about 20 feet apart, and seem to do best on arich, sandy loam. The methods 
of planting, tilling, fertilizing, and pruning are, in a general way, similar to those used with 
apple trees. 
Enemies. Peach yellows is a disease that causes the peach to ripen too soon. The 
leaves on trees affected with this disease come out.in tufts and are yellowish in color. The 
cause of the disease is not fully understood. All affected trees should be destroyed by fire. 
Brown rot or fruit mold is a disease that attacks the unripe fruit and causes it to become soft 
and brownish in color. A little later the peach so affected is covered with a coat of mildew. 
It can be partially prevented by spraying the tree several times with Bordeaux mixture. 
The disease known as “ peach curl” may be prevented by spraying with a weak solution 
of Bordeaux mixture before the buds open in the spring. 
The San José scale does serious injury to the peach crop. A lime-sulphur treatment is used 
in some sections of our country. Some authorities claim there are certain insects that will 
destroy the San José scale. If this proves to be true, these useful insects will be introduced in 
large numbers in peach-growing sections. (See Lesson 136, San José scale.) The peach-tree borer 
injures the tree by boring into the tree trunks. Young trees are often girdled, and the vitality of 
old trees seriously impaired by borers. The presence of borers may be detected by the exuding 
gum found on the tree trunks. If only a few trees are affected, the larve may be dug out with 
aknife. Some fruit men claim that a frequent application of a lime-sulphur solution on the 
trunks of the trees will prevent the borers from entering the bark. As new materials are con- 
stantly being used as sprays for nearly all plant diseases and insect pests, it is best to consult 
your State Experiment Station before using any spray. 
Varieties. Freestone varieties commonly grown are Elberta, Champion, Lemon Free, 
Early Crawford, and Late Crawford. Clingstone varieties are Lemon Cling, Carmen, 
and Heath Cling. The flesh of the peach in the freestone varieties comes loose from the 
. seed easily, while in the clingstone kinds it sticks closely to the seed and has to be cut 
away. f 
Fruits Resembling the Peach. The apricot is grown most extensively in California, 
where it was introduced at an early date. It is cultivated and cared for the same as the 
peach. It blossoms very early, and consequently is often killed by frost, hence is difficult to 
raise except in warm climates. 
The nectarine is a kind of peach that has a smooth skin. It requires the same cultiva- 
tion and care as does the peach.

PLUMS 
There are a great many varieties of plums raised in America, and most of them came from 
foreign ancestors. Southeastern and western Asia and southeastern Europe were the homes of 
many varieties that have been brought into the New World. _ There are many varieties, also, 
that have come from American ancestors. The trees can be grown in nearly every part of the 
United States. The seedlings, grown ffom seeds, are generally budded at the end of one or 
two years’ growth; and the trees begin to bear fruit when three or four years old. They are 
planted about twenty feet apart and do better if planted in soil heavier than that used for 
peaches. 
The conditions that favor peach growth are also good for plums, and the methods of 
planting, cultivating, fertilizing, and pruning are about the same for each. 
Varieties. The varieties of plums differ more widely than those of the peach, coming as 
they do from more distinct species. Of all the varieties there are three general or common 
types: first, the common plum or European plum, of which the best known varieties are the 
Lombard, Bradshaw, Green Gage, Prune, and the Damson; second, the Japanese plums, which 
are adapted to a wider range of country than the first type; third, the native plums, which are 
especially adapted to the plains and the southern sections of the country. There are some 
varieties of this third type that thrive in the cooler North. Wherever the first two types can 
be grown, the native plums are. not popular. The native plums are much hardier, and there- 
fore can be used under more severe conditions. Of the Japanese plums, the Red June, Abun- 
dance, Chabot, and Satsuma are the best. The Berger is an excellent early plum. The 
Lombard plum of the European type and the Wild Goose of the native type are more widely 
distributed than all the other varieties. The Weaver, Quaker, Wayland, and Forest Garden 
are all good varieties of the native type. 
Enemies. The plum curculio is one of the most serious enemies of the plum. The 
plum gouger is an insect that resembles the curculio in its destructive work. It lays its eggs 
in the plum, but makes nocrescent mark like the curculio. The adult insect also does a great 
deal of damage by eating into the flower. The same methods of prevention are used with this 
pest as are employed in regard to the plum curculio. The same brown rot that attacks the 
peach is an enemy of the plum. It first appears in the form of brown spots, and generally is 
more prevalent in wet weather thanindry. The infested fruits should be burned and Bordeaux 
mixture used. Black knot is easily recognized by the swellings on the twigs and small 
branches. As the knots grow older they become darker in color. If the tree is badly infected, 
the twigs and branches should be cut out. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture will sometimes 
prove of value.

GRAPES 
The grape is one of the oldest cultivated plants and was grown in the Old World before 
America was discovered. The Old World type of grape has been cultivated in America with 
success in a very limited territory in the western part of our country. Most of our successful 
varieties have been produced from native species. These native species can be grown in almost 
all parts of the country, but thrive best in regions bordering the Great Lakes. 
Propagation and Pruning. Grapevines are propagated from seed, cuttings, layers, and 
grafts upon old vines. If cuttings are to be used, they should be taken from the more mature 
wood rather than from the soft young wood. The vines grow best when planted in a warm 
fertile soil. The rapid growth of the vines makes severe annual pruning necessary. ‘This 
plan reduces the amount of wood and limits the quantity of fruit produced. The pruning 
may be done in either winter or early spring. The twigs taken off can be used as cuttings to 
start new vines. 
Uses of Grapes. Grapes are eaten raw, made into grape butter, and used for making 
grape juice, wine, and raisins. ; 
Enemies. The grape phylloxera is a serious pest, and its work can be detected by the galls 
upon the grape leaf. The Clinton grape is the variety more seriously affected by the phyl- 
loxera because it is not a strong resistant variety. The mildew, anthracnose, and black rot 
are the most serious diseases. The vines should be sprayed regularly to prevent these diseases. 
Special attention should be given the black rot as it probably destroys one fourth of the annual 
crop. If this disease is present, the fruit shows brown decayed spots which finally become dark 
and rough with small spore-producing pimples. The fungus of this disease also attacks the 
leaves, tendrils, and the canes of the grape. All affected parts become the source of new 
infection, hence should be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. The vineyard should 
be kept free from weeds and the vines pruned and trained so that good ventilation can be se- 
cured. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture is the most common means of preventing this dis- 
ease. The first spraying should be given when the second leaf appears; the second, before the 
blossoms open, and the third, after they have fallen. The fourth and fifth applications are 
sometimes given about two weeks apart, after the berries have partly matured. 
Varieties. Popular varieties that are grown over the greater part of the country are the 
Concord, Worden, Niagara, Delaware, and Brighton.

LESSON 129 
THE PLANTING AND CULTIVATION OF CORN 
The Chief Crop of the United States. Corn has played an important part in the history 
of our country. When the early New England colonists came to this country, they found 
the Indian using it as his staple food product. The colonists soon learned to grow it and 
many would have died from starvation had it not been for this grain. Under the careful 
tillage given corn in the United States, it now furnishes twice as much food per acre as any 
other of our grains. Although it is raised in every state in the Union, the largest and best 
crops are grown in what is known as the corn belt, comprising the states of Iowa, Illinois, 
Kansas, Missouri, Indiana, Nebraska, and Ohio. Many Southern States are now growing 
great quantities of corn, and it is not unlikely that there will be a southern corn belt in a short 
time. 
Soilfor Corn. The corn plant will adapt itself to various kinds of soil if the proper amount 
of moisture is present, but the richer the soil, the heavier will be the yield of grain. Good 
results are obtained by plowing under a clover sod that has been manured with well-protected 
stable manure. If stable manures cannot be obtained, commercial fertilizers should be used, 
especially to supply the phosphoric acid and potash. To supply the necessary nitrogen, the 
farmer should grow legumes in his rotation. If corn is to be planted two years in succession, 
rye can be planted in the corn at the last cultivation. This should be plowed under the next 
- spring and will help to keep up the supply of humus in the soil. 
Preparing the Seed Bed. Land for corn must first be plowed. With some land, fall plow- 
ing is practiced ; with other ground spring plowing is advisable. Fall plowing enables the rain- 
fall to penetrate the subsoil. In the spring these fields may have a dry surface but much 
moisture has been stored. If ground is plowed in the spring, it should be done as early as the 
ground will permit before the early rains. After plowing, the land should be harrowed. The 
fall plowed land sometimes requires disking before it is harrowed. If the clods are large and 
hard to pulverize, drags and rollers are used. Many farmers use the drag just before 
planting in order that the seed bed may be level and well prepared. 
Planting. After the seed bed has been prepared, corn may be planted if the soil is warm. 
In the Southern States the planting may be as early as March or April; in the Central States, 
in May; and in the Northern States, the last of May or the first of June. Corn should, of 
course, not be planted in cold or wet ground simply because the planting time has arrived; 
but by proper methods the farmer should have his land in good condition to plant at the 
proper time. The corn should be carefully tested before it is planted. It should also be 
graded after it is tested. The grading removes all the large, small, and irregular shaped grains 
that might not feed regularly through the planter. If thé corn is hilled, from two to four 
kernels are dropped in each hill, and these should be covered from one to two inches deep, 
depending upon the soil and the climatic conditions. 
Cultivation. A few days after the planting, the cornfield should be harrowed to loosen 
the top soil and to kill the grass and weeds that start before the corn is up. The harrow 
should be used again when the corn plants are from a half inch to an inch high. A little work 
at this stage of growth will save many days of labor during the rest of the season. The culti- 
vation of the corn should be frequent enough to keep down weeds and to maintain a loose 
soil mulch. A greater number of cultivations will be necessary if there is much rain that 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  192 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
causes the surface soil to crust. The soil mulch must be restored or the moisture will be lost 
by evaporation. If the soil demands it, shallow cultivation should be kept up until the corn 
is tasseling. Many crops are cut short by stopping the cultivation when the corn becomes 
too tall. Should the corn be too large for the use of a double cultivator, a one-horse cultivator 
can be used. Deep culture of corn is not advisable. The roots in their early stages are 
shallow feeders and by the time the corn is about two feet high they extend from row to row 
only a few inches below the surface. The cultivation that destroys or disturbs the roots in- 
jures the plants and lessens the yield.

THE HOME BEAUTIFUL 
It is just as important that 
the buildings and grounds of our 
“farms should be attractive as that 
our crops should be successful. 
A pleasing home is restful and 
helps to lighten labor and make 
life more worth while. Besides 
the personal satisfaction from liv- 
ing in inviting surroundings, they 
add to the money value of any 
farm. A farmer who is slack in 
attending to the comforts and 
beauty of his home is very apt to 
be neglectful of his crops. 
Before any building is erected 
or before any alterations are to 
be made upon buildings in use, 
careful study should be made of the natural environment, so that every advantage may be 
taken of natural features. There should be a unity to all plans of building and ground plant- 
ing. Buildings, trees, shrubs, and vines should harmonize as much as possible. 
Walks. Only those that are absolutely necessary should be built. As a rule, the 
natural type of walk is. preferable. Straight walks impress the visitor as being forbidding. 
Nature does not work in straight lines, and we should follow her methods as far as 
possible. 
Lawns. There is nothing more inviting and beautiful than a well-planned and well- 
kept lawn. It adds beauty of color and gives an opportunity for fresh air to reach the build- 
ings. Trees and shrubs should not be scattered over the lawn, but should be grouped as 
naturally as possible about the sides of the grass plot. In order to have a beautiful lawn there 
should be a good stand of grass. The seed used for the lawn grass should be pure and not’ 
contain a mixture of grasses that do not harmonize in colors. 
Trees and Shrubs. Trees should never be scattered about. Only small ones that grow 
readily should be used. The trees should be so planted that the good views from the home 
are not interrupted. Shrubs should not be planted singly, but be grouped with an eye to 
color and growing effects. Tall, upright shrubs may be placed in the middle of groups and 
the lower shrubs planted about them. Strive to have the growth as natural as possible. 
Groups of shrubs are more pleasing when they are made up of several varieties than when they 
contain but one kind. The varieties must not contrast too strongly, however. Vines are 
useful for hiding buildings that are unsightly and for covering fences. Permanent vines are 
best for the grounds as they do not have to be replanted continually. The English ivy, the 
Japanese ivy, the Virginia creeper, and the honeysuckle are probably the most used of all our 
vines for decorative purposes. If fast-growing vines are desired, the sweet pea, morning-glory, 
and moonflower may be planted.

LESSON 131 
LANDSCAPE GARDENING 
Landscape gardening is an art in itself and 
most farmers are not prepared to give it much 
attention. However, there are some rules that 
govern proper planting and laying off of the 
grounds that can be followed to advantage. 
It is well to have the home grounds laid off as 
artistically as possible and no grave mistake 
will be made by an intelligent home-maker if 
a few simple laws are followed. 
There are two methods generally followed 
in laying off the home grounds. In one of 
these the walks, drives, bushes, and shrubs are 
set about in formal designs and trimmed and 
trained into some geometrical shape. This 
style of ground decoration is much used in 
Italy and is known as the Italian style. In 
the other method the grounds are planted and laid off as nearly natural as possible. As this 
kind of gardening is much used in England it is called the English style. A combination of 
both these styles is sometimes desirable. 
The type of gardening chosen depends much on location, the style of house, and the individ- 
ual preferences of the owner. If the grounds are large, the natural type is, perhaps, best 
because not so much work is necessary to keep the grounds in good condition. Where large 
sweeps are to be had from the house, a natural planting will be found to be much more pleasing. 
Geometrical forms and designs are often tedious to the eye after they have become very 
familiar with long use. 
When the grounds are to be laid out, the first thing to do is to decide which of these two 
schemes of planting is to be used. After this is done a careful plan should be made, and every 
bush should be noted in the exact location where it is to be set. A clear and concise knowledge 
of what is to be planted and where, should be in the mind of the farmer before anything is 
put in the ground. The first consideration is that the final effect should be harmonious. 
The topography of the land, the position of the farm buildings, drainage, sunlight, winds, 
and color effects should all be considered before any work is attempted. 
A careful regard to a few things will greatly help the looks of the farm. There should be 
one idea to the whole plan and small details should not be allowed to mar this unity by being 
too prominent. All trees, shrubs, and other plants should not only harmonize with each 
other in color but they should help the general color scheme. The cost of the garden planting 
should not be too much. It is sometimes very foolish to follow out a plan in which the cost 
will be excessive.

THE SCHOOL GROUNDS 
Many school grounds both in the city and rural districts are bare of all forms of vegeta- 
tion. Aside from protecting the school building, one of the strongest reasons for school 
ground planting is that it adds to the comfort and pleasure of both teacher and pupil. Better 
work can be done in congenial surroundings than can be accomplished when the environment 
is unpleasing. 
The planting of trees and shrubs on the grounds has an educative value aside from its 
protective value. The knowledge of plant life, the ability to raise something, is just as much a 
part of school education as the matter to be derived from the usual textbook. Students 
interested in beautifying the school grounds can gain in the work no little amount of actual 
knowledge of right principles and methods of growing plants. Some knowledge of tree cul- 
ture will be of great advantage on the home farm, and very often this knowledge can be ob- 
tained only at the school. 
  Scoot GRoUNDS MADE ATTRACTIVE BY TREES AND FLOWERS. 
The first step in improving the school grounds is to prepare a plan. This should be a 
detailed outline of the work to be done, based upon the exact conditions prevailing at the 
school. The plan should first be a map of the grounds with all the buildings upon it. A 
careful consideration of a unity of effect should be given, and then the place where every tree 
and shrub is to be planted should be indicated upon the map. Free discussion should be 
given to personal opinions; and when any point cannot be settled by teacher and pupil, it should 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
196 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
be submitted to some one who is an expert in the matter of landscape planting. Very fre- 
quently it is well to have the plans made under what has been termed the “district policy.” 
This is to get all the members of the school district interested in the work by asking opinions 
and requesting that each member of the school district contribute something that will be 
available for planting. 
Arrangement of Trees. Trees must be so arranged that they will serve for protection as 
well as ornament. In many cases it is well to plant a belt of trees across the rear of the 
school lot. Solid planting should be the rule, as it is protective to buildings and better for the 
trees planted. The rear views from the school are generally the least desirable. The side 
planting is next in importance to the rear. If trees are planted in belts along the sides, there 
will be room enough reserved for playgrounds. Openings for walks and views should always 
be kept when the planting is done in belts. A formal arrangement of the trees is sometimes 
desirable, as it gives better opportunity for cultivation and can be made simple and attractive. 
If the grounds are large, a better effect may sometimes be obtained by open, irregular planting. 
If it is necessary to hide objectionable buildings, trees and shrubs may be planted solidly 
about them. Groups of trees may be introduced where they will not interfere with the play- 
ground; and if they are judiciously placed, the effect will be artistic. Vines, shrubs, and other 
plants should be used to help the unity of the planting plan and not to destroy it by offering 
too much detail. 
Trees for Planting. Several kinds of trees are suitable for belt planting. They should be 
placed in groups and not planted singly. In one group could be elm trees, in another could 
be oaks, while a third could be pines. The elm, oak, and maple are easily obtained anywhere 
and can be easily transplanted. These trees grow in a great variety of soils and are well 
adapted to most school grounds. The beech, chestnut, walnut, ash, pine, and spruce may be 
obtained from various localities and used about the school building. 
As the school ground is to be permanent, long-lived trees can best be used. Tree plant- 
ing is one of our most altruistic activities. Trees are for future generations and we should 
always plant with this end in view. A short-lived tree grows quickly, but it lasts only twenty- 
five or thirty years. A long-lived tree usually grows more slowly, but lasts for a century or 
more. 
Thorough preparation of the soil should precede the planting. Clay soils should be 
plowed in the fall that they may weather before the spring planting is started. Subsoiling 
is often of great benefit where clay soils abound. Just before planting time, the ground should 
be thoroughly pulverized with a harrow. If the planting is to be done in rows, the ground 
should be carefully marked off and the positions of each tree marked. If the planting is to be 
in groups at irregular intervals, the spots designated for each type of planting should be 
staked off and carefully marked. Holes should be dug large enough to contain all the roots 
fully spread out and deep enough to allow the tree to stand about four inches lower than it 
stood when a seedling. The time of planting will vary somewhat with the location of the 
school. The usual custom employed in the locality of planting trees and shrubs may safely 
be followed. Have some one present on the school ground who is familiar with local con- 
ditions when planting takes place.

THE FLOWER AND ITS WORK 
The flower of a plant is the part that forms seeds. stomen 
Only flowering plants bear seeds. The lower forms of 
plant life, such as fungi, mosses, and ferns, bear spores 
instead of seeds. 
In a typical flower there are four parts. In the 
center is a pistil, or several pistils; around the pistil or 
pistils are the stamens; surrounding the stamens is the 
corolla, usually made up of several parts, called petals; SECTION OF A CHERRY Biossom. 
and outside of the corolla is the calyx, which usually Te ae ee a 
is made up of several parts, called sepals. The pistils, stamens, petals, and sepals are really 
modified leaves. The petals are usually bright-colored and give a showy appearance to the 
flower. The essential organs of a flower are the pistils and stamens; and many plants have 
flowers consisting only of pistils and stamens. The large base of a pistil is the ovary, in 
which the seeds are developed. The stalk of the pistil extending above the ovary is the style, 
and the enlarged end of the style is called the stigma. A stamen consists of a slender stalk, 
called the filament, and a little capsule at the end, which is called the anther. In the anther 
are the pollen grains, which are scattered when the anther opens. When a pollen grain falls 
upon the stigma of a pistil, it adheres and sends a thread-like growth down the style and into 
the ovary and fertilizes an ovule, which then develops into a seed. 
A perfect flower contains both stamens and pistils, but all flowers:do not contain both of 
these organs. Some, called staminate flowers, bear stamens only; while others, called pistil- 
late flowers, bear pistil’only. Most species of plants bear perfect flowers; while in some 
species a single plant bears both staminate and pistillate flowers; and in other species one 
individual plant bears only staminate flowers, and another plant of the same species bears 
only pistillate flowers. Most of our wild flowers and fruit trees bear perfect flowers. Corn 
is a plant bearing staminate and pistillate flowers. The tassel is a mass of staminate flowers 
while the ear is a group of pistillate flowers. The long silks of the ears are the styles which 
project beyond the green husk in order that pollen may fall upon the stigmas. In spring, if 
you examine a number of willow trees, you will find a number of catkins, one kind only upon 
a single tree. One kind of catkin is a bunch of pistillate flowers, while the other kind is made 
up of a large number of staminate flowers. The staminate catkins are larger than the pistillate 
catkins. ‘ 
Pollination. Plants'cannot bear seeds unless the pollen of the stamens fall upon the stigma 
of the pistil. In plants where the pistils and stamens are close together there is little trouble 
for the pollen to reach the stigma. When these organs are separated, the pollen must be 
transferred by some means from the stamens to the pistil. This process is called pollination. 
Nature has several ways in which pollination takes place. Wind is the chief agent for 
the distribution of the pollen of such plants as the corn, willow, and pine. The spores from the 
staminate flowers are blown about and some few of them succeed in landing on a pistil, when 
fertilization generally occurs. This is a very wasteful way of pollinating as only a very few 
   
-P-A-G-E-204
  198 PRACTICAL LESSONS IN AGRICULTURE 
spores succeed in reaching a pistil; for this reason, such plants have to manufacture a great 
deal of pollen. Note how numerous are the staminate flowers of the corn. 
Some flowers are made to attract various insects by means of color or odor, and the insects 
carry pollen from one flower to another. In plants of this type, the parts of the flower are 
so arranged that the insect cannot enter to get the nectar without becoming dusted with the 
pollen. Bumblebees are necessary for the pollination of clover. When flowers are adapted 
to insect pollination, they become unfit for wind pollination and will not be pollinated if insects 
do not visit them. 
When the pollen of one plant fertilizes the ovary of another plant, cross pollination is 
said to have taken place. As a result of this cross pollination a stronger, sturdier seed is made. 
The introduction of new life from another plant is of much benefit to the seed, Cross polli- 
nation is sometimes done by hand. If this is to be done, (1) remove the anthers before they 
open so that they will not pollinate the stigma, (2) cover the flower thus deprived of its anthers 
with a paper bag to prevent pollen from other plants reaching the pistil, (3) when the ovary 
has developed sufficiently carry pollen from some other plant to the stigma and carefully 
rebag the flower so that no other pollen may get to it, and (4) when the seed has matured, care- 
fully collect them and place them in some receptacle properly labeled. Hand pollination 
offers the advantage of enabling one to know exactly the parent plants. A careful selection of 
parents will breed a very high grade of seed. 
When the pollen of one kind of plant is used for fertilizing the pistil of another kind of plant, 
the resulting growth is a hybrid. The plants used must be of two distinct kinds, as an apple 
and a pear, to produce a hybrid. If the parents are more closely related, the result is simply 
a cross, as, for example, the pollen of one kind of apple used on the stigma of another kind of 
apple. Hybrids and crosses are valuable, as they generally combine some of the desirable 
qualities of each parent. By careful selection and intelligent breeding, the good qualities of 
two plants may be emphasized and after several generations a plant may be produced that is 
a distinct gain to agriculture.

LESSON 134 
LEGUMINOUS CROPS 
A leguminous plant is one that bears its seed in a pod or legume. Cowpeas, velvet 
beans, alfalfa, peas, clover, beans, and vetches are examples of leguminous crops. The prin- 
cipal plant food that is lacking in most soils is nitrogen, and these leguminous plants have the 
power of taking the free nitrogen from the air and making it available for plant use. In the 
little warts, called tubercles, situated upon the roots of legumes are bacteria that feed upon 
the nitrogen that is in the soil air. The nitrogen compounds made by these. bacteria are then 
absorbed by the leguminous plants. If these plants are plowed under in the field, the soil is 
enriched with the nitrogen that they have gathered while the plants themselves are of great 
food value. Nitrogen-gathering plants have exceedingly long roots which tend to deepen the 
soil through their deep-growing habit. If the soil does not need nitrogen but does need 
humus, any non-nitrogenous crop may be plowed under. 
Of all the leguminous crops red clover is the best for northern conditions. Its deep root 
system withstands dry spells, loosens the soil, and helps to bring plant food to the surface. 
Cowpeas in the South take the place of the red clover of the North. They grow anywhere 
and easily flourish until the frost kills them. The roots are always as deep as those of red 
clover and the plants thrive on poor soil if not too wet. Crimson clover is the third legume of 
importance. The value of crimson clover lies in its ability to grow late and to make good 
winter pasturage. Alfalfa is the best soil-improving crop grown in arid lands and its culture 
is being rapidly extended to other areas. 
Gather plants of the following leguminous crops, — red clover, cowpeas, and velvet beans. 
Grind up each plant separately and preserve intact. Fill five flower pots with the same kind 
of loam soil. Add (in equal weights) to the first pot the pulverized red clover; to the second, 
the cowpeas; to the third, the velvet beans; to the fourth, ordinary stable manure; and 
leave the fifth pot without any fertilizer addition. This latter pot is to be used as a check 
pot. In each pot plant some quick-growing seed and keep a record of the experiment.

SAN JOSE SCALE 
The San José scale is one of the most dreaded enemies 
of fruit trees. It is extremely minute but multiplies so 
rapidly that it soon covers large sections of the tree 
branches. Young trees infected with this scale should 
never be allowed to enter the orchard. If the scale is 
found on any orchard trees, they should be burned at once 
and every care taken to prevent the spread of the pest. 
A spraying with kerosene emulsion has been found bene- 
ficial. No halfway measures will suffice, and with this 
pest, as with many others, it is easier to prevent than to 
eradicate. 
The insect generally winters on infested trees in its 
larval stage. Both males and females are found clinging 
to the bark of fruit trees throughout the winter months. 
When spring comes the males mature early and the females 
San José Scare, Apvtt anp Younc, @bout a month later. The young of the insect is brought 
forth alive; that is, eggs are not laid, but the young are 
born. The larve are like those of other scales, and attach themselves permanently in about 
twenty-four hours’ time. The insect reaches its adult condition and is ready to reproduce 
in about a month. During this period of growth, the parent has produced many broods 
which, on becoming mixed, cause all stages of development to be present on the same tree 
trunk. The character of this life history makes the insect very hard to control. The scale 
usually infests fruit trees, and occasionally such trees as the elm and walnut.

CODLING MOTH 
The codling moth and 
the plum curculio are the 
most troublesome insects 
that the orchardist has 
to contend with. The 
damage done by both of 
these little animals is 
very great and much care 
is needed to exterminate them. It is said that the codling moth causes an annual loss in the 
state of New York of some three million dollars. Like many other insects, it is a visitant from 
the Old World, having been brought into this country during the present century. It was 
unknown in the Middle West twenty years ago, but during the last seven or eight years it has 
spread largely through the Western States. 
The moth makes its appearance about the time that apple trees are in bloom. The fe- 
male lays her eggs upon the young fruit and the leaves. The larve hatch in a few days and en- 
ter the apple at the blossom end or from the side. The “worm” so often seen near the core 
of the apple is the larva of the codling moth. The females fly from fruit to fruit, depositing 
eggs until they die of sheer exhaustion. After about twenty days the larva becomes full 
grown and eats its way out of the apple. If the infested apple is still hanging upon the tree, 
the larva drops to the ground upon a silken thread of its own spinning, or crawls from the 
apple to the bark Of the large branches or trunk and beneath the bark spins a cocoon. The larve 
that drop to the ground or emerge from fallen apples crawl to the trunk or some other conven- 
ient place and there make their cocoons. In some localities the adult moths do not emerge 
from the cocoons until the following spring. In other sections where the summer season is 
longer the moths come out from the cocoons in a few weeks, and then 
produce another generation to infest the apples. The moth is small and 
not commonly known, even among fruit growers, but its work is easily 
seen and its larval stage very common. 
Many suggestions are given as to the means of eradication. 
Destroy all trash where the insects are likely to winter. Spray the 
infected trees with a Paris-green-Bordeaux mixture (see Appendix). 
Trap the climbing larvae by stretching bands of flannel or burlap 
about the trees. When the larve climb the tree they will stop 
and spin their cocoons under the first shelter. After the cocoons 
are spun under the band, it may be removed with the cocoons and 
burned. 
If spraying is done, the first application should be made just Worx or tae LARVA oF A 
after the blossoms fall. A second spraying should be made three Coptinc Mora. 
or four weeks later. Every leaf, twig, and fruit must be sprayed if good results are to 
be obtained.     Cocoon. Adult.

PLUM CURCULIO 
The plum curculio is 
only one fifth of an inch 
long, plump in appear- 
ance, brown in color, with 
black and gray mottlings. 
The damage done by this 
insect if neglected is about 
as great as that done by 
the codling moth. 
The beetle appears 
in the early spring after 
@ hibernating all winter. It 
Bega CHRCUIIO: feeds first on the un- 
opened buds and afterwards on the young tender leaves of the plum, cherry, peach, apple, 
and pear. When the fruit has developed to about the size of a marble, the female injures the 
fruit by piercing it with her ovipositor or egg-laying organ. The method of laying these eggs 
is especially interesting. The female first digs a hole in the fruit, lays the egg in it, and presses 
it down as far as possible. Next a crescent-shaped cut is made in the fruit around the egg 
by the snout of the little animal. A flow of gum follows this cut and is a sure sign that the 
curculio has been at the fruit. Having finished with one plum the female industriously at- 
tacks other plums until all her eggs are laid. It is only a few days after the’eggs are laid that 
they hatch into whitish grub-like larve. The larva bores into the center of the fruit, causing 
it to falltothe ground. By midsummer the larva leaves the decayed fruit and passes its pupal 
stage under ground. The adult beetles go into hiding at once and are not seen again until the 
following spring. In the apple and pear, the larva cannot fully develop unless the fruit drops 
to the ground, which it does not always do. 
As it is almost impossible to get at the larva, it is rather hard to eradicate this pest. All 
fallen fruit should be destroyed at once. If the curculio is jarred off the tree while it is laying 
its eggs, it may be caught in sheets and then destroyed. Chickens and hogs eat all the larve 
they can find. The beetle may be killed by spraying just before it begins to eat out the cres- 
cent about its egg, but the practice of spraying is not found to be very satisfactory. The 
gathering of the fallen fruit at intervals of a few days throughout the early summer is 
probably the best means of eradicating these beetles. 
‘The curculio is most numerous at the first part of the fruit season, and in fields that have 
timber standing near them. As it can fly, bandages about the trees do no good. Both the 
male and female puncture the fruit for food, but the female alone makes the crescent-shaped 
cut. Most of the deposition of eggs takes place before the stone of the fruit becomes hard. 
Larve will not develop well in dry soil, so during drought seasons the pest is less troublesome.

APPLE-TREE TENT CATERPILLAR 
The eggs of these caterpillars are laid during 
the month of June in oval rings about the smaller 
twigs of trees. They are easily seen, as each cluster 
is rather prominent, containing from two hundred 
to three hundred eggs. The egg clusters are pro- 
tected from the weather by a coating of glutinous 
matter which swells and breaks as the tempera- 
ture increases. This warming of the eggs causes 
the larva, which have developed in them, to take 
on greater activity and to. eat their way out to 
the limbs of the tree. If the season happens to 
be forward and the larve come out before the 
leaves of the tree have formed, food is found in 
the glutinous mass that surrounded the eggs, and 
the young insect is so hardy that it will live on 
this several days until the tender green leaves are 
formed.

from one egg mass work together and form a colony 
by themselves. Perfect harmony prevails, and each individual performs his share of 
the work of building the family tent. This tent is so common that a description is 
hardly necessary: The small, glistening web, if left alone, will soon spread and inclose 
whole branches of the tree, the caterpillars meanwhile getting their food from the leaves 
that have been included in their house. The feeding takes place usually twice a day, 
in the forenoon and in the afternoon. In about five or six weeks the caterpillars attain full 
growth after having molted their skins four times. After growth they seek out sheltered 
places, where oval yellow cocoons are spun and the pupa stage passed. At the end of three 
weeks the adult moth emerges. This moth is yellowish or reddish-brown in color, with 
striped forewings. The adult does not feed, and its only occupation seems to be the per- 
petuation of the species. As soon as they have mated and the female has deposited her eggs 
upon some twig they die. Besides the apple and cherry trees, the apple-tree tent caterpillar 
will feed upon the thorn, the rose, and the plum. Many of our larger trees, as the oak and 
willow, are also attacked by this insect. 
There are three methods of eradication : — 
(1) Encourage the presence of birds. 
(2) Burn the nests.at midday when the worms are all at home. Care should be taken 
not to scorch the tree. 
(3) Destroy the egg masses as fast as they can be found. 
Regularly sprayed orchards are seldom troubled with this pest. A few wild cherry trees 
might be planted in every orchard to attract the insects. They will go to the cherry trees in 
preference to any others, and may thus be captured and destroyed.

WOOLLY APHIDS 
    
  The aphids or plant lice are insects that may 
it be found on all our garden plants, on plants in our 
“Ay conservatories, and on many field and forest trees. 
;| ‘They live upon the juices of the plants, which 
they get by piercing the plant fibers and sucking 
the liquids. The woolly aphids of the alder, beech, 
and apple are very destructive. These pests give a great deal of trouble to our fruit growers. 
The eggs of this insect are laid upon the bark where the twigs leave the main stem. A 
great many eggs are laid, and they are always deposited where the young can get their food 
with little trouble. The eggs are yellow in color, turning black as they grow older. Small 
black aphids hatch from the eggs and commence to eat upon the tender bark of the tree. 
Young trees are seriously attacked by them and sometimes the bark is sadly scarred by the 
small pits they make. After a serious attack by the young, the bark stops growing and 
the tree becomes diseased. The first aphids hatched are all females. These females when 
they are about two weeks old give birth to living young, which are also females. All the young 
born in the earlier part of the year are females, the males not appearing until the fall. 
A variety of the woolly aphids of the apple attacks the roots of the tree. This pest is very 
difficult to eradicate. It works deep in the ground and feeds upon the fibers of the roots. 
There is no good way to prevent the pest from doing damage to the roots. If a tree has 
become badly infested it should be dug up and destroyed. Another apple tree should not be 
planted in the same place, or the trouble will be renewed. 
Plant lice have many enemies. If this were not so, our plants would be overrun with hes 
pests, for they multiply very rapidly. The larve of the ladybird beetles, of the lace-winged 
flies, and the ichneumon fly feed upon thousands of these aphids and help to keep them in 
check. Spraying with kerosene oil will destroy this pest, providing it is not the root- 
inhabiting kind» If the roots have not been severely attacked, a solution of one part of 
carbon bisulphide to three parts of hot water if applied to the soil will sometimes be of 
benefit. The earth about the tree should be closely covered to prevent evaporation.

THE MOSQUITO 
  Mosquitoes. 
The eggs of the mosquito are found on the surface of standing water. They generally 
hatch out the same day they are laid, and the young mosquitoes, called wrigglers, spend the 
larval and pupal stages in the water. It takes from one to two weeks for the pupa to emerge 
as an adult and fly away. 
After spring comes, the egg rafts of the mosquito may be found in nearly any body of 
standing water; old barrels, water tubs, pails, and stagnant pools are good breeding places. 
As the early life of the mosquito is spent in water, a comparatively easy way of eradicating 
the insect is at hand. The larva has to come to the surface to breathe, and if its supply of 
oxygen can be cut off, it dies. This is generally done by pouring kerosene upon the water 
where the eggs have been found. ‘The oil gradually spreads over the surface and forms a thin 
film through which no air can penetrate. In this way the mosquito is smothered. It does 
not take much oil to cover a rather large pool of water; a few drops will be sufficient for a 
good-sized tub where the insects are breeding. For larger surfaces, an ounce of oil for 
every fifteen square feet is enough to kill. Fishes, especially gold fishes, are very fond of 
young mosquitoes. Toads, frogs, swallows, and dragon flies are valuable aids to the destruc- 
tion of these pests. 
The two common kinds of mosquitoes are known as the Culex and the Anopheles. It is 
the latter genus that is responsible for the spread of malaria. Whenever malaria is present in 
a district, the standing water should be thoroughly inspected and removed. Every pool 
should be drained and kerosene used as far as possible. Screens at the house will form a pre- 
ventive but not an eradicator. The Culex is troublesome but not as dangerous as the other 
genus. The wrigglers of these two mosquitoes may be distinguished by the positions they 
take when at rest in the water.

THE HOUSE FLY 
The house fly is a common and dangerous insect. Much of the sickness that occurs to 
man is transmitted by these insects. Typhoid fever and other diseases are often transmitted 
from one person to another by the house 
fly. They speck everything with which 
they come in contact and bring the filth of 
their breeding places to the food we eat. 
The life history of the fly is typical of 
true insect growth. ‘There is an egg stage, 
a larval stage, a pupal stage, and an adult 
stage. The larva is sometimes spoken of 
as a maggot. The eggs of the house fly 
are laid in the manure about our stables 
and in the trash thrown about our back- 
yards. Some flies deposit as many as 
forty-five eggs in one night and probably 
lay many hundreds during a_ lifetime. 
It is not known exactly how long a fly will live. In about one day the eggs hatch out and 
the young larve begin to grow. After a growth lasting about six days the larve enter 
the pupal stage. In this stage the animals remain practically quiet for a week. At the end 
of the week, the pupz emerge as adults. A generation of flies is produced in about two 
weeks’ time. This accounts for the innumerable flies that appear every summer. 
Too much care cannot be taken to rid the house of flies. Besides being dangerous they 
area personal nuisance. All filth and trash that is likely to breed the insect should be burned 
and the premises about the home and stable should be kept very clean. A fly willgo anywhere 
and will generally adapt itself to its environment so that it is not easy to eradicate it. Milk, 
which is especially susceptible to germs, is very attractiveto flies and should be covered to 
keep out all contamination. Screens over windows and doors are an absolute necessity for 
protection against these pests. Q 
There is a great similarity between the house fly and the stable fly. These insects are 
often mistaken for each other, but a close examination of each will show distinctive differences. 
The mouth parts of the stable fly are different from those of the house fly. The house fly has 
a sucking tube for its mouth, while the stable fly has a mouth formed for piercing the skin. 
The bite of the stable fly is very annoying but not necessarily dangerous. Horses, cattle, and - 
dogs are greatly troubled by this fly. If the stable fly has any poisonous matter upon its mouth 
parts when it bites, an inflammation will probably develop. 
The bluebottle fly is another insect that comes into the house and is very common. It 
breeds in decayed animal matter. Any insect that has such an environment for its home is 
one that is to be dreaded about the house.

RURAL BETTERMENT 
When we work in the interest of movements that are intended to make life for the country 
people happier and better, we are working in the interest of rural betterment. Considerable 
time and thought have been given to the study of country life and its problems. The National 
Commission on Country Life appointed by Theodore Roosevelt gave us some valuable infor- 
mation on rural conditions. This commission in making its report said, in part :— 
“Rural society is lacking chiefly in a knowledge on the part of the farmers of the exact 
agricultural conditions and possibilities of their regions, resulting in the widespread depletion 
of the soils with the injurious effect on rural life; in the proper training for country life in the 
schools; in good highway facilities; and in organization for buying and selling. There is 
an absence of any adequate system of agricultural credit, a shortage of labor; a lack of insti- 
tutions and incentives that tie the laboring man to the soil; the life of the farm woman is 
burdensome and narrow; and the farmer is handicapped by the speculative holding of lands, 
monopolistic control of streams and forests, waste of our natural resources and restraint of 
trade.” 
In transmitting this report to Congress, President Roosevelt pointed out the desirability 
of codéperation among farmers in buying and selling, saying: ‘‘From all that has been done 
and learned, three great general and immediate needs of country life stand out : — 
“First — Effective coéperation among farmers, to put them on a level with the organized 
interests with which they do business. 
“Second — A new kind of school in the country which shall teach the children as much 
outdoors as indoors, so that they will prepare for country life, and not, as at present, mainly 
for life in town. 
“Third — Better means of communication, including good roads and parcels post, and 
better sanitation; for easily preventable diseases hold millions of country people in the slavery 
of continuous ill-health.” 
We have many organizations in our country to-day that are promoting rural betterment. 
Some of these are the Grange, farmers’ institutes, the agricultural press, ministerial aid as- 
sociations, teachers’ associations, Junior and Senior Agricultural Clubs, community improve- 
ment clubs, and county improvement associations. Perhaps no organizations have done 
more for rural betterment than the Junior Agricultural Clubs. These have been organized in 
nearly all of the states, and they have met with marked success. Judging from the results 
obtained, the most important of these are the Corn Clubs, Cotton Clubs, and Canning Clubs. 
Some information concerning them is given in the three following sections. 
SECTION II 
CORN CLUBS 
Corn clubs have been organized in many schools throughout the country to encourage 
the study and practice of better methods of corn raising. ‘The work has met with such success 
that every school should have a corn club affiliated with the state and national organizations.
-P-A-G-E-216
  210 APPENDIX 
The purposes of the corn clubs, as set forth in a recent circular published by the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture are as follows: — 
(1) To encourage more intensive farming by using the best known methods of soil building, 
selection of seed, seed testing, cultivation of corn, etc. 
(2) To offer a medium through which vocational guidance, inspiration, information, and 
careful direction can be given to the average boy now in rural life. 
(3) To adapt the boy to his agricultural environments, and make him capable of self- 
expression within those environments. 
(4) To teach the value of intellectual guidance, careful observation, cultural comparison 
and investigation, and the need of a broader education for the farming population. 
(5) To teach the boy the proper adaptation of plant life to local climatic and soil condi- 
tions. : 
(6) To assist the teacher and the public school to find an easy approach, educationally, 
to all the interests of rural and village life. (a) The club should be the laboratory for the 
club member and the demonstration plat for the farmer. (6) The club work becomes the 
connecting link between parent and teacher, farm and school, and last but not least, it forms 
a cooperative atmosphere in which rural boys may be developed to the highest ideals of rural 
life. 
The best results are always secured when the following organization in a county is main- 
tained : — 
(1) The school teacher is the-local corn club organizer who, together with the parents, 
helps the boy to understand the written instructions on corn growing, sent him by the National 
Department of Agriculture, the State College of Agriculture, the State Experiment Station, 
and the State Department of Education. 
(2) The County School Superintendent ‘is the county corn club director, and as such 
holds all county meetings, formulates the county rules, and settles all contests. Township 
and District School Superintendents do this work in states not employing county superin- 
tendents. 
(3) The instructor of the county club may be a supervisor of Agriculture, a special teacher 
of Agriculture, or a farm demonstration agent in counties where these agents are employed. 
This person will give instruction on the preparation of the soil, the cultivation of the crop, 
fertilizers and seed selection and attend field meetings of the club. 
The work is promoted jointly by the State College of Agriculture and the United States 
Farm Demonstration Work in coédperation with the rural school officials of the state. In Ohio 
four supervisors of agricultural education in the State Department of Education have charge 
of all agricultural work done in the public schools. 
If the school has no corn club, one should be organized at the earliest opportunity. Send 
to the institutions mentioned in (1) for bulletins directing this organization and for all infor- 
mation available upon the growing of corn. 
SECTION III 
COTTON CLUBS 
In the cotton states, clubs have been organized among the young farmers upon the same 
plan as used by the corn clubs. The object of these organizations is to study cotton in all its
-P-A-G-E-217
     
  APPENDIX 211 
aspects, — as a plant its cultivation, and its harvesting. In order that the young students 
may investigate for themselves, contests are inaugurated and individual farming upon a 
small scale is encouraged. Prizes are offered on the best acre of cotton, on the best five 
stalks, and on the best stalk exhibited. The same general rules that govern the corn con- 
tests are applied to that of cotton. Reports must be filed with each exhibit and the yield 
certified to by competent judges. 
The average yield of cotton in the United States is only about 200 pounds of lint and 
from 350 to 400 pounds of seed per acre. If proper selection of seed is made, right cultivation 
undertaken, and care used in handling the soil, from 500 to 600 pounds of lint and 1200 pounds 
of seed can be obtained from each acre in cultivation. It costs more to grow a pound of cotton 
when the yield is less than it does when the yield is greater. 
Cotton clubs should be organized in every school situated within the cotton belt. Send 
to the College of Agriculture for bulletins regarding the raising of cotton and ask that all help 
possible be extended to the school in organizing cotton clubs. 
SECTION IV 
CANNING CLUBS 
In order that the girls in our rural schools may have clubs similar to those for the boys, 
canning clubs have been inaugurated. These clubs make a special study of garden vegetables 
and fruits that are suitable for canning, and of the simplest process of preparing them for the 
market. Tomatoes, beans, apples, peaches, and other garden and orchard products are all 
studied with this aim in'view. Inexpensive canning outfits may be obtained by any school, 
and products prepared for the regular county exhibit. Each girl should be encouraged to 
enter a contest, exhibiting one line of canning or preserving. 
The rules that govern the entrance to canning clubs are as follows : — 
(1) Girls should be regularly organized by the teachers into local school clubs; and the 
school clubs into county organizations, with president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. 
(2) No limit should be placed on the number of girls belonging to the club. 
(3) All girls must be between the ages of 10 and 18, but not necessarily pupils of the school. 
Any girl not having the opportunity to attend school may join the club, and enter the contest. 
(4) The members of the club must agree to read the instructions sent out by the State 
Department of Education, the State College of Agriculture, and the United States Department 
of Agriculture. Teachers should set aside certain times for periodical meetings of the club, 
during school session, when the bulletins and circulars may be discussed. 
(5) Each girl must make her plans and do her own work. 
(6) A written report must accompany each exhibit, giving in details the method of doing 
the work which will be considered by the judges in awarding prizes. 
Establish canning clubs at your school. Write to the Department of Agriculture in 
Washington for bulletins upon this subject, and to the State Department of Education and 
the State College of Agriculture for any help needed. Encourage local enthusiasm by admit- 
ting to the club other girls in the neighborhood who have not the opportunity of attending the 
school.

SUPPLIES 
The apparatus listed below can be obtained from laboratory supply houses. The following 
list is estimated as the amount necessary for a class of ten students. It has frequently been 
found advisable to allow students'to work in groups of three or more. In such cases the equip- 
ment necessary will not be so extensive and can be arranged to suit the needs of the class by the 
teacher in charge. Some of the apparatus may be used by the class as a whole and duplicate 
equipment will not be needed. The prices quoted are catalogue prices and liberal discounts 
are allowed by nearly every supply house.

   MAYNE & HATCH’S HIGH 
SCHOOL AGRICULTURE 
By D. D. MAYNE, Principal of School of Agriculture and 
Professor of Agricultural Pedagogics, University of Min- 
nesota; and K. L. HATCH, Professor of Agricul- 
tural Education, University of Wisconsin. 
              
  $1.00    
  HIS course has a double value for pupils in the first 
years of the high school. On the one hand, it puts 
the study of agriculture on a serious basis and teaches 
the young beginner how he can carry on the work of a farm 
most profitably. On the other hand, it affords an interesting 
introduction to all the natural sciences, enabling the student to 
master certain definite principles of chemistry, botany, and 
zodlogy, and to understand their applications. A few experi- 
ments are included, which may be performed by the student 
or by the teacher before the class. But the subject is not 
made ultrascientific, forcing the student through the long 
process of laboratory method to rediscover what scientists 
have fully established. 
{| The topics are taker up in the text in their logical order. 
The treatment begins with an elementary agricultural chem- 
istry, in which are discussed the elements that are of chief 
importance in plant and animal life. Following in turn are 
sections on soils and fertilizers; agricultural botany ; economic 
plants, including field and forage crops, fruits and vege- 
tables; plant diseases; insect enemies; animal husbandry ; and 
farm management. 
€| The chapter on plant diseases, by Dr. E. M. Freeman, 
Professor of Botany and Vegetable Pathology, College of 
Agriculture, University of Minnesota, describes the various 
fungus growths that injure crops, and suggests methods of 
fighting them, The section on farm management treats farm- 
ing from the modern standpoint as a business proposition.

   PLANT LIFE AND 
PLANT USES 
By JOHN GAYLORD COULTER, Ph. D. 
          
      $1.20 
N elementary textbook providing a foundation for the 
study of agriculture, domestic science, or college botany, 
But it is more than a textbook on botany—it is a book 
about the fundamentals of plant life and about the relations 
between plants and man. It presents as fully as is desirable 
for required courses in high schools those large facts about 
plants which form the present basis of the science of botany. 
Yet the treatment has in view preparation for life in general, 
and not preparation for any particular kind of calling. 
The subject is dealt with from the viewpoint of the pupil 
rather than from that of the teacher or the scientist. The 
style is simple, clear, and conversational, yet the method is 
distinctly scientific, and the book has a cultural as well as 
a practical object. 
The text has a unity of organization. So far as practicable 
the familiar always precedes the unfamiliar in the sequence of 
topics, and the facts are made to hang together in order that 
the pupil may see relationships, Such topics as forestry, plant 
breeding, weeds, plant enemies and diseases, plant culture, 
decorative plants, and economic bacteria are discussed where 
most pertinent to the general theme rather than in separate 
chapters which destroy the continuity. Tne questions and 
suggestions which follow the chapters are of two kinds; some 
are designed merely to serve as an aid in the study of the text, 
while others suggest outside study and inquiry, The classified 
tables of terms which precede the index are intended to serve 
the student in review, and to be a general guide to the relative 
values of the facts presented, More than 200 attractive illus- 
trations, many of them original, are included in the book.

          HE thousands of users of Dr. Overton’s «Applied 
Physiology’’ will be glad to learn that he has prepared 
a new series which treats of hygiene and sanitation in 
accordance with the most progressive modern views. 
4| The earlier series was the first to teach the subject from 
the practical standpoint of health preservation, and his new 
series marks another important step forward. 
| In his capacity as Health Officer, as well as a general 
practising physician, Dr. Overton has had exceptional 
opportunity to gain his knowledge at first hand, to form 
sound judgments, and to view the whole subject in a broad, 
practical way. 
{| This two book course emphasizes hygiene in every 
chapter, but it gives enough physiology and anatomy for the 
pupil to understand the hygiene and sanitation. 
| These books have the same fundamental qualities which 
contributed so largely to the great success of Dr. Overton’s 
former books—clear, concise language, a generous collection 
of vital facts, truthful and scientifically accurate statements, 
well-balanced choice of topics, and a rare pedagogical 
adaptation to the classroom, with questions at the end of the 
chapters. 
| No boy or girl who studies these books can fail to 
live more healthfully or to promote the cause of public 
health.

ARPENTER’S Geographical Readers supplement the 
regular textbooks on the subject, giving life and interest 
to the study. They are intensely absorbing, being 
written by the author on the spots described, and presenting 
accurate pen-pictures of places and peoples. The style is 
simple and easy, and throughout each volume there runs a 
strong personal note which makes the reader feel that he is 
actually seeing everything with his own eyes. 
4 The books give a good idea of the various peoples, their 
strange customs and ways of living, and to some extent of their 
economic conditions. At the same time, there are included 
graphic descriptions of the curious animals, rare birds, wonder- 
ful physical features, natural resources, and great industries of 
each country. The illustrations for the most part are repro- 
ductions of photographs taken by the author, ‘The maps show 
the route taken over each continent. 
| The Readers on Commerce and Industry take up the 
three great essentials of human existence, food, clothing, and 
shelter. The children visit the great food centers and see 
for themselves how the chief food staples are produced and 
prepared for use, they travel over the globe investigating the 
sources of their clothing, and they learn how the different races 
are housed, and of what their dwellings are composed. The 
journeys are along geographical lines.

Supervisor of Primary Grades, Buffalo, New York. 
AN EIGHT BOOK SERIES or A FIVE BOOK SERIES 
WITH TEACHERS’ MANUAL 
HE authorship of this series is conclusive evidence of 
its rare worth, of its happy union of the ideal and the 
practical. The chief design of the books is to help pupils 
to acquire the art and habit of reading so well as to give pleas- 
ure both to themselves and to those who listen to them. They 
teach reading with expression, and the selections have, toa 
large extent, been chosen for this purpose. 
4] These readers are very teachable and readable, and are un- 
usually interesting both in selections and in illustrations. The 
selections are of a very high literary quality. Besides the 
choicest schoolbook classics, there are a large number which 
have never before appeared in school readers. ‘The contents 
are well balanced between prose and poetry, and the subject 
matter is unusually varied. Beginning with the Third Reader, 
selections relating to similar subjects or requiring similar 
methods of study or recitation, are grouped together. Many 
selections are in dialogue form and suitable for dramatization. 
| The First Reader may: be used with any method of teach- 
ing reading, for it combines the best ideas of each. A number 
of helpful new features are also included. Each reading lesson 
is on a right-hand page, and is approached by a series of pre- 
paratory exercises on the preceding left-hand page. 
{| The illustrations constitute the finest and most attractive 
collection ever brought together in a series of readers. ‘There 
are over 600 in all, every one made especially for these books 
by an artist of national reputation.

   '® LTHOUGH these arithmetics are intended to be 
placed in the pupil’s hands beginning with the 
third year, the oral work of the first two years 
is carefully developed in each series as a guide to the 
teacher. The plan agrees with present pedagogical ideas 
of teaching arithmetic, an easy treatment of each subject 
in the earlier years being provided before the complete 
treatment. 
@ In the earlier books, the subject-matter has been separated 
into two parts, and treated topically. In the later books 
the year has been made the unit of division, and here the 
treatment is also topical. Besides the two treatments of 
topics, the work is distinguished by the emphasis on oral 
drill, the number and variety of problems, the emphasis on 
business arithmetic, the systematic reviews, and the. easy 
steps in gradation. 
@ These books possess an unusual adaptability to the varying 
conditions in schools. The three-book series enables bright 
pupils to be promoted from the fourth year’s work to the 
sixth year’s work, or from the fifth year’s work to the 
seventh year’s work without omitting the study of any im- 
portant topic, and thus complete an eight years’ course in 
seven years. The two-book series permit bright pupils 
to finish the first five years’ work in four years, and be 
promoted from the fourth year’s work to the sixth year’s 
work, and thus complete an eight years’ course in seven 
years.

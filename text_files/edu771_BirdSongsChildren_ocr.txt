INTRODUCTION 
By HENRY OLDYS 
The many bits of melody that fill the solitudes of nature offer a fascinating 
field of discovery to musicians, yet to nearly all this field remains a terra incognita. 
Poets have been attracted to the haunts of birds from the earliest days of poetry, 
but seldom does a musician cross the threshold of their courts. Yet musicians, 
above all others, can there find keen enjoyment and actual inspiration. Mr. Olds 
shows by the group of delightful little songs he has produced, each of which is 
based on one or more real bird themes, what possibilities of suggestion bird-song 
contains. And it must be remembered that the reservoir is inexhaustible; not 
only does each species have its own characteristic music, but within the specific 
limit there are often both geographic and individual differences, while frequently, 
as is now known, a single individual will have a varied repertory of songs. Then, 
too, among these humbler musicians, as among their human brothers, there are 
marked gradations of individual excellence. Performances ranging from medioc- 
rity to mastership may be found among wood thrushes, robins, song sparrows, 
and many others. Like Gray’s flower, 
“born to blush unseen 
And waste its sweetness on the desert air,” 
many of the avian mastersingers pour out beautiful and unique fragments of 
melody which, unheard by comprehending humans, in a few years pass away 
forever with the life of the singer. 
The success with which Mr. Olds has secured and set a few of these gems of 
avian music should inspire others of the musical world to undertake a similar quest 
and to preserve some of the masterpieces of bird-music that apathy and neglect 
are now allowing to go to waste. Those who combine philosophy with music will 
find constant interest in study of the evident and very close relationship between 
bird-music and human music. Not only is this relationship shown in the occasional 
coincidence of human and avian themes, but still more strikingly is it manifest in 
the identical rules of construction often governing rhythm, melody, and melodic 
and harmonic sequence in both. This fact so impressed my very good friend, 
Mrs. Amelia von Ende, the well-known musical and literary critic, that in a new 
course of lectures on the history of music, she has, as she recently informed me, 
ignored all precedent and started with bird-music as one of the sources. 
For the information of any who may wish to become acquainted with the 
beauties of bird-music it may be stated that although spring and early summer 
are the best times for such study, yet there is no season in the year that is neces- 
sarily absolutely unproductive. The general chorus of bird-song begins before the 
winter has passed in February. It waxes as the number of singers is augmented 
by the arrival of summer residents and passing migrants, and then wanes until by 
August, when most species are moulting, it becomes a thread. In early autumn 
it revives in a somewhat desultory way and is finally extinguished by winter’s 
inclemency. Yet even in the depth of winter, when the earth is fast in the bonds

Introduction—continued 
  of ice and snow, one may hear an occasional song from some intrepid and uncon- 
querable' spirit. In this, as in so many ways, the year somewhat parallels the 
day. Birds begin to sing before light and the chorus swells, declines, becomes 
desultory, revives toward sunset, and is at length extinguished by night, which, 
however, like winter, is marked by an occasional song. Regular nocturnal singers, 
like whip-poor-wills and owls, tend to destroy the parallel; but when out of the 
dark and silence of the night there rises a little lay from a field sparrow, wood 
pewee, or other bird that had gone to rest at nightfall, it is like hearing a bright 
song from chickadee, song sparrow, or Carolina wren in the midst of a gloomy 
and cheerless day of midwinter. 
In closing I wish to express my high appreciation of the art and feeling 
Mr. Olds has exercised in the preparation of this little volume. While properly 
preserving with exactness the bird themes he embodies in his songs, he has com- 
bined them so ingeniously, has harmonized them so attractively, and has so well 
interpreted the sentiment that seems to underly each bird’s utterances, that I feel 
they cannot fail to bring delight and profit to the many thousands I hope will 
make their acquaintance.

PREFACE 
In writing this series of little songs, I have been dominated by a desire to 
accomplish two results. First, that the songs might prove to be such as would 
appeal to children, for the actual bird-melodies thus unconsciously absorbed 
should inevitably lead to a keener delight in the singing of birds, and a better 
understanding of their songs. A further result of this knowledge I hope will be the 
promotion of a deeper interest in the whole subject of bird-life, and the need of its 
preservation. 
My second purpose is to interest musicians, particularly composers of chil- 
dren’s songs, in the possibilities of utilizing bird themes. Here is a vast, untouched 
field, the resources of which .are practically inexhaustible, for, since each indi- 
vidual of several species may have a large répertoire all its own, thousands of 
beautiful new melodies are to be heard every season. A brief study of the themes 
which I have used should demonstrate their practical value, and what could be 
of greater interest to a child than songs treating of bird-life, which contain the 
real melodies sung by the birds? 
I have not made a particular point of keeping the melodies in the keys in 
which they were originally sung. Of greater importance, it seemed to me, was 
the preservation of the spirit of the original song, transposing, where necessary, 
to keys which would allow suitable range for the child-voice. The melodic inter- 
vals I have, of course, kept absolutely true. 
Most of the themes which I have used are the results of my own observa- 
tions. My thanks are due, however, and heartily given to Mr. Henry Oldys and 
Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews for permission to make use of themes from their records, 
and for valuable suggestions. Credit has been given in the proper places for 
themes thus used. The colored illustrations have been obtained through the 
National Association of Audubon Societies.

WOOD PEWEE 
This song should be sung in a languid manner, with decided 
portamento where indicated. The words as given form a good imi- 
tation of the tone of the Pewee, though whistling, as suggested for 
the second part of the song, will prove more characteristic. In 
whistling, the first note of each group should be attacked slightly 
from below. 
It is an interesting fact that of the twenty-four birds treated 
in this series, exactly one-third bear names which were evidently 
suggested by their calls or songs.

OVENBIRD 
The syllables “click-a-lick,” broadening as the tone increases 
in volume, to “lack-a-lack,” seem to me to more nearly represent 
the sound of the Ovenbird’s cry than does Mr. Burroughs’ “teacher, 
teacher,” etc. He undoubtedly does sometimes say “teacher’’; in 
fact, I have heard him do so, but the birds which I have heard 
more commonly sing the other syllables, and as the material used 
in these songs is largely the result of my own personal observations, 
I have used the song which I have most frequently heard. 
The reference in the song to the house “built upon the 
ground,” with a roof, etc., is due to the peculiar circumstance that 
the bird does this very thing, entering his domicile from a hole in 
the side. 
The cry of the bird should be sung with energy and precision.

  CHEWINK, OR TOWHEE 
Some have seemed to think that the call of this bird is “Chewink!” and others 
interpreted the song as “‘Towhee!” though the latter word must originally have been 
accented on the last syllable rather than the first, to really represent the sound. “Che- 
wink bird, he! he! he! he!”? with the last four syllables given in a thin tone, seems to me 
more exactly imitative than the other phrase which I have used. 
Chewinks are often heard answering each other from neighboring trees or bushes, 
and sometimes the responses are well related musically. Hence the form of the present song.

    BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE 
Each of these three themes has its own distinctive tonal quality. The first, repre- 
sented by the words “‘Chick-a-dee-dee-dee-dee,” and the most commonly known of his calls, 
is given, as Mr. Mathews says, in a “rather squeaky,” but nevertheless very cheery tone, 
for the Chickadee is a most social and confiding little bunch of feathers. The second theme 
is sung with very pure, clear tone, suggesting the word “Phebe.” The third is a sort of 
chatter, almost a scold, which I heard late in the summer, as a flock of Chickadees hopped 
through the low branches above my head. The syllables which most nearly represented this 
call were, as I put them in my note-book at the time: “‘Chick-a-dee-lup!” This phrase I 
have translated in the song as “Never give up!”

  MEADOWLARK 
Because one had learned the melody of a Meadowlark from the printed notes would not necesarily mean that he 
could then sally forth and unerringly recognize a Meadowlark song when he heard it. The chances for so doing would 
be better with the melody in mind than before, but there is more in bird-music than mere pitch and rhythm. To really 
know a bird’s song one must hear it sung by the bird; then he may be able to read into the given melody the proper tone- 
quality, style of delivery, etc. Moreover, one might never hear the melody in question, for different Meadowlarks sing 
different songs, and each bird may have several in his own répertoire. 
The present song will be found most realistic if the second theme (contributed by Mr. Henry Oldys) is whistled, 
with perfect legato and good spirit. This will give one a fairly clear idea of the general effect of a Meadowlark’s song as 
heard in the middle West, for the Meadowlarks of this section of the country sing with but little of the decided portamento 
which characterizes the song of the Eastern Meadowlarks.

    BALTIMORE ORIOLE 
The Baltimore Oriole sings rag-time! There is no disputing the fact 
that many of his songs are delivered with that marked syncopation of rhythm 
which in its degeneracy has deservedly come into disrepute with serious 
musicians, Yet we cannot condemn the Oriole for his love for misplaced 
accents, nor does the fact that syncopation is found in nature constitute 
an excuse for its abuse. 
The transcribing of this song might have been omitted, for fear of 
offending some, but I believe that the effect of the song is true, and the 
truth we must have in a serious study of nature. 
The themes which I have used were noted by Mr. Henry Oldys.

pote WOOD THRUSH 
The Wood Thrush is without doubt one of our very finest singers. The 
intervals comprising his melodies are quite distinct and clean-cut. Each phrase 
has a decided tonality, and successive phrases, while differing from each other in 
form, are usually in the same key. As for his voice, what pen can do it justice? 
All of the bird-music lovers have exhausted their vocabularies in describing it, 
but to appreciate its wonderful, silvery tone and its peace-producing effect, one 
must hear it in the quiet of the deep woods. 
The effect of the song as here given will be most natural if the melody is 
whistled throughout, with a roll of the tongue between tones.

VEERY, OR WILSON THRUSH 
One is filled with wonder and delight upon first hearing the 
song of this thrush. While not a versatile melodist like the Hermit 
or the Wood Thrush, yet he has the thrush voice, though with his 
own very decided timbre. The tone sounds much like that produced 
by a Jew’s harp, and his song is quite accurately imitated by singing 
his name, “‘Veery, veery,”’ etc. 
To put his melody upon paper is a most difficult undertaking. 
His intervals are not clear and his song is usually but a series of 
descending slurs, each group lower in pitch and of less volume than 
the preceding. His call, in contrast, as I heard it, is a very sharp, 
staccato tone, approached by a grace-note from above.

OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH 
This thrush has the same beautiful, appealing tone-quality 
as the other members of his family. While his répertoire is limited, 
yet his melodies are most astounding, in that they consist almost 
entirely of a series of tones comprising a seventh-chord. Mr. Math- 
ews has heard him singing diminished seventh-chords. I have 
secured but one record of this thrush, and that was a series of tones 
forming what is sometimes called the small seventh-chord, built 
upon the seventh degree of the major scale. So in the song I have 
used both forms. 
This melody will be more realistic if whistled. 
After writing this song and the above sketch, and before 
sending the MS. to the publisher, I received from Mr. Oldys a re- 
markable record of this bird. It will be noted that in my song I 
have given to the piano a broken tonic chord as an answer to the 
bird’s theme. In Mr. Oldys’ record the bird itself actually sang 
the very tones which I, as my own invention, had given to the 
piano, and repeated the phrases, he tells me, from fifty to a hundred 
times, without varying their order. A further coincidence is that 
the songs were sung in the same key, I having simply transposed 
my theme an octave lower. Have birds a sense of tonality? 
Here is Mr. Oldys’ record:

  ROBIN 
The Robin is one of the first to greet the coming day, and one of the last to 
bid it farewell. His song consists of a series of groups of two or three notes, sometimes 
establishing a definite tonality, and sometimes being merely an incoherent, rambling 
discourse, 
The first strain which I have used was noted by Mr. F. Schuyler Mathews, 
author of the “Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music,” who has kindly given 
me permission to employ it. That used in the refrain of the song, I heard exactly 
as it appears here, except that it was originally sung in the key of G

WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW 
This beautiful melody greeted my ear on the tenth of last 
May, as I was hurrying across our campus. The melody was so 
clear and the intervals so distinct that I at once committed it 
to paper before I had identified the singer. I soon obtained a fairly 
good view of him, but was not absolutely certain that it was a 
White-crowned Sparrow until I had compared the melody with those 
reported by Mr. Mathews. Here I found his clearly stated principle 
strikingly illustrated; namely, that each species sings with its own 
characteristic rhythm. The intervals sung by my bird were quite 
different from those heard by Mr. Mathews, but the rhythm was 
the same. This principle must not be applied too literally, however, 
as there are many exceptions. The bird in question, for instance, 
has been known to sing melodies with very different rhythms from 
the one which I heard, but the general tendency, I believe, is as 
stated. 
The spirit of the song which I heard seemed so clearly to 
suggest devotion, that this morning hymn of praise was the logical 
result.

WHITE-THROATED SPARROW 
To say that a certain bird sings ““zwee, zwee-e-e,” would not 
mean much more to one unacquainted with the song, than the words 
“voi che sapete” would to one who had never heard Mozart’s beau- 
tiful melody. If, however, the notes commonly sung by the afore- 
said bird were to accompany the syllables imitative of the tonal 
quality, together with suggestions as to tempo, volume of tone, etc., 
then a fairly good imagination might gain some idea of the sound 
of the bird’s song. 
There are some exceptions to this statement, however. If 
you were told that one bird sings “Bob White,” and another “Whip- 
poor-Will,” the chances are you would recognize the bird when you 
heard him. So also with the White-throated Sparrow. Whether 
you listen for “Old Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody,” or “All 
day whittlin’, whittlin’, whittlin’,” you will know him, for his rhythm 
is unmistakable. I heard a White-throat one cold morning last 
October, and his song sounded so disconsolate that I was led to 
read into it the sentiment appearing in my fancied duet between 
two birds. Then, too, it struck me that the word “quivering” is as 
imitative as “Peverly,” which is commonly ascribed to him, and 
“twittering” is as true as “whittlin’.”” I am certain that the bird 
is as innocent of one word as the other, and as the words which I 
have put into his mouth have a coherent meaning, I hope they will 
find favor.

  SONG SPARROW 
The Song Sparrow—what a wonderful melodist he is! We are just beginning to appreciate his great talent for inventing beautiful 
melodies. It was but a short time ago that a well-known ornithologist expressed his amazement on learning that a Song Sparrow had 
been heard to sing seven different variations of atheme. Another writer says: ““The song varies greatly with individuals, and almost 
every writer renders it differently.” True, indeed; but we may go further and say that not only does the song vary with individuals, 
but each individual bird may have many different songs in his own répertoire; yes, and not only variations of one theme, but many abso- 
lutely distinct themes. 
Last summer, during a period of fifteen minutes, I heard one bird sing six different songs, of which the second and third might be 
called variations of the first, while the other three were entirely new thematic material, differing from each other as well as from the first. 
And an interesting fact is that they were sung in closely related keys—four in F major, one in C major and one in B-flat major. Each 
song was repeate rperans a dozen times, separated by short pauses, with practically no change of intervals, until seeming to tire of the 
one, the bird would start off on another melody. 
This custom of repeating is quite characteristic of the bird’s singing; in fact, all of the thirty songs which I recorded last summer 
were delivered in this manner. é 
he songs I heard were all quite simple, uniformly diatonic, and with definite tonality. No wonder that “almost every writer 
renders it differently,” when we reflect that none of the melodies which I have noted have I seen recorded elsewhere, nor do I remember 
hearing any of the songs which others have reported.

FIELD SPARROW 
The songs of this Sparrow are not so interesting from a 
melodic standpoint as those of the Song Sparrow, nor does he pos- 
sess such a variety of themes. Still, he has a larger number than 
most of his tribe, and as for execution, his accelerandos and cre- 
scendos are well-nigh perfect. Mr. Chapman says: “His song is in 
keeping with his character, being an unusually clear, plaintive 
whistle, sweeter to the lover of birds’ songs than the voice of the 
most gifted songstress.” This is a strong statement, but there 
certainly is something very appealing in the sweet tones of the 
simple little melody which floats across the field in the heat of mid- 
day, or, later, adds to the spirit of peace which comes with the 
lengthening shadows. 
The first of the two themes which I have used was recorded 
by Mr. Oldys; the second I heard in a field near Frankfort, Mich. 
While they are both interesting themes, they are, perhaps, rather 
unusual, the more common form being somewhat like the following:

BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO 
Shortly after sunset one evening, as I was walking through 
a pasture containing much second growth of maple, beech, and fir, 
I was brought up short by a most interesting succession of sounds 
coming from a dense thicket quite near me. ‘‘Coo-coo-coo, coo-coo- 
C00, coo-coo-coo”’ were the sounds, given in perfect rhythmic succes- 
sion, on one pitch, and with a quality of tone which produced a 
very tranquil, peaceful effect. There could be no doubt as to the 
identity of the singer. 
But this is not the limit of his ability. On another occasion, 
I was startled by an ejaculation from the bushes directly ahead of 
me: ‘“Oo-wock-oo!”? At least, so I understood it, and was further 
amazed to see the ejaculator, a Black-billed Cuckoo, fly out and 
off, away from my sight. Then, as I still stood at attention, I was 
the object of still further remarks from a tree not very far away: 
“Cowlp, cowlp, cowlp!”’ This was exceedingly interesting to me, for 
while he did not sing the word “cuckoo,” yet the tones were exactly 
those attributed to his European cousin: 
  The tones were sharp and clear, and the interval exact. If he can 
sing “Cuckoo,” or “Coo-coo-coo,” on one pitch, and “Cowlp,”’ using 
two tones, it is but reasonable to suppose that he does sometimes 
actually sing ‘‘Cuckoo” on the two tones, as does the European 
Cuckoo. In fact, Mr. Cheney heard him do so, though the interval 
sung was a perfect fourth.

  WHIP-POOR-WILL 
Who has not heard this eerie call from across the lake, or from somewhere in the woods on a summer 
evening? And indeed, it may be heard at any time during the night, until it is drowned in the chorus 
of those who greet the dawn. 
The intervals of the call vary with different individuals, and the same bird may vary his own theme 
at different times, but the rhythm is quite constant. 
The best effect will be produced in this song by whistling the melody, at the same time trying to 
form the words ‘‘Whip-poor-will” with the lips and tongue. There is also a slight chuckling sound just 
before each “whip,” represented here by the grace-note.

BLACK-POLL WARBLER 
One day I ran across a flock of these tiny birds, whose faint, 
high-pitched voices seemed continually to be saying: “What would 
you, would you see, see, see?” So I constructed this little song, 
with that question as a starting-point, and the melody to which 
the words were sung as the musical theme. 
Some little friends of mine who have learned the song, call it 
the song of the “see-see”’ bird. 
Sometimes the song was varied by the insertion of the chro- 
matic tone, B natural, in the upward progression; but, as a rule, the 
melody was diatonic. I am aware, however, that this melody is 
rather exceptional, for the Black-poll more commonly sings a mono- 
tone.

BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER 
This Warbler is accounted to be the finest singer of his family. 
The melody which I have used is not the invariable form of this song, 
as he is quite as apt to use other tones for the close. I have heard 
the same bird vary the song by adding B-flat between C and A. 
The tone-quality is light and thin, but given in such a leisurely 
style that the effect is most pleasing. 
Another song, quite different from the one quoted, which is 
frequently heard from this bird, runs as follows:

BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER 
There may be some who will consider it foolish to ascribe any 
musical value to so simple and seemingly barren a theme as this. 
But we need only remind such that from just such simple thematic 
material as that sung by the thin, wiry little voice of the Black- 
throated Blue Warbler, some of the world’s greatest masterpieces 
have been evolved. 
I grant that the song which I have written is an absolutely 
simple song, but how could one, in sincerity, write an elaborate song 
with this tiny bird as the subject? 
It seems to me, moreover, that it is high time that musicians 
were cognizant and appreciative of the wealth of melody daily 
poured forth by these feathered friends of ours.

    MOURNING DOVE 
The melody which I have here used, I heard sung in exactly this pitch and with the 
intervals quite true, though the portamento was freely used as indicated. Rather low in pitch 
for a bird, you say? Yes, but that is one thing which gives the song its mournful, pathetic 
character. 
Do we not commonly think of a voice of contralto quality as more expressive of sympathy 
or other tender emotions than a high soprano voice? The bird is well named.

BOB-WHITE, OR QUAIL 
When I was a small boy, it was a common fancy with us children to consider the calls 
of the Quail as the pronouncements of an infallible weather-prophet. Sometimes he said, ‘More 
wet!” Well, then it would surely rain. Again it might be, “No more wet!” and, though it were 
raining at the time, he doubtless meant that it would clear off soon. So I have used these 
phrases in the song. 
‘These are not the only intervals which he uses. Sometimes the jump is a fifth, again a 
sixth, or even a seventh, but he does not seem to vary his style; it is always the same cheery, 
ringing call. The intervals I have used are those which were sung by the bird whose tones I 
happened to record. The rest of the melody is, of course, entirely my own invention.

  CAROLINA WREN 
Mr. Henry Oldys, to whom I am indebted for these themes, has written of this bird as follows: “First acquaint- 
ance with the Carolina Wren is always a surprise. Almost as small as his well-known cousin, the House Wren, he seems 
scarcely capable of having breath enough in his little body to produce the clear, ringing notes that startle the neighboring 
echoes.” 
A letter from Mr. Isaac E. Hess, who has contributed so much to the appreciation of birds on the part of residents 
in central Illinois, refers thus to his song: “Have you heard the Carolina Wren? There is a note that can be placed imme- 
diately in the scale. The song to which I refer (he has several), begins with high DO, then drops to SOL, then on to lower 
DO, a pure octave, repeating the DO-SOL-DO three times in succession.” While I have not used this theme, it will be 
seen to differ but little from one which I have used.

WINTER WREN 
Have you ever heard the Winter Wren? No? Then you 
have missed one of the merriest, cheeriest, most effervescent songs 
to be heard in all of nature’s great chorus. A pair of them made 
their home in a hollow tree not thirty feet from my cottage in the 
woods, and from June 22d, when I first heard them, until the middle 
of July, their spirits were unquenchable. 
Mr. Bradford Torrey, in his interesting book, “Birds in the 
Bush,” says: “The great distinction of the Winter Wren’s melody is 
its marked rhythm and accent.” Yes, and the fact that nearly 
every tone is either trilled or repeated so rapidly that it reminds one 
of a bubbling fountain. Yet his intervals are quite clear, and his 
tonality, as a rule, is distinct. He has the habit of repeating his 
melodies as does the Song Sparrow, though with the repetitions the 
intervals will occasionally vary slightly. In other words, he may 
flat some tone until the melody is finally twisted into another key. 
As may be judged from a study of the themes which I have 
used, his song may take several different forms. Many other records 
I have from the same singer, some of them new themes, and others 
fragments or distortions of these.

  BOBOLINK 
As one morning I went for water to the well hidden in the trees just above a small open meadow, I was greeted from 
below by a remarkable melody, given in clear flute-like tones which caused me to stop in amazement. “Hello!” said I, “who 
is whistling Schumann?” Further investigation revealed the white cap and the black breast of the Bobolink, who was thus 
unconsciously though unmistakably singing a part of the well-known theme from the “Faschingsschwank.” And not once 
but for several days, I heard the same song, sometimes just as quoted, sometimes curtailed, or, again, followed by a rapid 
fire of tones which I believe no human ear could disentangle. 1 tried many times, but always gave up in despair. Shortly 
afterward, however, with the influx of summer residents, and the frequenting of his domain by wild-strawberry seekers, he 
departed to fields unknown. 
Another Bobolink, which lived in a meadow about a quarter of a mile distant, sang in the same style, but with a theme 
consisting of an exact major triad, with the third and fifth preceded by a short tone on the fourth and sixth respectively. 
i Both of these main themes were always sung in a clear, precise manner, never hurried—such as any whistling boy might 
easily imitate. 
Since the first theme which I heard was so strikingly like that of Schumann’s though the bird sang in C major, I have 
eeken te liberty of using the first part of the Schumann composition in its exact, originalform. In my song, this theme appears 
second,

A WOODLAND MEDLEY 
This song was written expressly for the Hughey Color-Music 
School. In this school, children are taught to associate each tone of 
the scale with a certain color, and, to add interest, birds of the 
proper color are shown in picture and treated in story. To bring 
this phase of the subject from the imaginary to the real, I have 
selected birds of the proper color, which sing songs accentuating the 
tone represented by the color. All of the notes of the melody of this 
song are the actual bird notes. 
The colors assigned to the various notes of the scale, and the 
bird chosen for each, are as follows: 
Do, red, Cardinal. 
Re, orange, Baltimore Oriole. 
Mi, yellow, Yellow-breasted Chat. 
Fa, green, Red-eyed Vireo. 
Sol, blue, Blue Jay. 
La, violet, Linnet, or Purple Finch. 
Ti, pink, Rose-breasted Grosbeak. 
Do, light red, Cardinal.

     Such a collection as this illustrates, as has never 
been done before, the potential pleasures and profits of 
folk-dancing, especially to the growing generation. These 
dances of Finland are, like the dances of Denmark, 
, racy of the soil. It is an interesting fact that, although 
they are peculiarly national in feeling, their inherent 
simplicity and spontaneousness makes them universal. 
All who know Miss Burchenal’s earlier works will be de- 
lighted with her two latest publications. 
  With its companion volume of Finnish dances, this 
work is but lately from the press and will be found to 
contain a selected number of dances characteristic in 
spirit of the native soil whence Miss Burchenal has 
transplanted them for our benefit. Again, the dances 
are depicted through music and detailed descriptions 
easily comprehended. The edition is officially authorized 
by the Danish Society for the Promotion of Folk-Dancing.

GILBERT DANCES Edited by Susan Hoffman Gilman 
Vow. 1 Vou. II 
Melvin Ballou Gilbert, whose death, in 1910, deprived America of her foremost dancing teacher, created a 
new form for an old art. He fought his way to success through pure individual genius and the force of his own 
convictions, and he lived to enjoy a world-wide fame. He created exquisite dances to music of his own composi- 
tion and to fragments from the classics. 
A belief that purely gymnastic work did not constitute the ideal of physical training led to the evolving 
of a system now known as Gilbert Dancing. The books of Gilbert Dances are representative of the material used 
by Gilbert and reflect the principles of his teaching.

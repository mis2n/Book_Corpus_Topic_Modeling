PREFACE 
SINCE the first edition of this volume was issued seven. 
years ago, there has been a rapid development in some 
aspects of the American high school. The function 
and educational value of the several studies have not 
been materially changed ; consequently no sufficient rea- 
son exists for altering the parts of this book that pertain 
to those topics. 
Much pressure, however, has been brought to bear 
upon the high school to compel it to alter somewhat 
fundamentally its leading purposes, especially with 
respect to vocational ends. 
This powerful modern movement calls for a reéxami- 
nation of educational principles in the light of present 
conditions. What high-school leaders and _ teachers 
seem most to desire is a perspective of the whole 
situation, in order that they may estimate correctly 
the validity of the respective claims of general and 
special education, for they fluctuate according to the 
needs and conditions of various locations. 
To meet this need for perspective, six chapters upon 
“Basic Ideals for Educational Progress” have been 
added. They consider progress in education from the

following standpoints: prosperity; health; general, 
or cultural, education; special, or vocational, educa- 
tion; eugenics and euthenics; and the reciprocal rela- 
tions that should exist between individuals and social 
groups. 
The appendices of the first edition are now omitted, 
having become comparatively useless by reason of rapid 
changes in the high-school curriculum, and having been 
made mostly unnecessary by the accessibility of recent 
data upon courses of study. 
The most prominent purpose of the remainder of the 
volume is to reveal, through an analysis of the content 
of the studies themselves, their inherent and compara- 
tive educational value, and upon the basis of the values 
thus established to determine the best possible com- 
bination of the studies into the various curricula now 
demanded. 
A second purpose, of almost equal weight, is to show 
how, upon the basis of the proposition that education 
for insight must always be accompanied by training for 
efficiency, secondary education can most effectively 
perform its proper functions.

BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL 
PROGRESS
-P-A-G-E-14

-P-A-G-E-15
CHAPTER I 
PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION 
The measure of prosperity is income; the educationa 
means for its attainment is training for efficiency. 
AS 
1. Measure and Means 
To be attainable, an ideal must have a definite stand- 
ard by which its realization can be measured, and it 
must have equally definite means through which it 
may be approached. Ideals which lack these charac- 
teristics belong to the domain of “‘pious wishes.” Thus 
one man may sigh for the beautiful or the good, another 
for the elimination of vice or crime or injustice or poverty 
or disease, without devising measures of progress or 
means of accomplishment. These are utopian ideals, 
laudable perhaps in purpose, but impotent in execution. 
2. Income as a Measure of Prosperity 
Income is the primary measure of prosperity, because 
it is income that makes everything else possible. Ade- 
quate income is the antecedent of saving, the presuppo- 
sition of a normal moral life in the community, the pre- 
requisite of comfort, and the indispensable basis for 
progress in the arts and sciences. Virtue is unduly 
3
-P-A-G-E-16
    4 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
tempted when it is paid five dollars a week, while vice 
offers twenty-five ; frugality is paralyzed by the constant 
presence of misery due to want; again, who can delight 
in art when his children cry for bread ? 
Income is an economic index of even non-economic 
efficiency. If a man is going to be a minister of the 
  
    gospel, his efficiency should be such that he can com-   
mand a salary commensurate with comfort and progress. 
The same is true of the teacher, or of a member of any 
other learned profession. That those who are to par- 
ticipate directly in economic production, exchange, or 
distribution should be trained to earn an income ade- 
quate for progress in morality and well-being is a well- 
nigh self-evident proposition. 
This income measurement, therefore, applies to all 
workers in society, for not only is the worker worthy 
of his hire, but he should be worthy of an income suffi- 
cient to secure progress because of the inherent value 
of his services. However much treasure is laid up in 
heaven, enough should also be laid up on earth to se- 
cure the essential progress of the individual and his 
dependents. 3 
3. Choice and Valuation of Means 
The prosperity of a people or of individuals is bound 
up with many economic and political causes and condi- 
tions which an educational work is not called upon
-P-A-G-E-17
PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION 5 
to analyze or evaluate. The essential question is, 
By what means can education most effectively and most 
universally promote prosperity ? 
The means must not be limited to a single class of 
the population, as, for example, industrial workers, for 
prosperity is as much needed by the non-industrial 
classes as by others. Poverty incites to rapacity or 
servility, rather than to the highest type of service to man. 
Moreover, who wants a professional man or a statesman 
who can earn no more than a pittance? The meagre- 
ness of his reward is to some extent at least an index of 
the worth of his views. The primary means, moreover, 
must underlie the secondary as their logical presuppo- 
sition. Thus, frugality should not be put first, since 
it cannot thrive below the margin of decent sub- 
sistence. 
Training to economic efficiency must then, on several 
grounds, be accepted as the primary educational 
means for promoting prosperity. In the first place 
men can prosper honestly only to the extent that they 
can render services that others are willing to pay for, 
and the degree and rank of the efficiency determines 
in the main the worth of the service. In the next place 
a developing society moves rapidly and steadily away 
from the unskilled. An educated public does not care 
to listen to a narrow-minded preacher, or employ a 
badly trained physician, or elect a blatant, bladder-   
     
-P-A-G-E-18
  
6 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
brained politician, or employ a teacher who is snugly 
embalmed in the traditions of an outgrown civilization. 
Neither does it want a muscle- and mind-bound me- 
chanic who cannot adapt himself to changes in machines 
and methods. Finally, without efficiency nothing 
follows; with it, everything desirable becomes possible. 
Therefore, though it be granted that other elements 
influenced by education contribute to prosperity, and 
though our results may be realized only in the some- 
what distant future, may we not accept this principle 
of training to efficiency as the best means known to edu- 
cation whereby it may contribute to progress in pros- 
perity ? 
4. Deficit and Surplus: Two Types of Economic 
Society 
“Society” is not static, the same yesterday, to-day, 
and to-morrow; but, like the individual, is subject to 
growth, to arrested development, and to temporary 
decline. It may be benevolent and life-giving or tyran- 
nical and oppressive — helpful or helpless. 
It is, moreover, not one great undifferentiated entity, 
but a complex of many partially interpenetrating groups 
pertaining to government, religion, education, family 
life, and, above and beneath all, of economic groups for 
producing and distributing wealth. It is perhaps natural 
for the young to assume that as things now are, so they
-P-A-G-E-19
  PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION 7 
always have been. But this, of course, is not the case. 
Perhaps the most illuminating distinction between the 
past and the present of economic society is that empha- 
sized by Patten, first in his “Theory of Social Forces,” 
and more recently in his ‘‘New Basis of Civilization” 
and in his ‘‘Social Basis of Religion.”” He contrasts the 
stage of a national, or social, deficit with that of a social 
surplus. These stages may be briefly described as 
follows : — 
(1) The State of Social Deficit — A “Pain” Economy 
In such a stage of civilization there are two chief 
classes of men: the exploiters and the exploited; the 
strong and the weak. Wealth is indeed produced, but 
it is inadequate to secure progress. What there is 
flows from the weak to the strong, except the bare amount 
requisite for bodily existence. A society in a fixed state 
of financial deficit lives in a condition of fear and uncer- 
tainty with their attendants of suffering and sacrifice 
as prerequisites for living at all. Such a society is weak 
in its resistance both to foreign aggression and to domes- 
tic exploitation. In earlier times the masses were 
either enslaved outright, or held in some sort of servi- 
tude, as in Sparta, or in Europe during the feudal 
system, or, more recently, in Russia. The morality of 
such a system is one of sacrifice; merit is measured by 
suffering. The bad results to the few strong leaders are 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
8 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
arrogant assumption of authority, unregulated power, 
and ultimate deterioration in vigor because of dissipa- 
tion; to the poor they are dire poverty and its attend- 
ant evils, arrested development, misery, vice, crime, 
and a general state of sheep-like subjection. 
(2) The State of Social Surplus—A “ Pleasure,” or 
Codperative, Economy 
A society with a social surplus has the capacity for 
progress. Wealth no longer flows in an uninterrupted 
stream from the weak to the strong, but with a vigorous 
return current from the strong to the weak. This return 
current flows through many channels, social and individ- 
ual. Thus, in the United States the money donated 
annually to benevolent purposes often reaches the 
enormous total of a quarter of a billion dollars. Much 
more gigantic are the sums spent in public improve- 
ments. - 
When a nation is producing much more than is needed 
for bare subsistence, that is, when it has a decided social 
surplus, then society becomes more democratic, and the 
masses, rising above abject poverty, shake off their worst 
miseries, become more self-respecting, have their powers 
of initiative aroused, and gradually emancipate them- 
selves from the pains that inevitably accompany a state 
of deficit. Foreign aggression is so hotly repelled that
-P-A-G-E-21
  PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION 9 
it ceases to be a perpetual and serious menace. Great 
cities are built, industries developed, national defence 
provided for, universal education up to a certain point 
maintained, and the arts and sciences so developed that 
they provide new sources of general welfare and social 
progress. The morality of sacrifice gives place to the 
morality of progress through voluntary codperation ; 
fear is replaced by hope and love, and though vice, 
crime, and misery may exist, they are mitigated, and to 
some extent ‘successfully combated. On the other 
hand, prosperity, partly because of faulty distribu- 
tion, leads to evils of its own. Among these are the 
degeneration caused by the dissipation of those who 
have too much, as well as by the underdevelopment of 
those who have too little. A wild animal may gorge 
himself without harm because he must put forth so much 
effort to catch his prey, but the intellectual worker or 
the physical idler who gorges himself on food or drink 
soon lays the foundations of disease and premature 
death. In other words, he ‘subjects himself to 
various forms of degeneration, thus injuring not only 
himself, but his children, since they become fewer in 
number and poorer in quality. But on the whole a 
society with a surplus is greatly to be preferred to one 
with a deficit, because the surplus is the indispensable 
means for progress. Fear and pain are not the best 
nurses of peace, love, and progress. While fear may
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  Io BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
preserve the social groups, it checks at the same time 
their free development. 
5. The Need of More Widespread Prosperity 
A distinction must be made between the prosperity 
of the individual and that of the social whole to which 
he belongs. National economic efficiency may pile   
      
up a rapidly increasing social surplus, say of two billions 
a year, as in the United States, yet permit the widespread 
poverty of individuals to remain a painful fact. 
A growing social surplus in a nation sets many prob- 
lems that education is not called upon single-handed to 
solve. Perhaps the greatest of these is the equitable 
distribution of wealth: first, between its producers 
and the general public through taxation, in order 
that education, protection, and an environment favorable 
to development may be provided for all; and, second, 
among the individual producers themselves, that pov- 
erty may not arrest the budding powers and virtues of 
the young, or luxury and misguided energy enfeeble 
those most able to exploit national and other resources. 
The solution of these great problems of the distribution 
of wealth belongs to statesmen, economists, moralists, 
and to the enlightened public opinion of adult citizens. 
Education can perhaps help to establish and inculcate 
principles of distribution, but it has no machinery for 
their application. The same is true in greater or less
-P-A-G-E-23
i ee \V 
PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION Ir 
degree in the legal, political, and religious aspects of 
community life. 
But in so far as public and private prosperity depend 
upon the efficiency of the individual, education has 
much to say and do. 
6. First Requisite in Training for Efficiency 
Efficiency is a universal category, and income is its 
economic coefficient. However reluctant we may be to 
measure a man’s inherent qualities by his relative 
income, as in the case of a mental worker, like the 
teacher or the preacher, yet to a considerable extent such 
a measure is not only fair, but inevitable and desirable. 
Competition, adjustment, and the conditions of 
environment complicate the problem, but they do not 
materially alter the fact that what a man does for his 
living has its money measure. Every man, therefore, 
whatever his calling, should be able to earn an income 
sufficient for progress in the essentials of life, the preacher 
no less than the blacksmith, the employee of commerce 
no less than the worker in productive industry. If 
economic efficiency is a necessity for everybody, then the 
means for gaining it must be available for all. 
The most fundamental agent of education is knowl- 
edge, for this term sums up all that the accumulated ex- 
perience of the past has to offer us. It is our great social 
heritage, which, as Goethe says, each must earn in order
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  I2 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
to possess. Earning means learning, and upon the 
manner of the learning depends, so far as the school 
is concerned, the degree of efficiency that will be 
attained. 
Therefore the categorical imperative of education is 
this: ‘Carry thy learning to the highest possible point 
of efficiency in application.” This means that if one 
studies language, one shall be able to make this study of 
the greatest possible utility in the appreciation and in 
the expression of thought; if studies in mathematics 
are pursued, they shall proceed to the point of ready use 
as instruments of measurement and calculation in the 
solution of the quantitative problems that are encountered 
in actual life, and so in turn for each of the studies of 
the curriculum. Teachers are usually content if the 
student shows a clear intellectual grasp of the facts or 
principles involved; but this is not enough, for efficiency 
is not attained in this field until what is clearly compre- 
hended is vividly applied. 
The excellence of instruction in technological institu- 
tions is due, not so much to the fact that they deal with 
practical subjects, as that they carry knowledge to the 
point of practical application. This is an excellence 
that must be emulated by all grades and kinds of schools, 
the classical no less than the commercial or industrial, 
1See the author’s distinction between clear and vivid ideas, “Interest 
“and Education,” p. 44.
-P-A-G-E-25
  
PROSPERITY AND EDUCATION 13 
the lower no less than the higher, if education is not to 
stop short of the point of efficiency. 
That there are other requisites for training and effi- 
ciency is most certain, but the one named comes first. 
The others will be developed in due order in subsequent 
chapters.

  CHAPTER II 
HEALTH 
The measure of the degree of health that promotes progress 
is surplus energy; the means for its attainment is hygiene, 
both public and personal. 
1. Surplus Energy as Measure 
There are many reasons why health should be consid- 
ered next in importance to existence itself, since prac- 
tically everything that makes life worth living at all is 
dependent upon it. These considerations, however, are 
not the theme of the present chapter. The measure 
of health that promotes progress and the means for 
attaining such health are the topics before us. 
(1) Development of Latent Characters 
That surplus energy is the measure of the degree of 
health which promotes progress may be seen from its 
influence in the development of latent characters. 
Most biologists are now convinced that acquired char- 
acters, whether mental or physical, are not inherited by 
the young, but that all inherited traits come through 
the germ-plasm. ‘Those characters come to the front 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
  HEALTH 15 
whose development is stimulated by the environment, 
while those not so stimulated remain more or less latent, 
waiting for the right combination of circumstances to 
bring them into activity. Acquired characters are 
precisely those that have been forced upon men by the 
environments in which they have lived. So long as 
these do not change, the young, both by imitation and 
by compulsion, have to acquire similar characters in 
order to thrive under the given conditions. Environ- 
ments of social deficit, with their attendant evils of pain, 
fear, misery, and sacrifice, have compelled the acqui- 
sition of certain characteristics, but they have hereby 
suppressed the development of other characters quite 
as natural that have been inherited in a latent form. 
Thus, primitive fear of natural forces is transformed by 
knowledge into confidence of ability to use them as 
instruments of progress. Social surplus, on the other 
hand, releases the pressure hitherto exerted by environ- 
ing conditions and permits latent characters to have a 
more natural development. The primitive in us impels 
us to kill wild animals; but a state of society in which 
they are no longer dangerous or are not needful for our 
support, allows sentiments of toleration concerning them 
to develop. Not everybody now tries to kill‘every harm- 
less snake he comes across, and many indeed now con- 
sider hunting a relic of barbarism. 
A social surplus acts, therefore, ina double way. It
-P-A-G-E-28
16 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
gives, first, freedom for the development of latent 
characteristics; and, second, increased energy to facili- 
tate their development. This is the surplus energy 
generated by the health made possible by a social surplus. 
As history so abundantly shows, a general state of 
deficit in a nation or a continent, whether this arises 
from decreasing rainfall, poverty of natural resources, 
or overpopulation, means abject subjection and exploi- 
tation for the mass of mankind, and a chronic state of 
fear and pain. So long as this condition lasts, there are 
no upward avenues of hope for them. The characters 
they have been forced to acquire, they are forced to 
engraft upon their offspring. But when national wealth 
so far accumulates that there is plenty of food for 
all, and when both the power and the disposition 
to exploit decline, then new energy is given to men, 
hope displaces despair or stolid endurance, and new 
channels of activity are opened to young and old. 
Among parents, lessening oppression and growing 
energy arouse ambition. New occupations are often 
entered upon, and other environments are sought where 
the new force and freedom may have broader scope. 
This is the meaning of the immigration to America by 
adults for the past four hundred years. 
Important as this access of energy is to parents, it is 
still more important to children. In the first place, it 
gives them a longer childhood, in that it releases them 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  HEALTH 17 
from the benumbing effects of premature toil, together 
with its correlative impressment of acquired characters. 
Increasing prosperity means abundant food, as among 
the pioneers of America, and finally, as now, it means 
greatly extended education. The result is that the 
natural qualities which were kept latent by an oppres- 
sive environment have free scope for development. 
Each new generation seeks to rise to a higher plane of 
social life, for the plastic mind of youth, no longer forced 
by poverty into set moulds, responds to new stimuli, 
puts forth new growth, and readjusts its mental char- 
acteristics. Freedom from external codes of conduct 
and from the internal fears that the past has impressed, 
makes mental reconstruction possible. If our economic‘ 
problem is to avoid deficit and accumulate surplus, our 
psychical problem is to suppress the old ideals of pain 
and fear and now useless sacrifice, and to awaken the 
dominant personal and social qualities that make for 
progress. 
(2) Surplus Energy and Life 
If surplus energy is important in the development of 
new traits, it is no less important in the conduct of life 
itself. So far as the mind is concerned, the doctrine of 
interest shows us that benumbing drudgery becomes 
interesting work when the interest in the final accomplish- 
ment is carried back and attached to the means for reach- 
ing the end, as in carrying out an original design for an 
c
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
artistic product; the physical counterpart to that 
doctrine is that there is no drudgery so long as there is 
an abounding supply of energy. Even the most prosaic 
physical labor may be performed with zest, provided 
there is such a supply of surplus energy as to render its 
expenditure a physical satisfaction. Energy and interest 
are, of course, natural complements, each of the other. 
When both are present, life and all its labor are filled 
with zeal. They are the sources of hope and good cheer, 
of pleasure and enthusiasm. Interest declines with the 
expenditure of energy; it revives with the restoration 
of nervous force. The ergograph is always able to tell 
the story of permanent or fluctuating energy. That 
this energy may be kept in its lowest estate of muscular 
  
    routine or raised to its highest powers in mental effi-   
ciency is most true, but this is not the important point, 
since the use to which energy shall be put is not the same 
as the question of its abundant presence. 
Whether, therefore, we think of the development of 
latent characteristics or the conduct of life itself, surplus 
energy must be regarded as the physical measure of 
health that leads to progress. Health of this sort not 
only preserves life and conserves comfort, but it does 
more. It gives the buoyant step, the clear eye, the 
smooth, perfect skin, the wholesome complexion, the 
penetrating insight, the elevated purpose, the resolute 
will; it releases, moreover, unused stores of native
-P-A-G-E-31
  HEALTH 19 
ability, while it diminishes pain and fear and increases 
the enthusiastic zest of life. 
2. Public Hygiene as Means 
The means for securing the degree of health that pro- 
motes progress are public and personal hygiene. Edu- 
cation can affect the former both directly and indirectly ; 
directly through the administration of school hygiene, 
and indirectly through imparting knowledge and devel- 
oping ideals. 
(x) The Prevention of Disease 
The immediate purpose of public hygiene is to remove~- 
or lessen the causes of physical ills. 
How important for progress the matter of public 
hygiene is, may be seen from the consideration of a few 
facts that investigation has revealed. In the United 
States, on the average, three million people are found to 
be ill at any given time. Of these half a million are 
male wage-earners over fifteen years of age. The esti- 
mated annual cost in loss of wages and expense of 
medical attendance is shown to be well over a billion 
dollars, or about one-half as much as the united savings 
of the nation amount to. Seager! estimates that if 
the conditions concerning the four items, water, milk, 
air, and accidents, were made as favorable to health 
1 Seager, H. R., “ Social Insurance,” ch. IT. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
20 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
as public hygiene is capable of making them, the average 
length of life in the United States would be increased by 
eight years. Gould maintains that at least one-third of 
the suffering and loss due to disease is preventable. 
People will doubtless continue to die of disease more 
than of old age, but they need not die so soon. Kober 
finds the annual loss from typhoid fever to be three 
hundred and fifty million dollars, yet so preventable is 
typhoid that one writer declares it should no longer be 
listed as a disease, but rather as a crime. Improved 
water supply enabled Lawrence, Massachusetts, to re- 
duce the death rate in typhoid from one hundred and five 
to twenty-two per one hundred thousand, and Pittsburg 
from one hundred thirty and eight-tenths to forty-six 
and six-tenths. Yet that even these lower death rates 
in these cities are still criminally high may be seen from 
comparison with the figures for European cities. Dur- 
ing 1907 the death rate there from typhoid per one hun- 
‘dred thousand was as follows: London, 5; Edinburgh, 
2; Paris, 8; The Hague, 1; Berlin, Hamburg, and 
Vienna, 4 each; Munich, 3. 
That eight millions who are alive to-day in the United 
States will die prematurely of consumption is certainly 
an appalling fact, yet the destruction that comes to 
guilty and innocent alike from disease generated by 
vice is still more distressing, for to the pain of suffering 
is added moral degeneration. To diseases of this kind
-P-A-G-E-33
HEALTH 21 
are ascribed 80 per cent of blindness, 75 per cent of the 
operations upon women for inflammation, and a large 
per cent of infant mortality. In France alone 20,000 
children die annually from such afflictions. No nation 
has thus far successfully combated diseases associated 
with vice, because sentiment has hitherto prevented the 
public from treating all infectious and contagious diseases 
alike. Former President Eliot ! vigorously urges legis- 
lation compelling physicians to report all such diseases, 
whether socially disgraceful or not, to the board of 
health. He demands a new code of ethics for physicians, 
who permit the innocent to suffer, because they hold 
themselves bound by the oath of Hippocrates to keep 
secret all relations between themselves and their patients. 
(2) Mental Hygiene 
Of equal importance with public measures to prevent 
disease, are the provisions for what may be called mental 
hygiene. The best of bodies are liable to decline in 
vigor and efficiency in depressing or hateful surroundings. 
Squalor and ugliness attack the mind perhaps as fatally 
as they generate bacteria to afflict the body. Health 
thrives best when sunshine lights up what is pleasing to 
the spirit: open spaces, trees, birds, flowers, pleasant 
sounds, artistic buildings and grounds, and _ inspir- 
ing works of art, not only in museums, but on every side. 
1 Eliot, C. W., in Social Diseases, October, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-34
    
22 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
Youthful America has in the past been disposed to keep 
her art, such as it was, in her cemeteries, so that to one 
depressing influence she has added another. But a 
better day is coming. Already people talk of a “‘city- 
beautiful,” and in most places they have at least an 
annual cleaning-up day. Schoolrooms are now fre- 
quently beautifully decorated. The goods in shop 
windows are often tastefully and sometimes beauti- 
fully arranged, so that occasionally one may behold 
a garment fit to adorn a Madonna or a hat that 
Venus herself might deign to wear. Some day 
art will overtake and then distance the ugly in 
sights and sounds, even in our largest cities. 
Under such conditions energy will not be dissipated 
in defending the mind against the offensive noises 
and hideous sights that now so frequently assail 
it. Conditions that prevent diseases of the body, and 
surroundings that promote the elasticity and joy of the 
mind, unite in the hygienic city to fit men for the most 
rapid and enduring progress of which they are capable. 
What is true in the city is equally true in the country, 
except that there, personal outweighs public care of 
health. 
3. Personal Hygiene as Means 
The need of personal hygiene for the young, under the 
leadership of the school, may be considered from several
-P-A-G-E-35
HEALTH 23 
standpoints. If diseases controllable by public hygiene 
are decreasing, many that are controllable only by per- 
sonal hygiene are increasing; thus since 1882 kidney 
troubles have increased 131 per cent, heart disease 57 
per cent, and apoplexy 84 per cent. 
(1) Artificial Conditions of Life 
The artificial conditions, first of education and then 
of life itself, demand protective training of the body to 
withstand them. Why do so many of the young and 
middle-aged have to see the world through glasses? 
Partly because of much reading by artificial or inadequate 
light. Why are so many rendered miserable and less 
efficient than they otherwise would be by difficulties 
of digestion? Why so liable to infectious diseases 
like grippe and pneumonia? The answer is still the 
same, — because of the artificial conditions imposed 
by sedentary occupation in furnace-heated rooms, in- 
adequate exercise in the open air coupled with over- 
eating of unsuitable food, the worry and rush of modern 
urban life, and the like. Again, this is the plastic age 
of man, when the tides of life run high, and when the 
whole organism, nervous and muscular, may be built 
up for a long life of health and vigor even under the 
adverse conditions of situations new to the race. 
The remedy for diseases due to too much artificiality 
is a return to more primitive conditions. When dys-
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
pepsia arises from food from which the cellulose has been 
extracted, as in white flour, we may recover on a diet of 
shredded wheat, which retains it all. Cellulose is not 
a food, but it is a mechanical aid to digestion. Primi- 
tive men ate their cereal foods just as nature produced 
them, and thus established for their posterity the con- 
ditions for healthy digestion. Similarly, when life in 
close, vitiated furnace-heated air causes delicacy or 
disease of the lungs, the remedy is not drugs, but fresh 
air day and night, summer and winter. Again, when 
jangling noises worry the mind, when overworking and 
overeating throw the nervous system out of gear, the 
remedy is still, back to nature. Flee to the woods or the 
sea, where the only sounds are those that nature pro- 
duces, and where darkness soothes to rest and slumber. 
Then, if the stock of vital energy is not wholly exhausted, 
rest and pleasant exercise and social companionship 
and wholesome food will bring back in full volume the 
tides of life. / 
(2) Resistance to Disease 
The first thing that personal hygiene must strive for 
is resistance to disease. This is necessary after all 
possible precautions concerning diet, clothing, cleanli- 
ness, and the like have been taken. If the mucous 
membranes of the body are sensitive to infection, there 
is danger everywhere. Bacteria are ubiquitous; they  
-P-A-G-E-37
HEALTH 26 
swarm in earth and air and water; they infest our food 
and houses and clothing. It is impossible to escape 
them, but if there are the proper powers of resistance, 
the human body is more fatal to harmful bacteria than 
they are to it. To a healthy adolescent, bacteria 
constitute the least of dangers; the peril lies elsewhere 
—in misdirection or dissipation of energy for ends that 
do not promote health or enduring happiness or indi- 
vidual progress. How the needful vigor and vitality 
are to be developed, it is for the school to teach. Among 
the best of books on this subject are Gulick’s “The 
Efficient Life,” + and Saleeby’s ‘‘Health, Strength, and 
2 Happiness. 
(3) The Direction of Surplus Energy 
It is indeed a great thing to inculcate ideals of physical 
excellence and to aid in realizing them; but this is rela- 
tively easy, since the young are eager to achieve physical 
excellence. But it is at once more difficult and more 
imperative to direct these powers to the proper ends, 
since lower ideals have to give way to higher. We 
have here one aspect of the whole of education. It 
involves the training of mind, the direction of the will, 
1Gulick, L. H., “The Efficient Life,” Doubleday, Page & Co., New 
York. 
2Saleeby, C. W., “Health, Strength, and Happiness,” Moffatt, Yard 
& Co., New York.
-P-A-G-E-38
  
26 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
and, above all, the constant exercise of the constructive 
powers. Knowledge, discipline, culture, efficiency, are 
  
    all involved. When we fit for economic efficiency we 
direct the surplus energy to useful ends; we do the   
same when we train for citizenship and when we develop 
artistic powers. Youth should be imbued with intel- 
lectual and esthetic and volitional consciousness, and his 
energies should be trained to flow in all these channels. 
He must be a member in many social groups, and here 
again his energies find abundant scope; he must also 
live his individual life, making it rich and full to over- 
flowing. In short, wherever he comes into contact 
with life, in work or in play, in public or in private, there 
he must turn on the full currents of vital energy, for here 
as elsewhere to sow is to reap, to spend is to create 
anew. 
4. The New Asceticism 
The cult of muscle as an end appeals spontaneously 
to youth, as is abundantly shown in school and college. 
If we contrast the instincts of the young with the 
asceticism that prevailed in the Middle Ages when the 
body was considered a clog on the spiritual life, it must 
be confessed that the youth holds the better view. But 
there is something else. Since the brain and nervous 
system are peculiarly the organs of the mind, hence 
of the spiritual life, Saleeby contrasts the older asceti-
-P-A-G-E-39
HEALTH 27 
cism with what he calls the newer asceticism. The 
older declared that since the spiritual is the true end, the 
body is at best a necessary evil, and is to be subordinated 
accordingly; but the newer asceticism maintains that 
since the spiritual can be obtained only through the 
agency of the central nervous system, it follows that this 
becomes the immediate end of physical development. 
Though we arrive at a species of asceticism by this rea- 
soning, the result is radically different from the conclu- 
sion of the ascetics of the Middle Ages; for instead of 
considering physical development as an evil, we must 
promote it as a necessary prerequisite of the higher 
life of man. Perfect the circulatory, the digestive, the 
muscular systems of the body? Most certainly, but 
not as ends in themselves. Develop them for the wel- 
fare of brain and nerve, for upon these depend the higher 
life. 
Here is a mediating idea that bridges the chasm be- 
tween the old contempt for the body and the newer 
admiration for it and for physical training. It ennobles 
the aim of modern hygiene and is capable of satisfying 
alike the aspirations of youth and the truer valuations 
that come with adult years. Muscle, brain, mind. This 
is the true order. Muscle for brain, brain for mind. 
Saleeby declares that nine-tenths of the infants born 
even in the slums are physically splendid little specimens 
of humanity. It is the function of private and public
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
hygiene to preserve them, to develop them, to conserve 
them for their own good and the good of the public. 
We must always remember that the essential part of 
physical man is his nervous system; that muscle is an 
instrument of brain and that brain is the organ of the 
mind. “The brain is the man.” 
The voice of the Middle Ages speaks as follows: 
“The soul or the body, which? Choose between them; 
you cannot have both, for they are so adjusted that 
when the one goes up, the other goes down.” The voice 
of the present is to this effect: ‘‘The soul and the body ; 
we must have both, for as the brain is, so is the mind; 
and as the rest of the body is, so is the brain.” 
What are the best reasons why youth should conserve 
and properly use its surplus energy? First, that it may 
do its appointed work, and then that the central nervous 
system may not be impaired, either by vice or by drugs 
or by those forms of dissipation that undermine, first 
the health and then the morals. 
It is for these reasons that surplus energy is the 
measure of the health that promotes progress, and that 
public and private hygiene are the adequate means for 
attaining it.

CHAPTER III 
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL 
EDUCATION 
The measure of political democracy is civic equality; 
its educational means is culture. 
1. The Implications of Civic Equality 
The most primary meaning of this term in a democracy 
is that there is a common life of the people into which 
every individual is born and in which he has certain 
rights to enjoy and duties to perform; that as a citizen 
his civic equality implies that his rights and privileges 
arise from properly meeting his responsibilities. The 
eighteenth century notion that men are born with in- 
alienable rights that exist and must be respected whether 
the correlative duties are performed or not, reduces a 
man to the plane of an animal; for the only “rights” 
an animal enjoys are due, not to its own character, but 
to the character of the man who extends them. If 
life is an inalienable right of animals, why do men kill 
them for food? If life is conceived to be an inalienable 
right of a man, it is only because it is assumed that he 
will properly meet the social duties that such life implies. 
29
-P-A-G-E-42
    30 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
How otherwise can we explain capital and other punish- 
ment ? 
But if rights imply duties, then it is evident that the 
young must be trained in disposition and ability to meet 
the responsibilities that citizenship involves. An aris- 
tocracy implies a proletariat. It is the privilege of the 
former to command, the fate of the latter to obey. 
In the crudest stages of this relation, the proletariat 
have no rights the aristocracy are bound to respect. The 
masses may be used as food for powder, or as beasts of 
burden. In more advanced stages of such a social 
organization, some privileges are fixed by statute or 
enforced by violence. But at their best such govern- 
ments are far from being democratic. On the other 
hand, it is possible to retain remnants of the old 
aristocratic forms, as in England, and yet to attain the 
essence of democratic government. 
Civic equality implies, therefore, not unearned privi- 
lege, but trained competence to render social service. 
Every child is born to citizenship ; this is in turn a bene- 
fit and a duty, a privilege and ‘a responsibility, which 
cannot escape in a democracy. The more he fails, he 
either for want of ability or of disposition to enter into 
these mutually obligatory yet beneficial relations implied 
by the word democracy, the nearer he approaches the 
animal, which may arouse the pity and sympathy of 
mankind, but which lacks the essentials of civic equality.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 31 
A democracy has no place for a proletariat, a horde of 
men who have nothing but the labor of untrained muscles 
to sell. Neither has it a place for another but smaller 
horde of vandals whose motto is, ‘Get a plenty while 
the getting is good,” and whose performance is the 
exploiting of public wealth for private benefit. 
Citizenship has long been a word to conjure with, yet 
it has often been wrongly or inadequately conceived. 
Sometimes it has meant blind, unintelligent militant 
allegiance to the country in which the citizen lives. 
At other times it is made to mean partisanship or pro- 
vincialism. Some limit the term to governmental rela- 
tions, and thus identify patriotism with willingness 
to serve in army or navy or police squad in times of 
public danger. But the term involves a much wider 
set of relationships into which the young citizen must 
be inducted and for which he must be prepared. Some 
of the most important of them may be briefly described, 
as follows : — 
(x) The beginnings of citizenship take their rise in 
the home and the school, for these are social groups in 
which all must take their place and fulfil their various 
functions both of privilege and responsibility. Naturally 
the form of government is at first more or less autocratic, 
yet even in the home mutual helpfulness may be early 
inculcated, while in the school authority cloaks itself 
more and more in the garb of politeness and in the form
-P-A-G-E-44
ee ne ee 
32 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
of devotion to social ends. It causes children to have 
the feeling that in some measure they are helping to 
govern themselves, not for the sake of government as 
an end, but for the promotion of the common interests 
‘which the school represents. 
(2) Citizenship reaches its highest estate in govern- 
ment, national and local, and in the manifold political, 
economic, and legal relationships involved. It is not so 
much a training in the technical machinery of govern- 
ment that youth needs, as general intelligence and 
public spirit; for a distinction must be made between 
training for such a thing as civil service and education 
for civic equality in the system which civil servants 
administer. The one is special, the other general, edu- 
cation. Herbert Spencer in his famous plea for science 
in education did not distinguish sufficiently between 
science for the specialist, who bases his profession upon 
it, and science for the man on the street, who reaps mani- 
fold benefits from the application of science through the 
expert, without, himself, needing to know very much 
about it. Then just as there is the study of science for 
the general conduct of life, as well as for specialists, so 
there is study of citizenship for participation in the   common group life of men, as well as for the training of 
experts. 
It is perhaps assumed by some that civic equality is 
passive, or static, and operative by virtue of legislation 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 33 
alone. We say all men must be equal before the law, 
meaning thereby that each has legally the same privi- 
leges as another, and that each is under the same prohi- 
bitions; or if two men appear in contention before the 
bar of justice, each is subject to the same rules of evi- 
dence, each has the same rights of appeal, postponement, 
etc. For example, a suit at law against a college presi- 
dent for alleged defamation of character has just been 
decided in the Supreme Courts of one of our states. 
That suit was begun nine years ago. Each contestant 
doubtless enjoyed the same legal rights, but both are 
presumably impoverished in purse and impaired in 
disposition. This static equality, though doubtless 
essential in a democracy, is far from being that of most 
value. There is also the equality implied by partici- 
pation in group life. Political groups are national and 
state and county and municipal, or communal. To be a 
participant in a national group is to be intelligent upon 
national issues, which, in so far as they are not personal, 
are for the most part economic; as, for instance, ques- 
tions of tariff, trusts, internal taxation, conservation 
of resources, national ownership and public improvements, 
schemes of reclamation, etc. To the man untrained to 
understand these issues, all politicians look alike, — 
sleek, well-fed, rapacious, and ready to dole out the 
penny of privilege for the pound of advantage. Citi- 
zens of this type are not the sheet anchor of democracy, 
D
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
for though they claim protection because of their passive 
equality, they are unable to earn the active equality 
that comes of trained intelligence in the public service. 
Their life is parasitic, not codperative. 
What is true of citizenship in its national aspects is 
equally true and even more important in state, munici- 
pal, and other local government. Equality in partici- 
pation grows in complexity and importance as it draws 
near home. Municipal misrule is at once the shame and 
the despair of democracy. It looks as if the people were 
permanently condemned to be the victims of chronic 
exploitative groups of political bandits. All this comes 
of accepting the ideals of passive citizenship, in which 
privileges do not depend upon correlative services. 
The remedy is a training in citizenship that fits the 
young by social intelligence, social disposition, and social 
efficiency to participate freely and effectively in politi- 
cal coéperation in all its manifold aspects. When 
communities grow so rich in conscience or so poor in 
purse that they insist upon training each citizen into 
civic competency, making his social receipts depend 
upon his civic deserts, then the passive equality on 
which we now insist will be displaced by a civic equality 
based upon coéperative civic participation. 
(3) Much of citizenship is directly economic in char- 
acter, as, for instance, the ownership and control of the 
great agencies of production, the protection of the
-P-A-G-E-47
  
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 35 
individual against economic accidents, the social condi- 
tions making for or against economic prosperity, 
such as war, peace, piracy, caste, race antagonisms, 
morals, freedom of contract, regulation of railroads, 
telegraphs, banks, combinations of labor or capital, 
care for the incompetent, and the like. Here, again, 
intelligence and efficiency are the essentials of citizen- 
ship. 
(4) We have, moreover, social rights and duties that | 
arise from our juxtaposition in civil life. A community 
with plenty of objective enterprises finds small interest 
in the pettinesses of personality; one that lives a purely 
subjective life will find room for slander and other hateful 
activities. Lacking common ends to work for, the people 
devour one another. It is far better for a community 
to set itself to catching flies than to indulge in mutual 
backbiting. One boy in Worcester, Massachusetts, under 
the direction of Professor Hodge, turned in ninety-six 
quarts of flies in a few weeks, while the community as a 
whole, through codperation in fly trapping, was soon able 
to take down its screens in midsummer and live untor- 
mented by these pests. There are nuisances of many 
sorts that may be abated by mutual effort; there are 
many positive advantages always near at hand for those 
who look for them. 
(5) Finally, citizenship is not complete until it embraces 
international relations. What are our duties toward
-P-A-G-E-48
  
36 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
weaker nations? What toward equals? Should arbi- 
tration or treaties, or diplomacy, or political alliances, 
or battleships, or “benevolent” despotism decide the 
issues that arise? Is national equality based upon the 
same principles as civic equality among the citizens of a 
nation? Doubtless hereafter as heretofore international 
questions will be decided by the representatives of the 
people, and the public without consideration of its 
desires be left to reap the benefits or suffer the calamities 
of such action. However, an intelligent public opinion 
vigorously expressed by press, pulpit, and rostrum, 
especially if aided by initiative, referendum, and recall, 
will often be able to prevent precipitate action or to 
enforce the decrees of fairness and justice toward all 
nations. 
The final conclusion must be that since civic equality ° 
implies social relationships so wide in scope and so 
intense in character, the education that prepares for 
citizenship of this kind must be both wide and deep, 
and of corresponding universality. 
2. Culture as Means 
When the word culture is made to stand as the uni- 
versal educational means for training to citizenship in 
the comprehensive sense above described, it is manifest 
that there must be a reinterpretation of this well-worn 
term.
-P-A-G-E-49
  POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 37 
(1) Culture as an Aspect of Education 
The most cursory reading of educational literature 
shows that the word culture has had a more restricted 
meaning than is here ascribed to it. 
Rousseau contrasted it with nature and conceived it 
to be a social veneer of the aristocracy — an index if not 
a cause of their corruption. The conclusion of his 
first Dijon Essay is that, far from tending to purify 
morals, culture in the arts and sciences leads to the decay 
of morals; art is an ornament for impurity ; courteous 
manners but transparent garments for indecency; the 
splendor of public life but the sign of the enslavement 
of the people. Culture is therefore in his eyes the sym- 
bol of all that is vile in private character and hateful in 
public life. 
The humanists defined culture quite as subjectively as 
did Rousseau, but thought of it, not as a pernicious 
polish, but as an inner transformation of character — 
a total refining effect upon thoughts, morals, and manners 
which comes from insight into the literature, art, and 
philosophy of the ancients. To the early humanist the 
means of attaining culture was the study of the ancient 
languages. Until near the end of the nineteenth cen- 
tury this conception was held substantially unchanged, 
except that mathematics was gradually accepted as 
being on a par with Latin and Greek. To this honored 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
trinity has now been added the study of pure science. 
Gayley ' speaks as follows: “A generation ago the scien- 
tists worked for recognition as educators of youth. They 
deserved to win; and they won. To know the law of the 
natural world is indispensable to him who would 
understand aright the law of the social. A fundamental 
and sympathetic acquaintance with at least one science, 
such as physics or chemistry, is as integral a part of 
culture as a fundamental and sympathetic acquaintance 
with the humanities.” Shorey makes the same con- 
cession as follows: “It is time to recognize that the 
work of Huxley, Tyndall, Spencer, Youmans, and 
President Eliot has been done once for all. The victory 
of our scientific colleagues is overwhelming, and the 
Cinderella pose is an anachronism.” ? 
Our net result so far is that the subject-matter of 
culture embraces the old humanities, mathematics and 
the new sciences. 
(2) Culture and Discipline 
Up to the present, culturists have distinguished be- 
tween these terms, for though culture and discipline 
have been as closely connected as Siamese twins, yet 
they have not been one, but two. Thus Gayley in one

New York.

ber, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-51
   POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 39 
chapter writes of “The Collapse of Culture,” and in 
another of “The Collapse of Discipline.” By culture 
he appears to mean insight into the classics, for he 
writes: “To the abandonment of the classics with their 
sweet simplicity and their majesty, their orderly re- 
straint and their severe regard, I attribute in no small 
degree the declining ability to think closely, to speak 
and write lucidly, precisely, effectively, the declining 
love of noble letters and noble art, — the declining re- 
spect for tradition and authority, for the heritage and 
the faith, — the declining splendor of the ideal.” 1 How 
close at hand the other twin is, may be seen from the 
preceding page, where we read: “Equipment for liberal 
scholarship of any kind depends updn a knowledge of 
the classics. No better training in logical processes was 
ever devised than the philological discipline of the 
classics. No discipline more thoroughly systematized, 
more uniform, more definite, more rigorous.” 
If culture as distinguished from discipline means 
insight, discipline in language as distinguished from cul- 
ture certainly means efficiency in the use of language as 
an instrument of thought and expression. Thus, 
bringing inherited conceptions down to date, we have the 
following equations: Education = culture + discipline; 
culture = insight into the thought systems of the

4° BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
humanities and the sciences; discipline = training for 
efficiency in the application of these inherited treasures 
of thought to their manifold uses in life. 
These are clear distinctions and not useless in compre- 
hending the purposes of that general education which is 
needed to fit men for democratic citizenship. Yet 
perhaps further analysis will show that this is not really 
a case of twins, even of Siamese twins, in which the 
blood of each circulates in the other, but a case of two 
aspects of one and the same thing, as is maintained by 
Dewey.1 His definition is as follows: ‘Culture is the 
social insight and spirit to which useful skill, knowl- 
edge of fact, and trained mental power must all be made 
to contribute.’ In other words, culiwre has hitherto 
been conceived in subjective terms alone, as if the 
individual were a solitary and unique, not a social, 
being. But it is through group relations that we come 
to final values. Culture cannot function except in 
society, hence it involves as an integral part of itself 
  all that we have meant by discipline. Hence our equa- 
tion takes this form: Education for citizenship = cul- 
ture; culture = insight through knowledge + mental 
discipline + skill in use; or, more briefly, culture = in- 
sight + efficiency. Culture is therefore the whole of 
general education, not merely a part of it.

(3) Culture and Vocational Education 
There is, however, no real gain in converting the word 
culture into a term so general that it covers everything, 
for this would obliterate rather than clarify distinctions. 
The category culture, like most others, demands con- 
sideration from its two main aspects, range and intensity. 
A culture so wide in range that it includes everything 
known would be so broad that we should have to call it 
superficial; a culture so intensive that it includes but 
one subject of knowledge, we should have to call narrow. 
Evidently, then, a compromise must be made, so that 
there shall be some kind of harmonious balance between 
the range and the intensity of culture. It must be broad, 
but not so broad as to become superficial; it must have 
depth, yet not be so deep as to become narrow. It will 
not do to say, “If you know a little about a subject, it 
is cultural ; if a great deal, it is professional.” The con- 
sideration of mere quantity, just much or little, cannot 
settle such questions. 
How then can it be broad, but not too broad; intense, 
but not so intense as to be narrow? By extending itself 
to cover the aspects of knowledge that are fundamental 
to ideal citizenship; by confining itself to the mastery 
of principles most needful in social action. A cultural 
education must include language, because this is neces- 
sary in order to see and make distinctions; it must em-  
-P-A-G-E-54
    
42 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
brace art, for an esthetic consciousness is of the utmost 
importance in the enjoyment of life; it must in its higher 
reaches include philosophy, for to think deeply it is need- 
ful to knowhow men have thought; as a matter of 
course, it must accept history and civics, for these are the 
account of the evolution of freedom both in its ideals and 
in the machinery for their realization ; culture must use 
mathematics, for daily living includes daily measuring ; 
it must embrace a representative from each of the natural 
sciences, since they are necessary to that complete liv- 
ing for which Spencer pleads; and, finally, it must em- 
brace economics, for each man must enter into that great 
system of activities whereby he gains his daily bread, 
and contributes his thought, his vote, and his moral and 
physical support to the establishment and maintenance 
of that social system which enables free men to live in 
a free society. Reversing this order and summarizing, 
a culture course must embrace economics, biology, 
physics or chemistry, an earth science, mathematics, 
history and civics, philosophy, art and language. So 
much for the range of culture. 
What is the ideal depth of intensity? If we try to 
learn everything about each subject, we shall never cover 
the ground. The test here is the same as that for range, 
that which is most serviceable for the whole of com- 
munity life. If the range of culture is to cover the in- 
sight most needful to complete social living, surely its
-P-A-G-E-55
  POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 43 
intensity must include such training as best conduces to 
social efficiency in the use of this knowledge. Confining 
our knowledge of subject-matter to the fundamental 
principles of the studies enumerated, we must carry our 
intensity to the point of readiness in their general rather 
than their special application. Thus, in physics, a 
cultural course seeks to understand machinery rather 
than a machine. It may be interesting to fight out the 
“battle of the valves” in automobile engines and to be 
able to discuss intelligently the relative merits of the 
poppet, sleeve, and rotary types, but it is more important 
in general education to know what bearing the gas engine 
has on industry, on city and urban life, on the pleasure, 
health, and prosperity of the individual. Again, in 
studying municipal government, the thing of most im- 
portance is, not how to become a successful politician, 
but how to act, what attitude to assume, in municipal 
business. A citizen needs a language, not to teach it, 
but to enable him to rise to higher intellectual levels in 
thought and expression; he needs art, not merely to 
enhance his own pleasure in life, but to promote a love 
and appreciation of the beautiful among men.!_ So of all 
cultural education, its primary purpose is not to make a 
living for one’s self, but to make life more worth living for 
all men; not individual, but social, thrift; not the wel-

Bardeen, Syracuse, N. Y.

  44 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
fare of the individual as a subjective entity, but as a 
functioning unit in a functioning whole. In short, 
cultural, or civic, education is for Man the Citizen. 
(4) The Limits of the Cultural Aim 
Where shall education for culture leave off, and that 
for vocation begin? A natural inference from the defini- 
tion of culture is that it never ceases so long as education 
continues, for knowledge and mental training and skill 
in application belong to vocational no less than to cul- 
tural education. What actually change are aim and 
emphasis. In vocational education the aim is insight 
and efficiency in a gainful occupation; in cultural educa- 
tion the aim is preparation for those manifold universal 
functions that we collectively call citizenship. In 
emphasis the change is from balance of scope and in- 
tensity for a wide range of application to that narrowness 
of scope and degree of intensity which are necessary for 
success in a vocation. In due measure, therefore, all 
good education is cultural, and all cultural education 
is vocational in the sense that our larger institu- 
tional or social life is an occupation. In education we 
deal with the relative, not the absolute. In the words 
of Professor Conrad of Halle, the varying aspects 
of education are valid, “‘bis zu einem gewissen Grade.” 
In practice there is wide range in fixing the point where 
cultural education shall end and vocational begin. In
-P-A-G-E-57
  
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 45 
Germany this point is at the end of the eighth grade 
of the common school, for all who attend it. These 
constitute about nine-tenths of the school population. 
The German school organization is such that there is no 
promotion from elementary to secondary schools after 
the end of the third grade, except at a loss of time to the 
pupil which becomes increasingly prohibitive. Accord- 
ing to an estimation by Paulsen, not more than one 
graduate in ten thousand from the elementary, or Volks- 
schule, ever gets into a gymnasium, or secondary school. 
After the fourteenth year, accordingly, all additional 
education is vocational. This is given for a stated num- 
ber of hours per week, most frequently six, in contin- 
uation schools, and for three years. The pupil has 
chosen his occupation and is serving his apprenticeship 
therein, while the continuation school increases his 
knowledge and skill in the specific calling chosen. In 
the continuation schools of Munich, some forty trades 
are represented. Smaller cities limit the number accord- 
ing to need. 
In the education of the so-called culture classes, general 
education closes with the gymnasial course, or its 
equivalent, at the age of eighteen or nineteen. When the 
student passes to the university or to the technological 
institute, he begins his vocational training. 
In England it is the custom to carry cultural education 
through the university period. The Universities of
-P-A-G-E-58
46 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
  Oxford and Cambridge offer only culture courses. They 
are in no proper sense technical, as are the German 
universities. 
In this country, as President Hadley says, we have been 
trying to drive the English and the German systems of 
higher education tandem. In theory we say the student 
should begin his vocational training only at the end of 
the college course. To this end we have invented the 
graduate system for those who do not wish to enter 
any one of the well-defined schools of medicine, law, 
or theology. This theory is accepted only to a 
limited extent. A few medical and law schools require 
the A.B. degree as requisite for entrance. Most do not. 
Some draw the line at the end of the Junior year of the 
college course. Others take candidates direct from the 
high schools. Most schools of technology also admit 
the graduates of the high school. Again, technical high 
schools admit the graduates of the grammar school, while 
it is now proposed that the beginnings of vocational 
education shall take their rise at the end of the sixth 
grade of the elementary schools. We draw theline, there- 
fore, between cultural and vocational education at the 
following points: End of the college course, middle of the 
college course, end of the high-school course, end of the 
grammar school, and beginning of the seventh grade, — 
surely a system varied and elastic enough to suit all 
purses and all capacities. Though opinions may differ
-P-A-G-E-59
  
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND GENERAL EDUCATION 47 
as to how far it is rational, it must be admitted that 
each position is fortified with reasons. 
~~ Rividently under the conditions of American democ- 
racy no precise point can be fixed at which education 
for culture shall end and that for vocation begin, for to 
establish such a point would violate the principle for 
which the succeeding chapter will contend, namely, 
that of promoting equality of educational opportunity for 
/al. By this is not meant that all should do the same 
wo thing, for there is nothing but verbal equality in that, 
but that each should have an equal opportunity with 
every other for personal and social development. 
What an individual shall grow to be depends indeed 
upon heredity and upon acquired characters and upon 
the forces of his environment. We cannot change race 
or sex or native ability, but we can furnish opportunity 
for the development of: every type of capacity by keep- 
ing open all the avenues of education from the earliest 
period at which they can be utilized. The mass of 
children have their development arrested early, if the 
chief characteristics of education are sitting still and ab- 
sorbing knowledge. A few can endure these processes 
and still grow, but not many. Again, poverty, love of 
activity in the real world, restlessness under a reign of 
subjectivity or sentiment, the short-sightedness of 
youth, the selfishness of parents, and the like, all tend 
to limit education to the shortest permitted time, un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
less it is adapted to meet those psychological, material, 
and social needs most obvious to child and parent. 
Since, then, culture is necessary for all as citizens and 
is to a degree found in all education, we shall be safe in 
urging the continuance of cultural courses as long as the 
student can be persuaded to pursue them, and at the 
same time we shall be justified in introducing vocational 
training as early and as fast as necessary to secure the 
student’s presence in school and to promote his continu- 
ous development. In other words, psychological and 
economi¢, not merely logical, considerations shall deter- 
mine the time of beginning vocational training and the 
degree to which it shall be specialized.

CHAPTER IV 
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 
The measure of economic democracy is equality of 
opportunity; the educational means for attaining it is 
vocational training. 
1. Measure and Means - 
It may seem that we have equality in education when 
everybody is permitted to do the same things — pursue 
the same studies for the same time and by the same meth- 
ods in elementary, secondary, and higher schools. This 
is indeed uniformity, but not a true measure of demo- 
cratic equality. Only in the first six years of the ele- 
mentary school, or during the period of the acquisition of 
the rudiments of knowledge and skill in the school arts, 
is there any true equality in our present system. If this 
is to be extended, instruction must be differentiated at 
the beginning of the adolescent period, so that every child 
may get the type of education best adapted to his talents 
and situation in life. In the nature of things there 
is but one class of ends so fundamental in importance 
that they are fit to measure equality in a democracy; 
namely, the vocational ends. To survive in decency and 
E 49  
-P-A-G-E-62
5° BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
  comfort, to be able to live up to ideals of human worth 
and dignity, every individual must earn his living by 
producing for others what is valuable enough to be paid 
for. Lacking this power, all the graces that purely non- 
vocational education can impart, are but as a bed of 
roses on which to starve. Again, though it may be con- 
ceded that any education whatever, even that apparently 
most worthless, will enable some to earn a living, yet for 
the many such an education may have little or no eco- 
nomic value. There is no true equality of educational 
opportunity until the education for mental training and 
esthetic cultivation also gives each pupil the best possi- 
ble vocational preparation for life. Lacking this, all 
education beyond the most elementary is for the few, 
not the many. Granted that America needs to train 
scholars, that, as so many eloquently maintain, a million 
of them would not be too many, what is to become of 
the ninety and nine millions left? Are they not to count 
inademocracy? It is easy to say: ‘All who will may 
become scholars. The road is open.” But it is not 
open. They could not tread that path if they would. 
Many lack the ability; most lack the means. We 
pride ourselves upon being the foremost democracy of 
the world, yet we are the rearmost among nations of our 
own rank in providing that vocational equality of oppor- 
tunity without which there is no true economic democ- 
racy.
-P-A-G-E-63
  ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 51 
(x) Basis for Economic Equality 
America has long been known as the land of oppor- 
tunity. It has been our proud boast that each has an 
equal opportunity with every other to make the best of 
himself in the attainment of economic independence. 
The basis of whatever truth there has been in this boast 
has hitherto been free land. There has always been 
room in the West for those who had the courage to go. 
‘Horace Greeley’s advice, not so much heard at present, 
was: “‘Go West, young man; go West! There you have 
but to tickle the soil with the hoe to make it laugh with 
the abundant harvest.” ‘The first great epoch of our 
history, that of free land, which for four hundred years 
has allured the pioneer, has now come toanend. Hence- 
forth, if equality of opportunity is to be a reality, it must 
find a new basis. There are many schemes for economic 
socialism designed to attain this end, but their possi- 
bilities for realization lie in a somewhat distant future. 
The claim might be advanced that society is not biologi- 
cal, but chemical; not subject to growth, but to explo- 
sion; not in process of evolution, but of revolution. 
History has indeed recorded some revolutions, but they 
have been rather fulfilments of growth, or the removal 
of its obstacles, rather than its negation. But while we 
are waiting for a better organization of society by what- 
ever process best pleases our fancy or appeals most to our
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 ° BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
reason, the concrete problem of helping all men to realize 
the best that is in them is with us now. In the economic 
field democracy means equality of opportunity to make 
the best of inborn and acquired characters under inevi- 
table conditions of the environment as we find it, or are 
able to make it. Legislation cannot be the ultimate 
basis for feeding, clothing, and housing mankind. Food 
must be produced from the soil, clothing and the other 
necessities of comfort must be manufactured, houses 
must be built. That is, the eternal economic needs of 
man are production and exchange and distribution. 
These involve working and saving and inventing; they 
call for skill and diligence, initiative and endurance, 
for adaptability and courage, for deepening insight and 
increasing efficiency. 
Free land is a thing of the past; radical reorganization 
of society is a thing of the future; but the possibility 
of adequate vocational education is of the present. It is 
the best hope for a real economic democracy, the sure 
basis upon which we may build. 
(2) Vocational Training as Means 
Vocational efficiency is an aspect of citizenship, for it 
would be indeed a poor state that were made up of 
paupers. But vocation is an individual matter, since 
division of labor makes it necessary that there should be 
many vocations and many separate aspects of each.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 53 
For this reason cultural education alone no longer suffices 
to meet individual vocational needs. With free land as 
the basis of individual economic thrift, it might well 
seem to us that one type of education sufficed as a 
training for economic efficiency in everybody, since 
success crowned well-nigh every sincere effort. This 
theory of equality in efficiency was tried out in many 
types of enterprise, the military among the rest. We 
reasoned that a man who, without special education, had 
made a successful politician, would as a matter of course 
make a successful general. On this point John Fiske, 
the historian, has the following comments : — 
“The old-fashioned American notion that a man who 
succeeds in one kind of work can succeed in any other by 
dint of native ability and without special training is not 
so commonly entertained now as it once was. It was a 
notion which, on the whole, did us credit ; for it bore un- 
conscious testimony to the quick wit and rare versatility 
of the American people. But the complicated conditions 
of modern life are beginning to show its fallaciousness, 
and the Civil War taught us some lessons in this regard. 
Of all the occupations of life, there is none in which the 
imperative of professional training is so forcibly dem- 
onstrated as in warfare, where errors of judgment are 
visited with such prompt and terrible penalties. 
Among the commanders in our Civil War on either 
1 Fiske, J., “The Civil War in the Mississippi Valley,” p. 207. 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
side, nearly all who achieved success on a large scale 
were graduates of West Point, and most had served 
their apprenticeship in Mexico. On the other hand, our 
volunteer commanders who had had no special training 
seldom prospered in any higher position than that of 
general of division. There were one or two exceptions, 
but this was the rule.” 
2. Principles and Types 
The old general efficiency sprang from the soil; the 
  
    new vocational efficiency has a different source; namely, 
the training of mind and hand in the diverse industries   
that occupy mankind. Two topics of unusual impor- 
tance now confront us: first, the ideals or general princi- 
ples of vocational training; and second, its chief types 
and their characteristics. 
(x) General Principles of Vocational Education 
a. Motive. — Wealth of available knowledge often 
means poverty of educational motive. In primitive 
society learning is never detached from living, hence 
whatever interest there is in life is attached also to that 
which directly contributes to it. But now learning has 
progressed far beyond the possibilities of application for 
the individual. Who knows all about even a single sub- 
ject, or can apply more than a fraction of what he knows ? 
For years Professor Klein of Goettingen lectured on ad-
-P-A-G-E-67
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 55 
vances in mathematics. A dozen years ago or more 
he gave up the attempt as too strenuous for one man. 
Meagre as the literature of education confessedly is, there 
are a hundred thousand volumes upon it in the Bureau 
of Education at Washington. Every great university is 
ambitious to have a million volumes in its library. If 
these stores of inherited knowledge are to be absorbed by 
successive generations of students, so much of it must 
necessarily be detached from all practical application 
that the student is in danger of assuming a passive, in- 
different attitude toward it, for the further knowledge 
retreats from the concrete world, the more it loses in 
vitality. Educational motives become vital as knowledge 
performs its functions in actual living. The more it is 
detached from life, the poorer its influence upon the 
student becomes. 
Why are vital motives so often lacking in cultural 
education? Not because the knowledge there imparted 
is actually detached from life, but because it is so likely to 
seem so. But even this seeming detachment must be 
combated, and knowledge so selected, organized, and 
taught that its applicability to citizenship in its broader 
aspects may become daily apparent. But vocational 
education has the great advantage that what actually is 
true also seems so to the student. Yet, even this close 
relation of vocational studies to vocational occupations 
may be so obscured by bad organization and bad 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
teaching that the natural advantages of such courses 
may be partly or wholly sacrificed. This leads to the 
question of organization. 
b. Organization. — Some minds take naturally to 
dualism. If two principles appear different in any way, 
it is at once assumed that they must be discreet ; that is, 
separate and independent of one another. Education 
no less than philosophy has its dualists. Such persons 
say: “There is education for culture and education for 
vocation. They are different, but we need both, so let 
us run them either tandem or abreast as seems most 
suitable.” The tandem philosophers insist that cul- 
tural education shall be finished before the vocational 
begins. This is, of course, a well-known position, and, 
for some classes of students, especially those who are 
preparing for the professions, has manifest advantages. 
Those dualists who think to carry on cultural and 
vocational training together divide the time between 
them. A portion of the day, usually the first part, is 
given to cultural studies, and the remainder to practical 
work in manual training, domestic science, or what not. 
Thus, what nature would join together, art would keep 
apart. In such an organization dualism does its worst. 
But there is a monistic form of organization that promises 
better results, since it unites cultural and vocational 
aspects, insight and efficiency, into one organic whole. 
Since technology is based upon the fundamental
-P-A-G-E-69
  
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 57 
sciences, the motto of the monist in education may well 
be, “‘A new astronomy from the old stars.” This is, 
of course, figurative language and points to the reorgan- 
ization that took place in astronomy when Copernicus 
proposed to change the centre of the solar system from 
the earth to the sun. In vocational education the centre 
of interest changes from vocation to vocation. We have 
one great body of fundamental knowledge divided into 
appropriate parts and represented by the various studies. 
These studies are all we have or need, but the matter 
from each must be chosen with respect to the calling 
it is to serve, so that what changes is selection and 
emphasis, not the studies themselves. Most higher pro- 
fessional education fully recognizes this principle. 
Chemistry, for instance, is needed in metallurgy, in 
sanitation, in many useful arts, in medicine, in domestic 
science and in agriculture, but after the basal facts of the 
science are learned, each school emphasizes those aspects 
of the subject that have most pertinence to the field in 
question. Medicine, agriculture, commerce, education, 
and the like have use for biology in its manifold forms, 
but selection and emphasis change with each. 
The principle that the higher vocational education 
finds so useful is equally serviceable in the lower. There 
should be as many reorganizations of studies in voca- 
tional schools as there are distinct purposes. That such 
an ideal may: be realized in practice can be seen from 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
the following extracts from the report of a technical 
high school : !— 
(1) Mathematics. On the technical side the pupil articulates 
the mathematics with the work of the drafting room, shop, do- 
mestic science, and domestic art. Teachers of technical subjects 
are in constant touch with the mathematics department, anticipat- 
ing problems which will arise and reporting immediately to that 
department any weakness shown by a pupil in problem or principle. 
The work during the first two years is given five times per week 
and involves arithmetic, algebra, plane geometry, and elementary 
trigonometry. 
(2) Industrial Geography. This course is intended to give the 
student an introduction to the other sciences and furnish a back- 
ground for the course in industrial history. The first term is 
spent on meteorology in its relations to industrial, social, and eco- 
nomic conditions of a people; the second on physiography ; and the 
third on the industries of the various regions in their relations to 
climate and physiographical conditions. 
(3) Industrial History. It is expected that the work in in- 
dustrial geography and industrial history will prepare for the course 
in American history and civics, which includes the discussion of 
civic and industrial problems with a view to good citizenship. 
In the course in the history of arts, the principles underlying all 
the arts suggested in the course in English in the first two years, 
and illustrated in the courses in drawing and design, will receive 
added illustration in the study of arts, products, and processes of 
other periods of history and of industrial products and processes. 
(4) English. In the teaching of English literature, the constant 
aim is to make clear the relation of literature to life.... The 
works of our great English and American industrial writers will 
have a prominent place in the course. The supplementary read-

ing will include much that is best in invention and discovery, 
manufacture and distribution, and the attendant industrial and 
labor problems. In composition much emphasis is laid upon ex- 
ercises in original creation in one of the most beautiful arts. . . . 
Whenever practicable, the composition work is coérdinated with 
the other departments of the school, thus interrelating and bind- 
ing together the course of study. 
(5) Mechanical Drawing. This subject is taught as the language 
through which the student learns to give graphic expression to 
ideas which he is later to work out in material forms in shop and 
workrooms. It is the one medium through which craftsmen are 
able to record, clarify, and perfect such ideas as may come to them. 
(6) Applied Arts. As mechanical drawing is made the medium 
of expression in the shop, so is free-hand drawing in this depart- 
ment. Nature forms are studied and sketched in the plot, in 
detail, and in color. From these studies pupils derive conven- 
tionalized units which by repetition and grouping furnish motives 
for original ornamental designs and for suggestions of form, pro- 
portions, and color harmonies. These apply directly in construc- 
tive work, as in borders for garments, draperies, naperies, and in 
embroideries, in the decoration of pottery and leather work; and 
in the designing, decorating, and making of utensils and articles 
of household and personal use from various materials and fabrics. 
The work, therefore, correlates in very definite and practical ways 
with dressmaking, millinery, domestic science, and the mechanic 
arts and crafts, and with the many occasions in daily life in which 
an intelligent appreciation of fitness and beauty add greatly to 
vocational success or personal happiness. 
(7) Domestic Science. The purpose of the work in this depart- 
ment is threefold: (1) to teach all subjects’ pertaining to the care 
and duties of a home; (2) to teach all theory relating to the above 
subject as applied science, that the girls may acquire intellectual 
development as well as practical skill; (3) to teach institutional 
cookery and kitchen management as trade subjects, that students
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
may be prepared for catering as a vocation. During the first year 
botany and physiology are among the required academic studies 
for girls. These subjects are therefore taught as applied sciences, 
and the theory connected with the practical work in cookery for 
the first year has a physiological aspect. Chemistry is one of 
the required subjects for the second year. The same subjects 
are considered and the same materials experimented upon in the 
chemical laboratory as in the school kitchen. For instance, if 
eggs are cooked in the kitchen laboratory, during the same week 
their composition and properties are ascertained in the chemical 
laboratory. ‘ 
(8) Elementary physics is given the third year and is taught as 
applied physics with special reference to the problems of the shop 
rather than as mathematical physics. 
These extracts are representative of the way in 
which the Cleveland Technical High School is con- 
sciously reorganizing the whole course of study in har- 
mony with the leading purposes of the school. The 
programme of any other first-class vocational school in 
greater or less degree shows the same effort. A school of 
commerce will use the same studies, but it will adapt 
them to the commercial purpose, and so on through all 
varieties of similar institutions. Other things being 
equal, that vocational school ranks highest which most 
consciously and most successfully adopts the principle 
under discussion. 
c. Creative Work.—One conception of education 
makes it consist mostly of passive absorption, on the 
one hand, and of bare imitation of physical processes, on 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 61 
the other. In other words, the student is to remember 
what he is told, and to imitate whatheseesdone. Though 
it is freely conceded that memory and imitation have an 
important place in education, it cannot be conceded that 
they are education itself. When used as the sole in- 
struments of training, they lack vital motive; they are 
too subjective and abstract ; they fail to rouse the latent 
energies of the mind, to stir the imagination, to excite 
zeal and ambition. A passive education makes every- 
thing seem perfunctory and second-hand; its situations 
are artificial, rather than genuine; it leaves thought 
inert, for its inner resources are not utilized. If Jack 
is not a dull boy under such treatment, it is because his 
energies find other channels in which to flow. It is prob- 
ably his games that stir his blood, and intercourse with 
family and friends that keeps his wit from stagnating. 
The whole mental attitude of the youth changes, 
however, when he finds that he must make an active use 
of his mind in order to solve the problems that arise in 
connection with his daily work. When this is properly 
related to all studies in the curriculum that have any 
bearing upon it, then the new spirit permeates his whole 
school course. It is one thing to demand an isolated bit 
of ingenuity in constructing an article of furniture or a 
piece of pottery, or in designing a border, but quite 
another to solve a problem in materials that involves 
mechanical or free-hand drawing, the making of patterns, 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    | 
62 BASIC thie FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
the calculation of dimensions, the investigation of 
qualities, the acquisition of insight into art principles or 
the historical connections involved, and, finally, of ade- 
quate expression in English of aim, processes, and re- 
sults. Such radiating interest warms his heart as sun- 
shine warms the air. What is best amd most ideal in 
work, namely, its art aspects freed from economic pres- 
sure and benumbing routine, appeals with irresistible 
force to the spirit of youth. His response is immediate, 
whole-hearted, earnest, enthusiastic, continuous. To 
work is to live, to live is to work. The ‘curse’ becomes a 
blessing, a task is an opportunity, a problem well solved 
is an intellectual and ethical event. Art in this sense is 
truly, as Schiller thought, the bridge between sense and 
reason, which leads the youth from absorption in his 
own individual concerns to a realization of his relations 
to mankind. Education is no longer a revelation 
which the student is to absorb as a blotter absorbs mois- 
ture, but a wide-radiating insight coupled with equally 
extended practice in the objectifying of ideas in sense 
materials. 
Vocational is not different from cultural education in 
the validity of this principle, but it enjoys the advantage 
of being more immediate, more concrete, and seemingly 
at least more closely connected with the most absorbing 
activities of a man; namely, those involved in earning a 
living. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 63 
When motives are vital, when knowledge contributes 
all that it can to the solution of each problem, and when 
creative productivity is the leading conception of school 
work, discipline takes care of itself, teachers are changed 
from policemen to friends, the school is a privilege, not 
a bore, and education itself is looked upon as one of the 
most interesting things in life. 
d. Initiative and Skill. —It is easy at this point to 
fall again into dualism. Teachers desire initiative in the 
student, that inexhaustible fertility of resource that 
enables him to adapt himself to every change in condi- 
tion. The employer, on the other hand, is thinking, 
not so much of the welfare of the student and his future 
growth, as of his present availability for the work in 
hand. It is skill, ready for use, and adequate to present 
needs, ‘that the employer demands. Then the query 
arises: ‘Initiative or skill, which? You cannot have 
both.” But here again the antagonism is more appar- 
ent than real. If the teacher will but broaden his 
conception of what constitutes initiative, and the em- 
ployer but reflect what makes skill ultimately most 
valuable, it is possible to unite initiative and skill so 
that they:shall be but two aspects of one process. Initia- 
tive without skill of execution is as barren of progress as 
is skill without initiative. A machine might be defined 
as instrument for work, devoid of thinking. It will do 
what it was designed to do, but nothing else. Even
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
when most intricate and effective, it is but a poor pat- 
tern of what a human being should be. A disembodied 
spirit might be conceived to be a wonderful thinker, a 
dreamer who has an all-seeing vision, but as such a 
being could only project great plans without the ability 
to execute them, his effectiveness in the world would 
amount to nothing. The student should become neither 
a machine of iron, nor a mere spirit of thought, but should 
through variety and versatility of skill acquire initiative 
and adaptability; or, reversing the order, he should, 
through applied insight, become efficient and versatile in 
skill. For example, this principle applied will lead to a 
knowledge of machinery, its principles and their manifold 
applications, rather than to an empirical understanding 
of one or more specific machines. It will insist upon a 
wide-reaching power of adaptability in using all kinds 
of machines, rather than a high but restricted degree of 
skill in a narrow field. One who is at home in machinery 
can understand one mechanical contrivance as well as 
another. He is not afraid to handle a gas engine, an 
electric dynamo, a Hoe press, a self-binder, or a steam 
engine, because his knowledge of applied physics is such 
that even a cursory examination will put him in pos- 
session of all necessary understanding, while a brief 
period of practice will make him efficient in execution. 
To such a man a new machine is a new joy, an interest- 
ing application of well-known principles. Age has 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 65 
nothing to do with the mental and physical control of 
a man so trained, except to make him more proficient. 
A man of sixty is a better workman than a boy of 
eighteen, for he brings long years of experience to bear 
upon the mastery of the new problem. 
The case is quite otherwise with the workman who has 
acquired skill in the manipulation of one machine, but 
who has no extended knowledge of machinery and no 
considerable range of practice in using it. A labor leader 
once sarcastically recommended that every laborer of fifty 
who lost his job should be shot, since he could only sink 
to lower levels of occupation, until misery made exist- 
ence insupportable. 
The school, therefore, must seek to impart fundamental 
knowledge of principles in all the vocations it seeks to 
prepare for, and it should secure a wide range of practice 
in application; not initiative alone, not skill alone; 
not skill in a single department of work, but such 
a degree of skill in many departments as renders the 
student adaptable, and versatile, and capable of quickly 
acquiring speed where speed is necessary. The shop of 
the employer is the place to acquire speed and adeptness. 
These qualities can be quickly attained when there has 
been the proper degree of preparation. Such an opera- 
tor becomes increasingly valuable, whereas the one who 
has turned the school into a manufacturer’s shop and has 
striven alone for adeptness and speed in a single depart- 
F
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
ment becomes increasingly incapacitated for new appli- 
cations of skill. Arrested development of mind and hand 
is a bar to future progress. 
e. Thought-directed Routine. — Vocations differ in the 
character of the thought they invite and in the kind of 
skill they demand. Agriculture, heretofore, has im- 
posed a routine, but has not necessitated very much 
thought. The farmer always knew he had a mind, but 
he did not greatly use it in his business. It was conven- 
ient for entertainment, but not essential in farming, since 
each stage of routine was fixed by tradition or by the 
season. There were no problems to solve, — only so 
much wheat or other grain to sow, to reap, and to thresh ; 
so much corn to be planted, cultivated, and gathered ; 
so many cows to milk or horses to feed or hogs to fatten 
and market. Now farming bristles with problems which 
demand long-time experiments to solve. These prob- 
lems concern soil and its treatment, even to the extent 
of “ploughing with dynamite” for impervious hardpans ; 
the selection of seed; the breeding of plants; fertiliz- 
ing with manures, mineral substances, and leguminous 
crops; stock breeding and handling; poultry and pigeon 
raising; the development of fruit trees, small fruits, and 
the like; the utilization of old and the development of 
new markets; the possibility of pursuing extensive 
farming in the north during the summer and horticul- 
ture in the south during the winter.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 67 
Many have considered how children can be kept upon 
the farm. The solution is easy. All we have to do is to 
make farming interesting, so that it shall excite the im- 
agination, stimulate the use of thought, and give promise 
of such financial return as shall put into possession of the 
young all the instruments of progress, — competence, 
comfort, education, and a satisfying social life. Under 
the stimulus of the new agriculture, boys organize into 
corn clubs and the like, and girls into canning and other 
clubs. One boy in South Carolina is reported to have 
raised 238 bushels and three pecks of corn on an acre of 
ground, and that in a state where it was supposed that 
Indian corn could not be successfully grown. Groups of 
girls in the same section raised and canned tomatoes 
and other garden product, and realized thereby'some $400 
per acre. When such results are attained, no other per- 
suasion is needed to keep the children of the country at 
home, if only they are given a fair chance. Not infre- 
quently it used to be the custom to let each child have an 
animal which it could callitsown. If the animal chanced 
to be a female, say a heifer calf, and the child were per- 
mitted to own the increase, a hateful alternative soon 
presented itself, for the multiplying animals fed from 
the common stores soon threatened to absorb the whole 
substance of the farm. Then, what was given had to be 
taken away, causing grief and a sense of injustice. If the 
animal were a male, even then it must sometimes be
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
sold, after childish affection had fastened itself upon it. 
In any case, this kind of giving is wrong in principle, for 
it does not return to the child the rewards of his own 
initiative and enterprise. A much better plan is to as- 
sign him a plot of ground and encourage him to dream 
and scheme about it, to decide what he shall plant, and 
when and in what proportion, how fertilize, cultivate, and 
market. Such a procedure awakens all his dormant 
energies, fires his ambition for the future, and, best of all, 
lessens in no appreciable way the welfare of the whole 
group. Something has been created from surplus 
energies of mind and body that otherwise would not 
have existed. 
Thus, farming, from being the most laborious and 
prosaic of occupations, has become one of the most inter- 
esting. The new agriculture, while not greatly develop- 
ing manual skill, has enriched itself with all the re- 
sources of the mind. The combination of these two 
factors greatly enlarges all the possibilities of country 
life. 
The relation of thought to routine is somewhat 
different in industrial and commercial pursuits. In the 
first place, while the farmer is the conductor of an enter- 
prise, the worker in an industrial establishment must in 
general be an employee, who must do, not what his own 
sense of initiative may suggest, but what his employer 
directs. There is consequently far less opportunity for
-P-A-G-E-81
  ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 69 
trying out various projects that may present themselves 
to the mind. In the next place, the necessities of whole- 
sale production tend to eliminate problems for the work- 
man and to hold him for long periods of time to a fixed 
routine. True, he may experiment upon methods of 
speeding himself up by the elimination of useless motions, 
under the influence of what is called scientific manage- 
ment, but since this demands more resolution than reflec- 
tion, it does not greatly enrich the thought-life of the 
laborer. There seems to be more place for thought in 
preparation for an industrial pursuit than in following it. 
But the consciousness of ability to secure advanced 
position is a spur to the mastery of routine of a given 
stage. Then if the business is so organized that promo- 
tion is possible when it has been fairly earned, the mind 
will not stagnate. If, however, promotion and its conse- 
quent change is not attainable, then production becomes 
a species of slavery, which surplus physical energy may 
render endurable even for years, but which loses to indus- 
tryits greatest asset ; namely, fresh, elastic thought, which 
is always seeking new worlds to conquer. If the cur- 
rents of thought that ought to turn the wheels of busi- 
ness are directed to the whirligigs of pleasure, the loss to 
industry is not only great, but lamentable, since the riches 
it might enjoy are perhaps needlessly turned aside. 
Industry does indeed try palliatives such as profit- 
sharing, codperation to the extent of rewarding useful 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  7O BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
suggestions as to improvements in producing and market- 
ing goods, the utilization of by-products, and the like. 
If in the nature of the case it is a sheer impossibility for a 
given type of manufacturing to employ the brains of its 
operatives, it may at all events help make life worth 
living by encouraging such avocations as will conduce 
to greatest efficiency and which will return to life that 
indispensable intellectual and emotional element of 
which the routine of the business deprives it. If thought 
cannot function except in a tedious routine, a man be- 
comes an animal of an unhappy kind, because there is 
always the rebellious consciousness that he might be 
something better. 
Commerce offers greater scope for individual initiative, 
since even the humblest salesman has the personal qual- 
ities of his customer to deal with. Each sale made is a 
psychological problem solved, and as such brings its own 
rewards. Each failure is a spur to future effort. For the 
proprietor or the head of a department the possibilities 
for the extension of the business, the increase in its prof- 
its, the decrease of its expenses through bad debts, 
preventable leaks, and the like, present an interesting and 
perpetually renewed set of problems that demand for 
their solution all the resources of thought, courage, and 
initiative. No merchant, and no employee of his, ever 
ought to stagnate, since thought and routine can be so 
perfectly blended in the day’s work.

3. Types of Vocational Education 
Vocational education may first be classed as higher, 
middle, and lower. 
A, In the higher institutions of vocational training 
we have the following well-marked types : — 
(x) Schools of law, medicine, theology, teaching, and 
civil service. 
(2) Technological institutions. 
(3) Commercial colleges. 
(4) Agricultural colleges. 
Germany has 22 universities embracing schools of the 
first type, including the study of agriculture; 11 of the 
second, as separate institutions; and 5 of the third. In 
the United States, it is common to find all four types 
combined under one organization, though some states 
have separate colleges for one or more of these higher 
schools. 
B. Among the middle vocational schools we have the 
following types :— 
(x) Schools of Commerce. — There are 429 indepen- 
dent schools of this kind in Germany. In the United 
States there are some 500 private commercial or busi- 
ness schools. While the number of separate public 
commercial high schools is small in the United States, the 
number of commercial courses in public high schools is 
very large.
-P-A-G-E-84
   
  72 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
(2) Industrial Schools. — These include trade schools 
and schools for the workers in manufacturing establish- 
ments. Germany, which has carried this kind of instruc- 
tion further than any other country, has among her 
institutions for secondary industrial training the fol- 
lowing schools: Textile industries, 103; art industries, 
34; building and engineering trades, 52; metal indus- 
tries, 12; woodworking industries 12; together with 
numerous miscellaneous schools for basket makers, glass- 
stainers, book-makers, photographers, tailors, musical 
instrument makers, toy makers, millers, book printing, 
innkeepers, gilders, ivory workers, cabinet-makers, 
tanners, etc.1 In the United States, we have the 
following well-marked types of secondary industrial 
schools: (z) The separate or independent industrial 
schools, such as Drexel Institute, Philadelphia; the 
Armour Institute of Chicago; the Pratt Institute of 
Brooklyn; the Bradley Institute of Peoria. (2) The sep- 
arate public technical high school as found in a number of 
our larger cities. (3) Industrial courses or departments 
in regular public high schools, which are very numerous. 
(4) The public trade school, such as the Milwaukee 
Public School of Trades for Boys. (5) The part-time co- 
operative industrial school, as at Cincinnati and other 
cities. (6) Evening and day forms of continuation

ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION 73 
schools.! (7) Factory schools for the training of opera- 
tives. 
(3) Agricultural Schools. — Germany has only 11 secon- 
dary schools of this type, showing that the agricultural 
educational interests lag far behind the industrial in that 
country. This is not surprising, when it is considered 
that during the past thirty years Germany has been 
undergoing a rapid industrial evolution. Besides, 
agriculture there had already left far behind her the 
crude robber farming that has been so characteristic 
in each newly opened section of the United States. So 
long as virgin soil was obtainable, it was easier to move 
to a new tract than to preserve the fertility of the old. 
Consequently the need for agricultural education in the 
United States has recently been more keenly felt than in 
the Old World. 
Secondary agricultural high schools are springing up 
all over the country. Some are state-aided, some main- 
tained by local taxation, while a host take the form of 
agricultural courses in public high schools. New York 
supports separate secondary agricultural schools at 
Alfred and at Canton. In other states the township, 
the county, or the congressional district may be the 
seat of such institutions. In Wisconsin agricultural

    74 BASIC, IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
schools are coeducational; the course covers a period 
of two years of eight months each; the state appro- 
priates $4000 a year to each school; pupils must have 
completed the eight grades of the public school as a 
condition of entrance; students are admitted from 
outside counties! Bulletin No. 242 enumerates some 
of the ways in which these schools are able to help 
the farmers: they prepare plans for farm buildings; 
make suggestions for remodelling old buildings; build 
forms for and supervise the construction of cement silos, 
watering troughs, and similar structures; test all kinds 
of dairy products; assist in the selection of farm animals ; 
plan drainage systems; test seeds for germination; test 
cattle for tuberculosis; test soils; recommend systems 
of rotation. A prominent feature of these schools is 
the “part-time” work in agriculture, in which the student 
spends a part of his time in the school, and the remainder 
in productive farm work, preferably at home, under the 
supervision of the school. The outside work takes the 
form of problems, or “Projects” as they are called. 
These projects are classified as improvement projects, 
experimental projects, and productive projects. “Each 
project is something to be done on a farm, which would 
involve a limited and definite amount of equipment, 
materials, and time, and which would be directed to- 
ward the accomplishment of a specified and valuable 
1See Bulletin 242, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.
-P-A-G-E-87

result.” ! Such projects are found in vegetable, flower or 
landscape gardening, orcharding, small-fruit growing, 
general farm crops, farm forestry, greenhouse crops, 
poultry products, bee-keeping, swine husbandry, sheep 
raising, horse raising, dairying, etc. a 
Another form of state aid to agricultural secondary 
education is the subvention of agricultural departments in 
public high schools. Such aid is given in Kansas, Louisi- 
ana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New 
York, North Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. 
Doubtless such assistance will soon be extended in many 
other states. The amount of aid ranges from $250 to 
$1000, and in exceptional cases to larger sums.” 
Besides these standard forms of secondary agricul- 
tural education, there are numerous short courses and 
extension courses by which knowledge is disseminated 
and guidance provided.® 
C. In the field of lower vocational education, Germany 
has done more than any other nation, since she has or- 
ganized a system of continuation schools for cities, which 
have all become established parts of the compulsory state

dary agricultural education is the Eleventh Yearbook of the National

system. In the city of Munich alone, nine thousand 
boys attend these schools, twelve of which are general, 
and fifty-two trade schools. Seven thousand girls are 
distributed over forty separate schools. All receive 
instruction in household arts; nine hundred are in com- 
mercial classes, and three hundred in trade departments.1 
Similar continuation schools are maintained in England 
and in some other European countries. 
In the United States an extensive system of public 
evening schools is to be found in the larger cities. 
Courses in the simpler aspects of manual training, 
and household activities, and, in rural districts, the 
rudiments of agriculture are frequently provided in the 
elementary schools. The state of New York has made a 
distinct advance in providing that the rudiments of 
knowledge and the school arts shall be so far advanced 
at the end of the sixth year of school life that the be- 
ginnings of vocational training may start in the seventh 
and eighth grades. This arrangement also permits 
other secondary studies, especially language, mathematics 
and science, to begin at the same time. This provision 
is sure to have far-reaching effects upon democratic 
education, for it gives us a chance to increase the. effi- 
ciency of our secondary education while preserving its 
democratic character.

CHAPTER V 
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 
I. Eucenics: 1rs EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE AND 
Liuirs 
The measure of eugenics is the selection of desirable 
natural characters; its means are breeding and elimination. 
1. Conflicting Theories 
No study is perhaps more fascinating to the teacher 
than that of heredity, for upon its laws depend the limits 
of the educability of the young. Though it may be a 
laudable effort to try to wash out the spots of the tiger, 
yet for all our trying the spots abide. The teacher desires 
to know to what extent he may soften or avert the fate 
of those who are born deficient in the fundamental 
attributes of normal mentality; he also wants to know 
where the boundaries are that may not be passed. 
Furthermore, he would like to know what the welfare of 
the possible future offspring of defectives demands in 
the way of public control, and what he can do to dissemi- 
nate a knowledge of the truth and help it to prevail. 
The teacher is interested, moreover, in knowing to what 
77 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
extent human beings may subject themselves, or be 
subjected, to the beneficent aspects of the laws of animal 
heredity, and, on the other hand, to what extent these 
laws are certain to be evaded. In other words, he wishes 
to understand how humanity may modify animal hered- 
ity, and whether, on the other hand, some laws of animal 
heredity hold with inexorable rigidity in the human 
realm. 
The first great question among biologists is whether 
acquired characters are inherited or not; that i 1at is, W whether 
a_parent may tra transmit to his children say the muscular 
excellencies he may have a acquired by work or play, or 
gymnastics, or the immunity | to disease that an outdoor 
life has given him, or the mental alertness that an active 
intellectual life may ay have developed i in him. The 
[eied@an ciatntain that acquired characters are at 
least partially inherited, while the Weismann school in 
general declare they are not. The latter base this denial 
upon the ground that all heredity comes through the 
germ-plasm, which is antecedent to all body-cells and 
their development. Lamarck’s theory was published in 
1809, long before the microscope had given any hints as 
to how heredity is effected in the embryo. ‘His 
theory was that ‘acquired’ modifications are being 
continually produced and perfected by every organism 
during its life, and that they are at least partially trans- 
mitted to its offspring, so that each generation will be

rather better adapted to its surroundings than its pred- 
ecessor.”” Though the followers of Lamarck are not 
so numerous as they once were, still they are a force in 
the scientific world. They say it is absurd to think 
that ages of development under a given environment, 
say Central Africa, have not produced fixed racial 
characteristics. They hold that the human organism 
is one for inheritance, and should not be divided into 
germ-cell and body-cell and all potency in heredity as- 
cribed to the germ and denied to the body. They 
affirm that when pressed for reasons the Weismannites 
conceal themselves in the germ-cell ; that is, in mysteries, 
where no man can find them. The latter reply that the 
germ-cells are segregated in the body long before birth, 
and that it is absurd to think that they can be changed 
in fundamental character by somatic or bodily changes, 
such as are induced by the environment. They maintain, 
moreover, that these cells, like every other thingin nature, 
have the internal quality of variability, which is enough 
to account for development. They reénforce this argu- 
ment by describing a fairly complete mechanism of 
heredity which the microscope has enabled them to dis- 
cover. The followers of Weismann therefore maintain 
that, like the monads of Leibnitz, these germ-cells have 
no doors or windows through which somatic changes can 
reach them.

But the followers of Weismann divide into two camps 
when the question arises as to the way in which inheri- 
tance takes place. 
The Mendelians think that many, and in a final analy- 
sis perhaps all, hereditary characters are unitary, or inde- 
pendent, in kind, and that when germ-cells divide, these 
unit characters distribute themselves through the 
chromosomes in an alternate manner; accordingly 
inheritance may be duplex (from both parents, as when 
both are brown-eyed), simplex (from one parent only, as 
when one is brown-eyed but the other devoid of pig- 
mentation in the eye), or nulliplex (from neither parent, 
as where neither has the pigment that produces the 
brown in the eyes). A prominent character is also often 
called dominant and its opposite recessive (e.g. if tall is 
dominant, short is recessive), the main point being that 
through breeding either character may become isolated 
and fixed, so that a strain may be produced that will 
always come true to kind; as, for instance, a breed of 
wheat or corn that will ripen in a cold climate having 
but a short summer ; a breed of chickens which, like the 
White Leghorn, become great egg producers, but show 
small desire to incubate. The agriculturist now applies 
the laws of Mendel successfully in the breeding of nearly 
all varieties of plants and animals. The great success 
of Luther Burbank in the plant world is well known. In

the human field, Dr. Goddard shows from his investiga- 
tions on the heredity of the feeble-minded, at Vineland, 
New Jersey, that if both parents are feeble-minded, all 
the children will be, and that if one parent is feeble-minded, 
some, if not all, of the children most probably will be. 
On the other hand, the biometricians, as they are called, 
led by Galton and Pearson, doubt the validity of Mendel’s 
laws in the human family, at least in some aspects of 
heredity, and explain human heredity as a process of 
blending, as in the case of height, form of body, color of 
hair and skin. If Mendel’s laws held absolutely in the 
human field, we should be able to segregate the white in 
one strain (dominant) and the black (recessive) in an- 
other when cross-breeding between whitesand blacks takes 
place, but who has ever seen anything of this sort? 
What we seem to have is a blending of color in varying 
shades according to the amount of white or black blood 
in the mixture. 
Other writers, like Walker,? accept both blending and 
alternate inheritance as modes of transmission. Walker? 
says: “It appears that we have two opposite modes of 
transmission: one in which certain characters are defi- 
nitely segregated (Mendelism), and for which it is 
necessary to assume entities which are distributed in an

alternate manner to the gametes (the reproductive cells in 
either parent) when new individuals are produced; an- 
other in which characters apparently blend when crossed.” 
“The whole problem,” says Doncaster,! “is very in- 
sufficiently known, and the difficulty of obtaining reliable 
data is doubtless increased by race-prejudice. Taken in 
mass, the results of crossing white and black races seem 
to give a blended inheritance with continuous variation.” 
Again certain other biologists, like Dr. F. A. Woods,? 
whose eyes are fixed almost exclusively on hereditary 
processes, make heredity the main factor in human im- 
provement and think the environment of small conse- 
quence. Others like Saleeby* and Davenport* and 
Jordan ° ascribe a large influence to both. 
Still others, economists like Patten, Devine, and 
Rountree and Lasker, lay the chief stress upon the envi- 
ronment. Each of the foregoing positions will be dis- 
cussed and, so far as seems appropriate, evaluated in 
the present chapter.

2. The Mechanism of Heredity 
Encouraged by the surprising results obtained by plant 
and animal breeding, scientists are now led to inquire 
to what extent similar results are attainable in the human 
family. Manifestly great differences exist between a 
human and an animal economy. Thus, plants and ani- 
malsare controllable by forces outside themselves and may 
be selected or destroyed at the will of man; but human 
beings are ends in themselves, control in large measure 
their own destiny, and cannot be selected or destroyed 
at will, yet they are nevertheless organized into social 
groups which can to a certain extent exert an influence 
on selection and elimination, as, for instance, where 
feeble-minded persons are segregated in institutions and 
prevented from producing offspring. 
The reader of eugenic literature constantly meets such 
terms as germ-cells, somatic cells, mother and daughter 
cells, unit characters, chromosomes, centrosomes, de- 
terminers, duplex, simplex, nulliplex, dominant, re- 
cessive, etc., besides the older expressions, natural char- 
acters and acquired characters. To comprehend these 
distinctions and to understand the premises from which 
the eugenist draws his conclusions, it is necessary for 
the student to understand at least in outline the mech- 
anism of heredity as revealed by modern research. 
In the early days of the theory of evolution, men as-
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
sumed two things: namely, first, a tendency to varia- 
tion ; and second, a power to transmit these variations to 
offspring. Without variation there could be no progress, 
since the descendants would be precisely like the parents ; 
without the power to transmit variations there could 
likewise be no progress, for the variations would dis- 
appear with the individual that produced them. But 
knowing nothing of nature’s method of transmitting 
characters, it was often assumed that qualities acquired 
in the body (the somatic) cells, say in the muscles, could 
be transmitted directly to the offspring. Thus arose 
the doctrine of the inheritance of acquired characters. 
Now, however, it is definitely known that the whole 
mechanism of heredity lies in the germ-cells, and not in 
the cells of the body. Therefore it is necessary for the 
believer in the inheritance of acquired characters, whether 
mental or physical, to show that, and eventually how, 
these characters affect the germ-cells. That there is 
some connection between germ and somatic cells is 
evident, for it is from the body that the germ-cells must 
get their nutriment, while it is certain that when the 
body dies, all germ-plasm likewise perishes. But, on the 
other hand, it is easy to see why mutilations are not in- 
herited, since the tails and ears of dogs, for example, can 
hardly be so closely connected with germ-cells as to 
cause the puppies to be born with cropped ears and 
shortened tails. Yet it is at least conceivable that
-P-A-G-E-97
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 85 
poisons circulating in the blood or paralyzing the nerves 
might so affect the germ-cells that deterioration in the 
offspring would take place. 
At all events, it is evident that the eugenist holds the 
key to the problems of heredity when he concentrates his 
attention on the known mechanism of heredity found in 
the germ-cells, a brief outline of which follows : — 
(1) Protoplasmic or Germ-Cells 
These are of two kinds, the female (egg) and the male 
(sperm). Though differing in size, the egg being much 
the larger, each of these cells multiplies by division. A 
cell consists of a nucleus within a mass of protoplasmic 
matter. Within the small mass known as the nucleus 
there is a smaller body known as the plasmosome or 
true nucleus, and another known as the net-knot, or 
chromatin nucleolus. Surrounding these two points, 
yet within the nucleus proper, is an irregular network 
of denser material known as the chromatin network. 
Outside the nucleus lies a small so-called attraction 
sphere containing a centrosome. Figure 1 is a diagram- 
matic representation of a resting germ-cell. 
(2) Division of a Mother Cell (Male or Female) into Two 
Daughter Cells 
In the process of division the single centrosome of the 
resting cell which lies outside the nucleus separates into

RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 87 
two centrosomes when the cell is ready for division, 
which then move around to opposite poles of the nucleus, 
while the chromosomes arrange themselves at right 
angles to the axis joining the centrosomes. Later the 
line of chromosomes splits into halves longitudinally 
and then breaks into parts laterally, one-half going to 
each of the new centres. Finally, there is a line of cleav- 
age between the centres, so that what was one cell has 
become two, each one of which is an exact counterpart 
of the original. It is in this way that nature multiplies 
germ-cells in both parents. See Fig. 2. 
(3) Determiners 
Though it is perfectly evident that the fertilized germ- 
cell does not contain in miniature the various organs 
of the adult, yet it is nevertheless destined to produce 
them. The various characteristics that go to make up 
the developed animal must therefore be represented in 
some way in the germ-plasm. One fertilized egg develops 
into a bird, another into a snake, a third into a mammal, 
and so on in endless differentiation. There must, 
therefore, be internal differences of one sort or another to 
correspond to all these differences in the final results of 
development. These differentiating elements in con- 
stituent parts are called determiners. 
Determiners are located, then, certainly in germ-cells, 
and, according to recent research, most probably in

  Fic. 2.— Development of a Mother Germ-Cell, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 89 
the chromatic material (the chromosomes) of the 
nucleus. 
The inherent probability is that determiners come 
both from the egg cell and from the sperm cell, since off- 
spring show characteristics of each parent, but since the 
amount of chromatic substance is the same in each cell, 
it seems clear that the chromatic substance (the chromo- 
somes) must be the carrier of the determiners. 
(4) How the Doubling of Determiners is Prevented 
Since the determiners from the male germ-cell are 
added to those of the female, it would seem that the num- 
ber of determiners would double with each succeeding 
generation, were this not in some way prevented. A 
mechanism to effect this prevention is found in the matur- 
ing of the germ-cells. 
It might be supposed that germ-cells are capable of 
multiplication at any stage of their development, but such 
is not the case, for, starting with a primordial germ-cell 
inherited from ancestors, each cell created by subdivision 
pursues a regular course of further subdivision, then of 
growth, and finally of a fourfold multiplication and 
complete ripening. This is the end of separate develop- 
ment for the male or the female germ-cell. The cell is 
then ripe, like a mature fruit, and can find further exist- 
ence only when joined to its opposite, a ripe cell of the 
other sex; that is, only in a fertilized egg. 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  go BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
In the process of mitosis, or mitotic division, as it is 
called, the germ-cells have each had, say four chromo- 
somes, which it will be remembered are supposed to be 
the bearers of the determiners of the characteristics of the 
offspring, but in the final division that results in the 
mature cell this number is reduced by one-half, so that if 
_the mother cell had four chromosomes, the ripe daughter 
cell has but two. Thus when the egg is fertilized each 
parent cell has contributed as many chromosomes as the 
other ; namely, one-half of the original number, hence as 
many determiners, so that the doubling of determiners 
with each new generation has been prevented.! This is 
the mechanism of heredity, and the basis for the laws of 
Mendel. 
3. Mendel’s Law? 
Mendel discovered that in the breeding of peas 
certain characters, like height and color, depend upon the 
presence in the germ-cells of determining factors be- 
having as units. In any given germ-cell each of these 
determiners is either present or absent. Thus in the 
case of a tall pea vine the factor tallness may be sym- 
bolized by T and is called dominant; in a short pea vine 
the absence of the determiner for tallness is called re- 
cessive and has ?# for its symbol. Tallness being due to a 
1 Consult Wilson, E. B., ““The Cell in Development and Heredity.” 
2 Mendel, Gregor J., an Austrian Augustinian Abbot, 1822-1884. 
The law was discovered in the breeding of peas.
-P-A-G-E-103
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 91 
factor T, a tall plant arising from the union of two germ- 
cells, a male and a female cell, both bearing this factor, is 
TT; a dwarf, being without T in either cell, is #4. Cross- 
ing the tall pea with the dwarf, hybrids, or cross-breeds, 
result with the symbol Tt. This is called the first filial 
generation (F). In the formation of the germs of these 
cross-breeds a process of segregation occurs so that germ- 
cells, whether male or female, are produced of two kinds, 
T and ¢, in equal numbers. The T cells bear the factor 
‘“‘tallness” ; the é cells are devoid of it. T and #, being thus 
alternative, are called allelomorphs. The offspring, 
generation F,; which arise from the chance union of 
these germ-cells in pairs, according to the laws of probabil- 
ity, are therefore on an average in the following propor- 
foes st TT so Tht hs. 
Frequently the form T¢ cannot be distinguished from 
TT because of what is called the dominance of the factor 
T. Thus it sometimes happens in the case of one normal 
and one feeble-minded parent, that the dominance of the 
normal parent may be so great that all the children will 
appear normal though some may have in latent form the 
taint of feeble-mindedness. 
In the crossing of tall and dwarf peas, generation F, 
containing only the form T?, consists only of dominants 
(tall plants), and generation F; consists of three domi- 
nants (1 T 2 T?) to one dwarf (#), which, displaying the 
feature latent in F, is called recessive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
Such qualitative and numerical regularity has been 
proved to exist in regard to very diverse qualities of 
characters which compose living things, both wild and 
domesticated, such as colors of flowers, or of eyes, 
patterns, structure, and power of resisting certain 
diseases. 
When a character comes from both germ-cells, it is 
called duplex; when from one parent only, it is called 
simplex ; and when it is lacking in both parents, it is lack- 
ing also in the offspring, and is called nulliplex. 
An illustration may be taken from the crossing of red 
(dominant color) with white (recessive with respect to 
red) flowered four-o’clocks (Mirabilis jalappa). The 
offspring from this cross having the determiner for red 
from one side only, produced pink flowers only. In the 
first filial generation (F) when these pink flowers were 
bred together, they produced plants of which one in four 
had red flowers (duplex), two in four had pink flowers 
(simplex), while one in four had no red pigment 
(nulliplex).! 
Since each parent may be either duplex, simplex, or 
nulliplex with respect to a given characteristic, say a 
pigment in the iris of the eye, it follows that there will 
be six more or less distinct classes of combinations 
with corresponding results. Taking the color of eyes

4. Application of the Laws of Heredity to Eugenics 
  The laws of inheritance for unit characters are so plain 
that it might seem an easy task to prescribe just what 
must be done to secure a desirable character in offspring 
or to eliminate an undesirable one. 
points out, two internal difficulties confront us when we 
attempt to apply the rules of heredity to eugenics: first, 
“We do not yet know all the unit characters in man; 
1See pp. 18-19. But as Davenport?

-P-A-G-E-106
    94 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
and, second, we can hardly know in advance which of 
them are due to positive determiners and which to the 
absence of such.” Furthermore, unit characters may be 
simplex or duplex, which further complicates their 
determination. 
What may at first seem like unit characters, may turn 
out to be a number of separately inheritable factors 
influenced by external circumstances. Thus, insanity 
may be the result of one or more of a large number of 
internal conditions combined with such external ones as 
isolation, trouble, overwork, wounds, blood-clot, sick- 
ness, or nervous weakness in general. Much the same 
variety of causes of criminality is revealed by analysis. 
In what sense is there any born criminal? The chief 
external difficulties in the application of breeding and 
elimination to human beings have already been men- 
tioned. They are, that men are ends in themselves, 
control mostly their own destiny, and cannot be bred 
or eliminated at the will of others. These facts are 
modified by a certain measure of social control that can 
be exerted over marriage and communicable diseases. 
The educational significance of the modern eugenic 
movement would appear to be confined mostly to the 
influence education may have on the following aspects 
of the problem : — 
1. The elimination of the feeble-minded, criminalistic, 
and other undesirable classes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 95 
2. The multiplication of the mentally and physically 
supernormal. 
3. The spread of knowledge concerning eugenic laws. 
Taking these points up in turn, we have to consider 
I. THE ELIMINATION OF THE WEAK 
(1) The Mentally Defective 
The first law of inheritance of mental ability is that 
two mentally defective parents will produce only men- 
tally defective offspring. This law has been abundantly 
verified by Dr. H. H. Goddard by the study of many 
family histories of feeble-minded persons at the Vine- 
land (N. J.) Training School for Defectives. A low 
degree o of mentality is due to some defect in this particu- 
lar in one or both of the parents. Where both parents 
are Jacking i in some factor that determines normal men- 
tal development, the same factor will be absent in their 
children. The following charts by Dr. Goddard fully 
illustrate this law. They also show that if one parent is 
defective, some of the offspring, either in the first or 
second generation, are almost sure to reveal the defect. 
In these figures, the squares represent males and the 
circles females. 
Criminality is in some cases closely associated with

study of inherited feeble-mindedness. The Macmillan Co., New York.

feeble-mindedness; at other times the defect is of a 
different character, since the criminal is intellectually

strong and comes from parents who rank high in this 
respect. Davenport gives the history of a number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  RACE IMPROVEMENT : EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 97 
families in which one or more of the children or grand- 
children manifest criminalistic traits.! 
(2) The Ethics of Elimination 
Does the right to live imply the unrestricted right to 
propagate life irrespective of public welfare and the 
physical and mental health of offspring? There are 
several reasons why modern peoples need to ask and 
answer this question. Europe must ask it, because the 
New World has for four centuries steadily drained the 
best blood of her laboring classes, leaving so far as pos- 
sible the dregs behind. But the dregs of society are 
more prolific than the higher classes. During the nine- 
teenth century the population of Europe rose as follows: 
Russia from 38 to 105 millions; France from 26 to 38; 
Germany from 23 to 55; Great Britain from 15 to 4o, 
and the United States from 5 to 75 millions, respectively. 
Again, modern hygiene is tending to bring even very 
inferior human beings up to and through the reproductive 
period, while prudence and the increased cost of living 
is delaying marriage and otherwise restricting the birth 
rate among those classes from which we should expect 
the soundest offspring and the best training. Further- 
more, the very conception of progress in race improve- 
ment implies the replacement of lower life by higher, and 
surely it cannot be gainsaid that the germ-cells of the 
1 Davenport, C. B., “Heredity in Relation to Eugenics,” pp. 83-92. 
H
-P-A-G-E-110
98 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
higher order have as much right to existence as those of 
the lower. Hence selection in parenthood on this ground 
at least seems justifiable. 
Science is indeed making it possible for the earth to 
support thousands, where it once supported hundreds. 
Yet we can never for long escape the antithesis between 
the fit and the unfit. Were we in the midst of an ani- 
mal economy, this would not matter, since the unfit 
would soon perish and the fit survive. But as things 
are now, we feel in duty bound to protect and nourish 
the one as much as the other, hence the modern 
problem of exercising charity while improving the 
race. 
Saleeby ! formulates what seems the true solution as 
follows: “We must seek to preserve all the children that 
come into the world, to amplify the health of the healthy 
and to neutralize, as far as possible, the unfitness of the 
unfit, but at the same time while extending to the unfit all 
our sympathy we must forbid them parenthood.” 
“T submit, then,” he says, ‘that there is no inconsist- 
ency in fighting simultaneously for the preservation 
and care of all babies and all children without discrimi- 
nation of any kind — and, on the other hand, in declar- 
ing that, if the degeneration of the race is to be averted, 
still more if racial progress, which is the only sure prog-

tess, is to be attained, we must have the worthy and 
only the worthy to be the parents of the future.” 
This means that we must deny parenthood to the 
pauper, the idiot, the imbecile, the feeble-minded, the 
epileptic, the congenitally criminal, and to those who are 
afflicted with destructive contagious diseases. The 
ethical reason for the prohibition of parentage to these 
defectives is twofold : — 
1. The prevention of incurable misery or inferiority 
in the offspring, and 
2. The protection of society from needless deteriora- 
tion and the bearing of unnecessary burdens. 
To the living we owe all possible love and protection, 
but it is likewise the duty of the living to deny parent- 
hood to all whose possible offspring would be con- 
demned to hopeless inferiority of body or feebleness 
of mind. 
David Starr Jordan‘ gives a striking example of the 
good that may come to a country by denying parent- 
hood, even for a single generation, to those whose off- 
spring are sure to be imbecile in mind as well as diseased 
in body. 
In the valley of Aosta, in northern Italy, and in 
other Alpine regions is found the form of idiocy known 
as cretinism. All cretins are afflicted with goitre, though 
not all who have goitres are idiots. These cretins have

for centuries received ample support in alms, and, owing 
to this fact and the fact that the healthy peasants have 
been largely drafted off for the army, have until recent 
times greatly increased in numbers. Jordan, writing in 
1897, says: “In fair weather the roads about the city are 
lined with those awful paupers— human beings with 
less intelligence than the goose, with less decency than 
the pig. The asylum for cretins in Aosta is a veritable 
chamber of horrors.” He continues: “In 1910, I 
visited Aosta for a further study of this question. To 
my surprise I was unable for some time to find a single 
cretin or even anybody who knew the meaning of the 
word. I found that some twenty years ago Aosta had 
built an asylum for the aged poor. All the cretins and 
most of the goitrous in this region have been removed 
to this asylum, the men segregated from the women 
and the inmates not allowed to marry. There is but 
one cretin left, an old woman four feet high, who has the 
intelligence and, for that matter, the manners of a lap 
dog, very affectionate, but without any mental capacity. 
There were three others, half cretins, illegitimate chil- 
dren of cretin women. As regards the cretin children, 
Suor Lucia, the Mother Superior, said simply, ‘Il 
n’y en a plus (They don’t come any more).’” 
If careful segregation of defectives for twenty years 
can rid a community of a repulsive form of idiocy that 
has afflicted it for centuries, what possibilities for us

(in similar fields) are brought to view! We have in 
this country 42 institutions for the feeble-minded, 
z15 schools and homes for the deaf and blind, 350 hos- 
pitals for the insane, 1200 refuge homes, 1300 prisons, 
tsoo hospitals, and 2500 almshouses. In _ these 
institutions are 300,000 insane and _ feeble-minded 
(75,000 feeble-minded in institutions out of 150,000 in 
the United States), 160,000 blind or deaf, 2,000,000 
that are annually cared for by hospitals and homes, 
80,000 prisoners, not to mention the thousands of 
criminals who should be in prison, but are not, and 100,000 
paupers in almshouses and out.t 
By no means all the inmates of prisons, insane asy- 
lums, and institutions for the deaf and dumb should 
come under such eugenic restrictions as were imposed 
at Aosta, but many of them should, while nearly all 
the inmates of asylums for idiots, epileptics, feeble-minded, 
and paupers should unquestionably be denied parent- 
hood. Any pauper in the reproduction period of life 
is practically sure to have defects of mind and body such 
as unfit him for responsible parenthood. 
Where the defect is physical rather than mental, 
education of the afflicted in the principles of eugenics, 
as in deaf mutism, would seem to be the best and 
possibly the sufficient means of preventing unsuitable 
marriages.

(3) Influence of Education in the Elimination of 
Defectives 
Though it may be freely conceded that in its narrower 
aspects education has but slight influence upon eugenics, 
yet there are some ways in which its influence may be 
considerable. Among these are : — 
a. The creation of a wholesome public opinion 
through instruction in physiology and hygiene. When 
it is established and make known that certain physical 
or mental defects are sure to appear in the offspring, 
like cretinism in the Alps or idiocy and feeble-mindedness 
here, and that these defects rob the afflicted creature of 
about all that makes existence desirable, then public 
opinion will demand, secure, and enforce those restric- 
tive measures which, without cruelty to the individual, 
will forbid parenthood to him. 
b. The discovery, through mental and physical tests, 
of incurable weaknesses. These tests should be sup- 
ported by studies in the hereditary history of the indi- 
vidual. 
c. The segregation of the sexes in institutions for the 
education and protection of patients hopelessly deficient 
in physical or mental power.

2. THE SELECTION OF THE STRONG 
(1) Nietzsche’s Superman 
The “will to power”’ is, according to Nietzsche, the 
supreme measure of that bright blossom of the century 
plant of mankind, the overman, the supernal individual, 
for whose production the world of common men exist. 
“Man,” he says,! “is a rope between the brute and the 
overman, he is not an end or goal, but a bridge.” Kant 
thought that every man should be conceived as an end 
in himself, but with Nietzsche there is but one end, the 
great individual, and men are nothing but means for 
the realization of this dynamic personality. Nietzsche 
would not destroy the weak, he would use them, though 
he despises them. He has only scorn for a race of men 
who worship the mediocre, who believe in democracy 
and equality. “Why do the weak triumph?” he asks. 
“On the whole the sick and the weak have more sym- 
pathy and are more ‘human’; the sick and the weak 
have more intellect, and are more changeable, more 
variegated, more intellectual—more malicious... . 
The sick and the weak have always had fascination on 
their side; they are more interesting than the healthy ; 
the fool and the saint —the two most interesting of men ! 
And finally, woman! One-half of mankind is 
1 Nietzsche, F., “The Will to Power,” pp. 299-300.
-P-A-G-E-116
104 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
weak, chronically sick, changeable, shifty — woman 
requires strength in order to cleave to it; she also re- 
quires a religion of the weak which glorifies weakness, 
love, and modesty as divine; or, better still, she makes 
the strong weak — she rules when she succeeds in over- 
coming the strong. Woman has always conspired with 
decadent types, —the priests, for instance, — against 
the mighty; against the strong; against men.” 
With Neitzsche, as with Schopenhauer, the will is the 
supreme faculty, not so much the will to live, as with 
Schopenhauer, but the will to do, to be strong, to bid 
defiance to every influence that shears men of their power 
in order to make them ‘good’ or alike. The supreme 
purpose of the world is to produce such men of strength, 
and the offering is not too great that sacrifices any 
number of common men to produce one such demigod. 
As the final purpose of the world is not to bring goodness, 
but strength, such individuals stand above the morality 
of the mob and become a law unto themselves. 
“What is the root of all evil ? — that the slave morality 
of modesty, chastity, selfishness, and absolute obedience 
should have triumphed. Dominating natures are 
thus condemned (1) to hypocrisy, (2) to qualms of con- 
science; creative natures regarded themselves as rebels 
against God, uncertain and hemmed in by eternal 
values.” 1 
1“The Will to Power,” p. 309.
-P-A-G-E-117
     
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 105 
Struggle, war, passion, envy, hatred, and rivalry are, 
then, the fiery furnace in which the great man is forged. 
“The ‘warm sympathetic heart’ does not know what it 
asks when it demands the removal of this violent phase 
of life; its own warmth is the product of the fire of the 
very passions which it desires to have suppressed.” 
The church, he thinks, has spoiled some good things 
that go to the making of the superman. Among them 
are: 1. Asceticism, which has been used for suppression 
of desire, when it should be used for the development of 
power of will; 2. Fasting, which should be used to en- 
hance capacity, has been used as a penance for sin; 
3. The monastery should be not an escape from tempta- 
tion, but a storage reservoir for more powerful action; 
4. Feasts, — these are pagan things, which mean: pride, 
high spirits, exuberance; scorn for all kinds of serious- 
ness and Philistinism; a divine saying of yea to one’s 
self, as the result of physical plentitude and perfection. 
The superman, therefore, grants to himself all privi- 
leges when these help to express his superiority; he 
subjects himself and others to all discipline and hard- 
ship when these are necessary to his development or mani- 
festation. Power, not goodness, is his morality; his 
destiny is to develop and assert himself, not to serve 
others. Democracy is the consolation of little minds. 
“Equality of rights leads to equality of wrongs. Every 
right is a privilege.” ‘Equal rights to equals — unequal
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
ones to unequals, that would be the true doctrine of 
justice; and what follows from it — never to make the 
unequal equal.” Nothing counts but the desire for 
life, for power. Instinct, desire, will, are higher than 
conscious intelligence. 
We are to breed, therefore, the lion, the bear, and 
the wolf. If we ask, “to what end?” the answer is, 
for the sake of the power they embody, for the strength 
of will they manifest, for their disregard of everything 
Christianity cherishes, and their contempt of the people 
from whom they sprang, over whom they domineer, 
and whose lives and substance they consume. If the 
superman has any end outside himself, it seems to be the 
production and recognition of his kind. That there 
can be many such Nietzsche does not intimate, though 
he says: “The only nobility is that of birth and blood. 
Intellect alone does not ennoble; on the contrary, 
something is always needed to ennoble intellect. What is 
needed, then ? — Blood.”’ In short, he uses a wilderness 
of words with interminable repetition to describe his 
hero and the world in which he lives, but he does not 
show us biologically either how to get him or how to 
keep him when he is once obtained. ‘‘Would you have 
a name for my world? A solution of all your riddles ?

Science Monthly, December, 1905.

  RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 107 
Do you also want a light, ye most concealed, strongest, 
and most undaunted men of blackest midnight ? — 
This world is the will to power and nothing else.” 
(2) The Breeding and Preservation of the Strong 
The strong man is hard to get, and harder to keep. 
He is hard to get for several reasons. First, there is 
no social or other machinery for selecting and mating 
the kind of parents most likely to produce such offspring, 
even were any wise enough to be able to select them. 
Mankind cannot be bred as farmers breed animals or 
botanists plants. Second, the fortunate conjunction 
of germ-cells capable of producing a Lincoln, a Shak- 
speare, or a Napoleon is a matter so fortuitous that the 
chances of effecting it are as one to millions. 
But hard as the supernormal man is to get, he is still 
harder to keep, for if Mendelism is true, there is no 
knowing what ancestral traits may be latent in the 
determiners of the germ-plasm, or what chance of fate 
may prevent the strong elements in his heredity from 
prevailing. Again, no sooner does a man become a 
lion than he is possessed to choose a lamb for his mate. 
The union of a lion and a sheep, however, does not pro- 
duce a new generation of lions. 
Nietzsche’s theory is nothing new. The world has 
fortunately emerged from the state in which there were 
but two classes, the strong and the weak, the exploiters
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
and the exploited, the tribute takers and the tribute 
givers, the heroes and the herds. Such a condition of 
society was created and maintained by chronic social 
deficit. When the masses are on the threshold of star- 
vation, the strong man finds his opportunity, since the 
people are so weak that they cannot survive without 
him, and so helpless that they cannot resist his will 
to devour them. The flock does indeed need the shep- 
herd to keep off the wolves, but they cannot successfully 
resist shearing, or eventually being turned into mutton. 
It is doubtless weakness that makes submerged masses 
cultivate the sheeplike virtues prized by shepherds in 
their flocks — meekness, humbleness, non-resistance, 
tractability, patience in bearing pain, and willingness 
to suffer for the good of leader or led. But an economy 
of surplus has deposed the wolf from his position as 
leader and guardian of the flock. Nietzsche sees in the 
democracy made possible by an age of social surplus a 
conspiracy of the sheep to restrain the strong, to pull 
him down to their own level, and to exalt mediocrity. 
He sees in the church an organization to impose upon 
the powerful the very morality begotten by the weak 
for their own comfort and spiritual welfare. 
There is, however, a less gloomy view of the social 
ferment introduced by prosperity. The superman, as 
Nietzsche is fond of pointing out, considered himself 
as a divinely appointed shepherd of the sheep, who were
-P-A-G-E-121
  RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS I09 
taught to regard him rather than themselves as the ends 
of their being. But prosperity makes a new philosophy 
possible in that the prosperous man ceases to look for 
his end in his shepherd, only to find it in himself. 
Thus every man may aspire to strength, and to found 
a society in which each individual has the right and 
can find the means to develop to its utmost every 
germ of power and worth that heredity has given 
him. Children, therefore, do not inherit what their 
parents do, but what they might have become; democ- 
racy, therefore, should not be regarded as the leveller of 
mountain peaks, but the agency for raising submerged 
plainsintoairand sunshine. The satirist pictures English- 
men as exclaiming, ‘‘The meek shall inherit the earth; we 
are the meek.”” This merely means that those who were 
the meek under the old reign of deficit and its morality 
of helplessness have become the strong, not by virtue 
of mere numbers directed by envy, but because of the 
development of the possibilities lying latent in the 
individual. 
Society needs strength in all its people; it needs the 
strength to develop strength in the young; to restrain the 
strength of the strong when they insist upon being irre- 
sponsible gods, whether this assumed divinity manifests 
itself in the warrior, or in the priest, or in the industrial 
giant who would seize and devour everything upon 
which he can lay his hands.
-P-A-G-E-122
  IIO0 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
The function of the strong man is not, as Nietzsche 
thought, to travel in a circle about himself, to make his 
own capricious capacity the end and aim of its own being, 
nor is it to beget a race of godlets like himself; it is, on 
the contrary, to use his power to develop power in others, 
to improve mankind, not to devour it; to elevate the 
trace, not to be an elevation above it. 
The conclusion of the matter seems to be as follows: 
The great personality has small prospect of becoming the 
progenitor of a race of intellectual or volitional giants ; the 
race resists the effort to raise it above itself, but it does 
rejoice now and then in producing an isolated character 
of unusual strength. To make the greatness of the great 
man its own end, is to make an end of that which soon 
comes to an end, which amounts consequently to a tele- 
ological vacuum. Therefore, the supreme end of such 
beings is social rather than biological. The great man 
lives not for himself only, but for the great things he can 
accomplish for the elevation of mankind — the inventions 
he can devise, the systems of justice he can evolve and ex- 
ecute, the public policies he can inaugurate and admin- 
ister, the conditions of health he can establish and main- 
tain, the ideals of education he can conceive and realize ; 
in short, he lives to serve his fellow-man by making him 
better able to serve himself, by promoting his individ- 
uality and his social well-being. 
President Jordan speaks as follows concerning the pro-
-P-A-G-E-123
  
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS III 
posal to breed men as animals are bred: “It is evident 
that the human race is quite as plastic as the horse or 
sheep, and that if mating could be carried toward defi- 
nite ends, even for a few generations, there might be 
startling results. It would be easy in a few generations 
under competent control to standardize strength, beauty, 
endurance, or virtue. But there seems to be no possi- 
bility that any group of scientific men could ever be 
called on to exercise such control. Moreover, those 
best worth while would never submit to it. The best 
of men and of women will always choose their mates for 
themselves. The artificial breeding of the superman, if 
such a thing can be conceived as a practical matter for 
the state to undertake, would defeat its own ends. It 
would breed out of existence the two most important 
factors the race has won, so far as mating is concerned. 
These are love and initiative. The superman produced 
by official eugenics would not take his fate into his own 
hands, and his descendants would not know the meaning 
of love.” + 
The Spartans once bred to produce the soldier, but 
they sacrificed freedom to maintain slavery; they laid 
down love and initiative to take up brute courage and 
endurance. They gave to the world only an example 
that the world refuses to follow.

3. SELECTION AND EDUCATION OF THE SUPERNORMAL 
Though the superman may not be of much use bio- 
logically, he is of great value socially. No race can 
afford to allow the development of its choicest minds 
to depend upon accident. 
The old tutorial education had great advantages in 
the discovery and education of the supernormal among 
the classes who could afford tutors. When there is a 
teacher for one, two, or three children in a family, edu- 
cation can be individual in the scope of subject-matter 
as well as in method and rate of progress. N. Wiener? 
describes his own early education, in which his father 
was the tutor, somewhat as follows: ‘‘Father had two 
methods of procedure. He first opened up a new topic 
to me by conversation, showing its nature, purpose, and 
results. In this way he incited my curiosity and interest. 
Then when the study-hour arrived he set me a definite 
task of whose mastery he thought me capable, and for- 
bade all recreation until it should be accomplished. 
Under the stimulus of this dual method I quickly ran 
through Latin, Greek, French, and German, and by the 
age of twelve I had mastered the mathematics taught in 
the high school. One day coming from Washington 
our train was delayed for several hours by a wreck ahead 
of us. By and by, Father remarked that this would be 
1Consult article in Pedagogical Seminary for December, 1912, p. 463.
-P-A-G-E-125
  
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS I13 
a good time to begin calculus. He then outlined its 
salient features, so that before the train went on I had 
a good general idea of the whole subject. My definite 
lessons in this branch began as soon as we reached home, 
and were continued rapidly until it was mastered.” 
It will be noted that in this system of tutorage the 
two ideas interest and rigor play an almost equal part. 
By the age of sixteen young Wiener had taken his A.B. 
degree at Harvard, done one year of graduate work there, 
and had entered Cornell as a second year graduate stu- 
dent in Philosophy. It is evident that no school system 
where large numbers are involved could have carried on 
this boy’s education so rapidly or so effectively. 
Next to the tutorial system, perhaps that of the Jesuits 
best succeeded in discovering and developing unusual 
talent, especially among the poor, from which class many 
members of the order were drawn. 
American democracy in the development of its school 
system has never consciously discriminated against 
unusually gifted children, neither has it ever had them 
very much in mind. The system has been administered 
for the average, the feeble being carried as a load, and 
the able considered as a relief from mediocrity. Of 
recent years, however, a distinct recognition of the needs 
and rights of the subnormal has become somewhat 
general, so that in practically all large systems provision 
has been made for them in special classes. The question 
I
-P-A-G-E-126
| 
  II4 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
is now being asked, “If we should make special provi- 
sion for the education of the subnormal, why should we 
not also for the supernormal?”’ Several answers to this 
question are heard, such as, ‘Ability can take care 
of itself;” ‘It would be undemocratic, and develop a 
class of prigs;” ‘It would be a detriment to the medi- 
ocre to take from them the stimulating touch of superior 
minds ;” “Precocity should not be encouraged ;’’ and 
the like. But these answers do not seem convincing, 
since the rights of the superior child are certainly as 
‘sacred’ as those of the inferior, and because social 
welfare is best promoted when the powers of each pupil 
are best developed. 
There are already indications that our public schools 
have this problem in mind, since promotion is made 
more frequent and more elastic than hitherto, and since 
various schemes of individual instruction are here and 
there undertaken. There is small evidence, however, 
that our schoolmen have distinctly formulated the 
problem of the truly supernormal as have Stern,! Ker- 
schensteiner, and other German writers. The latter 
think of the supernormal as composing one or two 
per cent of the school population, say twenty pupils 
of ten years of age per year in a great city like Berlin. 
Eliminating the so-called infant prodigy or unusually

RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS I15 
precocious from consideration, Stern thinks we should 
provide special opportunities for the selection and train- 
ing of highly gifted minds, under such conditions that 
diligence and rapid progress are demanded as conditions 
of continued membership in these classes. He recognizes 
both special and general ability. Thus some pupils 
may be able to do or learn one thing about as well as 
another; others are specially gifted in music, drawing, 
construction, mathematics, or language. Kerschensteiner 
tested some 50,000 of the children of Munich in drawing, 
and thereby discovered much talent, a part of which had 
not before been recognized. Similar tests might easily 
reveal other forms of special talent, which could then be 
provided for. 
Under whatever name classes for supernormal minds 
may be conducted in the public school system, it is evi- 
dent that such classes should be open to all who can 
qualify for them, and that hard work and high accom- 
plishment should be made conditions of remaining in 
them. We shall need to devise a set of tests both psy- 
chological and educational for supernormal ability. 
These tests for the possibility of development will com- 
bine observation, experiment and analysis of objective 
results in drawing, music, plastic work, technical con- 
structions, as well as in language, composition, mathe- 
matics, and science; they will take note of heredity, 
health, muscular coérdination, and the like. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    116 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
- Again, shall the aim of supernormal education be to 
save time in passing over a fixed course, or to extend and 
intensify knowledge during the normal school period ? 
It is easy to get the uncommon boy to perform the tasks 
of the common boy in much less time than the latter 
demands. A former principal of the Lawrenceville 
(N. J.) Academy declared that he could easily put his 
boys into college at fifteen, and so well prepared that 
they would be able to loaf half the time during the 
freshman year and yet meet all tests of scholarship. 
Principal Warren of the Albany (N. Y.) Academy 
declares likewise, that many of his boys are capable of 
passing the college examinations while still in knick- 
erbockers. | When boys of fifteen or under enter 
college, especially if they are below normal stature, 
they are often regarded as freaks, prodigies, ‘in- 
fant wonders,’ or even as ‘mascots’; in any event 
they are not regarded as normal college men, and are 
more or less debarred from participation in college life. 
This, of course, is a misfortune. 
By extending and intensifying the preparatory work, 
however, gifted boys may enter college with the physi- 
ological development of the normal freshman. There 
will then be no objection to their taking advanced stand- 
ing, or omitting portions of mathematics, language, or 
science already mastered. 
Finally, it may be said that biologically it is the golden
-P-A-G-E-129
  
RACE IMPROVEMENT : EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS I17 
mean, the normal in humanity, rather than the super- 
normal that is desirable and attainable. Now and then 
the race will produce a man of rare and splendid quality ; 
but he must not be treated as a demi-god whom no law 
can govern and from whom it is expected a new race of 
beings shall spring, for as he has small hope of posterity 
of his kind, so society can have no hope that his capri- 
cious power will promote. its development. What 
society may expect, however, is that these superlatively 
gifted individuals will become its Washingtons, its 
Lincolns, its Grants and Lees, its Edisons and Eliots, 
who will clarify its ideals, direct its economic and educa- 
tional forces, express its highest aspirations, and guide 
it safely through the perils that beset a developing 
civilization. 
II. Evrsenics 
The measure of euthenics is the development of desirable 
inherent characters; its means is the improvement of the 
environment. 
The Well-Being that comes of Good Environment 
If eugenics would suppress bad blood, euthenics would 
suppress bad environment. If eugenics would select 
and cherish superior natural qualities, euthenics would 
bring to their highest possible development those good 
qualities that nature gives in varying degrees to all her 
children; if eugenics would eliminate the undesirable 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
individual, euthenics would eliminate the conditions 
that debase him. 
Bad Conditions vs. Bad Blood 
The world desires to be rid of paupers, criminals, idiots, 
the feeble-minded, and the kindred hordes that burden 
society. This class costs the state of New York alone 
some twenty-four million dollars annually. New York 
now has a law providing for the sterilization of hope- 
lessly degenerate persons. The eugenist may conceive 
that if only all these undesirables were made incapable 
of reproduction the physical and mental regeneration 
of the world would be quickly accomplished. But 
reforms that seem easy are sure to prove hard. In 
this case, it is evident that unless the sources of misery 
are eliminated, new crops of degenerates are sure to 
spring up. 
The philosophy of Darwin and Spencer has made us 
familiar with the idea of the survival of the fittest, which 
sometimes carries with it the assumption that the fittest 
are also the best. If that is fittest that best fits its 
environment, then many things that from one point of 
view are the fittest, are at the same time from another 
standpoint not the best, but the worst. The San José 
scale fits its environment very snugly, but in the esti- 
mation of the horticulturist it is a pest. The same may 
be said of bacilli that cause disease, like those that
-P-A-G-E-131
RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS II9g 
underlie consumption, syphilis, diphtheria, smallpox, 
and yellow fever. 
From a purely biological standpoint, those persons 
may be both fittest and best who can most successfully 
withstand the attacks of these destructive microbes. 
A black man is more immune to yellow fever than a 
white man, but in intellectual, moral, economic, and 
political aspects, the white is usually the superior. 
It is conceivable that a race of whites might be developed 
in the tropics who would be as immune to the yellow fever 
microbe as the blacks are, but the cost in good men would 
certainly be excessive. It is better, therefore, to kill 
the microbe or the mosquito that plagues, than to pay 
the price of immunity to his assaults. In the same way, 
it might be thought that we could in time develop a 
race so strong as to defy tuberculosis, yet the cost would 
be great, while unless the conditions that propagate the 
germ were removed, its devastating work would continue. 
It is better therefore to eradicate the germ and to combat 
the conditions in which it thrives, than to permit it to 
ravage mankind in the hope that in time men will obtain 
complete immunity through the elimination of the un- 
desirable. Itis eternally true that “the weed-killer is at 
the same time a weed-producer ” ; thus, alcohol ever pro- 
duces new generations of drunkards, even though it tends 
to eliminate them; consumption makes more consump- 
tives. It is better to kill the mosquito than to allow the  
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
mosquito to kill the man, better to eradicate the hook- 
worm than to allow the pest to paralyze the energies of a 
people; in short, better to remove a bad environment 
than to try to breed men capable of defying it. While 
eugenics is doing its best, therefore, to vitalize the blood 
of man, euthenics must make eternal warfare upon the 
forces in the environment that tend to debase it. “If 
the one would eradicate the drunkard, the other must 
eliminate the drink.” Along with both must go a miti- 
gation of the economic and other miseries that cause 
men to continue in pain what they began in pleasure. 
It is the business of euthenics, therefore, to make an 
environment in which the best may also be the fittest. 
Nature as such asks no moral questions, but society 
must both ask and answer them. She must produce an 
environment in which worth, intellectual and moral 
as well as physical, may prevail and survive. This 
means that diseases controllable by the public shall 
not be allowed to ravage mankind, that the conditions 
of healthful and happy living shall be open to every 
human being; that as men are protected from the pests 
that attack the body, so shall they be protected, as in 
some of our Western states, from the plagues that rob 
them of their subsistence.!

The cogency of this argument is amply sustained by 
the investigations of social and economic reformers, 
as may be seen from the remarks that follow. 
Devine! in his investigation of the causes of misery 
in New York City, comes to the conclusion that they 
are more economic and public than moral and private, 
while his study leads to the conclusion that least of all 
are they due to heredity, even though it be conceded 
that many in the slums come of poor stock. 
Rowntree and Lasker ? took a census of all unemployed 
persons in the City of York, England (82,000 inhabi- 
tants) on June 7, t910. These they counted and classi- 
fied as follows: youths under 19, 129; men who had been 
regularly employed and were then seeking such employ- 
ment, 291; casual workers, 441; workers in the build- 
ing trades, 173; work-shy, 105; women and girls, 139. 
They conclude as follows with respect to character and 
by this means exceeded all the expenditures for public purposes. Now 
only representatives of approved stock and bond companies are allowed 
to do business in Kansas. The number of companies has dropped from 
one thousand to just forty-nine. Owners of bank stock are made re- 
sponsible for bank solvency on pain of imprisonment, so that there are 
no more bank failures in that state. Corporations may no longer 
exploit the people with immunity, violaters of the excise laws can no 
longer escape with fines, but must go to prison if convicted. The result 
of thus making it easy for virtue and hard for wrong to survive is that 
wealth accumulates rapidly and well-being is well-nigh universal.

efficiency: ‘We have seen that in the two principal 
classes of unemployed workers, namely, those seeking 
regular work and the casual workers, numbering all 
together 732, or 57.3 per cent of the whole, about half 
were men of good character and physique, while the 
others were more or less handicapped by some physical, 
mental, or moral defect. Of the unemployed lads, four- 
fifths had a bad start in life, and the majority of them 
were certainly below the average in ability and char- 
acter. In the building trades, on the other hand, the 
ability of the unemployed men was not markedly inferior, 
but we found that moral defects which did not actually 
lessen their value as workers were here less of a handicap 
than in the other trades. . . . But our figures show very 
clearly that it is quite a mistake to regard the problem 
of the unemployed as primarily one of the character 
and efficiency of the workers. On the contrary, improved 
morals and increased technical ability, important as 
they are, can never solve that problem unless they are 
associated with industrial and economic reforms.” 
Among the remedies proposed are: Training for youths ; 
Regulation of work of public bodies; Afforestation 
(planting of public forests); Decasualization of labor; 
Insurance; and Decentralization of town populations. 
These are all proposals for the improvement of workers. 
When one considers to what extent education may influ- 
ence character and economic efficiency, one concludes 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
       RACE IMPROVEMENT: EUGENICS AND EUTHENICS 
  123 
that the main reliance for progress is not so much im- 
proved heredity, however desirable that may be, as the 
improvement of that part of the environment which is 
under control. 
Patten has no difficulty in showing that many of the 
characteristics that early fixed themselves upon the 
Christian religion were due to the progressive steriliza- 
tion of Asia Minor through decreasing rainfall‘ In 
his ‘“‘New Basis of Civilization,” he shows that material 
resources, heredity itself, family life, social classes and 
social consciousness, amusements, character, and social 
control are all transformed through the influences of 
an improving environment. Practically all recent eco- 
nomic literature tells the same story. We have a new 
agriculture in which men find a place for the use of their 
minds, and a new horticulture, both of which tend to 
increase indefinitely the food supply for man. We have 
a new biology which gives us also a new hygiene, a new 
world of technology which multiplies many-fold our 
power of production, at the same time equalizing and 
rationalizing our means for enjoyment. These things, 
and many others like them, are all due to improvements of 
a controllable environment. 
Nature must indeed give us something to start with. 
All the laudable efforts in the world will not make an 
imbecile rational or a feeble-minded child strong-minded.

  124 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
But nature does for the most part give us all we need to 
start on. Saleeby tells us, as we have already seen, that 
nine-tenths of theinfants, even of the slums, are physically 
splendid little specimens of humanity.1 Nature renews 
herself in every generation, thus purifying the fount of 
life, and making it possible for man to rise step by step 
to higher planes of living. Our main duty, therefore, 
is to control what lies solely in our hands, doing what we 
can meantime to keep the sewers of humanity from empty- 
ing into its rivers. The eugenist has indeed no difficulty 
in showing that heredity is decidedly potent in feeble- 
mindedness, in epilepsy, tuberculosis, insanity, and 
certainly to some extent in criminality, and his argu- 
ment is sound when it maintains that parenthood should 
be regulated or else denied to those who are sure to 
beget miseries to their offspring, and new burdens to 
society; but repression is after all not the chief duty 
of society; it is rather the conservation and develop- 
ment of that uncontaminated infant humanity that 
renews itself in every generation. In new life there is 
always new hope.

CHAPTER VI 
    
                        A SOCIALIZED INDIVIDUAL IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED 
SOCIETY 
The measure of a socialized individual is his social 
efficiency, both in promoting and in utilizing the social 
groups of which he is a member; the means for socializing 
an individual is training in social disposition and in the 
social applications of knowledge. 
The measure of an individualized society or social group 
is the degree to which it fosters the complete development of 
the individual; the means for individualizing society or a 
social group is codperative effort in securing for each member 
the full benefit of codperations 
I. Fluctuating Views 
All social organization begins and ends with the 
individual. Historically, the relation of an individ- 
ual to any given social group is a fluctuating one. 
In a pain economy where there is a chronic condition 
of social deficit, the individual, especially among the 
lower classes, is more or less completely submerged in the 
social whole. His labor, his property, his personal 
service, even his life, belong to one or another of the 
social groups to which he belongs. He must work and . 
125 Ae

  126 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
fight for his overlord, he must obey his priest, he must 
think as his superiors think, claiming only the pittance 
that will hold body and soul together. Another picture 
is presented by the four hundred years of social and 
economic development in America. Under pioneer 
conditions with an abundance of free land just beyond 
the settlement, with not only the possibility, but in 
many cases the necessity, of independence and self- 
reliance in thought and action as requisites for survival, 
even the completely socialized immigrant from Europe 
was compelled to be his own man. But now America 
is talking and acting social domination and individual 
subordination. Even so clear-headed a writer as Bosan- 
quet? talks about the futility of a “self-absorbed per- 
sonality.” He holds that personal emotion, that 
most subjective aspect of individuality, is mean and 
insignificant if kept purely individual, but is 
maximized by being made social. {It is acknowledged” * 
that the finite nature of the world compels us to have 
separate bodies and minds, but our ‘foreignness’ is not 
considered fundamentally important. It is a mere 
difference of organization of a content that is at bottom 
social, or common to mankind, so that individual dis- 
tinctness, though having a physical basis of reality, is 
unimportant, since knowledge, thought, science, and, for

THE INDIVIDUAL AND HiS SOCIAL GROUPS 127 
the most part, feeling, have the universality that comes 
of truth or of sentiment whose origin and development 
are social. 
The reasons for this changing attitude away from 
the individuality of the pioneer to the sociality of the 
urban dweller lie close at hand. It is not social deficit 
that is now driving us together, but density of popula- 
tion, and the codperative spirit necessitated by economic 
organization. Capital is concentrated and employed 
under the control of corporate bodies, often of gigantic 
dimensions. In this way the machinery for wholesale 
production and distribution can be utilized to the 
utmost. Labor, on the other hand, is similarly organized 
into bodies of even more universal scope. The old 
conception of government limited its function to police 
or military protection; but now government is expected 
to secure the conditions of health for all, to develop new 
sources of wealth, to conserve natural resources, and 
even to perform common economic services that it has 
not hitherto attempted. The term Jeffersonian Democ- 
racy implies the pioneer individuality of our early his- 
tory, but now the term must be differently interpreted, 
if it is to have significance. 
Every generation must, in short, reinterpret the term 
individuality. Each race, each nation, must periodi- 
cally reconstruct its ideals of the relation of the indi- 
vidual to his social groups. The problem is eternal;
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
it is always in process of solution, yet never permanently 
solved. 
The time may come when the completely socialized 
individual will be the highest ideal which education can 
entertain and try to utilize. But though it may be 
conceded that our notions of individuality generated by 
a rich, extensive, and sparsely peopled continent need 
revision, yet it may also be contended with some show of 
reason that conditions do not yet compel us to accept a 
view of life in which the individual does everything for 
others and nothing for himself. 
A conception more in accord with the actual situation 
and with our inherited notions, is that as population 
and the means of production increase, the individual must 
more and more utilize social codperation as the best 
means for personal advancement; for, after all, as our 
feelings, our thoughts, our motives, and our moral char- 
acter, like the hand of Douglas,! must be our own, so 
our coéperative activities, however altruistic and social 
in form, must in the end have a personal reference and 
purpose, except perhaps as we simply squander what 
we have. This personal reference of social action is best 
seen in economic production and exchange. Each man 
1“My castles are my king’s alone

And never shall in friendly grasp

   THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SOCIAL GROUPS I29 
works for himself while producing for others. The 
farmer raises food for the public, but manufacturers 
produce clothing, tools, machines, household articles, 
and everything else enjoyed but not produced by the 
farmer, in return for what he furnishes to them. That 
money is the medium of exchange does not alter the 
fundamental relation. It is mere social sentimentality 
that pictures the producer of any article of utility or 
beauty as producing it from purely altruistic motives, as 
from charity. Self-help through codperation is a nobler 
conception than that of mere benevolence. 
It is indeed not difficult to get primitive reactions in 
the modern man, and as these reactions were once neces- 
sary to survival, and in consequence have become more 
or less reflex and instinctive, so they may still be expected, 
and they are indeed often an honor to manhood. Thus 
we shall still try to rescue the wounded, though we know 
it would have been better to prevent the battle; men 
will continue to perish in rescuing people entrapped in 
burning houses, even though it would be better if we had 
adequate fire escapes or fire-proof buildings. Men will 
still offer themselves as food for powder, even though pol- 
iticians incite the wars in which they themselves refuse 
to participate. We shall long try to mitigate the suffer- 
ings caused by intemperance, though we will notliftahand 
to prevent ruthless men and corporations from exploit- 
ing their fellows even to the extent of lessening or de- 
K

  130 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
stroying their economic efficiency and rendering their 
lives worthless. Jack London says that men will never 
to the end of time destroy the saloon, but that women 
will when they have the ballot. Self-effacing altruism 
may at times be a decoration of life, but it can never be 
its fundamental working principle. 
There are three important educational aspects of these 
social relationships : — 
(1) Socializing the Individual 
By this is meant, not the extinction of individuality 
in socialism, but the training of the individual in social 
disposition and social efficiency. Working alone, he is 
a pigmy ; working with others, he may be a giant, or at 
least help to get a giant’s work done. 
Irving King has brought together in his “‘ Social Aspects 
of Education” the social viewsand arguments of many of 
our best and most progressive writers in this and other 
countries, such as Dewey, Kerschensteiner, Ward, Cooley, 
Ray, Royce, Burnham, Mead, Scott, Reeder, and many 
others.! Among the topics discussed are the following : 
The social responsibility of the country school; the 
school as a centre of social life; playground extension as 
an element in the socializing of education; the social 
effects of the school garden, where children work together 
1 King, I., “Social Aspects of Education,” The Macmillan Co., New 
York.
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SOCIAL GROUPS 131 
for common ends; the social significance of vocational 
education, which fits a child for codperative capacity 
in the economic world; the opportunity that the school 
may give in the development of social impulses and in- 
stincts that have arisen from ages of human experience ; 
the expression of these impulses in self-government in 
school, the social atmosphere of the schoolroom in 
the pursuit of knowledge and in the formation of 
character. 
The result may be summarized in the following creed: © 
I believe that my own greatest good is to be won through 
codperation with others for those things that we all desire; 
therefore, whether I work or whether I play, I will join 
my efforts with theirs in groups that shall be small or 
large, transient or permanent, as convenience or custom or 
the accidents of the situation may determine; I will work 
for the public good in small things as in great, and to my 
fellow-men who contribute to my good I will be true and 
loyal even unto death. 
Hence the social group finds its genesis and con- 
tinued existence in the common efforts of socialized 
individuals. 
(2) Individualizing the Social Groups 
No social group is an end in itself to the extent that it 
may be allowed to forget or ignore the proportionate 
good of each of its members. My moral allegiance to
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
any group, political, religious, or economic, is cancelled, 
whenever it shall demand my allegiance, yet deny my 
claim to the common benefit that should arise from it; 
when, in short, it demands something for nothing. Men 
are prone to exploit their fellows by forming them into 
groups and then appropriating to themselves all the 
benefits of the organization. Thus, a codperative com- 
pany for gain may be so formed and so manipulated that 
the benefits of the common contributions may be appro- 
priated by a few. City bosses may, in the name of 
democracy, form an oligarchy in which the benefits 
that should accrue to all are corruptly seized by them- 
selves. 
The principle of advantage according to contribution 
must of course be recognized. The man who has one 
share in an enterprise properly expects only one-tenth 
the gain of the man who has contributed ten shares, 
but, because the latter owns ten shares, he is not 
justified in absorbing the gains that should accrue 
to nine other men holding one share each, even though 
ten shares can outvote nine. An organized group must 
have officers to conduct it. These men contribute a 
service which is paid for, sometimes in money, but often   
in honor. Members of school boards usually serve 
gratuitously, but officers of financial corporations, or of 
groups demanding much time, labor, or financial respon- 
sibility, usually receive salaries for their services. This
-P-A-G-E-145
     
THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SOCIAL GROUPS 133 
is right and proper, as every one knows, but it is easy 
for such leaders to assume that the organization exists 
for their sole benefit, and, taking advantage of the 
indifference, neglect, or helplessness of the other members, 
absorb not only what is justly due them, but everything 
in sight. Few small investors have escaped joining 
enterprises either fraudulent in inception or in the 
conduct of the business. The example of Kansas and 
her laws against the selling of insecure bonds and stocks, 
cited above, is a case in point. 
The young, therefore, need to hold others and them- 
selves to strict justice and accountability in the conduct 
of group enterprises both in and out of school — in their 
games, their athletic and literary societies, and in all 
other group enterprises, transient or relatively permanent, 
in which they may engage. The same principles should 
be observed and discussed in civics and history or in the 
study of any other phase of human institutions of past 
or contemporary interest. They should perceive that 
the stability of Anglo-Saxon government in general 
depends upon the recognition of the fact that benefit 
depends upon contribution, that privilege arises from 
responsibilities that are met, that rights arise from duties 
performed. 
Hence the social group finds its end, not in itself 
or its officers, but in the benefits it contributes to each 
of its members.
-P-A-G-E-146
    
134 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
(3) Group against Group 
In this country the question as to how completely 
the individual shall be socialized is largely academic, 
since it has little or no effect in deciding practical affairs ; 
but society is ready to punish by fine or imprisonment 
the dishonest leaders of organizations who appropriate 
to themselves the gains that really belong to the mem- 
bers. The burning questions of politics and economics, 
however, pertain to the collisions that arise when group 
meets group in a struggle for supremacy. It is natural 
that a corporation organized for gain should seek to 
avoid competition so far as possible, as through the 
possession of patents or secret processes, or by their 
superior manufacturing or selling ability, by the preven- 
tion of waste of material or labor, by the installation of 
the most modern machinery, or by superior initiative, 
insight, or foresight ; but when it seeks to remove compe- 
tition by violently destroying it through power immor- 
ally, even if not illegally, employed, then mankind has 
a right to protest. The claim that it is doing this for 
the benefit of the members of the corporation is not 
valid, for the corporation itself is engaged in an unjust 
exploitation of the other competing groups, and it may 
be of the public as a whole. Many are the ways in 
which business groups conspire to undermine the competi- 
tion of rival groups or exploit the general public. Pro-
-P-A-G-E-147
THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SOCIAL GROUPS 135 
ducers of implements and munitions of war often seek 
to embroil friendly nations, or to raise fictitious alarms, 
or to arouse race antagonisms, in order to increase 
the sale of their goods; manufacturers at times predict, 
or even produce, economic depressions in order to make 
it appear that their own special privileges are necessary 
for the public good. 
The discussion of these themes brings us to a recogni- 
tion that the new economic order differs from the old, 
and that in consequence a new type of problem arises, 
a problem which cannot be solved by the application of 
the moral maxims of the old order. These changes are in 
brief as follows: 1. A shifting from an individual to a 
collective basis in production and distribution. 2. A 
corresponding shifting from personal to corporate rela- 
tions. Men now work more exclusively in groups, and, 
because they do, we are forced to consider the action 
of group against group, rather than the relation of a 
given individual to a given group.! 
We have first of all the permanent conflict between the 
great group of producers and that of the consumers, in 
which each individual as a producer has relations to a 
relatively small group (his own business, trade, or pro- 
fession) and, as a consumer, to a much larger group or 
series of groups (those who consume the same things he 
1See Dewey and Tufts, “Ethics,” pp. 486-522, Henry Holt and Co., 
New York,
-P-A-G-E-148
    136 BASIC IDEALS FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
does). May a firm, trust, or corporation drive its com- 
petitors out of business by lowering the price to a point 
that will produce their bankruptcy? Or shall it raise 
the price to all consumers in order that its rivals may 
remain in business. 
Again, a labor union has a double set of conflicts, first, 
against employers, and, second, against the great class 
of non-union laborers. As unions, they tend to check 
production by raising wages and by shortening the 
number of hours of employment. These actions also 
increase the price of the articles produced, as may be 
plainly seen in the building trades in any community. 
A new question arises when we consider whether the 
unions shall be open to all, or to a selected class 
only, or whether the number of apprentices shall be 
limited. Again, may unions combine with capital to 
raise prices ? 
When it comes to the solving of these and similar 
problems, we are confronted by this difficulty: Men at 
first attempt to settle new questions by the rules of the 
old order. Human conservatism, as well as vested in- 
terests, makes legislation and the public sense of equity 
lag behind the progress of events and the changes of 
conditions. Most lawyers and perhaps most men still 
discuss labor unionism as an intruder into the old and 
presumably true order of individualism that existed 
before the industrial revolution. The lawyers think of
-P-A-G-E-149
     THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS SOCIAL GROUPS 
  137 
the old laws, the others of the old moral system. The 
old virtues related to the actions of individuals as such; 
the new virtues arise from actions in concert. 
Machinery and modern technique have enormously 
increased production, but they have also increased 
danger to life and health, and they have tended to relieve 
individuals from the responsibility for these and other 
evils. If the trade or the business or the factory de- 
vours men and beggars families, who shall be blamed? 
Since the old order no longer applies, and the new is not 
yet in effective operation, men are disposed to ascribe 
the evils to accident, necessity, or providence, and to let 
it go at that. 
How shall products jointly produced be distributed ? 
Men put in labor, skill, capital. Some of these elements 
are inherited from kin; some come from inventors and 
men of science who devised processes and machines; 
some are wrought out by the individuals themselves, 
either through native endowment or the training of the 
schools. This pooling of contributions is profitable, 
but how shall the profit be distributed? Shall there be 
tules? How devised ? 
New aspects of the same problems arise when we 
consider the wages of women and children. For if one 
employer pays them less than enough for a decent moral 
life, what about his competitor across the street who 
tries to do the fair thing? If one manufacturer is allowed

ee Q 
to practice “sweating,” all who do not practice it are 
placed at a disadvantage. If one group evades taxes, 
the groups that are forced to pay them cannot compete on 
even terms. If one corporation secures special legisla- 
tion, similar corporations without such advantages will 
suffer. If a corruptly obtained contract or franchise is 
enjoyed by one firm, all competing firms are so much 
the poorer. If one merchant permits himself or is per- 
mitted to adulterate his goods, not only does the con- 
sumer lose, but competing firms likewise. 
So long as individuals may hide behind corporations, 
but little can be done to amend or remove these deplor- 
able conditions; but as soon as responsibility is placed 
firmly upon the officers of an offending group, beginning 
at the top, and punishment for illegal, corrupt, or unfair 
methods is visited upon them personally, then the way 
is open to immediate and permanent reform. Society 
as a whole must through legislation fix responsibility 
and prescribe punishment, but the school can do much 
by inculcating principles of moral conduct in accordance 
with new conditions."

   CHAPTER I 
BASES FOR SELECTION 
1. How Selected in the Past 
The history of education shows that the secondary 
curricula of the past have been chosen chiefly with respect 
to three things, namely: (1) The status of the persons to 
be educated; (2) the ruling ideals of the time, nation or 
curriculum maker; (3) the range of suitable knowledge 
available. Applying these categories with respect to the 
Spartans; the Athenians; the Romans, as, for instance, 
in the time of Quintilian; the Italians in the early re- 
naissance; the Germans in the time of Sturm; the Eng- 
lish in their so-called public school system of secondary 
education for the sons of nobles and gentry since 1688; 
one can understand why they did what they did. In 
similar fashion one may apply these tests to the many 
reform systems that have been proposed. Thus, with Plato 
in his “ Republic” the ruling ideal is, Up to philosophy! 
The persons to be educated are those who remain after 
a long series of siftings; the material available for this 
stage and fundamental to philosophy consists of music, 
literature, grammar, rhetoric, and geometry. With Rous- 
seau in his “Emile” the ruling ideal is, Back to nature! 
141
-P-A-G-E-154
  
142 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Here the persons to be educated are the children of those 
who have been corrupted by society, i.e., the upper classes, 
and the material consists of suitable selections from the 
arts and sciences that neither corrupt nor have been cor- 
rupted. With Spencer in his “ Education” the ruling 
ideal is, On to science! Secondary education with him 
applies to all who have capacity, means, and ambition 
to avail themselves of its advantages. The material 
available and most suitable because most conducive 
to complete living is science; first natural, and then 
historical and social. 
Discussion: — Application of the foregoing tests in detail 
to the cases suggested. 
The three factors, social status, ideals, and mate- 
rials, will doubtless determine the curricula of the future 
as they have those of the past, while their great varia- 
bility will continue to give rise to differences of opinion 
as to the relative weight that should be given to this or 
that element of the problem. Even among the Athe- 
nians there was not unanimity of opinion concerning 
  the ends and means of education, for Aristotle in his 
“Politics” remarks, “In our times men contend about 
the purposes of youthful training; they are not united 
as to what our youth should learn, whether that which

is it decided whether one should work more for the

                BASES FOR SELECTION 143 
development of the intelligence or of character; the 
education of the day leaves the question in doubt 
and makes no decision as to whether one should favor 
what pertains to the demands of life or to the attain- 
ment of virtue or should favor studies even that extend 
beyond these ends. Each of these views has found 
advocates.” * 
The past is fairly united, as is the present, in the propo- 
sition that secondary education should be more general 
than special, that it should serve as the prolegomena for 
future study, laying a sure foundation of knowledge and 
skill for subsequent specialization. But no lesson is 
more certainly taught by the history of the educational 
past than the futility of trying to establish a single cur- 
riculum that shall be valid for all men at all times; for 
even when one of the three factors, as that of ideals, is 
subject to variation, there must arise the state of opinion 
described by Aristotle. When, however, ideals vary, and 
    the classes of persons to be educated include every sta- 
tion in life, and the suitable material available for study 
is indefinitely multiplied, this futility appears with three- 
fold force. 
            
       Discuss1on :— Compare the fixed curriculum of the English 
“public school,” as at Rugby, with the elastic curriculum of the 
    American city high school, showing how the three leading 
    factors vary in the two cases.

2. The Argument for Concentration in the Narrow Fixed 
Curriculum 
Wherever in the past the leading aim of education 
has been clearly defined and so important as to over- 
shadow all subsidiary aims, and when, moreover, a few 
studies have greatly outranked all others in their contri- 
bution to this aim, we find the fixed curriculum, which 
lasts until fundamental aims or conditions change. Ex- 
amples are found in the Spartan education; in that of 
Athens before the rise of philosophy; in scholastic edu- 
cation; among the Jesuits, whose curriculum remained 
essentially unaltered for two hundred years; in the Eng- 
lish public schools from the coming of William of Orange 
until the days of Thomas Arnold; also in many stages 
of humanism in other times and countries. As soon, 
however, as ideals or conditions so change that the valid- 
ity of the established curriculum is disputed, the advo- 
cates of the old are thrown on the defensive. For they 
are called upon to defend the system under which they 
have grown up and of whose beneficent effect they are 
absolutely certain. F 
The argument then runs as follows: This system has 
been tried and not found wanting; it was good enough 
for our fathers, and will prove equally valuable for our 
children. The proposed new system is revolutionary 
and will destroy our most cherished institutions, our   
-P-A-G-E-157
BASES FOR SELECTION 145 
educational heritage." When impelled to give more 
definite reasons why newer studies should not partially 
or wholly displace the old, the advocates of the established 
curriculum invariably urge the superiority of the old studies 
for the training of the mind. “ Behold the giant intellects 
of the past!” they exclaim. “This is the meat upon 
which they fed. Their faculties were thereby ade- 
quately developed. Faithful and efficient in these few 
things, they were made rulers over many things. Minds 
made strong by these studies, like muscles strengthened 
by a few exercises, are capable of doing any work that 
may be demanded of them; intellects thus made keen, 
like the well-sharpened knife, can cut anything; power 
thus generated can be applied in any department of life, 
as the electricity concentred in a storage battery can be 
made to yield motion, heat, or light.” Curiously enough, 
the advocates of new studies are at first disposed to admit 
the validity of the argument for formal intellectual train- 
ing, but to urge that what they propose will do the same 
thing, besides having the advantage of being better 
adapted to modern needs. This has been one of the 
grounds upon which the introduction of electives into the 
course of study has been defended.?

  146 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Thorndike quotes extensively from influential writers 
on psychology and on education to show the wide preva- 
lence of the idea of formal discipline as a settled educa- 
tional doctrine." 
It is only in recent years that the doctrine of the 
formal discipline of the mind has been seriously examined 
and its validity qualified or even denied. The first in 
Europe to do this were the followers of Herbart, on the 
ground that since all mental exercise takes its rise in a 
definite mental content, its character is necessarily de- 
termined by its origin, so that it would be absurd to as- 
sume that thinking power developed by the study of 
mathematics, for instance, would as such have any 
validity in that, say, of biology. Biological thinking to 
have any worth must spring from a biological content.’ 
The first study of the problem in the United States was 
made by the late B. A. Hinsdale, of Michigan University, 
in a paper read before the National Council of the National 
Educational Association at Asbury Park, N.J., 1894. 
After careful analysis of the doctrine as applied to sense 
apprehension, memory, imagination, logical thought, and 
volition, with abundant use of literary and _ historical

citations, the writer comes to the conclusion that mental 
power developed in any one field of thought cleaves to 
that content so far as its chief field of exercise is concerned, 
but that there is some overflow into congruent channels, 
just as exercise of the muscles of any part of the body, 
say of the right arm, probably strengthens somewhat the 
whole muscular system. All mental power is therefore 
more special than general, for it becomes general only in 
so far as other fields of thought are congruent, or related, 
to those out of which the power was developed. Hins- 
dale’s conclusions, derived from analysis and experience, 
. coincide substantially with those deduced by the Her- 
bartians from psychological premises. More recently 
the doctrine has been subjected to practical experiment, 
in order to show how far the training of any mental func- 
tion improves other mental functions. These experi- 
ments and investigations of a considerable number of 
psychologists are adequately described by Thorndike, 
and confirm the conclusions of Hinsdale and the German 
Herbartian writers." 
O’Shea has treated this topic at length in his “ Edu- 
cation as Adjustment,”? as has Bagley in his volume en- 
titled “The Educative Process.” * Both agree with the 
earlier criticisms of the doctrine. O’Shea ascribes the

“spread ” of special training to the fact that many lines 
of activity differing in several characteristics may yet 
have some characteristics in common; while Bagley 
proves by argument and experiment and appeal to ex- 
perience that there is no such thing as a generalized habit; 
that all habits are specific. He asserts, however, that we 
can develop through specific exercise in a single depart- 
ment of thought both in ourselves and in our students 
ideals of industry, neatness, accuracy, cogency, and the 
like, which may easily extend to other departments of 
thought, thus furnishing to this extent a formal training. 
The position of the present writer is that most if not 
all the effects hitherto ascribed to formal discipline are 
better explained by a careful analysis of relative edu- 
cational values as based upon the content of the studies 
themselves. 
Discussion: — Debatable points in the doctrine of formal 
discipline. 
3. Reliable Tests of Educational Values 
If the doctrine of formal discipline is inadequate 
to explain the unquestioned educational results that spring 
from a seemingly narrow curriculum, like that of language 
and mathematics, to what then shall we ascribe these 
results? How, in other words, shall we test the educa- 
tional worth of any given body of subject-matter? The 
answer to this question is already implied in the rejection
-P-A-G-E-161
  BASES FOR SELECTION 149 
- 
of the doctrine of formal discipline, for if the fact be 
established that all training cleaves to the content in 
which it originates, it follows immediately that in an 
analysis of content we shall find the worth of a subject, 
not only for practical life, but also for mental training. 
The doctrine of formal discipline must give way, therefore, 
to the doctrine of concrete specific discipline. If, then, 
we grant the superior character of the training in language 
and mathematics, we shall be obliged to assume a depth, 
breadth, and universality of content for these subjects 
such as the classicists themselves in their zeal for an easy 
but unsound explanation have not always claimed. That 
these subjects have this universality and richness of con- 
tent subsequent sections will attempt to show. 
Subsidiary claims to superiority based on temporary 
conditions, such as the ease with which a subject can be 
taught, or the superior quality of teaching that may at 
any time be manifest, have no lasting validity, for if a 
subject is hard to teach so as to secure good educational 
results, all we have to do is to learn to teach it properly. 
Natural science in the universities offers a brilliant illus- 
tration of how a subject can produce its legitimate men- 
tal and practical results when the spirit and technique of 
its teaching are developed and generally applied. So long 
as science was taught according to literary methods its 
educational inferiority was manifest; but when men dis- 
covered methods in harmony with its content and aims,
-P-A-G-E-162
  
150 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
then it took full rank alongside the older disciplines. 
Teachers are still striving to perfect their methods of 
teaching other new subjects, such as history, modern 
foreign languages and the mother tongue. The success 
that science has attained in the last forty years points 
to the possibility of an equal success in the new fields. 
Discussion: — Comparative validity of the doctrine of 
specific as opposed to formal discipline. 
An unqualified answer to the question, “ What 
knowledge is of most worth?” can hardly furnish a sat- 
isfactory course of study; for we must at once ask, to 
whom? for what purpose? under what conditions ? 
Herbert Spencer, shortly after the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, asked the question in his well-known 
book, “Education,” and gave the unqualified answer, 
“Science is of most worth.” However great the influ- 
ence of this book may have been, nobody has ever been 
able to construct a successful course of study in accord- 
ance with the answer given. As a special plea for a 
department of knowledge then coming into a highly 
developed state, but largely neglected by the school, 
Spencer’s contribution was most important, even epoch- 
making; but as an all-round guide to the selection of 
subject-matter for schools it could not in the nature of 
the case be satisfactory; for, on the one side it neglected 
or undervalued the institutional side of modern life,
-P-A-G-E-163
     BASES FOR SELECTION Ist 
while on the other it failed to distinguish sufficiently 
between the individual and the professional need of 
science. We need, for instance, good sanitation in our 
houses, but all men need not be plumbers; we need 
clean antiseptic treatment of wounds, but all men need 
not be surgeons; there is likewise professional and popu- 
lar need of chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy, etc. 
Much of Herbert Spencer’s plea for science pertains only 
to professional needs, and has, therefore, small applica- 
tion to the high-school curriculum. 
Discussion : — Grounds for Spencer’s criticism that literary 
education is merely for adornment. 
As in the past, so in the present, not a little con- 
fusion in the selection of studies arises from the attempt 
to compass in a single aim all the purposes of education. 
Modern education at least has aims, not aim. Even such 
elevated words as character, virtue, highest good, citizen- 
ship, holiness are at present inadequate guides for the 
making of the curriculum, for, on the one hand, they 
relegate to purely subsidiary rank many subjects of 
practical and educational value whose functions cannot 
be properly performed by more favored studies; and, on 
the other, they ignore or undervalue personal capacities 
and needs. The man who says culture is the end of 
secondary education will overvalue literary insight 
and undervalue practical efficiency; he who puts most

stress on intellectual acumen will have small patience 
with wsthetics; the advocate of specific utility will 
think more of special than of general education; the Her- 
bartian who lays all stress upon “the development of 
moral character” transforms such subjects as mathe- 
matics, science, and accessories like physical and manual 
training into mere tails to the literary and biblical kite. 
It is the fate of all one-sided conceptions of the purposes 
of education, first to reject all aims not immediately 
pertaining to the final one, and then either to have a nar- 
row fixed curriculum, or to admit into the curriculum 
subjects for whose presence the single aim gives no just 
warrant. Witness a judgment arising from the ethical 
aim of the middle ages: “Many learn for the sake 
of knowing, that is pitiful curiosity; others learn that 
they may be known, these are subject to the jibe of the 
satirist — your knowing is naught when no one else 
knows that you know it—that is idle vanity; others     learn to earn money and station, that is contemptible 
    commercialism; one learns in order to edify, and another 
to be edified, that is wisdom. Only the last two make 
no misuse of knowledge, for they seek learning in order 
      
      m1 
     
   
  to act rightly. 
   Discussion: — Modern attempts to formulate a single aim 
for education: ‘Complete living,” ‘‘Character,” etc. See 
Bagley, “The Educative Process,” pp. 40-65.

Gathering up the conclusions that follow from 
the foregoing facts and arguments, we find that reliable 
tests of educational values must consider the following 
presuppositions: — 
(1) A Hierarchy of Aims 
Study of the physical, mental, and social evolution of 
men shows that what we are disposed to regard as the 
lower aims of life are not mean, but only elementary. 
They have had and still have their part to play in the 
struggle for existence, and are only to be regarded as 
primitive because it is now so easy to supply these first 
requisites for survival. Let the water or food supply 
begin to fail in a community, or the fuel give out in winter, 
or the means of shelter be destroyed in a night, and we 
shall see how imperative these so-called “ mean ” motives 
of life will immediately become. Professor James’ has 
described the hierarchy of mes belonging to every human 
being, in each of which he must dwell and if possible de- 
velop. There is the physical me, with its hereditary ten- 
dencies and results, which lies at the basis of my success 
and well-being in life, and out of which I must make as 
much as possible. Then there is the economic me, the in- 
tellectual me, the social me, the spiritual me, each of which 
is subject to atrophy, or degeneration, on the one hand, 
but on the other, easily capable of normal growth and

refinement. The subject-matter of a well-selected curric- 
ulum will stimulate each of these potentialities of youth 
and provide nourishment for its healthy development. 
The maker of the course of study will not only recognize 
the presence of all these phases of existence, but will also 
provide for their simultaneous and adequate unfolding. 
(2) A Richness and Abundance of Material 
In the past, singleness of aim has been accompanied by 
relative poverty of material. The early Greeks had only 
their native literature, to which were added later geometry 
and philosophy. The schoolmen had for their advanced 
schools only the philosophy of the Greeks, and then con- 
fined themselves mostly to the dialectics. The early 
humanists wanted nothing more than the classic litera- 
ture of Rome, to which that of Greece was afterward 
added. Indeed one may say that until the nineteenth 
century, there was but little valuable material available 
outside of philosophy, classic literature, and elementary 
mathematics. But, as if answering to the modern need 
for educational development in every aspect of life, we 
find a corresponding richness of subject-matter. Even 
the old disciplines have been perfected and extended as 
instruments of education, while a host of new subjects 
present themselves. One has but to think of modern 
philology: and mathematics, of history, economics, and 
modern foreign languages, and above all of modern
-P-A-G-E-167
BASES FOR SELECTION 155 
natural science, to see how enormously the old curriculum 
has been extended and enriched. The formalist might 
regard this expansion of knowledge as of no educational 
significance, since his doctrine of formal discipline makes 
abundance and variety of material superfluous; but when 
in accordance with modern experiment and psychological 
analysis we accept the doctrine of specific discipline, then 
we see the necessity of a content as rich and varied as are 
the needs of men in modern life. 
(3) The Claim of all Classes of Society to Participation in 
Secondary Education 
Had not modern studies brought about a recognition 
of the hierarchy of mes, and with this the hierarchy of 
aims in education, and had not development of knowl- 
edge arisen from its internal forces, the coming of democ- 
racy even would have made both necessary. As the his- 
torian well knows, past singleness of aim and poverty 
of material have always been accompanied by narrow- 
ness of range in the social standing of those to be edu- 
cated, whether it be the landed aristocrat or noble, the 
priest, the dialectician, or the classical scholar. Modern 
democracy, however, is satisfied with nothing less than the 
opportunity for universal education, not only in the 
primary school, but also in the high school and university. 
Whoever, therefore, seeks to confine education to a single 
aim, or a single class of society, or to a narrow curriculum 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    156 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
adapted perhaps to such aim and class, can hardly be 
a successful architect for the high school of modern de- 
mocracy. But this extension of the benefits of education 
to all classes of the community brings with it the need 
of placing emphasis upon new aspects of capacity, inter- 
est, and destiny in the individual, and consequently the 
need of greatly extending and enriching subject-matter. 
(4) The Limited Amount of Time and Strength of the 
Student 
In European countries, especially in Germany, the desire 
to make secondary education not only thorough but broad 
has led to excessive demands upon physical and intellec- 
tual strength. The number of gymnasial students with 
defective eyesight,’ for example, is well-nigh appalling, 
to say nothing of other impairments of body and mind. 
It is necessary, therefore, for the modern schoolman to 
devise means whereby we may duly recognize the limits 
of time and strength, while providing for the legitimate 
demands of a democratic system in the midst of super- 
abundant material. 
The following chapters will endeavor (a) to group the 
various branches of study into departments according to 
the nature of the content; (6) to inquire particularly as 
to the specific educational functions of each department, 
as indicated by the nature of the content itself; and 
1 See H. Cohn, “Hygiene of the Eye,” Ch. VIII, pp. 63-69; also p. 77.

(c) to forecast the principles according to which a cur- 
riculum for a given purpose can be constructed. 
Discussion: — 1. Effects of modern evolutionary theory 
in determining the aims of education. 2. Twofold influence 
of democracy and the development of systems of knowledge in 
bringing about variety in schools and discipline. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
        CHAPTER II 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF STUDIES INTO 
SIGNIFICANT GROUPS 
Attempts have been made by such men as Comte, 
Spencer, and Bain to arrange departments of knowledge 
into a hierarchy of subjects beginning with the most 
elementary and closing with the most comprehensive. 
Thus Comte places biology at the bottom and sociology 
at the top. Yet so numerous and intricate are the inter- 
relations of the sciences, both natural and human, that 
each thinker finds it easy to criticise the arrangement 
of his predecessor, but hard to propose one not subject 
to like criticism. Life, for example, which is studied in 
biology, presupposes physical and chemical forces and an 
abiding place in which to develop. If, therefore, we 
follow the course of evolution, why should not the ante- 
cedent conditions be placed first? If in our search for 
that which is most fundamental we go back to final causes, 
we shall become involved in the intricacies of speculation, 
and perhaps decide with Anaxagoras‘ that in the begin- 
ning there were two factors, a chaos of matter interpene- 
trated with nous, or forming mind, when we may take our

THE CLASSIFICATION OF STUDIES 159 
choice as to which to place first, the awaiting material 
or the forming force. Neither could effect anything 
without the other. 
Arrangement of the branches of knowledge in a hier- 
archy being impracticable, we are at liberty to arrange 
them according to convenience of treatment. One might 
follow the order of their importance in education, but here 
differences of opinion would arise. Of one thing we may 
be fairly sure; namely, that knowledge has been gradually 
differentiated and broken up into specific subjects from 
convenience in treatment, and we are at liberty to assume 
that each subject, as geometry, physics, physiology, his- 
tory, etc., embodies a specific content that differs so 
essentially from that of every other subject that no two 
can be so successfully studied or developed together as 
they can be apart. It would appear, therefore, that 
since content is not only the source of educational value, 
but is also the ground of any natural and convenient clas- 
sification, we may accept the subjects of study as we find 
them, and proceed to group them in any way not incon- 
sistent with their fundamental nature. 
Discussion : —Historical attempts at a logical classification 
of knowledge. See Bain, ‘Logic: Deduction,” pp. 229-236. 
The broadest and most obvious distinction in the 
content of subject-matter of knowledge is that between 
(1) the facts and laws of physical nature, which, though
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  160 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
observed and formulated by the mind, are not dependent 
upon the mind for their existence or validity, and (2) the 
linguistic, literary, artistic, and institutional constructions 
that have their genesis in the thoughts, feelings, and 
volitions of human kind. The first group pertains to 
nature, the second to man; the first might be called the 
sciences (including of course mathematics), the second 
the humanities. Both have from the earliest times been 
in varying degrees the subject-matter of education. 
So intimate and so important, however, have the inter- 
actions between the purely natural and the purely human 
become that a convenient threefold grouping may be 
proposed, as follows: — 
1. Natural Sciences (including mathematics), or those 
that pertain solely to nature. 
2. Humanities, or those that pertain primarily to things 
purely human, such as language, esthetics, politics, 
ethics, religion, etc. 
3. Economic Sciences, or those in which the laws of nature 
are applied by human volition to produce the con- 
ditions for the well-being of individuals, the multi- 
plication of populations, and the further develop- 
ment both of natural sciences and all that pertains 
to man as such. To this group we may assign not 
only economics proper, but many technical branches 
arising from applied science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
    THE CLASSIFICATION OF STUDIES 161 
1. The Natural Sciences 
The physical world may be regarded (1) as rela- 
tively stable, yet under the constant influence, outwardly 
of mechanical, and inwardly of chemical, forces. Mechani- 
cal forces hold the whirling worlds in their grasp, effect 
the movement of winds and waters, the falling of bodies, 
the phenomena of light, heat, and electricity. Chemical 
forces are those that effect changes or secure equilibrium 
among the minute molecules that make up the compo- 
sition of bodies. The physical world may, on the other 
hand, be regarded (2) as in a state of growth, development, 
or evolution. Everything, even the sun, the stars, the 
planets, the nebule in the heavens, the world itself and 
all the plants and animals upon it, are now conceived as 
being still in a state of evolution, or at least as having 
reached their present stage through long ages of develop- 
ment. 
It has long been the custom to group together those 
sciences in which mechanical and chemical forces are pre- 
dominant as the exact sciences, since the laws that govern 
the domain of mechanics and chemics are in general 
capable of such demonstration as to leave no doubt con- 
cerning their truth and universal validity. Many of these 
laws involve quantitative measurements, and as such 
are seen to be mathematical. Mathematics is therefore 
rightly classed with this group; for however independently 
and abstractly its truths may be investigated, yet they 
M
-P-A-G-E-174
162 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
always find their application in the quantitative aspects 
of the physical world. 
A second group of natural sciences arises from the 
genetic aspect of the world; namely, those that pertain 
to life, or living things like plants and animals. These are 
the biological sciences, zodlogy, botany, physiology, em- 
bryology, etc. 
A third group, consisting of what are called the earth 
sciences (physical geography, geology, etc.),' arises from 
the mixed and complicated nature of its elements, for 
the earth has been and still is subject to mechanical 
evolutionary forces; it shows the results of past and 
present evolution in the nature of life; while many of its 
most striking phenomena (earthquakes, volcanoes, hot 
springs, etc.), are due to mechanical and chemical forces. 
According to this analysis the natural sciences of interest 
to the high school may be conveniently grouped as follows: 
Group I. The exact sciences: mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, astronomy. 
Group II. The biological sciences: zodlogy, botany, 
physiology (embryology, bacteriology, etc.). 
Group III. The earth sciences: physical geography, 
geology. 
2. The Humanities 
The sciences which owe their genesis and develop- 
ment to the mental and spiritual needs of individuals and
-P-A-G-E-175
    THE CLASSIFICATION OF STUDIES 163 
societies are numerous and important. Among them we 
find first of all, language, with its manifold departments; 
then history and art; then jurisprudence, political science, 
theology, psychology, logic, philosophy, sociology. All 
of these, though having more or less intimate relations 
to the material world, as everything mundane must have, 
are yet primarily the outgrowths of the psychic and social 
nature of men. Throughout the whole history of civili- 
zation they have furnished the chief materials of culture; 
it is upon their substance that the minds of men have 
been nourished; out of their treasures of knowledge the 
curriculums of the past have been constructed; in them 
the educational interests and hopes of mankind have 
centred. 
In language we have to distinguish between the content 
itself, as embodied in literature, and the technique of 
speech, as seen in grammar, rhetoric, etc. The moment 
we begin to analyze the content of literature, however, 
we perceive that the esthetic and the ethical are so deeply 
embedded in it and so inextricably interlaced that it is 
impracticable to try to separate them for purposes of

they may be distinguished, but should not be sundered. 
In like manner, it is only for purposes of estimating 
educational worth and determining relative emphasis in 
instruction that we may be permitted to separate the 
technique of speech, i.e, the grammar, rhetoric, etc.,

from its substance, i.e., the literature. Logically they may 
be separated, but didactically they belong together. 
Excluding those sciences whose province lies beyond 
the high-school period, we find history and the fine arts 
as the remaining subjects of this grand department of 
knowledge. 
The natural sciences have fallen into three convenient 
groups. Continuing the enumeration of groups by tak- 
ing up the humanities, we have the following result: — 
Group IV. Languages. 
1. Literature (content, esthetic and ethical) 
of ancient and modern languages, including 
the mother tongue. 
2. Linguistics, including grammar and rhet- 
oric. 
      Group V. Pure A’sthetics (the remaining fine arts), 
    music, drawing, painting, sculpture, archi- 
    tecture, etc. 
    Group VI. History, including civics.    
    
   
  3. Economic Science 
   The scientific study of economics as an application 
of other sciences both natural and human began with 
the appearance of Adam Smith’s “‘ Wealth of Nations ” in 
      
  1781. This new department of knowledge, practically 
    only a hundred and twenty-five years old, has won for

itself an enviable position in the universities of Europe 
and America as an essential part of a rational curriculum 
of study. It has, moreover, so many aspects applicable 
to secondary education that its classification in a sepa- 
rate group is advisable for purposes of clear analysis, 
even if it should not be thought to arise from logical 
necessity. 
In many high schools it is customary to enumerate 
elementary economics among the subjects of study, and 
thus to make it a component part of the curriculum. In 
other secondary schools economics furnishes rather a point 
of view for history, geography, and technical aspects of 
manual and commercial training. It becomes, therefore, 
not so much an applied science as a practical study aris- 
ing from the blending of the science of man with that of 
nature. This gives us our third grand division and our 
final group: — 
XY Group VII. Economics, including also commercial geog- 
raphy, and the technical aspects of com- 
mercial and manual training. 
Gathering the results of our classification together, 
we have the following schematic arrangement: — 
A. Natural Sciences 
Group I. The exact sciences, mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, astronomy.

     CHAPTER III 
FUNCTION AND RELATIVE EDUCATIONAL WORTH 
OF THE STUDIES AND STUDY GROUPS 
1. Fundamental Distinctions between the Natural 
Sciences and the Humanities 
Before entering upon a detailed analysis of the 
content and worth of the respective studies the student 
will do well to keep in mind the broad, fundamental edu- 
cational distinctions between these two grand divisions 
of knowledge, for only by so doing can he avoid the con- 
fusion incident to the treatment of details so numerous 
and interrelated. These distinctions fall naturally into 
three groups; namely, those that relate (1) to truth, 
(2) to beauty, (3) to goodness. 
In examining the character of the verities (that is, 
the facts, conceptions, and laws) contained in the two 
grand divisions, the first obvious difference that comes 
to view is that between causes and effects which are un- 
influenced by human attributes as in physics, chemistry, 
and biology, and those, on the other hand, in which sub- 
jective or psychological forces have had a part, as in lan- 
guage, history, and fine arts. The human is variable; 
natural law invariable. Whether we study the mechanical 
167 
    
-P-A-G-E-180
     
      168 | THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
or the biological causes ‘and effects of natural science, 
we concern ourselves only with efficient and unvarying 
causes, and the effects that necessarily follow from them 
without exception. Significant facts may be hard to 
separate and determine, conceptions may take centuries 
to form, and the knowledge of laws may be greatly de- 
layed (witness the efforts of scientists to discover the 
causes of dew), but once the facts have been clearly learned, 
the conceptions adequately formed and the laws demon- 
strated, then are there no exceptions, there is no room 
for uncertain intuitive apprehension. Natural laws must 
be accepted as valid and invariable, whether in the realm 
of mechanics or in that of physical life. Furthermore 
the laws of the physical world rise to the highest gen- 
eralizations, like those that pertain to gravitation, the 
indestructibility of matter, the persistence and transmuta- 
bility of force, and the correlation of forces. 
The result of so considering nature has been to place 
its forces in the service of men, to free their minds of a 
crushing weight of superstition arising from ignorance 
of its laws, and to reveal to them the physical conditions 
of healthful living. The mental effect of the study of 
natural law is to awaken and nourish enthusiasm for the 
true as such, to discard authority, and to trust only vigor 
of reasoning in searching for natural laws, and to believe 
in their unassailable validity when once discovered and ade- 
quately tested. These are valuable results, for great has
-P-A-G-E-181
      THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES 169 
been the weight of woe suffered by mankind because their 
coming has been so long delayed. Let us call to witness 
the baseless terrors arising from erroneous belief regarding 
natural causes, the needless famines, diseases, and devas- 
tating pestilences that have afflicted mankind, and then 
the more lamentable perversion of noble human qualities 
themselves through blind adherence to authority, or by 
the injection into human affairs of the devils generated 
by ignorance of natural law, as in witchcraft or in the 
Spanish inquisition, thus poisoning the mind with the 
ptomaines of its own diseased thinking. Modern natural 
science has moreover diminished pessimism in the world, 
in that on the one hand the doctrine of evolution has 
given hope to those who had it not, since it shows how the 
world of man as well as that of physical nature has risen 
and will still rise in the scale of being through the growth 
engendered by inward force and outward circumstance; 
while on the other it furnishes an ever growing expansion 
of the material necessities for higher standards of life for 
even greater populations. The educational importance 
both to the individual and to society of forming such a 
view of the world and of mastering the means for its realiza- 
tion can hardly be overestimated. Once men thought the 
only fountain of youth and hope springs from the art and 
literature of the Greeks, now they know that there is an- 
other no less quickening that flows from the science of 
the moderns.

      170 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Turning now to an examination of causes and effects 
in the humanities, we find an element of uncertainty, 
of contingency, due to the admixture of a subjective 
element. Buckle in his “ History of Civilization ”’ failed 
to prove his thesis, that historical effects spring alone 
from physical causes, and that consequently history is 
only a branch of natural science. He helped, however, 
to correct the equally one-sided view of Hegel in his 
> that historical effects are “ Philosophy of History,’ 
purely subjective, though hardly capricious, since they 
spring from the inner nature of man. If history is not 
natural science, neither is it psychology. 
How, asks Helmholtz,! in his lecture on the relation of 
the natural sciences to the whole of science, will an am- 
bitious man act? Can we predict with the certainty of 
natural law? Is there not room for caprice, for free 
volition, for varying mood? Are not the laws of ambi- 
tion, if there be such, subject to exceptions that cannot 
with certainty be foretold ? 
Even where there are laws of human action that ap- 
proach in certainty to those of physical nature, their 
discovery is of such extraordinary difficulty, that there is 
always room for the introduction of surmise and authority. 
When we find it difficult to establish a law, we are disposed 
to trust the man who says he knows what it is. Of this 
at least we may be sure; namely, that nowhere in human 
1“Populare Vortrige,” Vol. I.
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES 171 
affairs do we find the reign of mathematical law as in 
physics; no proposition in literature, art, or history, 
however true it may chance to be, appeals to us with the 
certainty that attaches to a law of algebra or geometry 
when once it is understood. Generalizations in literature, 
art, and history are attained by a species of reasoning 
that Helmholtz calls artistic induction, and are frequently 
favored by many a happy, lightning-like inspiration, or 
lucky insight. This is often found in history and litera- 
ture, and is essential in all true art. “It is an essential 
part of artistic talent to be able to reflect the outer char- 
acteristics of a subject through word, form, and color, and 
to conceive by a kind of instinctive apprehension how the 
mental status must develop, without being guided therein 
by any fixed rule. On the contrary, when we notice that 
an artist has consciously worked according to fixed laws 
and abstractions, we pronounce his work poor and trivial 
and our admiration is at an end. The natural sciences 
are able to express their inductions in sharply defined rules 
and laws, whereas the sciences that deal with man have 
for the most part to do with reasoning that is guided by a 
psychological feeling of tact.” * 
It is in the department of grammar that we approach 
nearest to the strict logical reasoning of natural science. 
There is a substratum of logical nature in subject, verb, 
and attribute, and in their respective modifiers and con- 
1 Helmholtz, “ Vortrage,” I, pp. 15-16.
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
nectives. But the concrete grammar of any tdngue has 
to do with the language as it has developed without any 
conscious logical direction. Speech is therefore full of 
idioms that refuse to be parsed, while practically all rules 
of syntax are violated by numerous exceptions. 
This introduction of psychic forces in the shaping of the 
life of man has, however, great educational advantages. 
Evolution, for example, is no longer animal in character, 
wherein every individual is the enemy of every other as 
soon as there is competition for the means of survival; 
but it is human and hence codperative. It admits of 
benevolence and mutual helpfulness; it enables men to 
set the forces of nature to work to feed, clothe, shelter, 
educate, comfort, inspire, and protect all; it impels them 
to form themselves into groups, large and small, perma- 
nent and temporary, that they may secure in institutional 
form every advance made by individual or community. 
Furthermore, the nature of the humanities impels men 
to pass beyond efficient or practical causes, and to search 
for final or ultimate causes. They try to discover not 
only mechanical causes and effects, but also the ends 
which mechanical causes serve. In other words, the 
humanities show not only what must be, but also what 
ought to be. They define the laws that should govern 
conduct; they nourish alike the rational and the spiritual 
powers of men; they help explain and perfect institutions, 
thereby increasing social happiness and well-being, and 
\
-P-A-G-E-185
    THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES 173 
equipping the youth with a wholly human and beneficent 
view of the world. 
Yet, notwithstanding this striking difference between 
the natural sciences and the humanities in their attitude 
toward final causes, it would be an error to overlook the 
fact that in the biological sciences especially the concep- 
tion of natural forces working to an end, which if uncon- 
scious and non-moral, is still teleological in the sense of 
a final cause, forms a working basis for many modern 
men of science. To be sure, no real scientist can accept 
the old notions of external teleology, in which the observer 
thought he saw in organisms as now adjusted an evidence 
of divine architecture which according to a preconceived 
plan fitted each organ for its perfect work, and possibly 
the whole creature for the needs of men. This view must 
now be rejected, since the scientist knows that organs 
have become what they are through development, through 
long ages of adaptation to ever changing environments; 
and he is convinced, moreover, that this generally upward 
striving in the battle for existence has necessarily been 
for the sake of the animal itself, and not for the sake of 
some other creature, say man, who would like to devour 
it, or use it for purposes of his own. 
The rejection of this external teleology, however, does 
not exclude the possibility of one more rational, deep- 
lying, and inherent to the nature of the living thing itself. 
Everywhere we see plants and animals transforming the
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
raw material of nature found in earth and air and shaping 
it into new forms in accordance with some indwelling 
force, ideal, or plan.t Plant an acorn anywhere in the 
world, and it will strive to become an oak tree, noble and 
generous where the conditions are favorable to its growth, 
and dwarfed where they are unfavorable, — but in essen- 
tial plan an oak tree always. Here then in this conception 
of nature we have a link that unites mechanical and final 
causes, and an easy transition from the unconscious 
aim-accordant forces of nature to the conscious moral 
aims of human kind. The student of the history of philos- 
ophy does not need to be told how vital this Zweckbegriff 
was to the thinking of the ancients. A paragraph from 
Willmann’s “ Didaktik” sets the whole matter in a clear 
light: “The inner nerve which unites the moral and the 
natural sciences is the Zweckbegriff (i.e., the notion of inner 
forces working according to immanent purposes). This 
nerve modern research has — let us not say severed, but 
greatly neglected and permitted to lose in guiding power. 
The idea of end or aim was a metaphysical principle with 
ancient idealism, the good being considered as the final 
cause, not only of effort, but also of that which occurred; 
with this view, thought was antecedent to the material 
world, reason came before nature, the complete before the 
incomplete, freedom before necessity. Francis Bacon 
attacked this view and, with a brilliant turn, compared 
1 See Baldwin’s article, ‘‘ Teleology,”’ in “‘ Johnson’s Cyclopedia.”
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMANITIES 175 
final causes to vestal virgins — worthy of reverence, but 
unfruitful. Modern research has adopted this view, and 
has made the mechanical displace the older organic con- 
ception of nature. By so doing it has achieved extraor- 
dinary results in the individual sciences, but it has at the 
same time isolated itself from the moral sciences and made 
itself a stranger to an ideal conception of things. Partial 
truth, however fruitful, comes to this :— practical appli- 
cability at the expense of the whole truth is too dearly 
bought: vestal virgins, though unfruitful, were still not 
useless; they preserved the sacred fire and their virtue 
dignified and consecrated their whole sex.” 
Discussion: — Old and new conceptions of ¢eleology and 
their present validity. 
What esthetic differences are there between these 
two departments of knowledge? It is true in a sense that 
natural science has nothing whatever to do with esthetics, 
for its purpose is to discover or interpret fact, to establish 
laws, and to trace their effects. Yet we know that it is 
difficult for an astronomer not to be a poet, so powerfully 
do the beauty and majesty of the heavens impress him; 
there is a species of beauty in mathematical demonstra- 
tions, and indeed one may say an esthetic quality both 
in physical law and in the adjustment of form to function 
everywhere seen in life whenever we contemplate them 
from the standpoint of their ideal value. But when all
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
legitimate claims have been allowed, it must be evident 
that esthetics in natural science is so much a subordinate 
consideration that with many men of science it may be 
entirely dissociated from their scientific investigations. 
Much of our sense of the beautiful is indeed associated 
with things of nature, such as flowers, birds, human 
forms, falling rivers, and flaming volcanoes, but the 
esthetic appreciation directly awakened by contempla- 
tion of nature is not a part of science. 
Those departments of the humanities, however, that 
belong to what we call art, such as poetry, music, drawing, 
painting, design, etc., are distinctly esthetic, for art has 
not only a sense medium, as seen in word, form, tone, color, 
and material, but it has also an elevating indwelling 
ideal, now showing the perfect balance of spirit and body, 
as in Greek statuary, now the volitions or impulses of 
mankind. Art reveals to man both the beauties of nature 
and the treasures of the human spirit; it is inspired not 
alone by the cold glory of the snowflake, but also by the 
glowing feelings or the inspiring conceptions of moral and 
spiritual beings. It is consequently both the source and 
the expression of the highest human esthetic attributes. 
We must not conclude, however, that because these 
differences between natural sciences and the art division 
of the humanities exist, we ought therefore choose the 
one and reject the other; for difference of kind is only 
difference, not the mark of inferiority or superiority.
-P-A-G-E-189

Discussion :—1. Compare the esthetics of mathematics with 
that of literature; 2. that of astronomy with that of sculpture. 
Finally, how do the humanities compare with the 
natural sciences in the domain which we call the good ? 
Here we must first distinguish between subjects which 
by analogy may merely suggest goodness, and those which 
directly reveal it, since they have to do with the motives 
and volitions of men. The natural sciences belong to the 
first class, for the will of man has no part in the causes 
and effects of the physical world. Study of these forces, 
however, may elevate the mind and in a way point to a 
power that transcends them. 
Yet when we carefully examine the content of natural 
science, we find, not good in the moral sense, but only 
necessity, the inevitable results of irrevocable law. In the 
world of life we have biological development, which favors 
the strong, but crushes the weak. It is the struggle for 
existence, the survival of the fittest, the upward progress 
of the whole through plant and animal evolution that 
knows no moral motive, no good-will, no mutual helpful- 
ness in the human sense of the term. 
In itself alone, a recognition of the unchanging laws 
of nature simply helps to make men prudent. The case 
is quite different when we come to literature, art, and his- 
tory. These have to do with the ideals and conduct of 
men, and have the power, therefore, of revealing motive 
and volition. In this sense these subjects have a moral 
N
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
content that the natural sciences lack. As above ex- 
plained, they displace animal by human evolution in con- 
scious effort, in which codperation and mutual helpful- 
ness take the place of a deadly unconscious struggle for 
existence. In these subjects we have a revelation posi- 
tive or negative of good-will, benevolence, sympathy, 
love. Through them we learn the true form of institu- 
tional life as seen in group codperation. Evil is here 
recognized as degeneration and departure from the forms 
of social well-being. Through the humanities we get our 
moral view of the world, our attitude toward our fellows; 
from them we draw our ideals and impulses for social life. 
If then the natural sciences make men prudent, the hu- 
manities give them moral insight, ideals, and inspirations. 
Discussion: —1. Basis for the claim that the sciences 
stand on a par with the humanities in their influence upon the 
development of character. 2. What differences are discernible ? 
2. Detailed Study of Educational Values 
We may now pass from this general inquiry to a special 
investigation of the educational function of the various 
study groups, and, as far as practicable, of the separate 
subjects within the groups. This function, as already 
indicated, can be adequately determined only by. an 
analysis of content; not by any vague theory of a mystical 
‘indefinable somewhat’ that may be conceived as emanat- 
ing from them.

  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF MATHEMATICS 179 
A. THe Natura ScIENCES 
GROUP I. THE EXACT SCIENCES 
(1) Mathematics 
When we speak of mathematics in the high school 
we mean primarily algebra, geometry, and plane trigo- 
nometry. What important specific contributions are 
these subjects calculated to furnish in the education of 
youth? Why, even in the days of antiquity, was mathe- 
matics so highly esteemed as a discipline for the young ? 
The reason is not far to seek, for the world is so constituted 
that it cannot be apprehended without some means 
for discovering and measuring its quantitative relations. 
In the early days of reflection, when men began to search 
for bottom principles in the constitution of things, it 
was inevitable that they should come to the ideas of num- 
ber and form as necessary to the very existence of the 
world, for whatever fills space and time must be subject 
to geometrical and numerical laws; hence the saying of 
the Pythagoreans: “ What is the wisest? Number. 
And what next? Man, who gave names to things.” 
Mathematics and language, then, are the two fundamentals 
in the world, and presumably also in education. 
But what, we must ask, is the educational function of 
this quantitative study? In what does its peculiar es- 
sence consist? Aristotle’ himself asked why a youth 
1“ Ethics,” Ch. VI, p. 9.
-P-A-G-E-192
180 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
may become a mathematician, but hardly a scientist, 
and gave this reason: Mathematics rests upon insight into 
principles which appeal to the mind as unconditionally 
and necessarily valid as soon as they are understood; 
but science presupposes experience also, 7.¢., observation, 
experiment, hypothesis, verification, theory. The possibil- 
ity of progressive insight into mathematical truths comes 
early, but ripened experience and the possibility of con- 
structing a science from it come late. 
From this unconditional and necessary validity of 
mathematics there arise a number of advantages not found 
in equal degree in any other subject. 
Here in the first place is knowledge of whose certitude 
there can be no question, which is not subject to the caprice, 
opinion, or volition of men. Here there is no authority 
but that of the truth itself. Certainly in the realm of 
mathematics the favorite aphorism of Lucretia Mott 
holds with unquestioned force, “ Truth for authority; not 
authority for truth.” Mathematics has to do, not with 
memorized and transmitted traditions, or with supersti- 
tions and beliefs hoary with age, it may be, but with a 
system of demonstrable propositions developing from a few 
self-evident truths that appeal to the understanding with 
a directness and convincing certainty found nowhere else. 
Discussion: —Is training in an exact science the best 
preparation for the pursuit of an inexact one? 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
    
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF MATHEMATICS 181 
Next after certitude in educational importance we 
may perhaps reckon the progressive nature of algebra and 
geometry, indeed of mathematics as a whole. Starting 
from the most elementary stages of mathematical in- 
sight, each of these subjects, the one in the realm of time, 
the other in that of space, proceeds in unbroken order 
to ever higher generalizations, which assume manifold 
relations to each other, and which in turn lay the founda- 
tions for still further advancement. There is consequently 
a never ending series of definitions, principles, combina- 
tions, and demonstrations that reward the mind for its 
past efforts and stimulate it to ever renewed exertions. 
The following quotation from Bernhardi shows in vivid 
manner the progressive character of the science: ‘Mathe- 
matics as a system consists of sharply defined members, 
which, however, have the most intimate connection; these 
members rise in an ascending series, and in their upward 
progress give rise to more and more intricate and difficult 
combinations, like concentric rings starting from one and 
the same central point; yet with this difference, the in- 
dividual members appeal to the same qualities of mind, 
and each proposition is a whole in itself, yet also a repre- 
sentative of the entire science. This construction of 
mathematics makes each member a separate end for effort 
and gives the mind, when once this end has been reached, 
the feeling of accomplishment, and yet at the same time 
because of the strict connection of parts, one of longing,
-P-A-G-E-194
182 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
the wish to advance. The conditions of progress are 
most easily secured by following this progressive, up- 
ward movement, and the mental powers gain in breadth 
by progress through the homogeneous parts of the science, 
being at the same time stimulated to greater depth.” ? 
Mathematics has been highly esteemed as a pro- 
pedeutic for other subjects, for whatever needs to be 
measured or quantitatively determined must rely upon 
the respective departments of this science. It not un- 
frequently happens that some phase of mathematics is 
overvalued, thus leading to sterility of result in the depart- 
ment concerned or to indifference on the part of the 
learner. The most noted instance of this overvaluation 
relates to the function of mathematics as an exercise in 
formal logic. In discussing mathematics and physics 
in secondary education, Schellbach remarks: ‘“ Among 
the educated classes we meet everywhere the error that 
mathematics is chiefly useful in education as applied 
logic, even if it is limited toa minimum of content. This 
error finds its explanation in a number of circumstances, 
of which two are of especial importance; first, in the com- 
mon ignorance of the manifoldness of mental processes, 
methods, and ideas involved in secondary mathematics, 
and, second, in the erroneous conception of the notion of 
formal discipline, which does not perceive that form and 
content are inseparably united.” In this connection 
1 Compare Willmann, “Didaktik,” Vol. II, pp. 132-133. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
     
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF MATHEMATICS 183 
Frederick Meyer says, “ Were the mere logical side of 
this subject sharply and repeatedly brought to the front, 
it is probable that the interest of bright minds in mathe- 
matics would soon be extinguished.” Yet, it would be 
unwisdom to overlook the influence that the logical 
vigor, say of geometry, has upon the plastic mind of youth. 
Thus, it is related of Abraham Lincoln when as a young 
man he first read the plane geometry of Euclid that he 
exclaimed, “Now I know what an argument is; now I 
understand when a proposition is proved.” 
It is when we examine the relation of mathematics to 
science, both pure and applied, that we see most forcibly 
its indispensability as a propadeutic. Astronomy was 
once studied almost exclusively as a mathematical science, 
as in the days of Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton, and still 
has its mathematical side. So dependent is any precise 
and advanced study of physics upon mathematics that 
it is to be reckoned at once as a mathematical science, 
though, as will be seen later, physics has important aspects 
of educational worth not found in mathematics. With 
chemistry the dependence upon mathematics is much less, 
though here we have the laws of constant relations, 
multiple proportions, chemical formulas and equations. 
In history we have chronology; in sociology, statistics; 
in esthetics, laws of proportion and of sound; and in 
psychophysics, quantitative measurements of stimulus 
and response. High-school algebra and geometry and
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
trigonometry supply in large measure the quantitative 
laws which are applied in architecture, sculpture, engi- 
neering, military science, and navigation. It is through 
well-selected problems for solution that the student is 
made fully conscious of the intimate dependence of many 
pure and applied sciences upon the mathematics even of 
the high school; and this consciousness of practical worth 
often outweighs with the youth all the mental values of 
which he may hear, but of which he has no adequate con- 
ception. 
Discussion: — If the value of mathematics as applied logic 
is small, and the student is to pursue none of the sciences men- 
tioned, what is the educational justification of requiring him 
to master algebra, geometry, and trigonometry ? 
It is highly desirable that teachers and parents, 
especially, should have a clear apprehension of the mental 
traits that are specifically cultivated by a study of mathe- 
matics. From the foregoing analysis of content we can 
easily comprehend that this subject is preéminent in its 
power to train the mind in form and number to exact and 
progressive thinking, to adequacy of conception and pre- 
cision of expression, to energy of attention, to clearness of 
inner vision, to perception of necessary truths, and to the 
habit of seeking in its proper realm, not the conjectural, 
but the certain, for there is no “ of course” in mathematics, 
since even the self-evident must be proved. If in behalf

of language Hegel could say, “ He who knows not the 
Ancients has lived without knowing what beauty is,” 
so Schellbach can reply, “ He who has not known mathe- 
matics and its results in natural science has died without 
mL knowing what truth is. Mathematics, moreover, helps 
to quicken the scientific conscience by making the student 
unsatisfied with inaccurate and inadequate knowledge, and 
with expression that lacks precision or apprehension that 
does not arrive at full comprehension. It thus becomes 
a school of scientific thinking, terminology, and expression. 
Discusston: — To what extent is the confidence begotten 
by successful study of mathematics useful in non-mathematical 
departments of life ? 
Another mental aspect of the educational value of 
mathematics is the training it gives in the constructive 
imagination, for there is everywhere in mathematics a 
demand for the exercise of free creative power, whether in 
the solution of problems, in geometrical constructions, 
in the formation of equations, or the discovery of principles 
and proofs. “The feeling of elation that accompanies this 
creative activity produces the future mathematician.” 
Jacob Steiner can exclaim, “ We too are poets!” and 
Emil Lampe in his speech at the celebration of the Kaiser’s 
birthday at Berlin in 1893 says, ‘‘ In the development of 
new theories the mathematician needs as keen a creative 
1 Baumeister, “Handbuch,” Vol. IV, p. 23.
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
imagination as does the creative artist.” Notwith- 
standing the truth that underlies these claims, it would be 
the height of educational unwisdom to confound the 
mathematical with the poetic exercise of the imagination, 
and to concludethat the one is the equivalent of the other ; 
for, though both may be designated “ imagination,” they 
are as far apart as are the thoughts from which they spring 
and to which they cleave. The one is illuminated by the 
electric light of insight, the other is made to glow with the 
heat of feeling. 
Mathematics stands first among the subjects of the 
high-school curriculum in the magnitude of its demand 
upon the ‘logical,’ or ‘rational,’ and the smallness of its 
demand upon the ‘mechanical’ memory. This again 
arises from the nature of its contents. Without insight 
no mechanical memorizing is valuable in this department 
of knowledge, and with it little is necessary. Every 
* teacher of geometry, for instance, knows that the student 
is lost who tries to make good his lack of insight into the 
logical steps of a demonstration by his diligence in mem- 
orizing the demonstration as it stands in the book. 
The foregoing sketch gives an outline of the educa- 
tional worth of mathematics as based upon the nature of 
its contents, but an exposition of its limitations which are 
as striking as its advantages, and its comparative value can 
be undertaken only in connection with the subjects still to 
be discussed.

Discussion: — Importance in the education (a) of boys, 
(0) of girls, of the following elements in mathematics: 1. certi- 
tude; 2. progress in complexity and abstractness; 3. pro- 
pedeutic for pure and applied science; 4. training in imagi- 
nation and memory. 
(2) Physics 
Physics as a subject for high-school instruction has 
a double advantage, in that it is both mathematical and 
experimental. In so far as it is mathematical, it furnishes 
a concrete field for the application of the generalizations of 
algebra and geometry, and consequently shares with these 
subjects their apodictic certainty and their freedom from 
human bias. As an experimental science it has a great 
advantage in the fact that the observations made in the 
experiments must be vitalized with thought in order to 
be effective. There is in physics no mere staring at 
phenomena with whose appearance the observer has 
nothing to do, but on the contrary the things to be observed 
are produced by the student himself through the experi- 
ments he makes. Should the first observation not be 
conclusive, the experiment may be repeated until the 
student is satisfied that he has not only seen but understood. 
This form of observation offers an exceptionally fine field 
for self-activity of an educative nature, a field which is 
continually broadened by the ever increasing laboratory 
facilities that are being provided in public and private 
high schools.
-P-A-G-E-200
  
188 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Discussion : — Compare observation in physics with obser- 
vation in biology. See Section 50. 
Starting with the twofold basis of mathematics 
and observation of experimentally produced phenomena, 
it can be seen that physics is capable of performing impor- 
tant educational functions, a few of which may be briefly 
noted: — 
(1) It awakens anew that fresh, spontaneous interest of 
childhood in the events of the physical world: which the 
schools have unfortunately put to sleep, for it has the most 
striking connection with the material progress of the 
world; as, for example, the manifold and amazing results 
in the realm of electricity, —the telegraph, telephone, 
telautograph, wireless telegraphy; also the many forms 
and uses of steam, gas, water and electric motors; 
microscopes, telescopes, spectroscopes (spectrum analysis), 
and other instruments, and then such modern wonders 
as liquid air, X-rays, radium, etc. Not the least 
advantage in thus reawakening the speculative interest 
in natural phenomena, is the fact that the rapid develop- 
ment of physics is constantly producing new wonders to 
stimulate and strengthen this interest. 
(2) Physics enables thestudent to lay the foundationand 
to build the superstructure of his knowledge of the facts 
and laws of the mechanical world through mathematical 
insight and thought-saturated observation. Just as 
geometry may be developed from a few self-evident
-P-A-G-E-201
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF PHYSICS 189 
propositions, or axioms, so physics may start with facts | 
lying within the immediate experience of the student, and 
enable him, step by step, to construct for himself through 
his own experiments and thinking a body of knowledge 
that is free from the uncertainties of opinion and authority. 
Here there need be no ballast of historical data, dogmas, 
doctrines, or exceptions. The absence of these character- 
istics relieves the subject of the need of the memory- 
cram felt to be essential in many of the humanities. 
(3) It forms a welcome counterpart to the training 
necessitated by the nature of the content of literary, 
artistic, and historical studies) as already indicated in a 
general way in the comparison of the natural sciences 
with the humanities. Helmholtz calls attention to this as 
a result of his own experience with students trained solely 
in philological subjects. He says, “‘ What has been notice- 
able in my experience with students who pass from literary 
schools to scientific and medical studies, is, first, a certain 
laxity in the application of laws that are universally valid. 
The grammatical rules upon which they have been ex- 
ercised are in fact accompanied with long lists of excep- 
tions, and the students are consequently unaccustomed 
to trust to the certainty of the legitimate consequences 
of strictly universal laws. Second, I find them much 
inclined to rely upon authorities, even where they could 
form their own judgment. In philological studies even 
the best of teachers must refer the student to authorities,
-P-A-G-E-202
    190 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
because frequently he cannot compass the whole subject, 
and because the decision often depends upon esthetic 
feeling for beauty of expression, which demands long train- 
ing. Both defects rest upon a certain inertia and uncer- 
tainty of thinking, which will be injurious not alone in 
science studies. The best remedy for both defects lies 
in studies of a mathematical nature, for in them there is 
absolute certainty of reasoning, and no authority rules but 
that of the understanding itself.” 
(4) In an industrial society, physics has an important 
office to perform in fitting men and women not only for 
specific callings, but for the capacity to adapt themselves 
readily to new callings. The machine has taken the place 
formerly occupied by the tool; the factory has super- 
seded the workbench. It is highly desirable, therefore, 
that the student should be master of the principles 
of machine construction and operation. This mastery 
of principles enables him not only to understand new 
machines, but to become quickly an adept in their manage- 
ment. It enables him to judge of the value of new inven- 
tions, also inciting and controlling his own impulses in this 
direction. The practical advantages incident to the study 
of physics are elaborated by Spencer in the first chapter 
of his “Education.” 
Discussion: —1. Extent to which physics should become 
a universal study: (a) for boys, (8) for girls. 2. Need of physics 
as a preparation for the various professions.
-P-A-G-E-203
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF CHEMISTRY Igt 
(3) Chemistry 
An examination into the nature of chemistry shows 
it to be an inductive science essentially non-mathematical, 
with a fascinating history and a marvellous utility in 
modern industry. It has been developed through count- 
less experiments, and to be effective educationally must 
be taught in the same way. 
Unlike physics, the phenomena with which it deals, with 
a few exceptions, are not open to observation in the routine 
of daily life, but must first be produced under artificial 
conditions. This is its first difficulty. 
Its second difficulty is due to the fact that the changes 
with which it deals cannot be observed by the senses, 
since they take place among the ultimate constituent 
particles (atoms, molecules) of matter. The experiment 
begins with certain materials, introduces certain condi- 
tions (juxtaposition, change of temperature, etc.), and 
concludes with certain results. The problem is to dis- 
cover what chemical changes have taken place. This is 
a thought problem, which, if at the advance threshold of 
the science, demands a full use of known related facts or 
laws, and then fertility in the forming of hypotheses and 
dexterity in testing them, until the true cause stands 
revealed. Should the problem lie merely at the threshold 
of the student’s knowledge, the same order (observation, 
hypothesis, verification) is maintained, but the discovery 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
RR Ce re eae rE ee tt ee ee em ep a ee get are eh ee 
Ig2 - THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
of the true cause is abbreviated by the guidance of the 
teacher and his skill in proposing such problems only as 
the student with his present acquisition can hope to solve. 
Should the problem be to find the constituent parts of a 
mixture, the student is called upon to apply tests suggested 
by his previous experience, and then to form a series of 
hypotheses, each of which in turn is tested by the aid 
of previous knowledge, until the constituent materials 
are one by one discovered. Here is a direct challenge to 
the student’s fertility of resource, and his persistence in 
effort, in which are involved the mental tension caused by 
expectation, and alert, thoughtful observation. 
Discussion: — Comparison of experiments in physics and 
in chemistry, showing their likenesses, differences, and educa- 
tional effects. 
A concrete problem taken from elementary chemis- 
try will suffice to show the kind of mental activity involved 
in chemical experimentation. Suppose the problem is to 
find the cause of the formation of the ash-like substance 
seen upon the surface of base metals when they are 
heated. 
The first thing to do is to heat the metal or metals in an 
open retort, when observation quickly shows the ‘ash.’ 
It will conduce not a little to the student’s interest to learn 
that many centuries had to pass before men learned the 
true cause. An explanation of scientific method (observa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF CHEMISTRY . 193 
tion, hypothesis, and verification) will prepare for the solu- 
tion of this problem, and show the worth of exact and 
complete, and the worthlessness of inexact and incom- 
plete observation. Since a knowledge of the truth can 
be adequately obtained only through the student’s own 
thought, he is asked to propose a hypothesis as to the 
cause of this ash-forming seen on heated metals. Of 
course it will occur to him that the heat is a cause, but he 
will suspect that it is not the only one. It will easily occur 
to him that the air is present, and may perhaps be excluded. 
The teacher may suggest that it be displaced by hydrogen, 
which for the present is to be considered merely as a means 
for excluding the air. If now the heated metal remains 
untarnished in a stream of hydrogen, and the student is 
convinced that the air has something to do with the cor- 
roding of the metal, it is certain that this conviction will be * 
confirmed and strengthened when he sees that with the 
return of the air the familiar color reappears on the heated 
metal. Even if it now seems to be proved that without 
the presence of the air the metal cannot change, that there- 
fore the air exerts a direct influence in the change, yet the 
nature of this influence is still unknown. Further experi- 
ments (lessening of the volume of the air and changes in 
it caused by contact with the hot metal and increase in 
weight of the latter) lead the student through similar 
mental processes to be certain that the so-called ‘ ashes’ 
‘on the hot metals are nothing more than combinations 
oO
-P-A-G-E-206
  194 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
of the latter with that part of the air which, without 
knowing what it is, one may say with confidence is the 
part that is most active in the burning of combustible 
bodies. The production of oxygen out of oxide of 
mercury, which immediately follows, brings this series 
of experiments to a close. Here follows naturally a 
glimpse over the history of this discovery: Knowledge 
of the ancients about ‘ ashes,’ later called ‘ lime,’ as well 
as the erroneous views of the nature of metals and their 
‘ashes’ during the middle ages and later times, from 
Geber (800) to Stahl (1697); the complete overlooking of 
the influence of air and the consequent erroneous view that 
the cause of the corrosion lay in the metals themselves, 
and that consequently they might be changed to precious 
metals (the efforts to change base metals into gold lasted 
for 1500 years); the proposal of the phlogiston theory, 
which, though recognizing the ‘calcifying’ influence of the 
air, fell into another error by failing properly to observe the 
' change of weight in the latter and the final elimination of 
this error by Lavoisier." 
The foregoing example gives an intimation of the mental 
processes involved in an experimental study of chemistry, 
as well as of the intensity and quality of interest that it is 
possible to arouse in the subject. 
A brief summary of the most striking characteristics of 
chemistry as a subject of instruction may help the teacher

to form a still more adequate idea of its place and function 
in education: — 
(x) It is essentially non-mathematical and strictly in- 
ductive, so far as it is educative. Brevity of time and mass 
of desirable material may make memorizing of unverified 
facts and laws imperative at times, yet the real teacher will 
see to it that the subject is scientifically treated in numer- 
ous types of chemical investigation. 
(2) Though a school subject, it yet admits of abbre- 
viated investigation of important problems on the part of 
the student in strict scientific form (observation of fact, 
hypothesis as to cause, testing and verification of the 
hypothesis). The method of the classroom is, therefore, 
that of the research laboratory. 
(3) As a laboratory subject, it shares with physics the 
advantage of inciting the student to use all his abilities, 
mental and physical, in the solution of problems. 
(4) Chemistry stands closer to technology than physics 
even, and because of this fact may have, even in the high 
school, the stimulating effect of a professional study. A 
mere glimpse at the function of chemistry in industrial 
life shows its immense practical importance: chemistry of 
iron and steel; reduction of ores; refining of oil and sugar; 
manufacturing of dyes, starch, beer, wines, gas, paper, 
leather, lime, cement, soap, fertilizers, extracts; the 
proper nourishment of the human body, care of health, 
disinfectants, sanitation; to say nothing of its first great

function after the attempts at transmutation were given 
up, namely, the production of medicines. 
Discussion: — Comparison of mathematics, physics, and 
chemistry in the following respects: 1. kind of observation 
required; 2. nature of experiment; 3. quality of constructive 
imagination involved; 4. certitude of results; 5. progressive 
nature of problems to be solved; 6. demands upon memory; 
7. appeal to inductive and to deductive reasoning. 
(4) Astronomy 
This subject, in so far as it demands higher mathe- 
matics, photography, spectrum analysis, and the telescope, 
belongs not to high-school but to university instruction. 
It is only as a part of geography that it is adapted to 
secondary education, so that a separate discussion of its 
educational merits is not needed. 
Discussion : — Educative value of brief popular courses in 
astronomy. 
GROUP II. THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 
Botany, Zoblogy, and Physiology 
We pass now from the exact to the inexact sciences, 
from subjects that are quantitative to those that are qual- 
itative, from the rule of mechanical or chemical law to the 
law of life. This is a part of the world that is dominated 
by a new principle, that of growth, of organic development, 
of adaptation to environment, of evolution in the domain
-P-A-G-E-209
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF BIOLOGY 197 
of living beings. It has to do with organic bodies in which 
organs are at once means and end. As organs, or means, 
they serve the whole being; while as ends they are in turn 
served by the entire organism (nourished by the processes 
of digestion and circulation, protected from harm, etc.). 
As the content and ruling principles of biology are 
different from those of the exact sciences, so it is natural 
that the educational functions should also be different. 
Biological sciences are also observational, but in a different 
sense. Without a knowledge of the facts and laws of the 
living world, the observational training obtained in chem- 
istry would be of small worth in botany or zodlogy, for not 
only is observation bound up with thinking, it is also con- 
ditioned by apperception, by knowledge and experience 
in the domain concerned.* Observational training in 
biology, therefore, stands in a class by itself; it has no 
equivalent in the curriculum, for no other subject has to 
do with the germination, growth, nourishment, and evolu- 
tion of living things, their qualities, conditions of health or 
disease, vital processes, life history, classification, economic 
and esthetic functions. This topic is treated at length in 
Vol. II. 
Biology is also an inductive science like chemistry, but 
with a different class of materials and an entirely different 
tone as regards rigor of logical process. Analogy plays a 
'See F. Adams, “Herbartian Psychology Applied to Education,” 
Ch. VI; also Lange, “Apperception.”

198 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
larger réle than in chemistry, anatomical comparison over 
a wide range of groups is needed for its larger generaliza- 
tions, while many of its ultimate formulas still linger in the 
domain of doctrines, hypotheses, and theories. Inspiring, 
uplifting, and expanding they may be to the mind, but they 
have not been demonstrated in the exact sense in which 
the term is used in mathematics, physics, or chemistry. 
Think, for example, of the difference of view among men of 
science as to whether acquired characteristics are inherited 
or not. 
Another difference between biological and physical 
sciences lies in the study of the function of organs or parts. 
For what end does the leaf exist? the stamen? the bark? 
the iris? the vermiform appendix? In the answering of 
such questions and similar ones regarding structure and 
location of parts, there is abundant room for observation 
and inductive reasoning, but of a quality not found in the 
exact sciences ; for in the latter the idea of the function 
of a part in ministering to the whole does not occur, since 
they do not deal with organisms, but with mechanical re- 
lations or chemical reactions. 
If mathematics and physics are remembered chiefly 
through insight into their principles, the knowledge ac- 
quired in biological sciences is held predominantly through 
what the Germans call Begriffe, that is, through organiza- 
tion into classes. So prominent is this fact that Bain calls 
botany and zodlogy the sciences of classification. Once
-P-A-G-E-211
    
     
          FUNCTION AND WORTH OF BIOLOGY 199 
master the characteristics of a class, and the observer has 
at once a means for the identification of individuals which 
enables him to hold a vast array of facts within the grasp 
of a memory perhaps not of the strongest. 
Discussion : — Educational worth of biological training in 
classification. 
These sciences are peculiar also in that they deal 
with living things, or with things considered as if they were 
living. The laboratory is therefore extended to the open 
field, thus relieving the student from at least a part of the 
constraint of the schoolroom. The study of the wonders 
of living organisms may easily lead to sympathetic regard 
for animals and plants, and in this way produce an emo- 
tional tone quite different from that natural to quantita- 
tive science, for though one might be said to ‘love’ a geo- 
metrical proposition or a chemical demonstration, it is not 
the same kind of affection as that which may easily be 
cultivated for plants and animals. That this sympathetic 
regard for the animal world is not always the result of 
biological teaching is a lamentable fact, due to callous- 
ness or carelessness on the part of the teacher. 
Discussion:— Comparison of an experiment in physics, 
with one in chemistry and one in botany, to show likenesses 
and differences. 
A word, at least, may be said concerning the eco- 
nomic importance of having these subjects taught in the

    200 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
high school. The proper understanding and utilization of 
plants and animals lie at the basis of our agricultural, 
horticultural, and industrial prosperity, for not only do 
plants and animals furnish practically the whole supply of 
food and clothing for mankind, but they also constitute 
the main source of raw materials for manufacture, and are 
consequently the very life blood of commerce. It is not 
enough that a few specialists from the universities should 
maintain experiment stations and tell the people what 
to do; there must be a substratum of botanical and zodlogi- 
cal knowledge and interest on the part of the people them- 
selves in order to make the experimental results of the 
specialist of value to the community. It is said that he isa 
benefactor of the race who can make two blades of grass 
grow where one grew before; he is, if he can teach and 
persuade all growers of grass to do the same, otherwise 
his extra blade will be of small service. The farms of 
the more fertile parts of the Mississippi basin have doubled 
in value during the last fifteen years, mainly because the 
research of the specialist was met by the intelligence of the 
farmers. It will always be fundamental to our industrial 
well-being for the high schools to lay the basis for a wide- 
spread popular interest in the study of plants and animals 
that there may be transmitted to the masses the practical 
results of higher research. 
Discussion: — What would be an ideal course in biology

   FUNCTION AND WORK OF BIOLOGY 201 
Of all the pleas that Spencer * makes for the sciences 
as guides to life for the individual, that for physiology 
is the most convincing, for the problems of hygienic living 
are always personal and persistent, as are those that per- 
tain to food, stimulants, narcotics, clothing, and shelter. 
The modern urban and industrial development has also 
brought with it a host of new temptations, dangers, and 
difficulties, such as a sugar and otherwise superabundant 
diet, a sedentary life for young and old, excessive nervous 
strain, and social amusements for which the past develop- 
ment of men has not prepared them. So far as food is con- 
cerned, the old danger was famine; the new danger is a 
kind of refined gluttony, for it is undoubtedly the case in 
prosperous communities that far more men and women 
die from overeating and drinking, combined with under- 
exercise and nervous strain, than from lack of food.? This 
new danger incident to industrial plenty must be met by 
better and more extensive instruction in physiology and 
hygiene. Consequently the teacher is to be pardoned if he 
urges the practical, rather than the strictly educational 
function of this study. At any rate, for whatever reason 
he likes, he may urge a fundamental study of human phys- 
iology, in the high-school meaning of the term: the na- 
ture and function of the vital processes, like digestion and

circulation; the functions, and limits of endurance of 
the central nervous system; and especially the general 
laws of hygiene. 
Even if for no other reason, educational or eco- 
nomic, the study of botany and zoélogy is worthy of a place 
in every high school as an inexhaustible source of unselfish 
pleasure, comfort, and mental health and healing. Even 
the ancients recognized the importance of such study for 
similar reasons. Aristotle, in a noteworthy section of his 
treatise on the component parts of animals, contrasts two 
species of natural objects: the heavenly bodies, which in ac- 
cordance with his predecessors he holds to be divine and in- 
accessible, and the plants and animals, “ which are related 
to us by a certain community of life.” “ Both species of 
beings,” he goes on to say, “ have their interest; of the first 
we are able to comprehend but little, though the sublimity 
of the subject makes this knowledge more valuable than 
that of the world which surrounds us. On the other hand, 
the world about us has the advantage of furnishing us 
with more complete knowledge, which because the objects 
are closer to us and more intimately related to our nature 
we are warranted in placing alongside the investigation of 
those sublime existences. To him who has insight and is 
able to go back to the sources, living nature offers un- 
speakable pleasure, even with objects that do not flatter 
our sensibilities. It would be foolish and unbecoming were 
we to amuse ourselves with the mere contemplation of such 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF GEOGRAPHY 203 
objects as they are portrayed in painting and statuary, 
rather than to study the natural objects themselves, whose 
causes we might seek out. We must not permit any child- 
ish repugnance to keep us from the study of the lower 
animals, since there is something wonderful in all the 
things of nature, and what Heraclitus said to the stranger 
who hesitated to enter when he saw the philosopher warm- 
ing himself at the hearth holds likewise of them: ‘ You may 
enter with confidence; there are Gods here also.’ Con- 
sequently we must exclude nothing in our investigation, 
since nature and beauty are found in all, —nature in 
adaptation to end and exclusion of accident, beauty as 
the summit of existence and development.” 
Discussion: —1. Extent to which the biological sciences 
in the high school should introduce the student to the genetic 
and evolutionary point of view. 2. Is esthetic enjoyment of 
nature a legitimate end of biological science? 
GROUP III. THE EARTH SCIENCES 
The chief representative of this group in the high 
school is geography, mathematical and physical. Geology 
is better fitted for university than for high-school instruc- 
tion, since it is more remote from practical interests than 
most of the other natural sciences, and since it deals with 
generalizations of a very comprehensive nature. It is 
interesting to note in this connection, that when science 
had a broad basis of theory and a narrow one of demon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  204 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
strated law, astronomy was the science most universally 
taught in secondary schools, but that now when demon- 
strable law and practical applicability outweigh even the 
most glittering of unproved theories, astronomy is a study 
for the specialist in the university or the observatory. 
This does not mean that its glories have become dimmed; 
they have in fact grown infinitely brighter with the advance 
of mathematical knowledge and the invention of new in- 
struments of research, like the telescope, the photographic 
plate, and the prisms for spectrum analysis. It does 
mean, however, that the newer sciences from their greater 
definiteness and demonstrability have become much better 
suited to the intellectual and economic needs of youth 
than the more splendid but also more indefinite and diffi- 
cult astronomical science, which gratified the wonder of 
our predecessors. In a less striking manner perhaps, 
but no less surely, geology, once the centre of scientific 
interest, has now followed astronomy to the university, 
and has likewise become a subject more of special than 
of general study and research.

Mathematical geography, as its name indicates, is 
mathematical in character and shares the educational 
advantages and limitations of mathematical subjects, as 
described in preceding sections. It has certain aspects,
-P-A-G-E-217
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF GEOGRAPHY 205 
however, peculiar to itself which make it worthy of the 
few weeks of attention needed for its mastery. 
The specific end and aim of mathematical geography is 
the exact and adequate location in space of any given 
point upon the surface of the earth. To effect this end it 
is first necessary to obtain clear conceptions as to the form 
and magnitude of the earth, then to devise artificial means 
(lines of latitude and longitude) for locating places upon 
the surface of this sphere, and finally to acquire a full 
knowledge of the movements of the earth in space. 
It can naturally be seen that these problems are mathe- 
matical, not in the sense of algebraic calculation or geo- 
metrical demonstration, but only in the formation of geo- 
metrical figures on a gigantic scale. The imagination is 
called upon, not only to construct figures, as in plane and 
solid geometry, but to extend them until they compass 
the whole magnitude of the earth, of the solar system, 
and of the celestial sphere. It is in training the mind to 
facility and accuracy in thus expanding its spatial images 
that the peculiar educational worth of mathematical 
geography lies. This may not be the greatest thing in 
education, but it is unique, and worth more than it 
costs. 
A moment’s consideration will show how this expansion 
of spatial images is effected in mathematical geography. 
Suppose the observer chooses a convenient spot out of 
doors on a cloudless night to watch the apparent move-

ments of the stars. He sees that they rise, describe arcs 
across the vault above, and at last set, or disappear from 
sight. Reflection shows him that the arcs described by 
the stars are parallel, and that chords joining the rising 
and setting points of the various stars must be likewise 
parallel, one of which must pass through the point where 
the observer stands. Then by conceiving another line 
at right angles to the first, the four cardinal points of the 
horizon are fixed. Another line at right angles to the plane 
of the first two will give the two points, Zenith and Nadir. 
Still another line conceived to be the axis of rotation will 
give the north and south poles. Then the conception 
of planes cutting the earth in various directions must be 
formed, of which four are great circles; namely, the horizon 
(the earth being first conceived as it appears, a circular 
plane), the meridians, the equator, and the first vertical, 
which contains the four points, east, west, zenith, and 
nadir. Then we see that the equator cuts the day and 
night circle into two equal sections, so that at the equator 
day and night are each always twelve hours long. The 
notion of small circles also cut by the day and night 
circle but unequally except twice a year must also be con- 
ceived. We have next to think of the earth as a sphere 
turning on its axis and bringing all points successively 
into the sunlight, whereby the day and night circle cuts 
unequally the parallels of latitude north and south of the 
equator, except twice a year; also of the earth as circling

about the sun, the plane of the orbit (the ecliptic) being 
bounded by the path of the earth, and we must picture 
the axis of the earth declined twenty-three and a half 
degrees from a perpendicular to this plane and always 
parallel to its former positions as it moves along. Then 
returning to the surface of the earth, we must see how the 
arctic and the antarctic circles are fixed, perceive how and 
why zones and seasons are formed, and so on until we can 
accurately locate any given point on the earth’s surface 
with respect to any other east or west or north or south. 
Whoever stands beneath the starry sky and constructs all 
these lines, circles, and planes, fixes all these points and 
clearly sees the mutual relations of all as they lie in the 
great space above, beneath, and around him, will have no 
difficulty in comprehending what the essence of mathe- 
matical geography is, and wherein consists its specific 
educational function.

General, advanced, or high-school geography ap- 
pears under three chief aspects, according as the emphasis 
is laid (t) on the purely physical features of the earth, in 
which case we have physical geography as a branch of nat- 
ural science; or (2) on the effect of natural causes upon 
the well-being of mankind, in which case we have anthro- 
po-geography, the chief form of which with us is commer-

cial geography; or (3) somewhat equally upon physical 
laws and their effect upon mankind, in which case we 
have physico-anthropo-geography, which is Karl Ritter’s 
conception of geography come to unity within itself and 
forming a connecting link between the natural and the 
historical sciences. Herbart conceived geography in 
this way and called it the associating science. 
Recent physical geographies emanating from univer- 
sity centres emphasize the exposition of purely physical 
laws concerning land, ocean, and atmosphere, and con- 
tent themselves with incidental reference to their effects 
upon man. High schools that have commercial courses, 
or that wish to emphasize the practical aspects of a study 
of geographical forces, are calling for commercial geog- 
raphies. 
A recent advocate of the Ritter conception is Professor 
Kirchhoff," who thinks that needless confusion has been 
introduced into geographical teaching, especially in second- 
ary education, by artificial division into mathematical, 
physical, political, commercial, and historical geography. 
He would bring these into unity, first, through a study 
of separate districts and countries which are minor 
geographic wholes (Laénderkunde), home geography (Hei- 
matskunde) being presupposed as an apperceiving basis; 
and second, in the high school, through a_physico- 
anthropo-study of the earth as a heavenly body and the

home of man. The whole earth is studied as a macro-_ 
cosm refleeting all its component minor unities, while the 
separate districts or countries are studied as microcosms, 
which though minor geographic unities still reflect .and 
involve the whole. In other words, the study of the earth 
as such gathers up all the details of elementary geog- 
raphy, puts them into their proper relations, and gives the 
student a scientific grasp of that which he‘has previously 
learned as detail. “These,” says Professor Kirchhoff, 
“are the two parts into which geography naturally 
separates. 
“The general, or scientific geography views the earth 
as one of the planets of the solar system (mathematical 
geography), and then studies its atmosphere, its oceans, 
the structure of its land masses, the nature of rivers, 
glaciers, inland seas, lakes, the principles of plant and 
animal distribution, and the general reciprocal relations 
between the earth and mankind.” 
Discussion: —1. Is physical geography as a pure science 
of physiography justifiable in the high school? 2. Degree to 
which modern commercial geography satisfies the need of 
explaining the reciprocal relations between the earth and 
mankind. 
The educational effects of geographical study will 
vary naturally according as one or the other of the aspects 
is emphasized. In general, however, it may be said that 
this subject unites in itself many of the advantages of the

exact and of the biological sciences, with others peculiar 
to itself. “Nothing,” says Immanuel Kant, the first 
great German university teacher of this subject, “is better 
adapted to waken sound common sense than geography.” 
It does this for two reasons chiefly; first, because it stim- 
ulates to a kind of thinking that is fundamental, one 
might almost say primitive, in character (think of primi- 
tive attempts to discover the component parts of the earth, 
the cause of geographical phenomena, and to explain the 
movements of the heavenly bodies), and second, because 
it has to do both with familiar phenomena and with human 
interests of great import. Nothing is more fascinating 
to the mind of youth, or more stimulating to his imagina- 
tion, than his first organic view of the world as a whole, 
its development, its relation to other heavenly bodies, 
its interplay of forces, its influence upon the occupations, 
characteristics, and well-being of men. He delights to 
see, moreover, how men by thought and work can over- 
come natural disadvantages of climate and location, 
or by ingenuity and invention can utilize the natural 
geographical forces for his own advantage. Scientific 
geography furnishes us our first concrete view of evolu- 
tionary forces at work, and unites as nothing else can the 
world of nature and the doings of men.

FUNCTION AND RELATIVE EDUCATIONAL WORTH 
OF THE STUDIES AND STUDY GROUPS (Continued) 
B. THe HuMANIrIESs 
GROUP IV. LANGUAGES 
(1) Linguistics 
The opening discussion in Chapter III gave a 
general view of the permanent content and educational 
functions of linguistic and literary studies. The study 
of language both in form and content is the oldest disci- 
pline for the training of youth known to man since the 
invention of written speech, and in many countries during 
long periods almost the only one. Up to comparatively 
recent times mathematical knowledge was limited to the 
Euclidian geometry; the various physical, chemical, 
biological, and earth sciences were either rudimentary or 
in a speculative stage of development; modern languages 
were for the most part in their vulgar or non-literary 
condition; while economics as a science was non-existent, 
and history a mixture of tradition, fact, and fancy. Lan- 
guage, therefore, in addition to its own inherent worth and 
necessity as a subject of instruction became the recipient of 
air 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
212 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
  the time and attention that may now be given to subjects_ 
which were then not in a teachable state of development. 
Now, however, when these newer disciplines are full grown, 
and are demanding the place in education to which their 
importance and perfected development entitle them, it 
becomes necessary to analyze anew the content and edu- 
cational effectiveness of language, in order that, on the 
one hand, it may not be overestimated and continue to 
receive the emphasis which circumstances gave it in the 
past; and, on the other, which is perhaps still more impor- 
tant, that it may not be undervalued, and gradually sink 
into a position lower than that to which its permanent 
worth entitles it. 
A glance at the difference between the primitive 
and the cultured man with respect to the need of language 
training will throw much light upon its educational value. 
Primitive men secure the requisites for survival, not by a 
thoughtful direction of the forces about them, but by 
physical exertion in hunting and fishing, the herding of * 
animals, or by means of crude agriculture. In such an 
existence but little language, and that of an inexact kind, 
is needed. A vocabulary of a few thousand words suffices 
to name the important phenomena that affect the people, 
and to express their narrow range of thought, feeling, and 
volition. The thought content of the language of such a 
people is exceedingly simple, since it pertains only to the 
most prosaic affairs of daily life. It has and needs no fine
-P-A-G-E-225
  
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 213 
discriminations, no sharply defined conceptions, no wide- 
reaching generalizations. (Some primitive people are un- 
able to count beyond ten.) The feelings of men in this 
state are massive and tumultuous, pertaining to matters of 
survival, such as military and other defence, the procuring 
of food, and the perpetuation of the species. Such feel- 
ings find expression in action and inarticulate cries more 
than in language; as, for example, in the rage engendered 
by combat or by jealousy; the fear that expresses itself 
by flight, or uncontrolled emotion; the love that finds 
expression now in joyous exaltation or dumb repression 
or heroic deed, now in physical endurance of self-inflicted 
torture. The vernacular as passed down from parent to 
child suffices for men in a primitive state; there is here 
no need of training the young through language, for the 
ordinary intercourse of life gives them naturally and easily 
all that there is to give." 
The case is very different, however, when a caste, as in 
India; a religious group, as among the Hebrews or the 
Egyptians; or a class of freemen, as in Greece, begins 
deeply and seriously to reflect and to record its thoughts 
and emotions, its insights and inspirations, in religious 
works like the vedas and the Hebrew Scriptures, or in 
literature and philosophy as among the Greeks and more 
modern peoples. Such groups no longer get their subsist- 
ence at first hand from nature, but become the leaders

214 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
and in varying degrees the exploiters of their fellows — the 
tribute-takers. They lay the basis for civilization, how- 
ever, developing the arts and sciences, and making it 
possible for the whole race to lift its standards of life and 
thought; through their writings, moreover, they secure 
the advances made, enabling men better to understand 
themselves, relieving them of at least a part of the super- 
stitious fears that paralyze them, and inciting them to 
greater conquests over thought and nature. At this point 
the need for language training becomes imperative, for 
“Die Kunst ist lang, wnd kurz ist unser Leben.” Since 
the young must be placed rapidly in possession of the 
intellectual and moral treasures of the past, it is necessary 
to train them first to quick and accurate apprehension of 
what is written, and then to equip them with skill in the 
use of the language they have been taught to compre- 
hend. In addition to these formal facilities, they must 
likewise be led to make these literary, philosophical, and 
religious treasures their own through reflective study. 
Thus, for example, we find the education of the highest 
caste of Hindoo youth centring about the vedas, in their 
manifold forms and subdivisions, grammar being the 
foundation of all instruction. The Brahman regarded 
language as a divinity, and dedicated hymns to it. Rest- 
ing upon the work of many generations, Panini, who is 
supposed to have lived at the time of Alexander the Great, 
constructed a canonical doctrine of language which treated

FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 215 
the laws of the Sanscrit in eight books containing four 
thousand rules, said by Max Miiller to be more complete 
than the whole grammatical literature of all other nations 
giving a purely empirical analysis of speech. In similar 
manner, but with no such emphasis upon grammar, the 
Hebrews after the exile, when the language of the scrip- 
tures was no longer that of common life, placed their re- 
ligious books at the centre of all instruction. Chinese 
education for thousands of years has been exclusively 
literary, great emphasis being placed upon memorizing 
and the art of constructing literary mosaics from the 
Chinese classics. The early Greeks, as is well known, had 
only two types of training for the children of the higher 
classes, the physical in the gymnasium, and the literary 
and musical in the school. All the peoples thus far men- 
tioned used their own religious and literary works as the 
sole material for instruction in speech. The Romans, 
who borrowed the civilization of the Greeks, found it 
advisable or perhaps necessary to take the Greek language 
with Greek culture. At any rate, they appear to be the 
first people who utilized a foreign language in educating 
their youth. 
Discussion : — Extent to which the modern man still needs 
to have his literary education based on sacred writings. 
Historically considered the linguistic or technical 
side of language instruction has always embraced, though
-P-A-G-E-228
    216 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
with varying degrees of emphasis, the three elements, 
grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics. The modern school- 
man is not a little astonished to find how much weight has 
in the past been ascribed to these aspects of literary study 
in the training of youth. Their end and aim has always 
been the mastery of the word ; with the Greek, for the adorn- 
ment of life; with the Roman, primarily for oratorical, 
and secondarily for literary finish and efficiency; with the 
early Christians, for the purity, fulness, and convincing 
force of the sermon; with the middle ages the trivium 
(grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic), for perfection in the art 
of defining, distinguishing, proving, debating, and system- 
atizing; with the leaders of the renaissance, for the devel- 
opment of an eloquence that should rival that of the best 
days of Greece and Rome. With all these peoples the 
formal mastery of the word was the very life-blood of 
culture, the necessary prolegomena to excellence in the 
domain of language and of everything to which literary 
excellence is the vestibule. Classical philology in modern 
times has different aims. Its chief undertaking is the ideal 
reconstruction of the entire life of a people, cultural and 
institutional. The writings of such a people constitute 
the original sources of information, and the study of their 
language furnishes the key to the treasures. Both the 
sources and the speech become, therefore, objects of re- 
search to the modern philologist. To summon the spirit 
of a departed age, she must cry, — “ Speak that I may see 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
    FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 207 
”1 But if in modern educational circles linguistic you. 
instruction assumes a more restricted, it has still a most 
important, function. 
Discussion: — Extent to which the old reasons for the 
mastery of the word are still valid. 
The more a given group of studies is urged as a ne- 
cessity in education, the more imperative becomes the need 
of determining its inherent worth, lest the traditional es- 
timate of its value be over or under rated. We need, there- 
fore, to perceive clearly the nature and content of such 
studies, that we may justly estimate their permanent im- 
portance. 
To the modern high school, grammar is far more impor- 
tant than rhetoric or dialectics, since, first, it is indispen- 
sable for comprehending and using a foreign language, and 
second, because dialectic, or logic, is now remanded to 
higher education, while rhetoric is confined mostly to the 
mother-tongue, the effort to compose artistically in foreign 
tongues being now abandoned. The first great question, 
then, concerning the value of literary study is: what are 
the functions, what the limitations of grammar as an 
instrument for the training of youth ? 
Grammar in itself is nothing more than a sys- 
tematic exposition of the forms which speech assumes in 
endeavoring to mirror with exactness the mental processes 
1Compare Willmann, “ Didaktik,” Vol. I, pp. 392-393.
-P-A-G-E-230
  218 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
in which language originates. Grammar applies alike 
to the commonplace and to the exalted, yet it partakes of 
the characteristics of neither the one nor the other; it 
inquires merely: (1) What aspects of thought does a given 
grammatical inflection or construction represent, and (2) 
What grammatical forms must be observed to express 
a given aspect of thought? In other words, as already 
stated, grammar is used both as a key to the understanding 
of thought, and as a guide to its adequate expression. It 
is like the natural sciences in that it takes an outer object, 
a word or a sentence, for observation and reflection; but 
it is unlike those sciences in that it always has an inner 
reference. The symbol is external, but the thing signified 
is internal, for it has to do with the thinking itself, and not 
only the thing thought about. This makes grammatical 
study a concrete sort of introspection, the vestibule to 
psychology and logic. Here for the first time in school 
study the student begins to think about his thinking, 7.e., 
about the adaptation of word and sentence form to the 
meaning they would express. 
Negatively considered, since grammar is purely for- 
mal and is consequently independent of the content of 
the language to which it applies, we must conclude that 
there are many functions of science and literature that 
grammar does not perform. For illustration, it does not 
chave the apodictic certainty of mathematics, for its rules 
and forms are subject to exceptions; the quality of mem-
-P-A-G-E-231
  
   FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 219 
ory demanded in grammar is different from that required 
in physics or mathematics, for it is the exceptions rather 
than the rules that are hard to remember in grammar; it 
furnishes no food to the imagination, however much it may 
incite to guessing, and is consequently lacking in all es- 
thetic quality; the emotions it leaves quite untouched ex- 
cept the painful ones incident to its perplexities; in itself 
considered as a system of categories it is as unemotional 
as mathematics itself, for it touches not at all the will 
of man, the weal or woe of race, country, or condi- 
tion; it is indifferent alike to hope and despair, to love 
and hate, to good and evil, to the beautiful and to the 
ugly. tg 
Positively considered, grammar is a pure intellectual 
discipline, but differs nevertheless essentially from other 
studies seemingly like it in intellectual quality. As above 
observed, it has two main purposes and one peculiarity. 
Its first purpose is to serve as an aid to the comprehension 
of what is written, especially what is written in a foreign 
tongue; its second purpose is to aid in using language cor- 
rectly. In the mother-tongue these two aspects of gram- 
mar are somewhat equally emphasized, for as the mother- 
tongue is easy to understand, so up to a certain point it is 
easy to use. But with foreign languages both aspects: of 
grammar become more important, for a foreign tongue is 
difficult for the beginner to understand, and greatly more 
difficult to use. For this reason composition in a foreign 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    220 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
language makes the second function of grammar particu- 
larly important. 
* The peculiarity of grammar as an intellectual discipline 
is that it turns the mind inward to observe the character- 
istics of its own thinking. This peculiarity and the exer- 
cise of the twofold purpose of grammar demand especial 
investigation, for in them we shall find the reasons why 
men consider grammatical training of so much worth to 
the young. 
« The importance of the introspective nature of gram- 
matical study lies in the fact that it originates and devel- 
ops the language consciousness. Primitive language sense 
is developed in the mother-tongue by intercourse with par- 
entsandcompanions, but language consciousnesscomes only 
when the mind begins to examine by inner reference, first 
the thoughts of others as expressed in speech, and then its 
own. Think, for example, of the mental training in speech 
consciousness involved in the study of the manifold ways 
in which assertions may be made, 7.e., in the study of 
modes. How does one think when one says, Were I not 
Alexander, I would be Diogenes; Man sagt, der Koenig sei 
gestorben ; Que voulez-vous que je dise? What is the differ- 
ence in the thinking when one uses now an intransitive, now 
atransitive verb; now an active, now a passive form? What 
aspect of thought is exhibited in each of the cases of sub- 
stantives? Think, moreover, of the infinite variety that is 
given to speech and hence to thought by limiting or quali-
-P-A-G-E-233
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS Zar 
fying words, phrases, and clauses. In the study of foreign 
languages the mind is thus turned to the analysis of 
thought, not for a day or a week, but for years, and cul- 
minates in a new and higher language sense. Apprehen- 
sion of distinctions both broad and subtle becomes quick 
and keen; a sensitive feeling for the fine and noble in lan- 
guage, even if not in life, is engendered; the play of fancy, 
the flash of wit, the convincing force of logical conclusion, 
the appeal to sympathy, the resounding call to duty and 
noble living, all alike find a ready response in a mind thus 
trained. Such a man acquires the efficiency of the lib- 
erated tongue. What he has learned to note in the 
thought of others, he transfers in kind at least to his own 
thinking. Here is one great source of the difference, every- 
where felt, between the educated and the uneducated man, 
even though by native endowment they may be equal. 
The educated man thinks and speaks clearly, definitely, 
concisely, making distinctions when they should be made, 
qualifying when qualification is needed; he can express 
adequately the emotion he feels; he knows what an argu- 
ment is, and when it is conclusive, concerning any matter 
with which he is acquainted; and he has an appreciation 
for the subtle, the artistic, and the refined, which he never 
could have had had he been linguistically uneducated. 
In most respects the uneducated man appears the reverse 
of all this.. His thought is general, and guided more by 
+ Compare § 77.
-P-A-G-E-234
222 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
instinct than by trained intellectual force; his feelings are 
likely to be massive and_ primitive, and not easily ex- 
pressed in words; his logical processes are simple in char- 
acter and quite as likely to be directed by prejudice as 
reason; while his appreciation of the beautiful and refined 
is sadly limited by his unfamiliarity with the language by 
which they are expressed. In these and similar reflections 
one can perceive some of the reasons why grammar, as 
the vestibule to introspection, has been and indeed is so 
highly estimated as a means of mental culture. 
Discussion: — 1. Does the educational value of grammar 
warrant the isolated study of grammar as the first stage of 
instruction in foreign languages? 2. Distinguish between 
primitive and cultivated language sense, showing how language 
consciousness leads to the latter. 3. How can a study in it- 
self unemotional still become a means of emotional control ? 
Turning now to the twofold aspect which grammar 
assumes in learning, first to understand language and then 
to use it, we have to examine the validity of the claim, 
made since first speech as such was studied, that it fur- 
nishes if not a universal, at all events an admirable train- 
ing in logical thinking. 
All the reasoning there is in grammar centres about a 
few logical relations, and even these need not be explicitly 
but only implicitly known. The sentence is the expression 
in words of the form of thought we call the judgment. 
From the nature of the judgment, the logical relations of
-P-A-G-E-235
       FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 223 
the sentence follow. There must first be the substantive 
to correspond to the first concept of the judgment, then 
the attribute to correspond to the second concept of the 
judgment, and then finally the copula, or the assert- 
ing part of a verb, to correspond to the mental act of 
affirming the second concept to the first, or of excluding it 
from the first wholly or in part. In this way subject, 
copula, and attribute arise. Since the attribute may be 
(x) a word expressing action, state, or being, (2) a quality, 
(3) a thing or class of things, and since a word expressing 
action, etc., may be united with the copula, or asserting 
element, it follows that what we call an attributive verb 
consists of copula and attribute united in a single word. 
In other words, the verb in this case performs two offices, 
that of asserting, and that of showing what is asserted. 
When, however, the attribute is not verbal, it is separate 
from the copula as adjective or noun. 
Here we have the logical framework of the sentence. 
Then follow the modifications of the three main elements 
found in inflection, and modification by word, phrase, or 
clause, as exhibited in works on grammar. Nouns are 
distinguished as to person, number, gender, case; they 
are also classified according to logical categories. Copulas, 
or asserting elements, are inflected to show manner or mode 
of assertion, hence the various modes or moods; actions 
take place in time, hence there must be the idea of tense; 
actions vary as to cause, time, place, circumstance, etc.,    
-P-A-G-E-236
  224 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
hence adverbial modification; qualities differ in degree, 
hence adjectives may also be modified to show this. The 
name of a modifier showing degree is also called an adverb. 
Then finally the noun attribute may be modified like any 
other substantive. Here in outline is the whole circle of 
thought found in grammar. It takes some maturity, 
such as is found in the high school, to comprehend the 
logical relations, but after all the range of thought is very 
limited and exceedingly simple. A bright student ought 
to be able to master the whole thing, in principle, in a week 
or less. If insight into fundamental grammatical rela- 
tions were all there is to grammatical discipline, we might 
let our students come in their best clothes, teach them the 
grammar in the morning and give them a picnic in the 
afternoon. Mathematics, on the other hand, has to do 
with quantities. and the ratios between them. In the 
beginning the quantities are more prominent, and the 
ratios very simple. As the subject develops, the ratios 
become more complex and the quantities continue to 
retreat from view, being represented by more and more 
complex symbols. The subject is therefore one of con- 
stantly increasing complexity and abstractness, it being 
more than possible for the student to lose all sense of con- 
creteness and to juggle merely with symbols. But all 
that is essential in the thought range of grammar may be 
written on a single sheet of paper and mastered in a week,

       FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 225 
Some years ago one of the ablest of German mathema- 
ticians was accustomed to give a course of lectures each 
year outlining the advances in mathematics; but he gave 
up the attempt, for he declared that the discoveries in this 
field proved too great for him to follow. In their meas- 
ure, the same is true of all the natural sciences. Nobody 
makes any new discoveries in the closed system of gram- 
mar, but thought never ceases in its onward march in 
science. The excellences of grammar as a mental discipline 
for the young can then hardly lie in a mastery of the 
limited thought system involved in technical grammar. 
In what does it lie? 
Discusston: — Compare the possibilities of development 
of the thought systems involved in grammar and logic with 
those in mathematics and physical science. 
If Panini was able to formulate four thousand rules 
      
                                    for Sanscrit, it must have been because the exceptions 
were treated as rules. Modern grammar, however, has 
comparatively few rules and many exceptions. It is in 
the use of rules and exceptions that the peculiar logical 
discipline of grammar consists. Every sentence is an illus- 
tration of fundamental rules, and may be of exceptions. 
When the student has to work up to his ability in transla- 
tion, he finds constant application of his grammatical 
knowledge of both. A glance at the ending of a word may 
inform him whether it is a noun or a verb, and if a noun

    226 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
whether it is subject or object, genitive or dative. On the 
other hand, the form may not in itself show the true con- 
struction, when further tests must be applied. Fleeting 
hypotheses may be formed, to be approved or rejected by 
a new test, until the student is satisfied that he sees the 
meaning of the sentence. Then by a reverse process, he 
can quickly verify his first impressions, and discover if any 
word or form is still unaccounted for or has been incor- 
rectly apprehended. In composition, say in a foreign 
tongue, the same process is involved, but in still more ac- 
centuated form, for it is easier to use one’s grammatical 
knowledge effectively in translation than in composition. 
Needless to say, perhaps, the use of grammar in under- 
standing or in composing in the mother-tongue is confined 
to those difficult points that demand the exegcise of lan- 
guage consciousness. For the most part, the language 
sense developed since infancy suffices for the grammatical 
side of both understanding and composition. English 
grammar is consequently studied by American high-school 
students mostly for the mastery of the thought system 
involved and only secondarily for understanding and guid- 
ance in use. In the case of those whose language sense 
has been perverted by long practice of incorrect speech, 
grammar in the mother-tongue performs much the same 
functions as in the study and use of foreign language. 
The thought in grammar is not the long, vigorous, 
unbroken chain so essential in mathematics; it is not con-  
-P-A-G-E-239
  
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LINGUISTICS 227 
tinuous in length and breadth like that in natural science; 
it involves little of the mental persistence and plodding 
industry needed in mathematics and other exact sciences. 
On the other hand it is characterized by flexibility, alert- 
ness, and all-sidedness of insight and remembrance. In- 
stead of having the longitudinal or chainlike form of exact 
science, it is, so to speak, radial in form. The student is 
incited to think in every direction in rapid succession con- 
cerning the inflection of words, their position in the sen- 
tence, the rules of syntax, and, above all, the exceptions. 
He must have at ready command the hundreds of forms 
shown in declensions and conjugations, both regular and 
irregular, and at equally ready command all the irregular- 
ities that adhere to syntactical rules. To be effective, 
this mass of knowledge, forming a great apperceiving 
resource, must be at instant command. The study of 
foreign languages has long been applauded for its training 
of the memory. One sees here why the claim is well 
founded as far as it goes. Every sentence examined or 
written, every word inflected or construed, calls for quick 
and accurate application of what is known. The student 
is like a sturdy mountain-climber when he is studying 
mathematics; but he is more like a skilful fencer when he 
is using his grammatical knowledge in translating, or is 
composing in a foreign tongue. In the first case he must 
march by laborious steps to his goal; in the second he 
must ward off every false impression and thrust to the
-P-A-G-E-240
228 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
heart of the truth. Through grammatical study then we 
get, not depth, but versatility; not strength, but alert- 
ness; not insight into principle, but retention in memory; 
not a chain, but a web form of thought; not the onward 
march of experimental science, but the kaleidoscopic 
aspect of continuous application of a mass of rules and 
exceptions to a succession of sentences. 
Discussion: — What would be the educational worth of 
grammar should it remain unapplied to literature: (a) in Eng- 
lish; (6) in foreign languages? 
(2) Literature 
The primary fact about literature, never to be for- 
gotten by its teacher, is that it is one of the fine arts, and 
like all other fine arts it portrays the ideal through a sense 
medium, — in this case the word. It differs from history 
both in content and form, for history undertakes to nar- 
rate events, their causes and effects, as they actually oc- 
curred, and though at times its form may be what is called 
‘literary,’ this is never regarded as more than accessory; 
whereas literature makes no attempt to chronicle events. 
Its truth is psychological and ethical rather than histor- 
ical, while its form is esthetic. The mission of history is 
to inform, to make the experiences of the past a lamp for 
the future; that of literature is to lift the thoughts of men 
above the commonplace, to inculcate ideals, to make men 
at home in the world of emotion, to stimulate them to 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LITERATURE 229 
higher living. It takes its themes both from the outer and 
the inner world, striving to give an inner meaning to the 
outer forms of nature, or to make the inner world of feel- 
ing take on the visible aspect of the beautiful in nature, 
as in the cry of Emilia Galotti, about to suffer an 
untimely death, 
“Eine Rose gebrochen 
Ehe der Sturm sie entblattert hat.” 
Works of literature are monuments both to the spiritual 
life of the people from which they spring, and to the genius 
of the language in which they are written. It is for this 
reason that the modern philologist undertakes to recon- 
struct the whole inner life of nations through a study of 
their language and the literature in which the language is 
embodied. Literary and linguistic study, therefore, at the 
present time is much broader than in the past, when a 
single aim like oratory, or the imitation of classical style, 
often engrossed the entire attention of teacher and student. 
Literature, whether in foreign languages or in the 
mother-tongue, embraces many forms, from narration, 
oratory, proverbs, and lyric verse, up to the drama and 
the epic, but everywhere we find the characteristics above 
described: ideals, emotions, aspirations, the noble, the 
good, the self-sacrificing, the patriotic—all portrayed 
positively or negatively in esthetic form. A literary work 
is great according to the universal importance of the ideal 
truths it embodies, and the esthetic quality of their ex-
-P-A-G-E-242
  230 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
pression. Some assert that the four great literary bibles 
of the race are the works of Homer, Dante, Goethe, and 
Shakespeare. 
Such being the content and form of literature, what 
are its chief educational functions? Even if there were 
any need of teaching it for such intellectual training as is 
obtained through mathematics and natural science, it is 
evident that the nature of the subject is such that an 
effort to produce like results from literature would neces- 
sarily prove abortive, for literature has to do with ideals 
and emotions and beautiful forms, not with chains of 
logical thought, or with causes of natural phenomena. 
Freeman objected to teaching literature as a university 
subject on the ground that it deals with emotions, which 
are subjective and personal, and hence not fit topics for 
examination. One can examine on facts, laws, principles, 
causes, effects, etc., but how can one examine on states of 
personal feeling? Such an attempt destroys the feeling 
itself, leaving only the pale counterfeit which memory may 
retain. To meet this objection many teachers feed their 
students on the bare husks, the mere incidental accesso- 
ries of literature, such as facts of biography, mythological 
references, etymology of words, syntactical constructions 
or rhetorical devices for producing effects; others preach 
ethical sermons, or make elaborate analyses of plot, struc- 
ture, development, motives, — anything in short, rather 
than the literature itself. As John Burroughs expresses it,
-P-A-G-E-243
    FUNCTION AND WORTH OF LITERATURE 231 
the class fall upon a literary work as chickens in a barn- 
yard fall upon a bone, picking it dry. In other words, 
they teach everything but the literature itself; they at- 
tempt to transform a work of art, which is to be understood 
and appreciated, into a colorless discipline for memory and 
of cheerless analysis for logical thought. 
The remark of Freeman is not a reproach to literature as 
a high-school subject; it is only a hint as to its true func- 
tion, which is to portray the ideal as conceived by the 
author through such beautiful forms as his genius may be 
able to create. The primary purpose of teaching litera- 
ture, therefore, must be to lead the student to embody these 
ideals in his own conduct, to be at home in the world of 
elevated emotions, to appreciate the truly artistic in lit- 
erary forms, and in his own little measure to be able to use 
them in expressing his thoughts. Secondarily there may 
be other purposes, such as orientation in the inner life of 
other peoples distant in time or space, or knowledge of the 
development of literary style in a given field, or indeed of 
general literary information and polish. Incidental and 
accessory ends are not to be contemned; they are only 
to be relegated to their proper position and importance as 
accessories. 
Discussion: —1. Relative place and importance in the 
teaching of literature of the elements above named. 2. Was 
the old idea that each man could read English literature for 
and by himself educationally sound? 3. What is the justifica-
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
tion for teaching it, when there are so many other useful sub- 
jects that the student must study in school if he is ever to have 
any knowledge of them? 
Formerly literature was taught in school only 
through foreign languages, but the literature of the mother- 
tongue has now won a place for itself in the high school. 
That it has often been taught for purposes not native to 
it, or has received more or less time than its importance 
demands, is due to its newness as a school discipline, and 
to the difficulties inherent to its proper presentation. Lit- 
erature is now in the position that science was forty years 
ago; namely, that of frequent misconception as to aim and 
method. But the example of science, which has devel- 
oped a method in harmony with its purposes, justifies ‘us 
in believing that a similar development will take place in 
the teaching of literature. 
How far the literature of foreign countries, especially 
that of the ancient world, should be taught through English 
translation is a question for the future to decide. On the 
one hand the period of classical study possible to the Amer- 
ican high school is so brief that comparatively little liter- 
ature can be read jn Latin, and still less in Greek, so that 
if the student who does not go to the university for further 
study in these subjects is to know much about the real con- 
tent of classic literatures, he must get that knowledge 
through English translations. On the other hand, it is 
urged, first, that translations, however good they may be,
-P-A-G-E-245
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES 233 
necessarily lack the esthetic form of the original, and 
second, that the time used in reading translations is so 
brief that but slight impression is made upon the student 
by the content itself. It would be an experiment worth 
trying for a class to spend six months upon Butcher and 
Lang’s “Iliad” or “‘ Odyssey.” In the first place, these 
translations give the poetic imagery, and lack only the 
rhythm of the original hexameters, and in the next place 
such a study would give quite as much time to the content 
itself as could be given in reading the original, where a large 
part of the labor of the student is consumed in the effort 
to discover the meaning of the sentences. American high 
schools have never really tested the value of English trans- 
lations of foreign classics, and until they have done so, the 
question of their value should at least be an open one. 
(3) The Ancient Languages 
The most obvious educational value of the ancient 
languages is the opportunity they give for the development 
of language consciousness through the long drill in making 
grammatical distinctions. The question naturally arises: 
Why not develop this consciousness through grammatical 
study of the mother-tongue? In the first place, the study 
of grammar by itself is nearly valueless for the develop- 
ment of language consciousness, since this depends not 
upon the mere knowledge that distinctions exist, but upon
-P-A-G-E-246
  234 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
long-continued exercise in discerning them in literary 
works. In the next place, English is not so good as an 
ancient language for this application, since with the dis- 
appearance of inflectional endings, the very distinctions 
which these exhibit have either disappeared or have be- 
come obscure. An instance is the modern disposition to 
ignore the subjunctive forms of the verb, and consequently 
the distinctions that these forms imply. Again, the 
thought content of English, and indeed of modern foreign 
languages, lies so near, and is of so much more apparent 
worth than the exercise of making fine distinctions, that 
both teacher and student instinctively turn to the thought 
and ignore the grammar. Were we content to do as our 
fathers did two generations ago, and laboriously parse the 
whole of Milton’s ‘‘ Paradise Lost”? or Pope’s “ Essay on 
Man,” doubtless we could achieve valuable results in the de- 
velopment of speech consciousness. It seems more fitting, 
however, to get this drill, say upon Latin, where long ap- 
plication of grammatical principles is a necessary part of 
the mastery of the language itself, and where the percep- 
tion of thought distinctions is aided by highly inflected 
forms. 
Since both Latin and Greek are candidates for a position 
in the modern high-school curriculum, and since both may 
justly claim excellence in developing speech consciousness, 
a new question arises; namely: Is the language conscious- 
ness developed by the one so different from that developed
-P-A-G-E-247
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES 235 
by the other that we are justified in teaching both to secure 
this one end? Or is it worth the time and labor involved 
to learn two sets of symbols for one set of distinctions? 
Language consciousness thoroughly developed in one an- 
cient language suffices for this type of training, so that the 
modern effort to exhibit the parallelism of the grammar 
of languages is justified and deserves much further devel- 
opment. After the grammar of one foreign language is 
learned thoroughly, the deviations from this type found in 
other tongues should be noted for their practical rather 
than their linguistic worth. This consideration has im- 
portant bearings upon the educational worth of modern 
foreign language for the high-school student, as will be 
noted in Section 75. 
With respect to the many-sided attention and the mental 
alertness demanded by composition in a tongue in which 
the language sense is not a sufficient guide, all languages 
are much alike, differing only in degree according to the 
stage of the student’s knowledge and the difficulty of the 
task set by the teacher. Considering the narrow range 
of this closed system of thinking as seen in Section 66, 
it would seem as if former educational practice had greatly 
overworked this form of mental training. Here if any- 
where in education the economic law of diminishing re- 
turns certainly holds. 
Discussion :— Limits of profitable study of grammar in 
foreign language, from the standpoint of mental discipline.
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
What is there in the content of ancient languages 
that makes them worth teaching to modern students ? 
This question has been discussed, and at times actively 
debated, for the last four hundred years. The history of 
education shows how men’s estimate of relative educational 
values has changed with the development of new views 
of life and the appearance of new subjects for study. We 
are concerned, however, not with past, but with present 
estimates of the content values of these studies. 
It may be remarked at the beginning that it is not worth 
while to study these languages for what they contain con- 
cerning ancient history or the exposition of ancient mili- 
tary systems or political or social institutions, for since 
only facts and their causes are sought, all hindrances, such 
as strange words and constructions merely make it more 
difficult to learn the facts and to understand the causes. 
A translation of Aristotle’s ‘Constitution of Athens” 
gives the reader easy access to an accurate comprehension 
of a political system, whereas the original would certainly 
cost more effort without yielding a better result. In the 
words of Weisenfels: “It is evident that with regard to 
political and military history, not only a wide, but also a 
fundamental knowledge can be found through the mother- 
tongue. Thesame thing holds with regard to concrete ob- 
jects and so-called antiquities. In a few hours by instruc- 
tion through the mother-tongue one can give his students a 
more exact knowledge and a better understanding of the
-P-A-G-E-249
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES 237 
aspects of antique life, of geographical and topographical 
relations, of private and public rights, of the function of 
officials, changes in the constitution, and everything of this 
sort, than could be given by a full semester’s work with the 
students upon the ancient writers themselves. The same 
is true concerning the accomplishments of the ancients in 
the realms of mathematics, mechanics, and natural sci- 
ences in general. Positive knowledge about everything 
that concerns the outer private, or the official public life 
of Greeks and Romans can be effectively learned without 
the aid of the Greek and Latin languages.” * What is it 
then that cannot be learned at a smaller price than the 
mastery of the original text ? 
In seeking to answer the foregoing question, it must 
first be remarked, that in estimating the content value of 
the ancient languages one can hardly consider high-school 
instruction in them as an end in itself, for in large measure, 
especially in Greek, the high-school work is to be considered 
amere preparation for continued study in the college or 
university. In the two years usually given to Greek in our 
secondary schools, the instruction is necessarily confined 
mostly to the linguistic side of the language, to the ac- 
quisition of a vocabulary, and to learning to read. Not 
until after he leaves the high school can the student hope 
to profit by literary training in the Greek tongue. The 
case is better with Latin, for after the ‘Lessons’ and 
1“Handbuch fiir Lehrer Héherer Schulen,” pp. 243-244.
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Cesar are out of the way, even the high-school student 
may come to genuine Latin literature in Cicero and Virgil. 
That colleges and universities demand Latin and some- 
times Greek as an entrance requirement to arts or other 
courses is a good reason for teaching them to students who 
are preparing for those courses, but since the fact that these 
requirements are made is only remotely connected with the 
inherent worth of Latin and Greek, it needs no further 
elucidation here. 
Discussion : — Should high-school instruction in Latin, and 
in Greek, be considered a whole in itself, or a preparation for 
future college work? If the former, what changes are needed ?? 
First of all, when one tries to show the educational 
worth of the content of ancient languages, one needs to 
1 The following from the report of Doctor Dunker, to be found in the 
Reports of the Royal Prussian Industrial Commission of 1904, published 
by the United States Bureau of Education, gives the impressions of 
a distinguished foreigner concerning our short courses in Latin: “In 
the preparation for practical life, the belief in the cultural value of 
Latin plays a much greater part than with us. Formerly it was the 
knowledge of this language that distinguished the literary man from the 
workman, and, with the tenacity of the parvenu in culture, many an 
American adheres to this idea. With the briskness peculiar to him he 
studies for a year, in four weekly lessons, the severe, difficult language 
of Rome, which demands years of devoted work. The idea is still quite 
prevalent that it argues extension of culture to be able to recognize a 
number of Latin roots in the Romanic past of the English vocabulary. 
The proud inscription, ‘Per Pacem ad Libertas,’ in one of the princi- 
pal rooms of the Philippine exhibit at St. Louis, indicates the outcome 
of such classical culture.”
-P-A-G-E-251
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES 239 
examine two things: (1) the inherent worth of ancient 
civilization for the modern student, and (2) the extent 
to which the ancient view of the world, its thought, feeling, 
genius, and spirit, are inseparably united to their language. 
If it can be made out that these things are not worth study- 
ing, or that they can be just as well comprehended through 
the mother-tongue, then all those reasons for teaching the 
ancient languages that pertain to their content value fall 
away, and only the linguistic reasons for teaching them 
remain. 
To one who sees that the modern world has developed 
from the ancient the causal connection of the two is self-evi- 
dent, and it is clear that just as we study the earlier stages 
of plant or animal, so we must study the earlier stages of 
our present civilization if we would understand it aright. 
Both our political and our economic life have developed 
from Rome. To the Roman conception of national unity 
we have added the Anglo-Saxon conception of local self- 
government; while to the Roman laws for private property 
we have added the ideas of codperation, both of capital and 
labor, thereby perfecting with the aid of science and in- 
vention higher forms of industry than the ancient world 
ever knew. But the two root ideas, public patriotism and 
private property, remain unchanged. Again, what does 
not the modern world owe to Greece in literature and art, 
in scientific bent of mind and in philosophy? The achieve- 
ments of this ancient people are not mere objects of specu-
-P-A-G-E-252
  240 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
lative wonder, but they form the very life-blood of modern 
thinking and artistic creation. To students of the devel- 
opment of civilization, the indebtedness of the modern to 
the ancient world is so self-evident as to need no demon- 
stration. 
It being granted then that the products of antique 
culture are still worth studying, we have next to examine 
the claim that the true essence of this culture can be 
obtained only through a study of the languages in which 
they are embodied. This claim is not so self-evident, and 
indeed so difficult is it to prove, that even classicists them- 
selves are sometimes disposed to ignore logical grounds 
and to make a religion of classical study, claiming for it the 
emanation of “ an indefinable somewhat,” which is the true 
essence of classical culture. The weakness of this position 
is that nobody but the worshipper himself is impressed by it. 
The case, however, is not so bad as to need such des- 
perate remedies. To the philologist, who says to an 
ancient people, “ Speak that I may see you,” it has become 
an axiom that the language of a nation is the mirror of 
its inner life; for what is language but the expression of 
what is deepest in the intellectual, moral, and esthetic 
life of the people who use it? Even in these modern days 
of international commerce of goods and thoughts, the same 
thing is essentially true, as seen in English, Germanic, and 
Romance languages; how much more true then must 
it be of a language that is the expression of a closed
-P-A-G-E-253
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES 241 
system of national life! This inner spirit expresses itself 
not only through inflectional endings and sentence struc- 
ture, showing wide-reaching distinctions as well as subtle 
shades of thought, but especially also in the artistic forms 
of lyric, dramatic, and epic verse. To miss these linguistic 
forms and artistic refinements when studying the content 
of ancient civilizations, is to contemplate a body from which 
the life-giving spirit has departed. By means of this 
immediate contact of the youthful mind with that which is 
eternally young in the thought and emotion of the race, 
the youth is able to clear up his inner world, and to protect 
himself against the conventionalities that compass him 
about. Here he is able to feel the full pulse of that ancient 
world which, though now pronounced old, is still ever 
young, in that he penetrates deeply into the idioms, the 
linguistic refinements, and the artistic perfections of the 
ancient literary masterpieces. With the Roman he feels 
the force of death-defying love of country, the need of 
political unity, the sacredness of private right and public 
duty; with the Greek he feels the force of beautiful 
creations, the musical accord of body and soul, the force 
of accurate thinking and philosophic comprehension. If, 
unlike the Greek, he accords these insights, efficiencies, 
and aspirations to all men according to the measure of 
their ability, opportunity, and ambition and not only to 
the few alone who are called the free, why then these men- 
tal treasures grow rich as they become universal. 
R

Discussion: — 1. Value of ancient languages as products of 
ancient civilizations. 2. What classes of students should be 
advised to study Latin? Greek? ‘ 
The ancient languages have other educational val- 
ues more specific than those mentioned above. The Eng- 
lish language is particularly rich in Latin roots, while the 
nomenclature of science is largely derived from the Greek. 
For this reason both languages are of importance in the 
study of English etymology. 
To the specialist in philology, archeology, or in litera- 
ture, perhaps also in history and philosophy, they are a 
necessity, since they form the sources whence all real en- 
lightenment comes. The cry of modern scholarship is 
always, Back to Sources. Indeed, it may be declared, once 
for all, that to the scholar as specialist these languages 
are the necessary tools for his investigations, since with- 
out them he is like a man in a fog, having to feel his way. 
Many other claims more or less well founded have 
been made for the study of ancient languages, and many 
eloquent words have been uttered on their behalf. Thus, 
Goethe says that a man who knows no foreign language 
cannot adequately know his own; the saying, “one has 
as many souls as one understands languages,” is attributed 
to King Theodoric and also to Emperor Charles the Fifth; 
to Von Humboldt is ascribed the assertion that there lies 
in every language a specific view of the world and that the 
student gets a new view for every foreign language he
-P-A-G-E-255
    FUNCTION AND WORTH OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES 243 
learns; Fichte said, “The language treasure of the scien- 
? a modern work tific world lies in the ancient tongues; ’ 
on Thomas Aquinas declares, ‘The church everywhere 
takes with it the Latin language and the dogma developed 
after the thought forms of the Greeks, so that Greek 
wisdom and Roman power follow her, however far she may 
wander through the centuries; so likewise do the sons of 
the proud Brahmins on the Ganges learn Latin and study 
the Aristotelian philosophy, as hundreds of years ago the 
sons of Franks and Saxons began to exercise themselves 
in Latin speech and Aristotelian dialectic.” 
One need not rely on the voices of the past, however, 
for one’s estimates of the value of these old subjects, for 
they assume new aspects with every generation. Each 
period must examine them anew. The modern teacher can 
easily fortify himself with facts and reasons applicable to 
his time, by examining their linguistic function and the 
comparative worth of their esthetic and ethical content. 
Discussion : — Relative validity of the foregoing claims. 
(4) The: Modern Foreign Languages 
French and German, the modern foreign languages 
most taught in American high schools, may to a certain 
extent perform the same functions in education that 
the ancient languages do. Their position, however, as 
living languages, renders them less fit than the ancient 
tongues for some purposes, and more fit for others. It is
-P-A-G-E-256
244 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
generally declared on the one hand and conceded on the 
other that French and German are not so well adapted to 
give thoroughgoing linguistic training as are Latin and 
Greek. The reasons are not far toseek. In the first place, 
they are less highly inflected, so that thought distinctions are 
not so perfectly mirrored in grammatical forms. In the 
next place, it is much easier to gain a reading knowledge 
of modern than of ancient languages, and the student 
therefore more quickly comes to the point where the 
content is of much more subjective value than the form. 
In addition to these inherent reasons, we have the addi- 
tional consideration, that such linguistic training, even were 
it possible, is not desirable where there has been thorough 
grammatical training in an ancient language. On the 
grounds, therefore, that good linguistic discipline can be 
more effectively obtained elsewhere, and that when Latin 
has been well taught, further discipline of this kind is not 
so desirable as other things, we may fairly come to the 
conclusion that the earlier attempt to teach French and 
German in the same way and from the same motives that 
Latin and Greek are taught should now be abandoned. 
If, however, French and German do not easily yield the 
grammatical training of the older languages, they have 
certain advantages that give them an especial educational 
value. As living speech they are capable of furnishing to 
ear and tongue a training that is comparable to that fur- 
nished to the eye by Latin and Greek. They have, more-
-P-A-G-E-257
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES 245 
over, a vast body of literature that has sprung, not from 
heathen, but from Christian sources, and which mirrors 
life as it is, and not as it was. In addition to these strictly 
educational values, they have also great worth as in- 
struments of research and communication. 
It is the good fortune of English-speaking peoples that 
both French and German are philologically closely related 
to the mother-tongue, and hence comparatively easy to ac- 
quire. The basis of English is Anglo-Saxon, while a large 
part of its subsequent acquisition is Norman-French. 
The latter fact explains also why at least the beginnings 
of a Latin vocabulary are so readily acquired by those 
whose mother-tongue is English. Considering, then, the 
inadequacy of French and German to furnish the best 
grammatical training, and their superiority as to practical 
utility and literary wealth, how shall we realize most 
fully their value for modern education ? 
The new European reform movement for the teaching of 
modern foreign languages embraces the following main 
features: — 
1. There must be a free and accurate enunciation of 
elementary sounds, a ready and correct pronunciation of 
words, fluency in reading, and correctness of intonation. 
The basis for this training of ear and voice lies in compara- 
tive phonetics, as exhibited in the Vietor system. 
2. Grammatical knowledge of a modern foreign lan- 
guage is to be limited to what is strictly necessary to an
-P-A-G-E-258
246 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
understanding and use of it, and must never be separated 
from the living content. The basis for this linguistic mas- 
tery lies in an inductive grammatical study of what is read. 
3. Students shall be trained to a ready and accurate 
use of the language as fast as they learn it. The achieve- 
ments of Director Walter and his colleagues of the Reform 
Gymnasium at Frankfort a. M. in training students to use 
the words they learn are worthy of study by American 
teachers of modern foreign languages.‘ Training in 
writing and speaking a modern foreign language shall 
not cease until the student possesses, not only a language 
consciousness for the new tongue, but also a language 
sense, which forms an instinctive guide to correct usage. 
For example, the American student of German shall be 
able to use the correct gender of nouns without having 
to reflect upon the matter. 
4. Through the study of literary masterpieces, the 
student shall gain a comprehensive view of the national 
culture, past and present, of the people whose language 
he studies; also familiarity with their modes of life and 
thought. In other words he shall be able to think, feel, 
and, if desirable, act as a German or a Frenchman would. 
How much room for future achievements these ideals 
open to American teachers of French and German can be 
inferred from an inspection of our present accomplish- 
ments in this field.

words directly with ideas. 2. The Berlitz and other conver-

German aim to develop the power simply to read, or should it

American with foreign literary and industrial conditions. 
(5) The Mother-Tongue 
The Greeks appear to have been the only European 
people who were able to educate their children without 
deeming it necessary to teach foreign languages. Some 
may think that having the best language for their mother- 
tongue, they naturally needed no other; while others might 
take the ground that all valuable knowledge was better ex- 
hibited in Greek than in any other language. At any rate 
in the early days, before the rise of philosophy, they were 
content with the literary treasures of Homer, while later 
they added the linguistic training devised by the Sophists. 
It would at least be an interesting experiment to see what 
an American high school with good teachers could accom- 
plish with a curriculum without foreign languages, and 
with as much time given to English as is now devoted 
to the combined study of English and foreign tongues. 
The modern scholar in Germany stands in sharp con- 
trast to the ancient Greek. If the Greek confined all 
linguistic and literary training to his mother-tongue, the 
German has devoted so much attention to foreign lan-
-P-A-G-E-260
248 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
guages that he has paralyzed his power to use his own, at 
least in public speech. The following sketch from Lyon * 
shows the result and then the cause: ‘‘ Whoever contem- 
plates the history of our parliamentary oratory is aston- 
ished at the helplessness with which at the beginning the 
language-trained German appeared in public. It was 
only gradually that he attained the command of free 
oral speech, and even to-day good speakers, those who 
have a really good style, are a rarity in Germany. Many 
of them tremble even yet when they are to speak in public, 
and the most of them lose themselves in helpless windings 
or in whole series of meaningless sentences and repetitions. 
All this is to be explained by lack’of practice and conse- 
quent embarrassment. It is precisely the representatives 
of our highest culture who show this weakness most. 
What most prevents our German public speakers from 
having a happy fluency of oral speech is the fear of making 
mistakes, with which fear our youth are thoroughly 
inoculated, since in our schools correctness of speech in 
German and foreign languages takes precedence over 
everything else. Prince Bismarck, however, almost 
never used smooth sentences and faultless constructions, 
yet his speech came like molten metal, clear and penetrat- 
ing and overpowering through the forceful structure of the 
whole.”

Since 1890 when the German Kaiser declared that the 
German gymnasiums lacked a national basis, and that for 
the future they must be more concerned with educating 
young Germans than young Greeks and Romans, additional 
attention has been paid to instruction in the German 
language. Countless monographs, elaborate text-books, 
and now even a colossal ‘‘ Handbuch,”! are devoted to the 
subject. Similar movements are now in progress in other 
European countries. 
Discussion: —1. Educational merits and defects of a 
secondary education without foreign languages. 2. Other 
influences in the study of foreign languages that tend to impair 
the facile use of the mother-tongue. 3. What aspects promote 
facility in use? 
Modern schoolmen have ceased to have doubts as to 
the adequacy and necessity of the mother-tongue as the 
great instrument of science, of commerce, of culture, of 
political and social life, and of daily communication both 
oral and written. The questions which divide them are: 
(x) Do we need any specific instruction in the vernacular, 
which is of necessity the primary presupposition of all 
acquisition and expression of thought ? Is not the native 
tongue the natural inspiration and expiration of the soul ? 
Why teach English to English-speaking students any more 
than we teach breathing? (2) Can the mother-tongue be

len.”

  250 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
made an effective instrument of linguistic and literary 
training? Does it not lack inflection? What can take 
the place of translation as an ever present means of inciting 
the youth to linguistic effort and of furnishing him with 
an exhaustless method of discovering and solving linguistic 
problems? Is not the translation of Latin and Greek 
texts the best possible training in composition? Do not 
the reading and appreciation of literature in English come 
of themselves when a student is admitted to the library? 
Like reading with Dogberry, do they not come by nature? 
Why try to teach them? 
It has been shown above that the ancient languages are 
of great and presumably of permanent importance in the 
development of what is called language consciousness, but 
we must also at once admit that this theoretical insight into 
the intricacies of speech no longer, in the case of the foreign 
languages, passes over into that stage which we call 
language sense, whereby one instinctively uses the language 
correctly for oral and written communication. Since 
Erasmus few have been able to use Latin like a mother- 
tongue. Furthermore, no study of ancient languages 
appears to enable the student to transmute the language 
consciousness derived from them into a complete language 
sense in the mother-tongue, unless perhaps in the matters of 
diction and of insight into distinctions of thought. Trans- 
lation, which must perforce follow the sentence if not the 
word order of the original, may indeed enrich the diction
-P-A-G-E-263
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF THE MOTHER-IONGUE 251 
and sharpen the wits, but how can it be depended upon 
as the sole means for producing a fluent, untrammelled 
flow of original thought in the mother-tongue? Without 
this free flow, as from a fountain, a genuine, far- 
reaching language sense for English can hardly be said 
to exist. 
The chief function, then, of English as an object of 
special study in the high school must be conceived to be 
transmuting the language sense which our birthright gives 
us into a higher language sense by means of the language 
consciousness developed mostly through foreign tongues, 
but also in a measure through the study of English itself. 
The cycle is as follows: (1) the immediate language sense 
inhering in the vernacular; (2) the language consciousness 
obtained through linguistic study of English and foreign 
languages; (3) the resulting scientific and literary language 
sense, which is one of the noblest possessions of the 
educated man. 
That this crowning achievement can never be completely 
attained without a direct study of the vernacular itself 
is the prevailing conviction, not only of English-speaking, 
but also of other modern culture nations. To the first 
question, then, Do we need instruction in the mother- 
tongue? the answer must be an emphatic yes. To the 
second question, Can the mother-tongue be made an 
effective instrument for creating the higher language 
sense ? the answer is, it has already been made such an
-P-A-G-E-264
  252 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
instrument to a degree that warrants further efforts at 
development. 
If science was able in forty years to perfect for itself a 
method that places it on a plane with the best that the 
humanities can exhibit, why should not the teaching of 
the vernacular be capable of similar didactic development ? 
The English teacher is in the happy position of the early 
American who saw before him a continent to develop. 
If Chatham could then exclaim, “ Were I not an English- 
man, I would be an American,” so can the teacher of 
ancient languages likewise exclaim, “ Were I not a 
teacher of the old, I would be a teacher of the new.” 
Concerning the need of teaching English literature in 
the high school there can likewise be no serious question. 
That it is perhaps the richest literature of all times is 
claimed by Anglo-Saxons and often admitted by the 
scholars of other nations. As such it is worthy of atten- 
tion in the school. If the Greek could find almost his 
whole intellectual and ethical training in a far less devel- 
oped literary treasure, surely we can find enough such 
training in one that is far greater, richer, and more diver- 
sified to warrant us in devoting the necessary time and 
labor to this end. It is too early to know whether this 
school instruction in literary masterpieces will materially 
aid in producing literary masters; but of this we may 
be assured, it will help to produce a vast body of appre- 
ciative readers for the masterpieces that have been or

may be produced. It will appreciably raise the literary 
standards of our people, and conduce to the development 
of that unalloyed happiness that comes from communing 
with the ablest and purest minds the world produces. 
Discussion: —1. In what ways does the study of foreign 
languages promote the higher language sense in the English ? 
2. Analyze into its prominent features the best English in- 
struction observed in secondary schools. 
GROUP V. THE FINE ARTS 
The fine arts are architecture, sculpture, painting, 
music, and poetry. In the high school they are repre- 
sented mostly by drawing, singing, and literature, and to 
a certain extent by moulding, designing, elocution, and 
rhetoric. 
Having in view the fact that the technical element of 
art is more prominent than the intellectual mastery of 
its fundamental ideas, or the esthetic appreciation of 
its merits, German writers on education often regard 
drawing and singing as mere techniques (Fertigkeiten), 
and attach them to the course of study as desirable ap- 
pendices. Such a disposition of the fine arts not only 
belittles their importance in education, but also obscures 
the organic nature of the curriculum. No study is worth 
much in education without its technique, and conversely 
no technique is worth much that is not grounded in in- 
sight,. that is, in intellectual mastery and esthetic, ethi-
-P-A-G-E-266
    254 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
cal, or other form of appreciation. The two elements, 
insight and technique, however, vary greatly in their char- 
acter and relative emphasis." 
Art has two elements, one of content and one of 
expression, and might be defined as a means of revealing 
the ideal through a sense medium. The content of art 
is therefore of an intellectual or conceptual nature, while 
its material means of expression (stone, brick, wood, 
bronze, marble, color, tone, word) appear in the three 
forms of regularity, symmetry, and harmony. The ideal, 
or conceptual element may rise from the simplest to the 
most exalted theme, as from Goethe’s violet crushed by 
the foot of the careless maid to the greatest conceptions 
of classic and religious art as seen in the Apollo Belvedere 
or the Sistine Madonna. The sensuous element may 
likewise range from the simple rhythm of monotonous 
repetition to the perfect harmony of diverse elements as 
seen in the Parthenon, the Winged Victory, the Last 
Judgment, a Beethoven symphony, or a tragedy by 
Homer, Goethe, or Shakespeare. 
sthetics as a department of philosophy undertakes 
to explain the fundamental conceptions of art, and to 
show why the various combinations of the sensuous ele- 
ments please and elevate the mind. Even an elementary 
study of esthetics will greatly aid the teacher in enabling 
him to cultivate in his students an appreciation of art. 
+ Compare Section 88.
-P-A-G-E-267
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF THE FINE ARTS 255 
One of the most important of the many treatises upon 
esthetics is that by Hegel, of which Dr. Wm. T. Harris 
has given a concrete outline in his “ Psychologic Founda- 
tions of Education.”” A more modern work of much 
value to the teacher is William Knight’s ‘ Philosophy of 
the Beautiful.” 
As Dr. Harris says, “The three highest activities of 
the soul deal with the beautiful, the good, and the true.” 
Science in the broad sense reveals the true; ethics and 
religion deal with the good, while esthetics deals with 
the beautiful. To the high-school student, however, 
the beautiful appears not as abstract theory, but as con- 
crete art. If he is to have his powers of appreciation and 
his skill in execution developed, it must be through con- 
templation of works of art and practice in representing 
them, chiefly through drawing on the one hand, and 
singing on the other. The esthetic importance of the 
study of literature has already been considered, so that 
what remains is to show in outline the specific educational 
functions of drawing and singing. 
Discussion: — Compare Hegel’s “Philosophy of Art,” 
as seen in Dr. Harris’s ‘‘Psychologic Foundations,” with the 
origins of art as exhibited by such writers as Spencer, Grosse, 
and Hirn, as a guide to the teaching of art. 
The first and most obvious function of these arts 
is to enhance the student’s powers of esthetic apprecia-
-P-A-G-E-268
ee Nee ee ee ne Cpt TET Tee Fee ene eam 
256 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
tion for the forms of art involved in drawing and singing, 
since these exercises give an insight into the laws of regu- 
larity, symmetry, and harmony as elements of expression 
that can be obtained so effectively in no other way. The 
exercise of these arts, moreover, helps to develop the mind’s 
latent power of appreciation of what is most satisfying 
in the ideals of art. 
In addition to this general function of these high-school 
forms of art study, each has important specific functions. 
Drawing trains the eye and the hand, whereas singing 
trains the ear and the vocal organs. 
A new sort and quality of observation is demanded the 
moment the student tries to represent objects by the aid 
of the pencil, for not only must he see precisely all the 
details of form, but he must look at the world as if it were 
flat, and yet must at the same time see how its depth 
can be represented by shade and perspective. When one 
considers for a moment the enormous importance of sight 
in the formation of our mental images, one can perceive 
the educational significance of such a systematic training 
in exactness of vision as is involved in drawing. Nor is 
the value of this training limited to the esthetic field, 
but extends into almost every department of practical 
life, finding its applications in all the natural and most 
of the humanistic sciences, as seen in the designing of 
machines, in manual, decorative, and other useful arts. 
In all of these, the sure eye and the skilful hand, so highly 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF THE FINE ARTS 257 
prized by Rousseau, find unlimited scope. Drawing, 
therefore, in high-school education has three educational 
functions not fulfilled by any other department of study: 
(x) It contributes to esthetic appreciation the element 
that comes alone through efforts to construct the esthetic 
forms of space; (2) it compels a kind and keenness of 
observation not found elsewhere, in that it combines exact- 
ness of detail in observation of tri-dimensional objects with 
their representation in two-dimensional space; and (3) 
it makes the hand skilful, not only in a fine art, but also 
in many useful arts. 
Modern nations have become aware of the fact that art 
instruction in the schools has immediate and important 
relations to industry. England learned this at her first 
world exposition in 1851, and the American public 
became increasingly aware of it in 1876 at Philadelphia 
and again at Chicago in 1893. To cite an instance, — 
Sweden and Norway, the inventors of wood sloyd, were so 
inartistic in their productions that in 1881 they were able 
to export to the United States but $137 worth of manu- 
factured wooden articles, whereas Belgium, a nation 
having the artistic qualities of the French, sent $118,146 
of this class of goods, i.e., nearly one thousand times as 
much. Other causes may have entered into this result, 
which, however, is so startling as to be instructive. 
“Tn 1851, at the World’s Exposition in London, it 
became evident that English industries were not of such

a character as to compete with those of France and Bel- 
gium. -Prince Albert, wise and thoughtful as he was, 
set about a deep-reaching system of education that should 
correct the national defect and recover the prestige of 
British arts and manufactures. The South Kensington 
Museum was established, and day and evening art schools 
set up in all manufacturing centres. The museum placed 
at its foundation a collection of works of art showing the 
history of art — its beginnings, its high-water marks, and 
its fluctuations. On this basis instruction was given in 
those forms of ornamentation that the world has pro- 
nounced beautiful. There began from this time a gradual 
rise in the taste of the English workman; from being an 
artisan pure and simple he began to be an artist. Eng- 
land has gone forward rapidly in the direction of producing 
works of taste, and her useful manufactures, heretofore 
made without reference to beauty, have improved in 
tastefulness of design and execution. 
“The establishment of a great national art gallery, the 
Louvre, and the studies of French savants in the canons 
of good taste had long before revolutionized French manu- 
factures and given France the supremacy in the world 
market for goods that command high prices and ready 
sale. 
“Taking hint from England, we have had in this country 
something of the fever for education in art, especially 
in the lines of industrial drawing. Remarkable as has
-P-A-G-E-271
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF THE FINE ARTS 2590 
been our progress in the matter, yet there is a prevalent 
lack of insight into the true direction and significance of 
this branch of industrial drawing. We have had much 
stress laid on geometric drawing and the construction of 
working drawings, as well as the old-fashioned system of 
drawing pictures of objects, and we have had much in- 
vention of original designs, founded on the basis of regu- 
larity and symmetry, but we have had very little of a 
really high order of esthetics.” * 
Singing trains the ear in the perception of tone and 
rhythm and to the sure distinction of musical inter- 
vals, while at the same time it develops the vocal organs 
and contributes materially to correct breathing. It is 
through singing that the student gets his first clear in- 
sight into the nature of vowels and consonants, in that 
he finds the vowels can be prolonged while the consonants 
as a rule cannot. The breathing exercises possibly help 
the student to acquire a feeling for the correct construc- 
tion of sentences, as he must take breath at the right 
places. This again aids in good declamation, while the 
developed sense of rhythm and time contribute to an 
appreciation of the same elements in poetry. Singing, 
then, has also three great educational functions not ade- 
quately performed by other subjects: (1) It contributes 
essentially to the appreciation of those forms of art that

find their expression in time, primarily music and secon- 
darily poetry; (2) it trains the ear to nice discriminations 
in sound and rhythm; and (3) it develops the vocal organs. 
In these ways singing contributes to the perfection of one 
of the purest and most gratifying accomplishments known 
to man, that of vocal song.

GROUP VI. HISTORY 
Fundamentally, history is the story of man and all 
that favors or hinders his progress in well-being — the 
influences of his environment whether natural or human 
that have affected him, the responses he has made to the 
stimuli of this environment, the institutions he has de- 
vised to fix and transmit his advances; in short, the whole 
account of his efforts, mishaps, failures, and successes as 
a social being. 
The leading theme of history, however, is political 
progress; the rise, growth, and development of states, 
nations, empires; their collisions, conquests, and alliances, 
all to one great and often unconscious end; namely, the 
progress of the individual in civil rights and duties, his de- 
velopment toward freedom and self-government. To the
-P-A-G-E-273
  
FUNCTION AND WORTH OF HISTORY 261 
astonished eye of youth, history portrays the superlatively 
great in human affairs; great battles, the clash of empires, 
supreme national exertions and sacrifices, all-compassing 
patriotism and self-sacrifice on the part of the leaders 
of society, towering ambitions, overpowering military 
genius, and epoch-making initiative on the part of states- 
men and warriors. It is in history that the young first 
learn to regard the present as the last attained stage of 
a mighty evolution, and thereby acquire reverence for the 
vicarious sacrifices of the past, regard for the civil liberties 
of the present, and a sense of responsibility for the civil 
welfare of coming generations. 
Discussion : — Should history be regarded as a generalizing 
science like economics, or as one that merely traces specific 
effects to their specific sources? See Publications of the 
American Economic Association, Third Series, No. 2, pp. 137- 
199. 
Besides influencing and even forming the student’s 
permanent attitude of mind regarding civil rights, duties 
and responsibilities, history performs a number of intel- 
lectual and ethical functions that are largely peculiar to 
itself, the most important of which may be mentioned. 
1. History is preéminently the realm of the contingent, 
that is, of a class of causes and effects which, unlike those 
revealed by natural science, do not follow the invariable 
order of natural law, but are influenced and sometimes 
determined by circumstances that might have been other-
-P-A-G-E-274
  
262 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
wise. This does not mean that no law can be observed 
among these phenomena, for that would not be true. 
Yet these laws lack the apodictic certainty of those realms 
of science with which the will of man has nothing to do. 
For illustration, the result of battle often depends not upon 
numbers and equipments alone, but upon accidents of 
field and flood, the unforeseen presence of natural ob- 
stacles, like the sunken road at Waterloo, the freshness 
or weariness of the troops, their flood and ebb of courage, 
the genius, stupidity, jealousy, caprice, intelligence, or 
information of the officers. The mental attitude of a 
people is generally influenced if not determined by their 
economic situation; often by prejudices engendered by the 
quarrels, sometimes personal, of party leaders, and not 
seldom in the past by differences in religious opinion and 
practices, whereby men not unfrequently lost their natural 
reason. In short, historical results are a resultant of forces 
both natural and human, wherein the accidents of the 
one and the defects of the other play their part. If it 
is insisted that these causes are still “ natural,’ and the 
results inevitable, then it must be urged that these causes 
are often indeterminable, so that both causes and effects 
are nevertheless contingent. 
From the contingent nature of historical causes arises 
the first great function of historical training; namely, the 
development of judgment respecting the civil affairs of 
men. This judgment enables its possessor duly to weigh
-P-A-G-E-275
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF HISTORY 263 
the motives, preconceptions, prejudices, and capacities 
both of individuals and communities; it enables him to 
estimate the probable effects of deviation from funda- 
mental principles, to forecast the transforming force of 
new conditions of political life, like the influence of trusts 
and labor unions, or property and intelligence qualifica- 
tions for suffrage; it shows how dependent political opinion 
is upon birth, geographical location, and supposed eco- 
nomic advantage. The satirist sometimes declares that 
when the rains fail along the western border of the Mis- 
sissippi basin, the farmers let their hair grow long and 
start a new political party. If on the one hand, however, 
the historical student is inclined to condemn the weak- 
ness and inconsequence of political opinions, he may on 
the other easily satisfy himself of how true and faithful 
even unto death the people are when the great seer re- 
veals to them in unmistakable terms their sacred rights 
and their more sacred duties. 
2. Next in importance to training in sound political 
judgment, and growing out of the contingent nature of 
historical causes, is the spirit of toleration thereby en- 
gendered. He who reasons mathematically concerning 
the right or wrong of historical actions is necessarily 
intolerant, for mathematics has no place for caprice, 
interest, personal bias, or the influence of birth or party 
affiliation. But historical judgment can take note of 
these and other contingent causes and can enable the  
-P-A-G-E-276
  264 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
judge to put himself in the other man’s place, to see with 
his eyes, feel with his heart, and act with his decision and 
energy in the same way he acted. When men are in the 
midst of heated conflicts, either of arms or ideas, they 
are prone to forget toleration and sound political judg- 
ment. It is history, which views events after the fires 
of partisanship are dead, that enables men to recover 
their lost perspective, to understand aright, and finally, 
when judgment must be passed upon the moral aspect of 
any great struggle, to pass it with a full knowledge of all 
the contingent causes and with a magnanimity of spirit 
that transforms the partisan into the patriot. It is this 
spirit that robs defeat of its sting and victory of its exulta- 
tion over a defeated opponent. History sends the youth 
into the world disposed to be fair and tolerant toward 
his fellows whether in party or in national opposition, to 
be predisposed to free himself from prejudice and unreason, 
and to regard political differences in the light of all the 
circumstances. How much unreasoning hatred toward 
England has in the past been engendered in American 
youth by the study of history written in the spirit of 
partisanship and intolerance! Happily that epoch 
is now past and we are able to view England through 
the eyes of such historians as John Fiske and Goldwin 
Smith. 
3. History trains the student in the exercise of what 
may be called the reconstructive imagination, in that it
-P-A-G-E-277

calls upon him to picture outgrown modes of thought and 
feeling, to construct images of old social customs, to imag- 
ine the influence of an economic, political, and social life 
almost totally different from that of the present. Reason- 
ing always upon the basis of this image of old conditions 
the student is called upon to reconstruct the whole social 
consciousness of the people whom he is studying. He 
must be able to see, feel, and act with them, thus making 
himself for the time being a new personality. Assuming 
that the youth who thus reconstructs the past will want 
to imagine himself one of the leaders, he will be now an 
Egyptian priest or soldier; now a Greek freeman, land- 
owner and noble, if not a philosopher; now a feudal 
lord or a medizval church dignitary; or in modern times 
a Drake, a Napoleon, or a merchant prince. The play of 
fantasy involved in this change of personality gives great 
flexibility to the imagination of youth. It is a legitimate 
successor to the imagination of the child who is ready to 
‘play’ any réle his fancy suggests; and it is allied to 
the form involved in trying to live into the consciousness 
of a foreign nation through the study of their language. 
On the other hand, it differs radically from the forms of 
imagination involved in natural science and geometry, 
since they are constructive in a different sense. 
4. The exercise of the memory in history takes on new 
forms because of the contingent nature of the causes. It 
is causal, or rational, to the extent to which events are   
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
remembered through their causes, but the memory for 
the causes themselves often partakes of the mechanical, 
since they could not have been foreseen, but must simply 
be remembered. There is also room for a large amount 
of purely mechanical memory in this study, as every 
teacher who has prepared for an examination in history 
well knows. How to enable the student to secure the 
most lasting retention for the important events in his- 
tory is an ever present problem to the teacher. 
5. Finally, historical study should materially assist the 
student to develop his permanent attitude toward polit- 
ical liberty and self-government. If he is a member of 
a democratic society like our own, he will see not only the 
lasting good in democracy, but he will also see and in his 
measure be able to promote the conditions necessary 
for its successful continuance. With such an insight and 
disposition as history is able to give him, he will not be 
shaken by tempests in teapots, will not lose his faith in 
political freedom because some men remember their 
privileges and forget their responsibilities, but he will 
do his share in promoting public intelligence and arousing 
public conscience, thus like St. Paul, fighting the good 
fight and keeping the faith. 
Discussion: — 1. Which is more effective with high-school 
students, history treated as a science, or history treated as a 
literary art? 2. In what sense does history belong to #s- 
thetics?

Norte. — Mr. Charles Henry Firth in his “Plea for the Historical 
Teaching of History,” London, 1904, says: “Men give opposite an- 
swers according to their conception of the methods and objects of the 
historian. One tells us that history is a science, nothing more and 
nothing less; another that it is an art and that one only succeeds in it 
by imagination. To me it seems to lie between these twoextremes. His- 
tory is neither, but it partakes of the nature of both.” 
C. THE Economic ScreNcEs 
GROUP VII 
(1) Economics 
Although economics as a science is not yet generally 
taught in high schools, the economic aspects of secondary 
education have become so numerous and important as 
to justify an economic group in the classification of studies. 
Whenever society enters distinctively into a new phase 
of its evolution, there must be a new distribution of edu- 
cational values. In a hundred years civilized society the 
world over has changed the whole tone of its existence. 
If it was once speculative and subjective, it is now scien- 
tific and objective; if once it was agricultural and rural, 
it is now industrial and urban. Speaking of our industrial 
evolution, Professor Dewey says: “The change that over- 
shadows and even controls all others is the industrial 
one — the application of science resulting in the great 
inventions that have utilized the forces of nature on a 
vast and inexpensive scale; the growth of a world-wide 
market as the object of production, of vast manufacturing 
centres to supply this market, of cheap and rapid means
-P-A-G-E-280
268 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
of communication and distribution between all its parts. 
Even as to its feebler beginnings, this change is not much 
more than a century old; in many of its most important 
aspects it falls within the short span of those now living. 
One can hardly believe there has been a revolution in all 
history so rapid, so extensive, and so complete.”* 
Fortunately for America, public and educational senti- 
ment had been able to keep within reasonable distance of 
the stages of this industrial revolution, so that society 
is ready to utilize its best educational products in this 
new field, and the schools have been able in some degree 
at least to prepare the individual to devote his powers suc- 
cessfully to the new needs. Germany is an illustration of 
a land in which industrial progress has greatly outstripped 
educational development and social sentiment. The result 
is an “ educated proletariat,” to use Prince Bismarck’s 
phrase, or, in other words, overproduction in the world 
of scholarship. Outside of a few great commercial cen- 
tres, like Hamburg and Bremen, social sentiment does not 
permit an educated man to use his talents and learning 
for the promotion of industry, but dictates that he shall 
work in a learned profession or a civil office. With in- 
creasing industrial prosperity the higher schools and uni- 
versities double their attendance every few years, while 
the possible places in official or professional life can but 
keep pace with the general increase of population. Here

we have an educational application of the famous Mal- 
thusian doctrine of the relation between food-supply and 
population. According to Russell,* to secure a permanent 
appointment as a teacher, a man must wait and work 
without salary on an average for a period of nearly six 
years (five or six years) after he has finished his university 
course. The “ Associated Physicians of Germany” an- 
nounce through the daily press that there are ten appli- 
cants for every position open in the medical profession. 
When it is remembered that not alone social prejudice, 
but also long years of highly specialized education, prevent 
a man trained in one field from successfully entering an- 
other, one can see how great a hardship it is to be confined 
to a calling in which the applicants outnumber ten to one 
the possible openings. Thanks, however, to our demo- 
cratic sentiment, our readiness to fit our education to the 
needs of our students, and to the unrivalled opportunities 
opened to every variety of talent, we hardly know the 
meaning of the term overproduction as applied to educated 
men. 
So imperative is the need of adjusting our education to 
our new industrial life, that President Eliot attempts a 
new definition of the cultivated man. In addition to 
the old concepts of what constitutes the cultivated man, 
he introduces some elements decidedly modern, as may 
be inferred from a few extracts from his address: — 
+“German Higher Schools,” p. 373. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
    270 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
“The rising generation should think hard, and feel 
keenly, just where the men and women who constitute 
the actual human world are thinking and feeling to-day. 
“Combine the knowledge of literature with knowledge 
of the ‘stream of the world,’ and you have united two 
large sources of the influence of the cultivated person. 
“Culture can no longer imply a knowledge of every- 
thing, not even a little knowledge of everything. It must 
be content with general knowledge of some things, and 
a real mastery of some small portion of the human store. 
“The imagination is the greatest of human powers, 
no matter in what field it works — in art or literature, 
in mechanical invention, in science, government, commerce, 
or religion; and the training of the imagination is, there- 
fore, far the most important part of education. 
“That great century (the nineteenth) has taught us 
that, on the whole, the scientific imagination is quite as 
productive for human service as the literary or poetic 
imagination. 
“Let us as teachers accept no single element or kind of 
culture as the one essential; let us remember that the best 
fruits of real culture are an open mind, broad sympathies, 
and respect for all the diverse achievements of the human 
intellect at whatever stage of development they may ac- 
tually be — the stage of fresh discovery, or bold explora- 
tion, or complete conquest. Let us remember that the 
moral elements of the new education are individual

FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ECONOMICS 271 
choice of studies and career among a great, new variety 
of studies and careers, early responsibility accompanying 
this freedom of choice, love of truth now that truth may 
be directly sought through rational inquiry, and an om- 
nipotent sense of social obligation. Those moral elements 
are so strong that the new forms of culture are likely to 
prove themselves quite as productive of morality, high- 
mindedness, and idealism as the old.” * 
Discussion: —1. What hinders a rapid readjustment of 
education to modern conditions? 2. Is a fair degree of 
educational balance still possible and desirable in secondary 
education? (See paragraph 3 of President Eliot’s definition.) 
The theme of economics is the study of society from 
the standpoint of wealth, or material well-being. First, 
it investigates theoretically the laws and conditions of 
wealth production, while practically education in eco- 
nomics endeavors to prepare the citizen for efficient ser- 
vice in such production; this gives rise to manual train- 
ing and other forms of industrial education. Again, 
economics investigates theoretically the laws and condi- 
tions of wealth exchange, while the school also tries to 
promote practical efficiency on the part of its students 
in effecting the exchange; this gives rise to schools and 
departments of commerce. Finally economics investi- 
gates the laws of consumption and the consequent stand-

ard of life among the people, turning its attention to 
the burning question of the proper relation between the 
possibilities of earning and the cultural necessities for 
spending. Even if there is no special department of 
school education which trains to rational consumption, 
yet school economics should at least try to impart rational 
ideals regarding minimum standards of life, and the duty 
of society to raise them among the masses. 
Discussion: — 1. Is it wise to include elementary economics 
as a distinct study in any high-school course? in which? 
2. Value to the teacher of a study of economics. 
As explained in Section 30, the studies of the eco- 
nomic group may be regarded as compounds arising from 
the application of pure sciences to industrial or material 
welfare. Here we see the exact, the biological, and the 
earth sciences joining with history, modern foreign lan- 
guages, anthropology, etc., to lay the foundations of in- 
dustrial welfare, and to prepare the individual both on the 
side of insight and upon that of efficiency to play an hon- 
orable and useful part therein. 
What was said under history as to using the powers of 
reason, imagination, and memory, upon that which is 
partly natural law-and partly contingency, holds likewise 
of economics, with this difference: that whereas in history 
they apply to political evolution, the growth of mankind 
in civil liberty and self-government, in economics they
-P-A-G-E-285
  FUNCTION AND WORTH OF ECONOMICS 273 
apply to the daily industrial life about us. History and 
economic theory determine political policy. With respect 
to the combination of the law-accordant and the con- 
tingent, the two departments give substantially the 
same mental training, preparing the man of the world for 
correct judgment in that realm of human affairs where it is 
necessary to apply scientific categories, but at the same 
time to allow for contingencies. 
Economics, unlike history, abounds in generalizations, 
like Ricardo’s law of rent, Malthus’ law of population, 
the law of diminishing returns, etc., which are however 
more or less modified by the contingent. Thus, for 
example, few people are disturbed at present by the in- 
exorable logic of the Malthusian doctrine, for commerce 
and invention are increasing food-supply faster than 
population advances, even with the aid of better eco- 
nomic and hygienic conditions. History searches out the 
causes immediate and remote for any given series of 
events, but it hesitates to lay down generalizations as to 
what will occur in the future. It is unexpected contin- 
gency, the unpredictable change of circumstances, that 
renders vain most attempts to judge the future by the 
past. Economics has, therefore, an element of educa- 
tional value not found in history, for it teaches the youth 
to generalize in a new way, wherein contingency modifies, 
but does not wholly negate, the formulation of law and 
principle.

  It is only when we see what economic aspects of 
other studies and what economic technique are involved 
in some phases of modern secondary education, that we 
perceive the full need for separate classification of the 
economic group. The most important economic aspects 
of other studies are the following: —

treatment of the same subjects in literary and scientific courses ?

development during the last twenty years, giving rise to 
new types of schools and causing not a little astonishment 
among that group of men who have not been able to adjust

their educational theories to. the industrial situation. 
This technique as it appears in the high school naturally 
divides as follows: —

industrial training for girls. 
2. Technique pertaining to distribution: 
a. Bookkeeping. 
6. Banking and finance. 
c. Typewriting and stenography. 
d. Laboratory study of commercial products. 
Since the educational significance of technique will form 
a special topic for later consideration, its further discussion 
at this point is unnecessary.

CHAPTER V 
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO 
CURRICULA 
1. The Twofold Aspect of all School Studies: Knowledge 
and Technique, or the Acquisition of Efficiency, in Use. 
The preceding chapters have discussed the classifica- 
tion and relative educational worth of the studies as based 
on their content. Nothing has been said, however, as to 
how this worth is to be realized by the student. It is evi- 
dent at a glance, first, that no one student is able profit- 
ably to pursue all these branches of study, since this is 
prevented by lack of time; and, second, that natural 
sequence and relative importance among the studies 
make it inadvisable for the student to pursue every 
study selected throughout his whole school course. We 
are consequently compelled first of all to set ourselves the 
problem of selecting suitable portions of the studies to be 
pursued, deciding when they shall be begun, in what order 
taken up, and how long they shall be studied. These ap- 
pear simple matters, yet we shall find that our whole con- 
ception of education is involved in the decisions we make. 
A distinction of fundamental importance in the making 
276 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 277 
of the curriculum, as well as in the whole process of teach- 
ing, is that between the acquisition of knowledge on the one 
hand and the acquisition of skill and efficiency in its 
application on the other. The latter is called sechnique. 
The thesis of this Section is, that we must recognize this 
twofold aspect in every study, and provide time in the 
curriculum and place in the school for the acquisition of 
both knowledge of its content and technique in its use. 
The subject may be, and indeed in some cases has been, 
approached from diverse points of view, a few of which may 
be briefly mentioned. 
1. The fundamental purposes for the acquisition, of the 
technique of a study are two: (a) That the student may 
be able to apply his knowledge of the study readily and 
skilfully in those departments of practical life in which 
it may be found useful; (6) The reflex action that the 
acquisition of skill in the use of knowledge has upon the 
quality of the knowledge itself, since in the effort to attain 
skill in use, insight is deepened, memory rendered more 
secure, and interest strengthened. 
2. Mental processes are arrested at an incomplete stage 
of development when insight only is sought, since cognition 
alone is emphasized, whereas the complete cycle of mental 
activity embraces cognition, feeling, or emotion (often in 
the form of interested attention) and that form of volitional 
action which consists of doing something. An idea that 
stops at cognition might perhaps be called clear and one
-P-A-G-E-290
  278 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
that completes the cycle above described vivid. A clear 
idea, or one that is arrested at the stage of cognition, may 
perhaps enlighten the understanding, but it does not warm 
the feelings or give scope to volitional action. We are 
inclined to think our work done when the student apper- 
ceives, but this is only the stage of clearness; if we would 
have him reach the stage of vividness, we must see that 
he acquires the necessary technique. 
3. The modern psychologist emphasizes the reciprocal 
dependence of sensory and motor powers, showing that 
each is essential to the perfect development of the other. 
Consequently all school work should make provision not 
only for the sensory-intellectual in the apprehension of 
fact and law, but also for the intellectual-motor in the 
acquisition of that form of efficiency that we term tech- 
nique. Professor James * recognizes the importance of this 
distinction when he exclaims, “No impression with- 
out expression!” By this he means that every sensory 
impression shall find its adequate expression not only 
through the vocal organs in speech or song, but also 
through the hand in writing, drawing, moulding, or in the 
use of tools, apparatus, and utensils. In other words 
ideas must not only be clear, but must also become vivid 
through the appropriate use of the motor system of the 
physical organism; we must have not knowledge alone, 
but also the skill that comes from its application. 
1«Talks to Teachers,” pp. 33-38.
-P-A-G-E-291
   THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 279 
4. Professor Dewey* emphasizes this same distinction 
under the terms Content and Form. ‘To acquire the 
‘content’ of a study we master the facts and laws which 
human experience and reflection have gathered and formu- 
lated. The content of a study is a social product to be 
transmitted to youth. To acquire the ‘ form’ of a study 
we master the technique which enables us to use this 
social product in the society of which we are now, or are 
later to become, a part. The form of a study is a social 
instrumentality to be acquired by youth in order to make 
the content effective in practical life. Reciprocally, 
we gain insight in order to be efficient, and we train our- 
selves in efficiency that we may deepen the insight and 
realize its importance in the world. Pestalozzi said of his 
century: “The worst gift, perhaps, that an evil genius 
has made to our age is knowledge without training in 
efficiency.” 
5. Finally, a truer, more adequate, and more organic 
formation of the curriculum can be made with than with- 
out this distinction; for, as shown in Section 78, if we con- 
fine the acquisition of skill to singing and drawing, thus 
making these exercises merely accessory and more or less 
incidental, we put into the course of study something that 
does not organically belong to it. Furthermore, such a 
conception of technique would wholly fail to account for 
1“ The Ethical Element in Education,” Third Year-Book, National 
flerbart Society, p. 18.
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
modern developments of the curriculum as seen in manual 
training and commercial high schools. But when this 
distinction is recognized as of universal validity for all 
studies, and it is also seen that changing circumstances 
change the emphasis that is to be put now upon the one, 
now upon the other of these elements, the construction 
of different curricula from the same studies for different 
kinds of schools or different classes of students becomes, 
logically at least, easy and natural.’ 
Discussion :— Extent to which this principle has been 
hitherto recognized. 
Sometimes the acquisition of technique calls for a 
special place and equipment, sometimes it can be acquired 
without them. The natural sciences call for laboratory 
and field work, and usually for a special equipment of 
apparatus, as in physics and chemistry; manual training 
needs workshops, tools, and machines; commercial schools 
or courses demand laboratories, business offices, and the 
appliances used in communication. It would be a 
distinct gain in all secondary education if the workroom 
idea involved in the acquisition of technique could find 
adequate visible expression in laboratories, workshops, 
apparatus, and above all of work desks that are capable 
of easy transformation according to the use to which they 
are to be put. The same need is felt in the elementary 
1See Outline, pp. 281-284.
-P-A-G-E-293
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 281 
school. Dewey, trying to find some school desks suitable 
for work, thus narrates his experience: ‘‘ Some years ago 
I was looking about the school-supply stores in the city, 
trying to find desks and chairs which seemed thoroughly 
suitable from all points of view —artistic, hygienic, and 
educational. We had a good deal of difficulty in finding 
what we needed, and one dealer, more intelligent than the 
rest, made this remark, ‘I am afraid we have not what you 
want. You want something at which the children may 
work ; these are all for listening.’ That tells the story of 
the traditional education.” 
In order to show how the study groups appear 
when this distinction between knowledge and technique 
is everywhere made, the following table is arranged: —

liamentary procedure through

institutions as the George 
Junior Republic.

Economics

guages. 
Technique of distribution 
as in accounts, stenography, 
typewriting, laboratory study 
of commercial products, com- 
mercial use of modern lan- 
guages, etc. 
It is interesting to note that by thus extending the 
workshop idea to all the studies, we bring education again 
into line with race experience, in which most learning has 
been obtained in connection with practice in field, shop, 
or public life. This perhaps helps to account for the grow- 
ing interest of the young in their studies that is nearly 
always observed when there is muscular activity in labora- 
tory, workroom, or machine shop. 
Again, this arrangement restores healthful relations 
between mental and physical exertion. Were all our 
schoolrooms fitted with desks both for sitting and for 
standing, for writing and for tool work, at least of the 
lighter and cleaner kinds; also were the spirit of social 
codperation encouraged among the students, and accom- 
panied by the liberty of moving about for mutual conference 
and assistance, as is the case to some extent in natural

science laboratories and machine shops, the physical 
well-being of our students would almost take care of itself. 
It is a general observation often accompanied with ex- 
pressions of regret, that students in professional courses in 
higher institutions manifest far more zeal, enthusiasm, 
and diligence than those who are pursuing a course in 
general culture. Among the reasons for this state of 
things is the fact that professional education always has 
a strong objective side, as in moot courts, clinics, prac- 
tice schools, machine shops, laboratories, etc., whereas 
general education is frequently confined to things of 
thought alone. 
The one provides for a balance between insight and 
efficiency in use, whereas the other is inclined to confine 
its field of activity to, insight alone. But if we consistently 
carry out the workshop idea in all studies, allowing no 
insight to be unaccompanied by the appropriate training 
in its technique, the greatest cause of apathy in culture 
courses will be removed.*

take the place of physical training. 2. Effect of laboratory 
work on school discipline. 3. Extent to which the laboratory 
and workshop practice is a legitimate field for specializing.

as a condition for securing the educational value of the latter. 
5. Relative importance of the laboratory practice in the 
various subjects in enhancing insight and retention. 
2. Principles of Selection and Arrangement of Studies 
and Topics 
To adjust education to the multiplication of studies 
on the one hand, and to the diversities of training demanded 
by modern society on the other, Germany has adopted two 
types of fixed courses of study for general or cultural 
education ; one found in the Gymnasium and the other in 
the Realgymnasium. Other schools are provided which 
omit one or more of the last years from the full course. 
These courses are fixed by public authority and may not 
be changed except by the authority de them. The 
aim of each of these schools is to is: education, 
the chief difference being one of emphasis, since about the 
only difference in studies is that English may be substituted 
for Greek in all schools of the Real type. 
One of the chief defects of this inelastic system is that 
in the attempt to get all types of studies into the curriculum 
and to give each study the amount of time necessary for 
good results, the student is overworked to such an extent 
that his sight is usually impaired, and not infrequently 
his health also. The number of fifty or fifty-five minute 
periods per week, even for six-year-old boys, ranges from 
30 to 33. A second serious defect is that, outside of the
-P-A-G-E-299
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 287 
mere choice of a school, which is not often possible, no 
attention is paid to individual preference or fitness in the 
selection of the studies to be pursued, or to the amount of 
time that shall be devoted to a study that is found in the 
program. There stands the school with its single fixed 
course of study; the student is permitted only this alter- 
native — to take it or to leave it.’ 
1 The following from the report of Dr. Dunker, member of the Royal 
Prussian Industrial Commission of 1904, shows the evil effects of the 
inelastic course in Germany: “‘ Shopwork, in accordance ‘with a funda- 
mental but often forgotten educational principle, rests ‘upon the native 
instincts of the growing human being. Not every boy of approximately 
high-school age is inclined to scientific studies, but almost every boy has 
an instinctive desire to create with the hand something concrete and 
tangible. To direct and cultivate this instinct must be the task of a 
rational education. Now, the advocates of manual training have always 
emphasized the point that they desire, by means of this manual training, 
to attract to the middle school pupils that are not drawn to higher cul- 
ture by literary interests. Such pupils, who are not in themselves bad 
or mentally deficient, but whose interest cannot be reached by a one- 
sided school, are found in all countries. With us they are kept in the 
higher, almost purely literary, school by the pressure of military privi- 
leges. Beginning with Quarta (about fourteen years of age), they 
embarrass the classes, vex the teachers, lower the standard of instruction, 
and therefore that of the entire school, become over-aged, and secure at 
best the military privilege of one year’s army service (instead of two). 
If they turn out well in some vocation in later life it is in spite of the 
school, not because of the school. Very often, however, they enter 
upon practical life morose natures, without faith in themselves and their 
calling, without energy, without creative ardor, irritated against the 
school that failed to reach them. Of the best the school can give, of 
the desire for progress, of the yearning for more and higher things, they 
have not felt a breath; their culture has come to an end, but also for 
effective manual work they are spoiled.”
-P-A-G-E-300
  
  288 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The best American practice deviates from the German 
plan in two important particulars. In the first place, it 
provides many more courses of study from which the stu- 
dent may take his choice. The courses, moreover, differ 
widely not only as to the studies they contain, but also as 
to the time to be devoted to each branch. The second de- 
viation from the German practice is, to give the student 
considerable latitude both in the choice of studies and in 
the length of time that shall be devoted to them. Some 
schools have even gone to the extent of making all studies 
elective, but this is not common. 
Discusston: — 1. Possibility and desirability of limiting 
American secondary education to two or three closely related 
courses of study. 2. Compare the second cycle of French 
high schools with the American and German curricula.’ 
If, however, the responsibility for the construction 
of a course of study is to be divided between the individual 
student and society as represented by parents and school 
officers, the question naturally arises : According to what 
principles shall this division take place; also what shall 
society prescribe; what shall the student be allowed to 
elect ? 
The answer to such questions depends upon one’s con- 
ception of the leading purposes of secondary education for 
normal individuals. If it is decided that the purpose is 
1 See Farrington, F. E., “‘ French Secondary Schools.”
-P-A-G-E-301
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 289 
purely ‘ cultural,’ then one must determine what studies 
conduce to this end, and prescribe them; or if they are too 
numerous for prescription, then must one prescribe some, 
and offer a choice among those that remain. If one decides 
that secondary education shall be governed by the extrance 
conditions for higher institutions, then the prescription is 
determined by the requirements. If, however, one refuses 
to be bound by inherited ideals, on the one hand, or by 
the entrance requirements of higher institutions, on the 
other, and declares that the first purpose of the secondary 
school is to make education general, in the sense that it 
trains the student in every type of mental action and in- 
troduces him to every typical form of social, political, and 
industrial life, as revealed by language, science, art, history, 
and economics; and if, in addition, one declares that sec- 
ondary education is special and practical only as it trains 
every student to be efficient with the knowledge he has 
acquired; then it becomes fairly evident that the school 
must prescribe those typical forms of mental training 
that long experience, reénforced by the analysis of relative 
educational values, shows to be necessary to all-round in- 
sight and efficiency. In brief, the field for prescription is 
departments, groups, or types of study; that for election 
is specific studies within the prescribed groups. A similar 
problem arises also when we consider not only the what 
but the how much. These and other related problems are 
considered in detail in the following sections: —

  2990 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
1. Prescription and Election of Studies 
To the youth, blessed with health, mental ability, 
and financial means, the secondary or cultural stage of 
education reduces itself finally to the acquisition of such 
knowledge and skill as will best prepare him for what 
“complete living,” and must in- Herbert Spencer calls 
clude what is fairly representative not only of those sciences 
that conduce to physical well-being and economic wel- 
fare, but also those sciences and arts that conduce to 
social survival in institutional life, as well as to personal 
happiness and development. 
Since the school authorities as the representatives of civ- 
ilization have not only the responsibility of knowing what 
should be transmitted to the new generation, but have also 
the duty of seeing that no important acquisition be lost, it 
might seem at first glance as if prescription of studies were 
the only rational course to be pursued. But further re- 
flection shows that it is practically impossible to prescribe 
for any one youth the study of all the world’s acquisition of 
science and art, so that the principle of division of labor 
is as necessary in learning as it is in earning. Further- 
more, since natural personal differences in taste, ability, 
industry, and destination that always exist are greatly 
multiplied in a democracy, where the students come from 
every stratum of society and go into every species of the 
world’s work, it is evident that a modern high-school 
administration should permit the exercise of a certain
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 291 
amount of personal choice in the selection of studies and 
in the relative emphasis that shall be placed upon them. 
The minimum of prescription is indicated by our study 
of relative educational values. No important field of 
knowledge must be overlooked; no essential type of mental 
training ignored. Following the order of our discussion 
of values, we see that the great types are the natural 
sciences, the humanities, and the economic studies. Of 
the first grand division mathematics, an exact science, and 
an evolutionary science are necessary to representative 
completeness of knowledge and mental training; of the 
second grand division, linguistics, literature, art,and history 
form the irreducible minimum; of the third or economic 
grand division, some mastery of economic theory and some 
manual training or some skill in using the machinery of 
exchange are the essentials. In small high schools it may 
be necessary to confine the whole course of study to these 
few representatives of general culture. The larger the 
teaching body, however, the more courses can be provided, 
and the larger the range of electives may be. The chief 
differences among courses of study such as classical, Latin- 
scientific, English, manual training, commercial, etc., will 
pertain first to the studies that shall be selected to represent 
the various groups, and second to the amount of time that 
shall be devoted to each. No course of study can be pro- 
nounced educationally complete unless it contains a repre- 
sentative from every study group; nor can any course, how- 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
292 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
ever complete in this respect, be considered efficient that 
does not give to each study the amount of time and atten- 
tion necessary for effective mastery, both as to knowledge 
and as to skill. 
The school is responsible for seeing that through the 
studies prescribed by authority and those elected by per- 
sonal preference the student’s secondary education shall 
be fairly complete both in range and quality. Some de- 
partments have been anticipated in the elementary schools 
and some find their culmination in college or university; 
both these facts must be taken into consideration in 
arranging the curricula for high schools. 
Discussion: — 1. Apply the principles stated in this section 
to the curricula of secondary education in Germany, France, and 
England. 2. The time element in making studies, languages, 
history, science, etc., educationally effective. 
2. Selection and Sequence of Topics. Educational Inter- 
pretation of the Theory of Recapitulation. 
This subject has been more extensively discussed in 
elementary than in secondary education.’ The Ziller 
theory is briefly as follows: Education has first to do with 
a developing mind; and second with the cultural products 
of a civilization that has developed through many stages 
of historical progress. The mind of a child, in analogy with

the physical embryo of an animal, recapitulates in a few 
years the slow evolution of the race, for just as the embryo 
of one of the higher animals in its unfolding is known to 
pass through all the essential stages of development mani- 
fested by lower orders, so the child in his mental develop- 
ment may be conceived to have passed through in a short 
space of time all the great culture epochs that have marked 
the race evolution. What follows from this supposed 
parallelism? For Ziller the conclusion, one may say the 
unproved assumption, that the culture material for the 
education of the child at any given stage in his mental 
development must be drawn from the culture products 
of the race when it was in the corresponding stage of 
evolution. 
“Tt is obvious,” says Rein, “that, if the two series — 
the historical, with its culture materials; and the personal 
with its manifold ideas, wishes, and desires —can be 
brought successfully and accurately into harmony with 
each other, one can undoubtedly get control of the pupil’s 
interest, because by this means the psychological conditions 
would be best established.'”” Extended efforts have been 
made by the Ziller wing of the Herbartian School of edu- 
cational thought to carry this theory into practice, but it 
need not surprise us that an important educational pro- 
cedure that is founded first on an analogy and then upon 
an assumption, should be as vigorously opposed as it is 
1“ Outline of Pedagogics,” p. 96.
-P-A-G-E-306
    204 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
vigorously exploited. Many depreciate the force of the 
analogy, while others deny the validity of the assumption. 
Ziller maintains that because race and individual stages 
of development are parallel, therefore the culture products 
of the race are the proper material for the instruction of the 
child when he is in a corresponding stage. This conclusion, 
argues Dewey,’ is not legitimate; for it does not follow 
logically, while the experience that seems to confirm it can 
be better explained in another way. Granting the paral- 
lelism between individual and racial development, what 
is it that really corresponds ? Not the content of knowl- 
edge as seen in culture products, for these may be val- 
uable or worthless, appropriate or inappropriate, as the 
case may be, but rather the typical modes of reaction to 
stimulation. If the race has through long ages in the 
struggle for existence developed the hunting instinct, or 
the impulse to pursue agriculture or to use tools, we may 
perhaps expect to find strong traces of these instincts or 
impulses in children at the appropriate stages of their 
mental development. This explains, in the opinion of 
many, why all boys are likely to be particularly receptive 
to subject-matter or exercises that give mental or physical 
scope to these inherited tendencies, and it furnishes strong 
intimations to the teacher concerning the selection of 
subject-matter, and the training in technique necessary 
to make the knowledge effective.

THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 295 
It may further be pointed out that the plan of selecting 
material from the cultural products of a distant past 
ignores the value of the present environment in furnishing 
an apperceptive basis for all education. Is it not some- 
what of a contradiction in educational practice to borrow 
one’s subject-matter from ancient sources, while being 
compelled to rely upon the pupil’s experience in a modern 
environment for its comprehension ?. Why is not a modern 
youth who knows about railroads, steamboats, and bridges, 
gunpowder, rapid-fire cannon, and repeating rifles with 
their small caliber and smokeless powder; balloons, field 
glasses, and telegraphy, in a better condition to understand 
a modern war, than he is to comprehend a Persian invasion 
of Greece or a campaign of Cesar against the Gauls? All 
we have to do to enable the student to understand even 
the most complicated machinery of industry or institu- 
tional organization is first to point out clearly its purpose, 
and then to analyze the whole into its constituent ele- 
ments. In this way, both apperception and knowledge to 
be apperceived come from the same environment. All that 
is valuable of past culture epochs, is incorporated as ele- 
ments in the present culture epoch, and may easily be 
mastered, everything in its own good time.’

in elementary education as amended and developed by American 
experience and common sense is found in the works of Dr. Charles A.

Discussion : — Relative force of the argument for (a) the 
cultural products, (b) the modes of reaction to stimulus, (c) the 
present environment. 
The application of the doctrine of individual reca- 
pitulation of race development to secondary education is 
most extensively made by President Hall in his monu- 
” A few extracts from Pres- mental work on “Adolescence. 
ident Hall’s sketch of the ideal school ' will give a concrete 
notion of how in his opinion education in the secondary 
stage should adjust itself to the adolescent nature of 
youth: — j 
“ First of all, the drill and mechanism of the previous 
period must be gradually relaxed, and an appeal must be 
made to freedom and interest. Individuality must have 
a far longer tether. We must, and can, really teach 
nothing that does not appeal to interests deep enough 
to make it seem of almost supreme value in the world. 
Hence, there must be a wide range of elective study for 
those who continue at school. 
“ A conclusive and far-reaching principle is that at no 
other stage of life is the power to appreciate and apprehend 
so far ahead of the power to express. Hence we should let 
up on examinations; we should cast our bread upon the 
waters, knowing that it will be found after many days, be- 
cause so sensitized is the soul now that nothing is lost.

Mental and moral teaching and influences sink at once too 
deep to be reproduced in examinations of the present type, 
without injury to both mind and will. 
“The youth is all insight and receptivity; he has just 
entered the stage of apprenticeship to life; he has awak- 
ened to it as at a second birth, and has found all things 
new and glorious. 
“The teacher’s cue is now to graft the soul all over 
with buds and scions, and not to try to gather a harvest. 
The fundamentals of the soul, which are instinct and in- 
tuition, and not pure intellect, are now in season. We must 
lay new and larger foundations. 
“The high school has lost its independence (is now a 
mere link in an educational chain), and of all stages and 
grades has least interest in the large problems of educa- 
tion; namely, what to teach and how, in order to develop 
the nascent periods during the teens and to save powers 
now new-born in most profusion, but sure to be atrophied 
or perverted if not studied with tact and federated with 
individual adaptation. — High-school teachers have aban- 
doned all initiative, have renounced their birthright of 
interpreting and ministering to the needs of one stage of 
life. Their motto seems to be, Non vite sed schole dis- 
cimus. —Noble ideals are gone; the independent func- 
tion of the secondary stage of education is almost aban- 
doned; and the pupil and teacher devote themselves to 
a routine of tasks in an artificial program imposed by 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  
298 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
the will of others, and fitting, not for the world, but for 
college. 
“The teacher must teach more, and know more; he 
must be a living fountain, not a stagnant pool. He should 
not be a dealer in desiccated, second-hand knowledge, 
a mere giver-out and hearer of lessons. That is the chief 
and humiliating difference between our secondary teachers 
and those abroad, who are mostly doctors of philosophy 
as they should be.” 
This is the voice of an American Rousseau, who would 
bud the juicy naval orange upon the sour stock of the 
rough lemon, who sees visions and dreams dreams, who 
brings all the resources of his knowledge and eloquence, far 
greater than those of the old Rousseau, to bear upon the 
teacher that he may understand and lead aright the fresh 
young life whose intellectual and moral unfolding is so 
largely intrusted to his guidance. 
Liberally interpreted, the foregoing intimations drawn 
from the study of adolescent characteristics may be sum- 
marized as follows: — 
1. The studies must be chosen from every field of knowl- 
edge that is important for life, for “The teacher's cue is 
now to graft the soul all over with buds and scions.” 
2. The youth shall have the opportunity to study those 
departments and phases of knowledge: that most keenly 
awake his slumbering interests; hence (1) many elective 
studies, and (2) permission to gratify to the utmost his
-P-A-G-E-311
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 299 
interest for the striking, the novel, the mysterious, and the 
practically important. This second point is illustrated 
by President Hall’s recommendations concerning high- 
school physics.’ Physics, he thinks, should not be dry and 
formal, not mathematical and strictly scientific, as it is in 
the university, but concrete, thought- and interest-pro- 
voking, and elastic enough to permit the student, through 
a free use of the laboratory, to examine as far as he will 
and can, the impressive phenomena already enumerated, 
such as argon, liquid air, X-rays, telegraph, telephone, 
graphophone, telautograph, wireless telegraphy, dynamos 
and electric motors, high and low potentials, single and 
alternating currents, locomotives, automobile gasolene 
engines, steam turbines, telescope, microscope, prisms for 
spectrum analysis, etc. Physics is not to consist alone of 
these side excursions, but it is to whet and satisfy curiosity 
concerning them, and thus lead gradually to the resolution 
on the student’s part to master the science that shows how 
to comprehend and use them. It is easy, here as every- 
where else, to inoculate the young mind against that life 
interest in the subject which should dwell with it long 
after the student leaves the high school. He must not 
be left in the mental condition of the youth who refused 
to see an artistic exhibition of “ Hamlet ” on the stage, on 
the ground that he was sick of ‘‘ Hamlet,” having studied 
it in school and looked up all the references.

3. “The teacher must be a living fountain, not a stag- 
nant pool.” He must know more and teach better, not 
as the mere examiner, or the purveyor of canned goods, 
but as the inspiring guide, who, while he imparts one in- 
crement of knowledge and skill, whets the appetite for 
another. 
Discussion :— Compare the validity of these arguments 
with that of the considerations presented on pp. 292-295. 
3. The Correlation of High-school Subject-matter 
The problem of the best possible correlation of 
studies, that is, their best arrangement as to juxtaposition 
and succession, is one that has a long history, and one 
which in the course of time has seen many solutions. 
When subjects were few and educational aims simple or 
single, the problem was of easy solution; but it has grown 
difficult as studies have increased in complexity and num- 
ber, and as educational aims have become numerous or 
many-sided. 
In this as in other fields the theories of Plato have 
played an important rdéle. According to his thought, 
there are two worlds, a transcendent and a sensuous one. 
The transcendent world is the world of ideas; the sensible 
world is that of phenomena. These two worlds, though 
disparate, are so related that the phenomena of the sense 
world are the images or counterparts of the transcendent 
ideas of the unseen world, which in turn are the prototypes
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 301 
of the sense images. It is the function of our senses 
to apprehend the phenomena; that of our reason to ap- 
prehend the ideas. Just as phenomena and ideas are 
disparate, that is, belong to distinct worlds, so sense and 
reason are likewise disparate, or of unlike nature, and need 
a mediator capable of bringing them into proper relations. 
This mediator Plato saw in mathematics, in that on the one 
hand mathematics has to do with things of sense in the 
calculation of magnitudes, and on the other, proceeds by the 
exercise of reason to investigate the eternal relations of 
things. Thus, for example, the relation of the hypothe- 
nuse to the legs of a right triangle has to do with a concrete 
instance of a particular triangle, and with an eternal law 
which has been and will be true throughout all the vast 
eons of time and in every nook and cranny of space, which, 
like the ideas themselves, must stand though the heavens 
fall. Since the Greek program consisted alone of language, 
mathematics, and philosophy, and since with Plato the 
final end of education was to produce the philosopher, 
the natural as well as the rational order of studies was 
(t) Language (especially poetry), (2) Mathematics (espe- 
cially geometry), (3) Philosophy. This program is simple 
yet beautiful in its perfection, as may be seen in the fol- 
lowing exposition :— 
1. Language is empirical for it deals with words, sen- 
tences, and literary wholes. It proceeds through inductive 
study to rules. These are of many-sided application and
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
form the key to all knowledge. Poetry and prose literary 
masterpieces expand to take in the whole world of sensible 
perceptions. 
2. Mathematics is a rational science mostly deductive 
in character and sets the demonstrative reason to work. 
Like poetry it is empirical and elementary in that it has 
to do with magnitudes that appeal to sense; but unlike 
poetry it leads to the comprehension of universal laws, 
and since mathematics is the science of the problem, it 
leads back again into the world of sense. 
3- Philosophy, like mathematics, is rational and deduc- 
tive. It gets small assistance, however, from the world of 
sense, while it demands the highest possible exercise of 
abstract thought. 
The early Christian thinkers accepted in general Plato’s 
philosophy, and with it his order of studies, which now 
took the following form:— 
1. The trivium (speech —grammar, rhetoric, dialectics). 
2. The quadrivium (mathematics—arithmetic, geom- 
‘ 
etry, music, and astronomy). ; 
3. Philosophy and theology. 
Since their aim was to educate the priest, as Plato’s 
was to develop the philosopher, the schoolmen had to 
take but one additional step, namely, theology, in order to 
complete their curriculum. They could therefore pre- 
serve the organic construction of Plato’s course of study. 
The history of education shows how this unity devised by  
-P-A-G-E-315
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 303 
the schoolmen was destroyed by the nominalists, the 
humanists, and the scientists. We shall in all probability 
never see its like again, for the old world has departed, and 
with it its unity of aim and its simplicity of subject- 
matter. Then but a single class of the population was to 
be educated, now all classes claim it as an inherent right 
of mankind; then a single aim was dominant, now the 
ends of education are manifold; then only a little teach- 
able knowledge was available, now the labors of thousands 
for generations have increased the amount of teachable 
knowledge beyond the needs and capacities of any individ- 
ual or class of individuals. Yet, for all that, the need for 
an organic course of study for every department of general 
education has not left the world; the problem is still 
with us, but it must have a new solution, or better, a 
number of new solutions. 
Discussion: — To what degree do the various curricula 
presented in the appendix approximate to Plato’s scheme of 
correlation ? 
Herbart suggested that related topics should be 
taught simultaneously in order to extend and intensify 
all interests created. Ziller, following up this suggestion 
and uniting his theory of the historical stages of culture 
with his ethico-religious aim of education, devised an 
elaborate plan of what he called concentration of instruc- 
tion. According to this scheme, the humanistic aspects
-P-A-G-E-316
nn ee an ee ee 
304 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
of the curriculum must take the lead and dominate all 
others, for two reasons; namely, they presumably have 
more ethical and religious value than the others, and they 
can be taught according to historical stages. Conse- 
quently the elementary curriculum, with which Ziller 
principally busied himself, consists of a core of history, 
biblical and secular, and literature. About this core, 
which progresses by parallel historical stages of the various 
topics, all the facts and laws of nature are attached by 
mere association, usually mechanical and far-fetched. 
Three results, Ziller thought, might be thereby effected:— 
(1) The unity of psychical life in the child might be 
strengthened, since he would have to regard simultaneously 
and as related all the ideas imparted or generated by 
education; (2) all the interests aroused by instruction 
would be centralized, strengthened, and extended in every 
direction until they penetrated every department of knowl- 
edge; (3) everything taught in the curriculum would take 
on an ethico-religious aspect as though seen through 
  colored glasses, and the moral and religious character 
| of the child would presumably be brought to an ideal 
state of perfection. 
For several rather obvious reasons Ziller’s hopes have 
not been widely realized. In the first place, it has never 
been proved that psychological unity concerning dis- 
crete things is desirable. Why should we desire even to 
be in condition to think of everything when we think of
-P-A-G-E-317
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 305 
anything? To have a tendency to do so might be very 
uncomfortable, or even unsettling to one’s peace of mind. 
The habit of not thinking of unrelated matters is certainly 
one of the negative blessings of life, which should not be 
lightly put in jeopardy by the schoolmaster. In the 
next place, it has not been proved that interest is strength- 
ened by the diffusion involved in extending it in every 
direction. The strong interests in life are marked by 
concentration to a small group of closely related things; 
why should not the same be true in education? Finally, 
the development of moral character of good fibre is not a 
matter of such innocent simplicity as Ziller seems to assume. 
True piety is hardly engendered by a pious regard of things 
piously indifferent. No serious effort has ever been made 
to extend the Ziller theory of concentration to secondary 
education. 
Another scheme of concentration for elementary 
education was proposed by the late Colonel Parker,’ 
which was based upon the philosophical unity of knowledge. 
This naturally could not be a psychological concentration 
on the part of the child, for he is too immature either to 
perceive or, even if he could perceive, to appreciate such 
relations. Parker’s scheme would have had much better 
chance of successful application, psychologically consid- 
ered, in the college than in the elementary school. The 
subjects thus organized are mineralogy, geology, geogra-

tory —a list of names that reminds us of Herbert Spencer’s 
plea for science in his “‘ Education.” Necessarily in such 
a plan the logical rather than the psychological principle 
of sequence comes to the front. This principle is effec- 
tive for the young, however, only when the subject-matter 
thus organized is so simple that the logical arrangement 
is at the same time the best psychological one, as in 
Plato’s scheme of poetry, mathematics, and _ philosophy. 
Discussion : — Extent to which the logical coincides with the 
psychological sequence in representative studies like mathemat- 
ics, physics, history. 
Modern attempts to find a single adequate prin- 
ciple of correlation among the studies themselves having 
apparently proved unsuccessful, the only remaining 
recourse on this side of the problem is to examine the 
various studies in detail in order to discover and utilize 
such natural relations as may be found to exist among 
them. The leading interrelations may, therefore, be 
taken up in detail. 
1. Mathematics. Even if this subject has lost the com- 
manding place it held in ancient educational systems as 
the mediator between the apprehensions of sense and the 
processes of reason, it still performs a similar function. 
It is the presupposition and necessary propedeutic for all 
departments of pure and applied quantitative science,
-P-A-G-E-319
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 307 
such as physics, astronomy, to some extent chemistry 
also, and all departments of engineering. It underlies 
the theory of music, and has indirect relations to drawing 
and the theory of the beautiful. “Esthetics in a certain 
sense coincides with mathematics, the difference between 
the two sciences consisting in this: Mathematics concerns 
itself only with the rationality of time and space percep- 
tions, whereas esthetics considers also the effect of this 
rationality upon our sensibilities.” * 
Upon the psychical side it still has the same training 
power for the reason that it had in Plato’s time. Every 
student who learns through the study of geometry what a 
demonstration really is, feels, as did Lincoln when he had 
read the first book of Euclid, that he now knows what 
proof is. 
2. Geography,— the where: Herbart called geography 
the associating science. It has in its various aspects 
undoubtedly more relations to the other branches of the 
curriculum than any other study. Its intimate connection 
with history, which must always have a place in which to 
unfold, and whose contingencies depend in large measure 
upon geographical elements, like land structure, rivers, 
food-supply, weather, etc., has long been observed by 
schoolmen. As mathematical geography it is closely 
related to elementary astronomy; as physical geography,

Kérpers.”
-P-A-G-E-320
308 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
to plant and animal life as described in botany and zodlogy; 
as commercial geography, to economic production and 
exchange. Even literature and art are not wholly inde- 
pendent of place, and hence have their geographical 
aspects. 
3- Philosophy. Though not a subject of high-school 
study, philosophy is of great importance to the teacher 
in enabling him to perceive the intimacy of the inter- 
relations that exist among the departments of high- 
school study. Ethics reveals the hierarchy of ends in 
education, as elsewhere, and psychology reveals the means 
for reaching them. Metaphysics undertakes to unify, 
or bring into relation to ultimate ends, all the various 
departments of human thought and action. 
4. History, — the when. As an associating disci- 
pline, history is less elementary than geography and less 
abstract than philosophy. In some departments the when 
is important, as in literature and art; in science it is less 
important, for sciences reign in the world because of what 
they are, rather than because of what they were. Yet 
interest in the present stages of development can often 
be enhanced by reference to former stages. In some 
cases comprehension is assisted by historical study of the 
science, as in the case of the atomic theory in chemistry. 
5. Language. Language has relation to all sciences, 
for it is the means of their expression. The study of 
language, to be of most importance and use as an asso-
-P-A-G-E-321
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 309 
ciating science, must everywhere deal with the things of 
nature and civilization. This is especially true of the 
literature to be read by the student. 
6. The Hand. All those subjects are naturally associ- 
ated which demand the skilful use of the hand in the 
mastery of their technique, as in the laboratory, the 
drawing room, and the workshop. This unites by a new 
bond the exact and the biological sciences, fine art and 
craftsmanship, drawing and the mechanic arts. 
Dewey ' makes a convincing argument to show 
that the only really adequate correlation of studies will 
come, not so much through the discovery of internal like- 
nesses and equivalences, as through sincere effort to cor- 
relate the studies in the school with the life activities to 
which they relate. He thinks, moreover, that the con- 
necting link between the insight of the school and the 
institutional and industrial life outside the school is the 
laboratory, drawing room, or workshop, because it is here 
that the student’s thought finds its first life-conforming 
expression. But when all studies are seen in their rela- 
tions to the life activities which they explain and for 
which they prepare, it is evident that each will find its 
natural relations to every other in the student’s mind, 
and that without any soul-racking effort on the part of 
the teacher to find some universal law of thought gravita- 
tion which shall bind all together in a beautiful system.

The accompanying diagram may serve to show at a 
glance how this idea works out in actual practice, and 
reénforces the recommendation already made that theory 
and practice, insight and efficiency, should go ever hand in 
hand. 
Discussion: — Extent to which the laboratory and work- 
shop idea is: (a) desirable, (6) attainable, and (c) already at- 
tained. 
4. Practical Considerations in the Construction of 
Courses of Study 
In the making of a curriculum of study for actual 
use, theoretical considerations are nearly always modified 
by practical ones of tradition, public authority, and often 
mere feasibility as determined by financial support, 
material equipment or teaching force. The following 
exposition treats of a number of important topics from 
this standpoint: — 
1. Juxtaposition vs. Succession in the Arrangement of 
Studies. Opinions of schoolmen as well as customs of 
countries differ as to what is the ideal program so far as 
the arrangement of studies in juxtaposition or succession 
is considered. In Germany, for instance, public author- 
ity decrees that many studies shall be carried on, side by 
side, for a series of years, a small number of hours per 
week on the average being given to each. During the 
four years corresponding most nearly to our high-school

  312 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
course (III*, III*, II’, II*) the Prussian Realgymnasium 
always has as many as eleven subjects taught simul- 
taneously, while in the third year twelve subjects are 
so taught.t In the Prussian classical Gymnasium, the 
first two years have eleven each, the third ten, and the 
fourth nine studies carried on together. The principle 
of succession is almost ignored in these schools, except 
within such related groups as mathematics and natural 
science. Religion, German, Latin, Greek, French, His- 
tory and Geography combined as one subject, and gym- 
nastics run through each of the four years without 
break. Mathematics is taught in them all; natural his- 
tory in the first; and physics, chemistry, and mineralogy 
as one group through the remaining three. From three 
to five of these subjects get but two hours a week, three 
of them but three hours, one (Greek) has six hours, 
while Latin in the Gymnasium has seven hours for three 
years and six for one. In the Realgymnasium for the 
same time, Latin has four hours for each of the first two 
years and three for each of the last two years. Both of 
these courses are given in full in the appendix and may 
easily be compared. 
To carry on so many studies at the same time, even 
though many of them get but two or three hours per week, 
it becomes necessary to hold the student for what seems 
to us an excessive number of hours per week, actually 
1 See Russel, J. E., “ German Higher Schools.”
-P-A-G-E-325
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 313 
from thirty to thirty-three or thirty-four in the Realgym- 
nasium, and for the classical gymnasium approximately 
the same number. These periods are all from fifty to 
fifty-five minutes in length. 
If the German plan may on the whole be described 
as that of juxtaposition, that of the American high school 
may lay claim to that of succession." 
The sample programs suggested by the Committee of 
Ten? have, as a rule, only five subjects under consider- 
ation at one time, or less than half the number of the 
German gymnasiums, while the number of periods per 
week is reduced from thirty-three to twenty, and the 
length of the periods from fifty or fifty-five to forty, forty- 
five or fifty minutes, the provision also being made that 
at least five of the twenty periods should be given to 
unprepared work. In a few cases the number of studies 
to be carried on at one time rises to six. 
The German courses appear, and are, in fact, far more 
rigorous in their demands upon the student than the 
American, though it must at once be explained that 
American high schools depend much more on preparation 
outside the recitation than do the German gymnasiums. 
In the latter schools a period is divided somewhat equally 
between advance work and recitation, the teacher fulfilling

-P-A-G-E-326
  314 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
in considerable degree the function performed by the text- 
book with us. 
Professor Miinch suggests two formulas for determining 
the relative amount of juxtaposition and succession, though 
admitting that these formulas are of small practical 
value: (1) “ Put as many studies into juxtaposition as 
you can without encountering the danger that they will 
neutralize rather than organically supplement one another, 
or that interest will be dissipated; (2) put as many 
studies in succession as you can without danger of ex- 
hausting interest, or of banishing from consciousness 
what would otherwise be valuable.” * 
The inadequacy of such formulas may easily be seen by 
comparing their application in German and American 
courses of study. Evidently this is a point where custom 
is much more potent than argument. Those subjects 
will have to be placed in juxtaposition which are held to 
be absolutely essential in one or more of the four years 
of the course; all others will easily submit to the principle 
of succession, the hope being that an intensive study 
for a term or a year will prove more beneficial than more 
prolonged study with fewer periods per week and with 
more divided interest. Geography and history mutually 
supplement each other and may well be placed in close 
juxtaposition; the same is true for algebra and geometry, 
though the American plan inclines to algebra in the first, 
1“ Geist des Lehramts,” p. 349.
-P-A-G-E-327
  
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 315 
and geometry in the second year of the high school course. 
Physics and chemistry may be taught at the same time, 
though for practical reasons, such as time for ample 
laboratory work, and preparation for advanced work in the 
university, American teachers of science think it better to 
teach them in different years. The Report of the Com- 
mittee of Ten is almost unanimous in the judgment that 
physics should be taught in the last year of the high school, 
and chemistry in the next to the last. The reason for 
placing physics at the end of the course is that the mathe- 
matics of the first three years forms a natural introduction 
to it. A similar reason places grammar before rhetoric. 
Discussion: — Relative weight of the advantages and dis- 
advantages of the German as compared with the American plan 
regarding juxtaposition and succession, in respect to (a) health, 
(b) interest, (c) permanence of mastery, (d) time for laboratory 
or other similar exercises. 
2. Importance of Inner Unity in Each Study or Study 
Group. The need of inner unity in the several branches of 
study becomes imperative as the number of subjects taken 
into the curriculum increases. When, for example, in the 
early American academies mathematics was confined 
mostly to arithmetic, it was perhaps natural that the sub- 
ject should become unduly expanded by the inclusion of a 
multitude of topics now excluded or transferred to higher 
stages of the science, such as banking, insurance, discount, 
*Report of the Committee of Ten, p. 117.

316 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
equation of payments, and others now more easily treated 
in algebra, to say nothing of the arithmetical ‘ puzzles’ 
inserted to try the wits of the young student. Now, how- 
ever, that we have, on the one hand, a nicely graduated 
course of mathematics, including not only arithmetic but 
also elementary and advanced algebra, plane and solid 
geometry, and plane and spherical trigonometry, all to be 
mastered by the time the youth is eighteen years of age, 
and, on the other, a similar development of the other 
studies, the old tendency to side excursions through the 
introduction of subsidiary and non-essential matter, must 
be resisted, and in the case of tradition vigorously com- 
bated, in order that each subject or group of subjects, 
through exclusion of unnecessary topics and the proper 
organization of the essentials, may fall into such organic 
unity that the student need lose no time and waste no 
energy. 
The complete development of this theme, however, 
belongs to special didactics, and must be investigated 
through extended study in the several fields. Many val- 
uable reports of special committees discuss this topic at 
length, as do the several excellent treatises on special 
branches of study now available for the secondary teacher.’

3. Provision for the Acquisition of Efficiency in the Use 
of Knowledge. What has been termed expression, form, 
technique, skill, etc., or the intellectual-motor side of all 
education, demands especial attention in the construction 
of a course of study, since the older practices of the school 
obscure its importance, even when they do not entirely 
overlook its newer aspects, as seen in drawing, laboratory 
work, manual training, etc., and consequently fail to 
provide adequately for the necessary time and facilities. 
Modern experiments in manual training schools tend to 
confirm the opinion that half the time of the school day 
may be spent in laboratory, drawing room, and shop with- 
out essentially abridging the purely intellectual accom- 
plishment of the older type of schools, and without ex- 
posing the student to the danger of overwork, since the 
alternation of intellectual and manual occupation fur- 
nishes a healthful balance of bodily and mental exertion. 
Should this opinion be ultimately fully confirmed, one can

  318 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
see what radical improvements on the side of the acquisi- 
tion of efficiency are possible even in purely humanistic 
courses, for every humanistic branch of study may, with 
proper facilities and time allotment, have a species of 
laboratory or workshop drill that will promote at once 
efficiency in use and variety of work. But the full ad- 
vantage of this position appears only when we regard the 
possibilities of technical training in every important field 
of education, whether the emphasis be placed upon lan- 
guage, science, or economics. No student of the human- 
ities need be a stranger to the laboratory of science, or the 
workroom of the fine or useful arts; no student of science 
need be a stranger to the humanities; no student of the 
arts of production and exchange need be ignorant of lan- 
guage or science, for there is time for the development of 
insight and the acquisition of efficiency in all the typical 
fields of knowledge. 
Discussion : — Facilities, teaching force, daily program, etc., 
needed to realize the ‘laboratory idea,’ in classical, scientific, - 
and industrial training.’ 
4. The Order in which Languages shall be taken Up. 
This is mostly fixed by custom in various schools and coun- 
tries. Though from time to time the recommendation is 
made to place Greek before Latin, the consensus of opinion 
the world over is that Latin should come first. With 
1 See Curricula of Industrial and other High-Schools.  
-P-A-G-E-331
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 319 
regard to the priority of French or German in American 
schools, opinions differ. Some say that since French is 
more nearly allied to Latin than is German, it should be 
the language first begun; the argument can be made that 
for this very reason it should not come first, or perhaps at 
all, since modern education may be considered to have 
time enough for but one language of a kind. Further- 
more, since we have a large number of German-speaking 
people in our population, it is easier to find teachers who 
can speak the German almost or quite as a mother tongue 
than it is to find teachers of French with like ability. In 
most schools this question is left an open one to be decided 
by the qualification of teachers, the wishes of parents, 
students, etc. 
“Whether Latin or a modern language should come 
first in a well-ordered course of study is a question upon 
which teachers differ. It is one of the questions upon 
which, in the existing state of psychological and pedagog- 
ical science, it is just as well not to dogmatize. It is often 
urged that the discipline afforded by the study of Latin 
makes the subsequent learning of a modern language 
easier. This is true, but the converse is no less true.” * 
Since Latin is not usually begun in American schools until 
the age of fourteen or fifteen, most educational bodies 
interested in language study recommend the beginning of

. mittee of Twelve of the Modern Language Association), pp. 98-99.

    320 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
a modern foreign language in the grades at the age of 
eleven or twelve. In Germany, however, this question 
is a more burning one, for while the gymnasiums regularly 
begin Latin at the age of nine or ten, the ‘ Reform Gym- 
nasium’ at Frankfort a. M. pursues French for three years 
before beginning Latin, thus limiting the study of Latin to 
six years, instead of nine as in the older gymnasiums. 
This innovation is vigorously contested on all sorts of 
grounds, lest it undermine in a measure the character of 
German classical education.* 
The further consideration of the early introduction of 
modern foreign languages under American conditions may 
well be postponed until the proposition for a six-years’ 
high-school course is discussed. 
Discussion: —1. Herbart’s reasons for recommending 
that Greek precede Latin? 2. Advantages that are expected 
from studying French for three years before Latin is begun, 
as seen in the German Reform Schools.* 
5- Types of Curricula 
Owing to causes already sufficiently explained, the 
abundant subject-matter of secondary education falls 
naturally into several types of curricula, in order to meet 
the varied needs of a democratic society. So distinctive 
in character are some of these curricula that in large cities

* Russell, “German Higher Schools,” pp. 399-405.
-P-A-G-E-333
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 321 
they often rise to separate schools. In general, however, 
several types of curricula appear in the same high school 
under the name of courses of study. It is possible to 
arrange a course of study for each student; this is often 
done in special cases, and is even attempted for all students 
in some schools. Obviously, however, such a precedure 
involves much labor and is especially liable to error, either 
on the part of the teacher who prescribes, or on that of the 
student who chooses. Students fall naturally into classes, 
such as those who are fitting for college, or those who are 
well adapted to profit by certain types of study. On the 
basis of this natural division in the wishes or abilities of 
the students it is possible to formulate courses of study, 
liberal and relatively complete in character, which will 
answer to the several needs of the students. If further 
flexibility is desired, electives from among fairly equivalent 
studies may be offered in the later years of each course. 
The construction of these courses of study is often left 
to custom or the individual opinion of the principal or the 
superintendent who formulates them. The school officer, 
however, who wishes to proceed with some degree of scien- 
tific accuracy, must apply the principles explained above 
in the present chapter to at least five important points: — 
1. What studies shall be chosen for each course? On 
the basis of a study of educational values and equivalences, 
it has been recommended that each distinctive type or 
group of studies be represented in each high-school course, 
i.
-P-A-G-E-334
  
  322 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
the degree of representation being governed by the size and 
qualifications of the teaching corps, also by the general 
character of the course itself. 
2. How much time shall be devoted to each study 
chosen; 7.¢., for how many periods per week ; for how many 
terms or years shall it be taught? No absolute principle 
can be established to govern this matter. The consensus 
of our best educational opinion, however, is to the effect 
that to get the full educational value from a subject it 
must be taught with considerable intensity for a consider- 
able length of time. Some subjects like languages and 
mathematics must be continued for a series of years; 
others may be disposed of in briefer periods. The mini- 
mum for effective work in any branch is thought to be four 
or five periods per week for a half year. 
3- What shall be the content of the subjects chosen? 
Here again cumulative experience is the best guide. For- 
tunately, we have a number of trustworthy formulations 
of such experience in American schools. The first in im- 
portance is the Report of the Committee of Ten of the 
National Educational Association,’ with its nine sub- 
committees of ten each. The second is the Report of the 
Committee on College Entrance Requirements of the 
N. E. A?

Other important reports in this field are those issued by 
the college entrance examination Board of the Middle 
States and Maryland,’ the New York State Academic 
Syllabus, renewed every five years and issued by the Edu- 
cation Department of the State, and the numerous re- 
ports of committees of educational associations through- 
out the country, to be found in the files of the School 
Review, which is published at the university of Chicago. 
All of these reports are national in scope, and worthy the 
most careful study. 
Discussion: — Comparison of the various curricula given 
in the Appendices with respect to the points discussed above. 
4. What shall be prescribed and what elective in each 
course? The principles that should govern here have 
been explained above in Section 94. 
5. How many recitation periods per week shall be 
required of each student? The Committee of Ten sug- 
gest a uniform requirement of twenty, but they take no 
account of extra time needed for music, drawing, and 
other forms of manual work. The European systems 
uniformly make much larger demands. President Butler” 
would hold the student to a minimum of twenty-five 
full hours of educative work per week. Unless the 
stamina of American youth is much below that of 
European, this cannot be held to be an excessive re-

324 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
  quirement. When laboratory work is included, it is 
certainly not excessive. 
The names in most common use for the several courses 
are as follows: — 
(1) Classical: three foreign languages, one modern. 
(2) Latin-Scientific: two foreign languages, one 
modern. 
(3) Modern Language: two foreign languages, both 
modern. 
(4) English: one foreign language, ancient or 
modern. 
(5) Manual Training: any one or two foreign lan- 
guages, usually modern. 
(6) Commercial: usually at least two modern foreign 
languages. 
The first four of the above courses take their names from 
the languages taught in them; the last two from the lead- 
ing characteristics of the courses themselves. 
Discussion : — Consideration of the types of curricula given 
in the Appendices. 
6. A Six-Year High-School Course of Study

-P-A-G-E-337
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 325 
solved, That we javor a unified six-year high-school course 
of study beginning with the seventh grade. 
This implies either that the twelve years now devoted 
to elementary and higher education together (elementary 
school, 8 years; high school, 4 years) shall be so divided 
that secondary education shall occupy six years, and ele- 
mentary education six years; or that the beginnings of some 
secondary school studies shall start in the last two years of 
the grammar school. The latter is what is recommended 
by the Committee, but the former has been proposed as a 
principle. In Europe generally the elementary are so 
distinct from the secondary schools that there is but little 
transition from one to the other, there being no common 
educational ladder for all classes of the population. Under 
these circumstances, the elementary schools begin at the 
age of six years and continue to that of fourteen, whereas 
the secondary schools begin at the age of nine or ten and 
close at the age of eighteen or nineteen. Much of the en- 
viable superiority of these schools is due to the fact that 
real secondary studies, especially languages and mathe- 
matics, may be begun very early, and continue unbroken 
throughout the nine years’ course. Having an educational 
ladder running through all our elementary and educational 
system, however, it is evident that we cannot copy the 
European plan, even were we on other grounds disposed 
to do so. Yet the extension downward of our secondary 
period, at least for important subjects demanding much 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
326 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
  time, is highly desirable in public education. Some of the 
more prominent reasons for this change may be briefly 
mentioned: — 
1. Such a plan would prevent the undue prolongation 
of strictly elementary methods, thus conducing to greater 
intellectual independence and efficiency. English boys 
take their plunge into Euclid’s geometry at the age of 
eleven or twelve, some three or four years before American 
boys are supposed to be mature enough to make the at- 
tempt. In manners American boys are reputed to be 
more precocious than their English cousins; — why their 
prolonged infancy in intellectual capacity? 
2. The proposed change in the kind of instruction in cer- 
tain subjects corresponds closely to the physical and men- 
tal changes at the beginning of adolescence. In this case 
six years would be given to the mastery of the elementary 
arts, while the next six years could put the emphasis upon 
studies which provide at once for culture and for efficiency 
in life. 
3. Such a plan would enable students to prepare more 
efficiently and with less nervous strain for more ex- 
tended courses in college, professional or technical 
schools. Four years is too short a time for grounding 
the student in mathematics, languages, science, history, 
and the other studies demanded for entrance to higher 
institutions. 
4. As Professor Hanus suggests, this arrangement
-P-A-G-E-339
  THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA 327 
would make it practicable to introduce industrial training 
during the last two years of the grammar school for those 
who were not going into the high school; and to do the 
same on a higher plane during the last two years of the 
high school for those who did not propose to enter any 
higher institution of learning. 
5. This plan harmonizes with the experience of foreign 
countries and the practice of our own private schools. A 
good private school can easily prepare a boy for college 
in from one to two years less than are required in a public 
high school, provided he begins his secondary studies by 
the time he is eleven or twelve years of age. 
The obstacles in the way of such a movement are chiefly 
of two kinds, first, those of administration and equipment, 
and second, lack of adequately trained teachers. Neither 
of these is insuperable. A difficulty, though hardly an 
obstacle, is the need of preserving the regular four years’ 
high-school courses for those who for one reason or another 
begin no secondary subjects in the grammar school. The 
Committee of Twelve of the American Philological As- 
sociation * suggests that the Latin of the seventh and 
eighth grades be made an equivalent of the ordinary first 
year’s work in Latin in the high school. Students who 
have had these two preparatory years’ work would join 
the second Latin class in the high school and continue with 
them to the end of the course. A similar arrangement

could be made for French and German ;! for mathematics 
too, should American boys prove as capable in intellect 
as they are mature in feeling. 
Discussion : — Which shall be the ideal of the American 
high school: a complete general education fitting directly 
for all higher professional institutions, or as at present an 
incomplete general education, to be finished by a few years 
in college or university ? 
  7. Junior High Schools 
The problem of fhe six-year high school is being 
solved in a number of American cities by the establish- 
ment of what has become known as the Junior High 
School. This is notably the case in Columbus and 
Dayton, Ohio; Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, and Sag- 
inaw, Michigan; Alton, Illinois; and Berkeley, Cali- 
fornia, while very many cities have adopted some 
plan for making high-school studies reach down into 
the seventh and eighth grades of the grammar school. 
The Junior High Schools of Columbus, now four: in 
number, may serve as types for this form of organiza- 
tion. Each Junior High School embraces the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth grades, or the last two grades of the 
grammar school, and the first grade of the regular high 
school. These pupils are assembled in buildings devoted

The following is a summary of the chief arguments 
cited by Fullerton in favor of the Junior High School: 
1. The plan increases and equalizes the personal influ- 
ence of the teachers. 
2. Since small classes may be formed more readily, 
there is better opportunity for individual work. 
3. Good order is more easily secured because of 
increased interest in the studies, because of greater 
variety and better teaching. 
4. The movement of pupils from room to room is 
restful and adds to the variety which the adolescent 
craves. 
5. Pupils are thrown on their ownresources and become 
more independent, thus making the transition from ele- 
mentary to secondary education natural and easy.
-P-A-G-E-343
THE ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES INTO CURRICULA Sor 
6. Individual development is encouraged through this 
independence and self-expression. 
7. Instruction can be better adapted to individual 
needs because of the number of teachers and the intro- 
duction of new studies. 
8. The teacher’s work, being more concentrated, is 
better done. 
9. Better grading is made possible, since there is no 
object in keeping up the size of the class. 
to. Better continuity in a study is promoted by the 
departmental plan. : 
11. Promotion by subject takes the place of class 
promotion more easily. 
12. Better teachers can be secured, since higher edu- 
cation may reasonably be demanded in Junior High 
Schools. 
Objections to the Junior High School plan by a certain 
rather small percentage of teachers and principals who 
have considered it, are urged as follows :— 
1. The personal influence of the teacher is lessened 
by being more widely distributed. 
2. The child can adjust himself to one teacher easily, 
but is confused by trying to do so with several. 
3. It is more difficult to place responsibility for poor 
teaching, since poor teaching in one subject tends to 
lower the pupil’s standing in all subjects. 
4. The plan increases the difficulty of securing good
-P-A-G-E-344
332 THE STUDIES OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
order because of confusion in passing from room to 
room. 
5. The teachers will tend to exaggerate the impor- 
tance of their subjects and to make the work too difficult 
for pupils of that age. 
6. Teachers become narrow by being confined to the 
teaching of one subject. 
7. This plan makes the school organization more 
difficult. 
From a given investigation in 1910, it is reported that 
471 principals had tried the Junior High School plan in 
some form; and that 467, or 76 per cent of all reporting, 
favored it. 
The most thorough-going advance in this field wasmade 
in New York State in 1910, when it was provided that 
the seventh and eighth grades should forman Intermediate 
School, in which high-school subjects may be introduced. 
This is the most important improvement in educational 
administration that has been made since public high 
schools were established, for it makes the Junior High 
School or some equivalent school possible, and the 
prediction may safely be ventured, that the New York 
plan will ere long be followed by a majority of the states 
of the American Union.

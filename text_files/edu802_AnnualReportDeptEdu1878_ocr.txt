TOTAL COST OF THE SYSTEM. 
The salaries of County Superintendents are not included in the 
above statement of expenditures, because the reports from which it 
is consolidated are made up from the accounts of District Clerks. 
The County Superintendent receives his salary (if any) from the 
County Trustee, upon the order of the Chairman of the County 
Court, sometimes from the school fund, before being apportioned to 
the School Districts, and in other cases from the County Treasury. 
Consequently these salaries are not included either in the receipts or 
expenditures above given. If added to the receipts they would in- 
crease the amount by their sum. In estimating the total cost of the 
system in the State, they should obviously be added, as well as the 
expenses for salary, printing and postage of the State Superinten- 
dent’s office at Nashville. The State Superintendent is required by
-P-A-G-E-9

‘law to furnish teachers’ registers for all the Public Schools, blank 
forms for bonds, contracts, enumeration of school population, cer- 
tificates to teachers, and reports of Superintendents and Directors, 
the cést of which is paid from the interest on school fand by war- 
rant on the Comptroller. These items, added to the expenditures 
accounted for as above, present the following statement, showing the 
total cost of the system:

The above summaries show the balance on hand Sept. 1, 1878, to 
be $170,162.77, from which must be deducted the indebtedness re- 
ported; which then presents: the following statement of true bal-

SCHOOL POPULATION, 
The enumeration of scholastic population of three counties, 
Grainger, Van Buren and Wayne, was not returned in detail, and 
the figures used are for the enumeration of 1877, The reason given 
by the County Superintendents for not making the returns is that 
the district clerks failed to report, and they were not sufficiently 
compensated to travel over the county and get them. 
SCHOOLS AND ENROLLMENT, 
Four counties failed to report the number of schools and of 
teachers, Grainger, Lauderdale, Rhea and Wayne. The same rea- 
son is assigned for the delinquency, excepting in the case of Lau- 
derdale, where the Superintendent was prostrated by. sickness. 
The schools of Hardin are estimated, the most of the clerks having 
failed to report. Schools were opened and carried on in all these 
counties, which, in addition to Houston, Loudon and Van Buren, 
made no report of enrollment of pupils, and, (except Houston par- 
_ tially), of average attendance. Had these seven counties made 
’ fall reports, the percentage reported of enrollment and of average 
attendance would have been considerably larger, as it was in fact. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Twenty-two counties make no report of private schools. In. 
some of these were no private schools opened which were not con- 
solidated with the Public Schools. The difficulty of getting returns 
from the other counties accounts for their absence. And it is not 
' supposed that the reports from the seventy-two counties, which 
have made returns, are complete and full, As is the case with the - 
Public Schools, the correct enrollment and attendance are above 
rather than below the figures given.
-P-A-G-E-13
[ 13 ] 
SCHOOL HOUSES, 
There has been a gratifying movement in many counties for the 
supply of better and more commodious school houses. In very 
many school districts the accommodations are.most wretched still, 
but the spirit of progress has begun and is contagious. Next to 
good teachers, there is no part of the machinery of public education 
which is more necessary to efficiency, and it is hoped that the time 
is not far distant when every school district in the State will be 
able to boast of its neat, convenient and comfortable school houses, 
supplied with suitable furniture and apparatus. Several counties 
made no report of ‘school houses. In many school districts the 
Public Schools are taught in churches, but it is desirable that the 
directors should, if practicable, supply separate houses in which the 
schools should be taught. ‘The fund is too small to build houses 
and open the schools during the same year. Hence, it has been 
suggestéd to build the houses by private effort wherever the people 
can be induced to do so. In many cases this has been done, and it 
has never failed to give a strong impulse to education, and both to 
strengthen and impart permanency to the system. 
THE FINANCIAL EXHIBIT. 
An encouraging fact in the financial exhibit is the satisfactory in- 
crease in receipts of school money, making an aggregate larger than 
that of any year since the establishment of the present system, ex- 
cept the year of its inauguration, Notwithstanding the failure of 
incomes, the shrinkage in values, and the decreased assessment of 
property, this result appears as a cheering signal of increasing in- 
terest in public education, and the almost sole precursor of return- 
ing prosperity to the country, and that without increased taxation 
or the evidence of additional burden on the tax payer. The 
absence of serious complaint at whatever burden is im- 
posed, establishes the conclusion that the majority of the people 
have learned the truth so forcibly expressed by an English states- - 
man, that “taxes raised for the purpose of education are like vapors 
which rise only to descend again in fertilizing showers to bless and 
beautify the land.” ‘And the cheerfulness with which these bur- 
dens are met in nearly all the counties of the State shows that the 
people are beginning to understand that agriculture, mining, manu-
-P-A-G-E-14
f 14 ] 
facturing, mechanical employment and commercial enterprise only 
farnish the abundant and often misapplied material of the wealth of 
States; while its engineers and executives are a virtuous, skilled and 
educated people, without which not even the most generous soil can 
be well cultivated, nor the most productive mines developed, nor 
the most promising manufactures successfully operated, nor the 
_ skill of the mechanic set in motion, nor commerce stimulated to its 
wonderful achievements. It is this now well recognized economy 
in education which has placed it forward as the first factor.in the 
material progress and prosperity of nations, and has stimulated the 
civilized governments of earth to make the Public School system 
paramount to standing armies or a full exchequer—to the purse or 
sword. Competition in manufacturing art and in the cultivation of 
.the soil has grown so keen that no community, though it possess 
the most abundant crude mining products and the most productive 
lands, can hold its own without a continual -and increasing supply of 
skilled and educated laborers and artisans. Not only is it unable to 
compete in prices with those communities which train the minds as 
well as the hands, but it cannot bring into market fabrics or products 
which will compare in quality with those prepared by brain-directed 
skill. ‘ 
Thus we have supplemented to the moral and political considera- . 
tions, which make public education a necessity in a free State, that 
predominant argument which has forced its adoption upon despotic 
governments as an act of self-preservation, and a condition of the 
perpetuation of their civilization, and of their material wealth and 
prosperity. 
a IMMIGRATION. 
And not only is it a well recognized fact among enlightened 
statesmen that the skill, intelligence and enterprise of a native 
population must be stimulated and developed by the efficient 
Public School system, but it is also a condition precedent to a large, 
desirable and constant influx of intelligent immigrants that the 
facilities must be offered for the free education of their children, 
It is clearly demonstrable, because it rests upon the induction of 
- facts, that soil, climate or natural productions alone are not suffi- 
ciently attractive to the class of immigrants which Tennessee most 
needs—skilled artisans, educated laborers and farmers trained in 
improved agriculture and the use of Iabor-saving machinery. -
-P-A-G-E-15
| 
Our soil, our climate, our variety of products, our water power, 
our mineral wealth are of undisputed excellence, and yet the con- 
stant tide of immigration which has been so long looked for has 
barely begun, and, it may safely be affirmed, will never grow into a 
great movement until it is known and advertised that our Public 
School system is equal to the demands of that class who themselves 
will add to our wealth by coming, and who are resolved that if they 
do come, their children must enjoy the same advantages of educa- 
tion which have qualified them for usefulness and self-helpfulness 
in life. Our vast areas of fertile soil, our mountains of mineral 
products and our floods of water power constitute no greater source 
of wealth-producing power than when the savage tribes roamed 
over them, ignorant of their potentiality and indifferent .as to their 
great usés, unless we can train our native population, by appropri- 
ate education first, to appreciate their value, and secondly, to trans- 
figure them by the plastic hand of skilled labor into those forms of 
usefulness and beauty which will tempt winged commerce to bear 
them off among her precious freights; and unless, too, we can induce 
a liberal, enlightened and thrifty class of immigrants to come to the 
State to help us in the great work of development which lies before 
us. Inthe language of State Superintendent Ruffner, of Virginia, 
“here is the richest of all the mines of undeveloped treasure. Here 
we unseal the mighty fountains of national power. Here we give 
children to the mother earth who will bring back to her the fertility 
of youth.’ And through all the lines of industry will thrill a new 
and. stronger life.” , 
In this way, then, may we bring to our commonwealth tenfold 
the wealth of which we have ever boasted, by cultivating the minds 
of her youth, which, in many senses, constitute themselves the 
wealth of the State and which deserve its first and highest care, and 
will make its grandest and most valuablereturns. The State cannot 
directly cultivate its soil, work its mines or direct its water power. 
But it can do more and better.. It can develop its half million 
children into such intelligence that the work of their hands and the’ 
creations of their skill from the rude material of her mountains,’ 
plains and valleys shall present a scene of diversified industry, and 
make her gifts’ of curious and cunning fabrics which shall rival 
those of England, France and Germany, whose manufacturing; ag- 
ricultural and artistic developments are due to the same stimulating ©

cause, which we must adopt to take rank among the wealth-produc- 
ing States of Europe and America. 
‘ THE ECONOMIC ELEMENT. 
It has proved a fortunate circumstance in the history of popular ~ 
education that this great economic element of its power has been 
brought to the front to coerce sluggish statesmen to its support. 
The grand appeals of Luther and all his worthy successors of the 
Protestant faith in its behalf, because it opened the way to the study 
and practice of religious freedom, and unlocked the arcana of the 
_ Bible to laymen, sufficed to introduce it slowly to the enlightened 
nations. The key-note sounded by Washington as the concert 
movement of free peoples and nations whose institutions are based 
on popular consent, when he so grandly said: “ Promote, as an ob- 
ject of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of 
knowledge,” was not even sufficiently powerful to engraft upon our 
State system the necessity of universal education as the absolute es- 
sential of the perpetuity of a popular form of government. The 
father of his country was ably seconded by the first statesman of 
his era, Mr. Jefferson, when he declared emphatically: “ Were it 
necessary to give up either the Primaries or the University,1 would 
rather abandon the last, because it is safer to have a whole people 
respectably enlightened, than a few in a high state of science and 
the many in ignorance,” ‘This he said, although he directed that 
' “the founder of the University of Virginia and author of the Dec- 
laration of American Independencé” be carved upon his tomb-stone. 
Yet, with all this, we have advanced slowly, and aid has been 
grudgingly given to Public Schools by the States upon whom Wash- 
ington and ‘Jefferson shed the lustre of their renown and the halo of 
their statemanship. But we now havea new epoch. Progress in 
mechanical invention, in competing industries, and in the wealth of 
nations, and the improvements in easy transit, have stimulated both © 
manufacturing and agricultural skill to such keen and eager compe- 
tition that the slothful, the ignorant and the unskilled common- 
wealths are left: to become no better than the Barbary States, if they 
fail to develop their people, and thus develop their communities, 
The potent element of wealth or poverty, progress or decay, ‘is 
thrown into the scale, and the sleeping politician who fails to align 
himeelf among the friends of free Public Schvols at once betrays. his

people, . . 
LABOR IN EDUCATION. 
The elementary education imparted in our Public Schools is by 
the common consent of civilized nations, taken as the foundation of 
all education, to whatever pursuit or profession in after life it may 
jead, and whether it be intended to promote morality and religion, 
conserve the State and civil rights, or-to prepare for the business . 
and ayocations of life. While this elementary preparation does not 
of itself always lead to religious or moral habits; yet, it cannot be 
denied that it opens the way to the understanding of all ethical and 
religious codes and instruction, and that it is the key to the reposi- 
tory of. sacred literature. | While it does not directly unfold the 
principles of civil right and political economy, yet it is evident that 
it is the vestibule where, as in ancient Rome, the images of our pa~ 
triotic ancestors may be beheld, and that he who eriters this vesti~ 
bule has the entree to the temple of political science. This elemen- 
tary education may not prepare youth for the great practical work 
of every great nation, the agricultural and mechanical employments, 
which are the sources of wealth, and prosperity, but it should be 
made subservient and secondary to this important work of prepara~ 
tion, and it is certain that without its essential aid no skill or intel~ 
ligence in any avocation of life can exist. The public elementary 
and grammar schools should be made the instruments of teaching,. 
both by the precept and example of the teacher, that all labor is not 
only. honorable but noble, when pursued for right ends. The hurt- 
fal doctrine should be universally discarded that education is but 
the avenue to exemption from manual labor, but it should be shown 
that iti is the means of making that labor more ready to the hand, 
re. intelligent, more remunerative, more swift and.more satisfac- 
‘ary. ‘Instead of this doctrine, the truth should be constantly incul~ _ 
cated that it is the decree of Providence that the great mass of men. 
and women must be laborers in some sphere, and that instead of de 
spisiag it, they should dignify, honor and ennoble it, as the c@an- 
servator of individual honor and independence, the support of hu- 
man virtue, the safeguard of religion, government and society, and 
the promoter of family and national wealth. and prosperity: 
problem should be constantly studied how to make i it most efficient, oe

» most remunerative and most respected—how to banish its antipodes, 
idleness with its companions, vice and discontent, from society, and 
how to most certainly affix the badge of degradation upon all who,be= 
-.dng able to contribute by their labor to human happiness, are yet 
drones in the busy hive of social life—the true pariahs in all free 
“sand intelligent communities... These are among the great problems 
to-be solved by our Public Schools as they exist, and all true teach- 
ers who enter their precincts should be devotedly impressed with a 
. ‘sense of their prime importance to the welfare of society and to the 
respectability and good repute of the Schools themselves, without 
which they will fail in the great ends. for which they were organ- 
ized and are sustained. 
An eminent educator, Prof. B. G. Northrop, of Connectieut, truly 
‘says: “The problem of our State and of our day is to elevate work 
by educating and thus elevating the workman.” “The wealth and 
welfare of individuals and States, always dependent on labor, only . 
can be most fully secured by educated labor. If rightly conducted, 
our schools, so far from breeding discontent with the humblest pur- 
suits, will prepare for success in the ordinary eallings of life.” 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
* But it is not enough for the prosperity of the State that such 
sound maxims should be taught. The time has arrived in our his- 
tory when industrial schools, for the purpose of promoting special 
skill in agricultnral and methanical pursuits, should be employed. 
We have only to look at the advantages which these schools have 
conferred on Scotland, Ireland and England, as well as upon the 
continental nations, to convince us of their utility in training up 
master morkmen and foremen as well as skilled laborers for the 
various avocations of life and for increasing the products of the soil 
and improving the fabrics of manufacturers, thus enhancing indi- 
vidual and national wealth and affording employment to all. | Bel- 
gium, Germany and France alone have about eighty thousand grad- 
uated apprentices from their industrial schools, besides their agri- 
cultural schools and schools of forestry. In Ireland agricultural 
schools are interwoven with the eommon school system. All. the 
trades are learned in these schools on the continent, and the girls 
are taught to sew, weave, embroider and make lace, as well as to 
practise household duties. In Switzerland there are twenty-seven

industrial schools, the most important of which is a Horological 
Institute, at Geneva, in which watch-making is taught, and the re+ 
sult of which is that ‘one million watches are made per annum, while 
in ribbon, muslin, delaine and wood-carving, her fabrics rival those 
of any neighboring nation. Thus a small nation, whose soil is stet- 
ile and which is almost destitute of mineral ores, exacts tribute to 
her trade from all the world, by her taste, skill and industrythe 
vesult: of her industrial schools. 
That such schools should be encouraged in connection with our 
Public School system in Tennessee, has grown to be an earnest -con- 
Viction with most of eur thoughtful minds. Our excellent State 
University at Knoxville, eligibly situated in the beautiful metropo- . 
Jis'of East Tennessee, furnishes fortunately the foundation for such 
‘ ‘encouragement, and when thoroughly organized and equipped, as is 
the design of its present able faculty,-and of its Board of Trustees, 
‘it is destined to prove the pioneer in the noble work of industrial 
education, embracing beth the agricultural avd mechanical depart- 
ments. This question has been earnestly and ably discussed in some 
‘of our Teachers’ Institutes, notably at the State Teachers’ Associa~ 
tion, held at Jackson in January, 1878, and has thus been the means 
of awakening a solid sentiment in favor of early action and practical 
measures. in its behalf, . 
TEACHERS’ CONVENTIONS, | 
In connection with these Teachers’ Conventions and Institutes’ 
which have been held for the last two years in the Congressional 
Districts of the State, it is necessary to remark that, following the 
example of all States which have suecessfully organized efficient 
Public School systems, it was deemed an essential in our State to 
depart somewhat from the mere routine administration prescribed 
by the law, by holding these meetings, in order to meet the just ex- 
‘pectations of the people and justify the burdens which the system 
imposed. In using this powertul instrumentality, I conceived that 
the best. talent and attainments of the teaching profession within the 
State should he secured if possible. . The object was two-fold, @. to 
benefit the teachers themselves by stimulating discussion and in- 
quiry and promoting among them'a needful esprit de corps ; and (2) 
to challenge public investigation into the grounds of a-Pubji¢ School. 
system by the State, and invite into that arena the sympathies and —
-P-A-G-E-20
  { 0 j 
approving séntiments of the people at large. The success of these 
” ineetings would evidently depend on the character of the co-opera= 
tion which should be successfully summoned to this important work. 
‘The best and ablest teachers must be conciliated to the work and 
_ their hearty and earnest aid secured. That the work of such men 
should leave a most satisfactory and profound impression upon the 
cultivated audiences which should attend, and upon the teachers who 
are ambitious of and striving to attain facility, if not distinction, in 
the teaching art, could not be doubted. 
That improvement in method and elevation in standard should 
have succeeded the steady and sustained efforts of these lecturers is 
_ but natural, - And that the people themselves should, thus en- 
-lightened, have been led to take a more favorable view of-a system, 
thus ably sustained and fortified, is unquestionable. The highest 
corollaries of deep study and learning are evolved by the Institute 
lectures. And accordingly, the opponents of the system melt away 
before such efforts, and the system itself becomes firmly rooted ‘in 
the confidence and affections of the people. : 
-I have the pleasure of stating that during the last year I was 
ably sustained and seconded at these meetings by such teachers as 
Dr. Edward 8, Joynes, cne of the ablest English philologists and 
linguists of our country; by Prof. James Dinwiddie, who ably fills 
the chair of mathematics in the Southwestern Presbyterian Univer- 
sity; Superintendent W. F. Shropshire; Prof. G. R. MeGce, of Tren= 
ton; Prof. J. E. Scobey, of Murfreesboro; Prof. C. W. Callender, of 
Sumner; Profs. S, H. Lockett, R. L. Kirkpatrick and E. Alexan- 
der, University. of Tennessee ; Superintendent H. Presnell, Jones= 
boro; Superintendent 8. Y. Caldwell, J. E. Bailey and J. C. Red- 
-man, Nashville Public Schools; Prof J. C, Terrill, Winchester ; 3 
Miss Clara Conway, Memphis, and many others whose services . 
to the cause were of the highest value and were given with 
tare and spontaneous cordiality and devotion. At the two 
Tustitutes held at Union City and Brownsville, the teachers 
. present also enjoyed the great privilege of hearing lectures on 
“the re-adjustment of labor,” and on “graded schools,” from the 
distinguished Superintendent of the St. Louis Schools, Dr. W. T. 
Harris, who came to mingle with his brother teachers of Tennessee, 
on thesé interesting occasions, by special invitation. 
oti is but just to mention, however, that there were two of this
-P-A-G-E-21
{ 21 J 
select corps whose punctual attendance was so remarkable when- 
ever they engaged to attend, and whose enthusiasm on all 
occasions was so marked as to entitle them to the elected leadership 
of their fellow-teachers. These were Dr. Edward 8S. Joynes and 
Miss Clara Conway—the first, in his chosen theme of our noble 
mother tongue, so rapturous and magnetic in his treatment of the 
interesting and popular theme in all its branches as to seem to have 
touched it with the wand of genius itself; and the last, so clear in 
each exposition of method as te win the unanimous approval and 
applause of her discriminating professional audiences. 
*It is proper to say that these important meetings could never 
have been successfully held without the generous aid tendered to 
them by the wise, prudent and provident General Agent of the 
Peabody Edueation Fuad, Dr. B. Sears, whose appropriation to that 
object enabled the traveling expenses of those traveling long dis- 
tances, and not locally interested, to be paid. 
PEABODY FUND. 
The appropriations from the Peabody Education Fund for the 
last year, within the State, have been as follows: :

This sum is as large or larger than that appropriated. to.any other- 
State for the year, and attests the earnest solicitude by the Board of 
‘Exust in the success of our schools, as well as the confidence. felt. 
that earnest, honest and intelligent efforts have been made to sus— 
tain them in an efficient. condition. I need not reiterate the con- 
victién that the encouragement which has been thus given by the. 
wise disposition of this fund, has proven always an invaluable ae- 
éessory in the arduous work of organizing and sustaining the cause. 
of popular education in this State and the South. 
STATE NORMAL COLLEGE. 
The report of the Secretary of the State Board: of Edueation, cov— 
ering the President’s report, is herewith submitted, from which it 
appears that the institution has had.asuccessful career far beyond the. 
expectations of its friends. I have had occasion personally to make 
frequent visits to the college, and was always deeply impressed with. 
its efficieney and usefulness, in its high special sphere of preparing: 
teachers for the Public Schools of the State. Having been founded 
by the beneficence and enlightened public zeal and spirit of others, 
and never having taxed the treasury of the State or School Fund a 
cent, it should not only receive a generous and grateful appreciation, 
but should become the object of the wise fostering care and supervi- 
sion of the State. 
The suggestions and recommendations of the Secretary of the. 
Board are fully and cordially approved. The able and profound 
address delivered by. Dr. Barnas Sears, LL.D., at the commence- 
ment exercises of the College, is: published in the Appendix, as a. 
valuable addition to our educational literature. 
REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. - 
‘The teports of the various County Superintendents are singularly 
united in suggesting certain changes in the law. Viewing its provi- 
sions from. a practical stand-point, based on eonstant .experience, 
their opinions are entitled to much weight, These points may be. 
thus summed up: 
1. Provision, of a more compulsory character, for adopting and 
enforcing uniformity in text-books in counties. 
_2... The establishment of’ a County Board of Edueation,. or Execu~ 
tive Committee, i in the counties, to. supervise and unify school work,
-P-A-G-E-23
[ 23 ] 
Promote efficiency and secure reports and responsibility, both in 
financial and educational results. 
3. The change of the scholastic year, so as to begin on July Ist," 
and end on June 30th, each year, thus avoiding the division of 
the scheol year and confusion of county aid district reports. 
4, A better, safer and cheaper system of distributing and disburs- 
ing school money than the present one, looking to but one disburs- 
ing officer in each county. 
5. A uniform provision of law to modify and change school dis- 
tricts, so as to adapt them to the natural features of counties, and 
promote convenience and accessibility. 
These suggestions well merit careful and mature consideration, 
and are submitted respectfully with my hearty approval. / 
In conclusion, I can but renew my sincere and earnest thanks for 
your continued encouragement and support.

STATE NORMAL COLLEGE. 
  REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 
NasHVILLE, TENN., Dec. 1, 1878. ~ 
To Hon. Leon Trousdale, Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Srr—In transmitting through you to the General Assembly the 
following lucid Report of Chancellor Stearns, I may be permitted 
to say that the President and State Board of Education have watched 
the rapid development and progress of the State Normal College 
with great interest and gratification. It has fulfilled the pledges of 
its warmest friends. Ifcontinued upon the basis already laid it 
wwill in a few years rank high among those educational institutions 
having national or continental reputation. This is strong language, 
but true. For the College is peculiar in its field and in its work. 
In this connection, allow me to call marked attention to the fol- 
lowing extract from the letter of George Peabody, founding his 
great “ Education Fund,” in 1867. It will appear from this that 
unless a stupidity is exhibited without parallel in the history of.ed- 
ucation, Tennessee has an opportunity of gaining one of the grandest 
institutions in America. 
“J furthermore give to you the power, in case two-thirds of the - 
Trustees shall at any time after the lapse of thirty years, deem it 
expedient to close this Trust, and, of the funds which at that time - 
shall be in the hands of yourselves and your successors, to distribute 
not less than two-thirds among such educational or literary institu- 
tions, or for such educational purposes as they may determine, in 
the States for whose benefit the income is now appointed to be used. 
‘The remainder may be distributed by the Trustees for education or 
literary purposes, wherever they may deem it expedient.” _ 
All of which is respectfullly submitted by .

REPORT OF THE CHANCELLOR: 
[To the Board of Education 
of the State of Tennessee: 
’ GentLEMEN—In presenting my Annual Report of the State 
: Normal College for the year ending September 1, 1878, I have 
the honor to state, that the progress and condition of the College 
have been such as to exceed the most sanguine expectations of its 
officers and friends. The whole number of students connected with 
it has been 108, of whom 89 were from Tennessee, the balance be- 
‘ing Scholarship Students, to whom more particular reference will be 
made hereafter: 
The health of the students has been remarkably good, and their 
devotion to the study atid practice necessary to prepare themselves 
for the Teachers’ profession praiseworthy. 
DEGREES. 
The Senior Class: were entitled to graduate at the Annual Com- 
_ mencement, May 29, with the degree of “Licentiate of Instruc- 
tion.” Several of its members, however, being obliged, by the con- 
ditions attached to scholarships which they held, to remain another 
year, and others not thus obligated wishing to do so for further ad- 
-vancement, it was determined to form them into an advanced class, 
. to graduate the succeeding year with the addition of the usual Col~ 
lege or University Degree of Bachelor of Arts, with the sanction of 
. the Trustees of the University of Nashville. This left four only 
to constitute the regular graduating class for the year. 
One teacher has-been added to the corps of instruction—Mr, Hy, 
P. Grover, of Boston University. The whole corps for the year

VISITORS, 
The College has been frequently visited by His Excellency, the. 
Governor of the State, the State Superintendent of Public Educa- 
tion, members of the Board of Education and Officers of the State . 
Government and Teachers, and persons interested in education in ~ 
this and other States, 
DONATIONS, ETO. 
Several valuable donations of books, etc., have been received, 
among which are a set of Harkness’ Latin books, sufficient for a 
elass, Anderson’s General History, from. their authors; set of 
Mason’s National Music Charts, from Ginn Bro., and Globe and 
Maps, from J. E. Dorland, agent for A. S. Barnes & Co. 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
. Several of the class-rooms have been provided with modern and 
tasteful farniture ; rooms have been fitted up for the Chemical and 
Philosophical departments, and considerable apparatus for the illus- 
tration of physical science procured, for which the College is in- 
debted, mainly to the liberality of the Trustees of the Peabody 
Education Fund; the parties from whom these articles were pro- 
cured having made large concessions in prices in favor of the Col- 
lege. Other, though comparatively small improvements upon the 
principal building and grounds have been made, but by no means to 
the fall extent demanded by the convenience and purposes of the . 
College. 
CABINET. 
A valuable cabinet of rocks and minerals, and casts of forts of 
extinct species of animals has been procured, constituting one of the 
most useful, as well as valuable, Paleontological Cabinets in the / 
Southern States, This purchase was made possible by large deduc-- 
tions from usual prices made by Prof. H. A, Ward, of Rochester,

PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The Peabody Scholarships to which reference has been made will 
“pe best explained by the following circular, issued Oct, 1, 1876. 
“Jn view of the want of well established and thoroughly furnished 
‘ Normal Schools of a high order in the South, except for colored 
. teachers, and of the fact that few of the States in this section of the 
country are in a condition to establish one at present within their 
own borders, the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund have 
- contributed a part of the amount necessary to convert the Literary 
‘Department of the University of Nashville .into a State Normal 
College. They have furthermore determined to establish in this 
school a limited number of scholarships of $200 each, for the en- 
couragement and aid of pupils from adjoining States, whose char- 
acters, abilities, general culture and health give special promise of 
usefulness as teachers.” 
“Applicants must have the unqualified recommendation of the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, pass with an examiner 
appointed by him for the purpose, a good examination for a gradu- 
ate of a first-class High School, be accepted by President Stearns, 
and promise to teach at least two years in the Public Schools, if 
they have an opportunity. If, upon a half year’s trial, reasonable 
expectations are not m@, the scholarship will be discontinued. The 
-longest period for which it will be given to any pupil is two years, 
‘Application is to be made to the undersigned, or to President 
‘Stearns, through the State Superintendent. 
B. SEARS, 
General Agent.’’ 
Sraunton, Va., October 1, 1876. 
- “In view of the liberality of the Trustees of the Peabody Educa- 
. tion Fund, and to carry out the design contemplated in the above 
‘circular more fully, it has been determined to make no charge for
-P-A-G-E-51
[ 53 4 
tuition in the case of those holding “ scholarships,” and that tuition 
shall also be free to all students from Tennessee, ladies or gentle- 
men, who intend to fit themselves for the teachers’ profession. A 
charge, however, of $2.00 per term will be made in every case for 
use of books and for incidental expenses. 
Catalogues and further information may be obtained from 
EBEN 8S. STEARNS, 
President.” 
In accordance with this arrangement, an assignment of scholar- 
ships was made to the States entitled to them, by Dr. Sears, the _ 
General Agent of the Peabody Education Fund. Some of these 
States were not at this time prepared to avail themselves of the 
offered privilege, and several were not able to fill their quotas. The 
Hon. G. J. Orr, State Superintendent of Instruction for Georgia, 
received nearly two hundred applications for these scholarships, but 
as he had been allowed but five, it was deemed best to institute a 
competitive examination for these places. Eighty, or more, persons 
responded and were duly examined. The five who stood highest 
were authorized, of course, to apply for admission to the College, 
and at his earnest solicitation five more, who stood nearly as well, 
were added, and these ten have constituted Georgia’s delegation. 
There have been during the year seven scholarship students from 
Virginia, ten from Georgia, and two from Florida, making nine-, 
teen in all. It is understood that their number will be largely 
increased hereafter.* 
The influence of this arrangement with the Trustees of the 
Peabody Fund upon the future of the College, cannot be otherwise 
than most beneficial. These scholarships are to be filled by the very 
best of the young men and women of the South. They will come 
with well attested moral characters and habits, good intellects, con+ 
siderable attainments in study, and with a determination to make 
the two years, during which they are required to remain at the 
College, as useful as possible. To this must be added, not merely the 
notoriety given to the institution all over the country, but also, the - 
deep interest taken in the College, and especially in this feature of it, 
by the eminent gentlemen who compose the “Trustees of the Peabody . 
  
*There are already thirty-eight such students at the College, with eight or ten 
more to come-—-Dec. 1878,
-P-A-G-E-52
           [ 54 J] 
. Education Fund,” and the State Superintendents of Education and 
other officers of all these States, who-are naturally anxious to send 
us their best material, and to have the students reflect honor upon 
° Both the College and their native States. As the Head Officer of this 
stitution, I am thus brought into interesting and pleasing rela- 
tions with all those friends of popular education, and enjoy the ben- 
* efit of their sympathy and support. 
..7 ‘As a still further evidence of this interest in the advancement of 
all classes of students at the College; the Trustees of the Peabody 
Fund offer, MEDALS struck in memory of GEoRGE PraBopy, to 
students especially meritorious. The terms and conditions of the 
award will be.seen best by reference to the following circular. 
PEABODY MEDALS. 
Three Medals—one of silver and two of bronze—having been 
offered by the Trustees of the “Peabody Education Fund,” for 
" distinguished excellence in the Senior and Middle Classes, the fol- 
“. lowing conditions of competition and award were prescribed by the 
undersigned, a committee of award, appointed by the Executive 
, Committee of the Board. 
The names of the successful competitors will be given in a future 
catalogue. 
As a first condition for competition, all candidates must be mem~- 
bers of the Senior or Middle Classes, and must show that they have 
maintained an average of 90 per cent. as exhibited by the records of 
the instructors respectively, vis: 
1. In constancy and punctuality of attendance upon daily ses- 
sions and all required exercises. 
2. In general character, demeanor, and whatever appertains to 
. general culture, as far as developed. 
8. In scholarship. 
4. In ability to manage classes and impart instruction,as shown 
"> in the regular work of the College. 
All students exhibiting said rank will be entitled to HonoRABLE 
Mawri0n i in the Annual Catalogue of the University, over the sig- 
natures of the Committee of Award, and will be admitted to, final 
, corpetition for the Peabody Medals,
-P-A-G-E-53
  [ 55 ] 
Members of the Junior Class exhibiting the rank required for ~ 
competition in the other classes, and on the conditions prescribed — 
for them, will also be entitled to Honorable Mention in the Annual 
University Catalogue. 
On the third Wednesday in’ May, all students in the Senior and 
Middle Classes, thus entitled to compete for the medals, will be 
assigned some topic connected with their professional work, previ- 
ously announced, on which they will be required to write an expo- 
sition or essay in the presence of the Committee, or some person ap- . 
pointed by them. These essays will be examined by the Committee 
respectively, and ranked according to merit, and the rank thus 
obtained will be added to the rank before mentioned and decide the 
award.

CITY SCHOOLS TO BECOME MODEL SCHOOLS HEREAFTER, 
At the close of the year an arrangement was entered into between 
the Board of Instruction for the city of Nashville and this College, 
whereby the city schools, and more particularly the Howard school, 
located in this vicinity, will be regarded as taking the place of a 
smaller and less representative MODEL ecHooL. The plan has not 
"yet been perfected in detail. An offer of a similar character was 
made by the City Superintendent of Edgefield, but our numbers 
and circumstances will not permit us to accept it at present. I look 
upon this measure as one of great importance, not only on account 
of the actual benefit to be derived by our students from the oppor- 
- tunity thus afforded to observe minutely a great system of graded 
  schools in full operation, and to teach in them as substitutes, from. 
time to time, but as showing the amicable relations subsisting be~ 
tween the parties.

VISIT OF THE GENERAL AGENT OF THE PEABODY EDUCATION 
FUND. 
The most interesting event of the year was, perhaps, a visit from 
Rev. Dr. Sears, the General Agent of the Peabody Education Fund, 
who came as the guest of the University-of Nashville, to attend its 
Commencement and deliver the Annual Address. The intimate, in- 
deed vital, connection which this distinguished gentleman had with 
the establishment of the State Normal College, his deep interest, 
not merely in its general success, but also in its inner life, constantly 
manifested by his agency in securing from the Peabody Fund the - 
money essential to its very being, made his visit to the College an 
occasion of peculiar interest to the officers and students, As the 
carriage containing this revered educator and philanthropist, the 
Hon. E. H. Ewing, President of the Trustees of the University of 
Nashville, and the President of the College, approached the main- 
building, he was greeted by a welcome address by James A. Noyes, 
of Georgia, in behalf of the students, to which he briefly respond- 
ed. He was then escorted between long files of students to the 
. President’s office, where several distinguished gentlemen were wait- 
ing to receive him. He was then taken to the Chapel, which had 
been tastefully decorated with evergreens and flowers for the occa- 
sion, where another address was made by Mary Gibson, of Tennes- 
see, and a handsome bouquet of flowers presented. The usual devo- 
tional exercises of the day followed, conducted by Rey. Dr. Palmer, 
of New Orleans, after which the visiting gentlemen were taken to” 
the class-rooms, witnessed the daily work of the College, and then - 
returned to the Chapel, where, after the usual exercises in teaching, 
etc., by the students, an address was made by Hon. E. H. Ewing, 
and finally by Dr. Sears. 
As such occasions may not be of frequent occurence, I have 
thought the present one of sufficient interest to take a place in the / 
history of the College. 
COMMENCEMENT. 
The second annual commencement was held at Masonic Hall,.on 
Wednesday evening, May 29, and was attended by a very large au- 
dience, composed of citizens and strangers. The graduates, ‘the 
larger portion of the class, having concluded to remain at the Col- 
lege another year, consisted of Michael Lawrence Coen, Edgefield,
-P-A-G-E-56
[ 58 ] 
Tenn.; William John Goodrum, Fall Creek, Tenn.; Thomas Gor- 
. taan, Donelson, Tenn.; Jacob McGavock Lindsley, Nashville, Tenn., 
on whom the degree of “ Licentiate of Instruction” was duly con- 
‘ferred by the President. The same degree was also conferred as 
« HONORARY by your Board upon Miss Julia A. Sears and Miss 
. Emma M. Cutter, teachers in the College. 
     
   
‘ ADDRESS AND MEDALS. 
The annual address was made by Rev. Dr. Sears, intro- 
duced by His Excellency Governor Porter, and was not only 
.- published with the proceedings in the daily papers, but has been, I 
learn, deemed by the Peabody Trustees of sufficient general interest 
‘and importance to be printed with their annual minutes. 
The medals were also conferred by Dr. Sears, with an appropri- 
ate address. 
It will thus be seen that the year has been one of great prosper- 
ity, in spite of the manifold obstacles too well-known to require 
_ particular notice here. All that is now wanting to develop the 
great capacity of the College for usefulness to our citizens, and to 
make it the honest pride of Tennessee, is a more intimate knowl- 
edge of its designs and its necessity to the efficiency of our Public 
Schools, and that the interest of the people, whose institution it is, 
more than any other claiming their notice, should testify their re- 
- gard for it by aiding in its support. 
TENNESSEE HAS THUS FAR MADE FOR IT NO APPROPRIATIONS. 
During the already three years of its existence Tennessee, as is 
well-known, has contributed nothing whatever to aid in sustaining 
an agency on which so much of her future prosperity depends. 
‘The venerable University of Nashville, proud of its history and 
long roll of eminent graduates, has come nobly forward, substi- 
tuted for her literary department this Normal College, giving 
her the use of her buildings, grounds and funds, and free tuition to all. 
The Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund have done the rest, 
’ For the year already opened the Peabody Fund has appropriated 
- $9,000 to support the College. The scholarships, which will be not 
” far from 40 the coming year, will bring into the State not less than 
$8,000 more, all of which, and much more, will be expended in thig
-P-A-G-E-57
  [ 59 ] 
State. All parties interested in the College, in the Publie Schools, 
and the progress and welfare of this community, would look with 
deep regret upon any course which might tend to diminish the in- 
terest of the parties now supporting it. But it is evident that the 
present state of things cannot continue always. The parties re- 
terred to contemplated, it is known, with confidence, that at an 
early day the State would manifest its appreciation of the work 
they were trying to do for her; that if it objected to direct taxation _ 
for this purpose, it would, at least by a small appropriation from the 
general school fund, equalize the privileges of the College to all © 
parts of the State, either by mileage or scholarships similar to those 
created by the Peabody Education Fund for other States... It must 
be understood, however, that no measures of this kind will aid in 
‘the support of the College or help it to pay current expenses. 
On the contrary, the increase of numbers they would eccasion would 
be likely to require greater outlays for its maintenance. But if 
they are doomed to continued disappointment, it is to be seriously 
feared that they will lock with favor upon propositions which may 
be made to remove the College to some other State exhibiting greater 
interest in its welfare. For the honor of Tennessee may such a dis- 
aster be long averted. 
Respectfully submitted, 
EBEN 8. STEARNS, 
Chancellor of the University of Nashville, 
and President of State Normal College.

ADDRESS OF REV B. SEARS, D. D. LL. D. 
DELIVERED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STATE NORMAL 
COLLEGE, NASHVILLE, TENN., MAY 29, 1878. 
  
. In all great public interests, there is a simple underlying princi- 
ple from which the whole may be developed. That principle in re- 
gard to Public Schools may be stated thus: Man was made for ed- 
ucation as much as the earth was for cultivation. Both the rational 
and the material world Jose most of their value when neglected. 
Not long ago I passed, on my way to Texas, through the cultivated 
States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. I then passed through the 
rich but uncultivated Indian Territory. The contrast was painful. 
The bounties of nature seemed to be wasted for the want of the 
hand of industry. I have seen a similar contrast between a culti- 
vated and uncultivated people. Can it be that in one case itis the 
same fertile earth, and in the other the same rational beings? Look 
at Britain as it was in the days of Julins Cesar, and at England as 
it is to-day, and tell me what has made the difference? It is cul- 
ture, Compare the Germany of Tacitus with the Prussia of the 
present day, and you will see the same contrast, What has China, 
India, Mongolia and Central Africa, during so many ages, done for 
the progress of mankind? Their history, like that of the native 
. tribes of America, is mostly worthless because it lacks the essential 
. element of a progressive civilization. 
The difference between a totally uneducated and a highly educated, 
man or people isas great as between an ant and anelephant. Look at
-P-A-G-E-59
{ 61 ] 
a boor of Siberia, and then turn your thoughts to a Humboldt, and ' 
you would think you had crossed a continent in the animal king- 
dom. I agree with Huxley when he says that one such man as 
Arkwright or Watt is, in a pecuniary point of view,worth £200,060 
to England alone. There is probably vastly more of undeveloped 
resources in the capacities of man, than in the unseen mineral wealth 
of the world. If both individual man and nations are worth to the 
world one hundred times more when highly cultivated, as England. 
and Prussia are now, than when sunken in the ignorance of barbar- 
ism, education is a prime necessity to man, as it is his prerogative. 
Education, then, should be universal because the nature and neces- 
sities of man are universal, Jt is the immense disparity between 
these two, the want and the supply in the matter of education which 
is the cause of some of our greatest troubles at this very day. With 
all the learning of individual men, there is among us and around us 
a frightful mass of ignorant and almost useless citizens, which the 
educated class cannot control. If you inquire into the cause of much 
of our domestic unhappiness, you will find it is the want of culture 
and refinement. The son goes out at night for pleasure, because he 
finds so little at home. The daughter seeks amusement abroad by 
day and by night, for the same reason. The husband goes to the 
saloon and other places of resort because his wife’s stock of enter- 
taining conversation is exhausted; and she herself sits solitary at 
home in the wearisome and dull evenings, because the family finds 
more pleasure elsewhere. 
Now, if this be the history of many families in every community, 
how much of intellectual elevation, of high-toned moral sentiment 
and public spirit will be found among them? What are their social 
enjoyments—rational and improving, or low and degrading? elevat- 
ing and refining intercourse, or the sensual pleasures of eating and 
drinking, and vulgar and commonplace conversation ? 
I need not ask what are the occupations of such families. They 
will be of the plainest and coarsest kind, The arts will be of the 
rudest sort. That skill, which in this age is an essential element of 
prosperity, will be wanting. 
The sad story to be told of this class is that individual life is dul,

viting. Social life, low and unimproving; civil life, jealous, selfish

semi-barbarous. It is as Boetia compared to Attica; Ireland com- 
_. pared to Scotland; Spain to England or Prussia; Spanish America 
to the United States. 
It was once, in the days of Rousseau, fashionable to admire, at a 
distance, savage life. Men talked and wrote much about the pure 
and simple life of the children of nature. We have since learned 
that there are more cannibals than saints among these supposed in~ 
nocents. We now hear a certain class of politicians prate about the 
virtue and purity of an untaught rural population, as if gross ignor- 
ance were the only true basis of political integrity and public mor- 
ality. If this is not putting darkness for light and light for dark- 
_ ness, we do not know what is. The absurdity is too gross to admit 
of serious argument. It is brain, not argument, that is wanted. 
And yet there are men who are indifferent, and others who are 
ever hostile to the general diffusion of knowledge by means of Pub- 
lic Schools. The former know not its value, because they have not 
yet learned what all others have—that “knowledge is power.” Of 
_ its elevating influence, its broad day-light upon the soul, and its 
life-giving energy, they are totally ignorant. Though the world is 
full of examples, to them the page of history is.a blank. 
The other class appear to be more knowing than the wisest men, 
and assume to be public teachers and guides. They are the apos- 
tles of ignorance, as if divinely commissioned to keep the veil on 
the human mind, which others are endeavoring to remove. They 
forget that truth and the soul are made for each other, as much as 
‘light. is made for the eye, and the eye for the light. They heed not — 
the proverbs of Solomon, nor the voice of the wise men of one hun- 
dred generations in regard to seeking knowledge. In their view, 
the many exist for the benefit of the few—the one to do the think- 
ing of society, the others to do the work. Light is to shine 
upon these few favored sons of fortune, while thick darkness is to 
cover the people. . 
‘There are men in Virginia—I hope there are none in Tennessee 
——who, if we may- believe them, are not hostile to the Public 
Schools; they only wish to cut down unnecessary expenses. They 
want cheap schools—the cheaper the better. They would graduate 
the pay of teachers by the wages of the day laborer. “The poor,” 
they say, “do not need accomplished teachers or expensive schools. 
Nothing but the simplest elements of knowledge need: be taught

-P-A-G-E-61

  them. They have no claim for anything better. Many of them 
are vicious. Let them put their children to work. The lower 
classes will never rise. Why trouble ourselves about them? Edu-— 
cation is to them a doubtful boon; it often injures the laborer by 
making him discontented. It is all fanaticism and false philan- 
thropy.” They are now prepared to turn round and say that the 
Public Schools are vulgar; that it is no place for the children of ~ 
good families. Of course, the rich ought not to pay taxes for schools 
that do not benefit them. These men are not opposed to Public. 
Schools, Ob, no! They are the friends of a moderate, economical 
system of education. Deliver us from such friends. How came 
such fossils to turn up in this age? They are at least three centu-— 
ries behind the times. They were born and bred in sleepy hollow. . 
The wheel of time has been turning, and will not go back to accom- 
modate them. The world has moved somewhat since such ideas 
were entertained. Feudalism is dead and buried, and not even its 
ghost will ever revisit the glimpses of the moon. The peasant of’ 
former centuries has disappeared ; the citizen has taken his place. 
Now, we have only to neglect this mass of the people, to suffer their 
offspring to grow up in ignorance, and we shall have as plentiful a 
harvest of communists as France and chartists as England has ever : 
had. Indeed, these untutored, imported citizens, buried in our coal 
mines as deeply as they are buried in ignorance, are foremost in all 
disturbances, They come mostly from the Old World. They are 
secluded from society, and breathe not the atmosphere of our insti- 
tutions. They suffer from want, and in their ignorance know not 
the cause, and become the enemies of the property-holders. Strikers 
are the natural outgrowth of ignorance. Education is the only 
remedy. An ignorant populace can always be led by demagogues. 
Now, which is the wiser, the nobler, to vulgarize and brutalize 
the lower classes, or to humanize and civilize them? That is the 
question for us to settle. Shall we, or shall we not fasten the 
shackles of ignorance upon one-half or one-third of our fellow- — 
citizens ? 
What folly it is in this nineteenth century to repeat the blunders 
of preceding centuries! It was not the light of the Reformation, 
but the darkness which preceded it, and which still remained, that 
- caused the Peasants’ war in Germany. It was not Voltaire and 
Rousseau and their compeers that produced the horrors of the French
-P-A-G-E-62
[ 64 ] 
Revolution, but Louis XIV. and XV., by sinking the people to the 
level of the brutes. The wild beasts were only unchained by new 
“political events. And we have terrible convulsions in store for us, 
if we do not tame and humanize the fierce and ferocious elements of 
society by a diligent and careful training of a new generation. We 
’ have signs and tokens enough of approaching danger to give us 
timely warning. 
This crusade against Public Schools is as unwise as it is perilous. 
We live in a scientific age, and cannot get out of it. Henceforth 
all successful business will be conducted on scientific prineiples. 
The muscles of the hand and arm have given way to machinery. 
The ways of our fathers, which answered for them, will not answer 
for us. Improvements have infinitely varied and multiplied com- 
petitions. In Virginia the carriage-maker, the cabinet-maker, the 
manufaciurer of the implements of husbandry and of household ar- 
ticles find that the material is carried from our forests almost to the 
Canada line, worked up by steam or water power, and returned and 
sold here at lower rates than we can manufacture them. Hand la- 
bor is of but little account; brain work has the ascendency every- 
where. Even in so simple a work as that of making boots and 
shoes, not less than seventeen patented inventions are now used. 
Crimping, stitching, sewing, pegging, eyeleting, riveting are done in 
less time than it would require to describe the process. 
One woman can make the eyelet holes of 1,440 pairs of shoes in a 
' day. The consequence is that fewer hands are employed, although 
more work is done., In Massachusetts 30,000 fewer men in the shoe 
business alone are employed than there were in 1855. And yet the 
' manufacture is increased by $71,000,000 a year. In like manner, 
the great inventions of recent times have revolutionized nearly all 
branches of business. The New York Tribune, for its 30,000 read- 
ers, rolls off from its revolving cylinder and folds up twenty-four 
miles of printed matter for its columns every day, and not a human 
hand touches the work, which is all done by machinery. But the 
ignorant cannot be trusted to work this machinery. The people, or 
State, that is determined to do business in the primitive way, dooms 
, itself to irretrievable inferiority and insignificance. ‘ 
' Business is no longer provincial. Those who are to prosper in it 
~ must have a wider outlook than was formerly necessary. They 
must take vastly more into their calculations than their fathers did. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
{ 65 ] 
Not only is the sphere of influences affecting them wider, but the 
relations of trade are more complicated. Business is in the hands 
of experts, and a novice, though honest and industrious, is sure to 
be outdone. Competition is sharper than it was, and the competi- 
tors more numerous, and improved methods make it harder to keep 
up with the times; the adaptation of means to ends is more exact; 
and the study and forecast of coming changes in the state of busi- 
ness have become more common by means of increased knowledge. 
In these disastrous times our men must go to work with clearer 
heads as well as braver hearts. Those who take most advantage of 
the facilities furnished by science will carry off the prizes. While 
industry and economy will do much, skill will do more. The more 
mind there is applied to business the more prosperity there will be. 
General education, therefore, is the condition on which the sue- 
cess of the individual, the happiness of families, the peace of society 
and the prosperity of the State depend. How is this grand object 
best to be obtained? “Various methods have been tried during many 
centuries and in all civilized countries, and the result of these exper- 
iments is the almost unanimous opinion that not only the best but 
the only way is by a State system of Public Schools. All other 
kinds of schools, whatever their merits i in other respects, have failed 
to accomplish this object. 
PART IL 
As soon as such a system is established by law, and properly or- 
ganized, there is at once a demand ‘for an army of teachers, There 
must be not only a much larger supply of teachers, but the worth- 
less ones must be weeded out by strict examinations. . 
One of the chief dangers is that of employing cheap teachers. 
Landor represented Hanley as saying, “the readiest made shoes are 
boots cut down.” So men think the readiest made teachers are cut- 
down men of other employments. We have hundreds of such 
teachers, not one of whom has the slightest doubt of his fitness for 
the office. 
In the great demand for them, caused by the multiplication’ of 
schools, many unsuitable persons will be likely to be employed for 
want of better. Students, sometimes, who have no aptitude nor 
love for the occupation, will submit temporarily to the unwelcome 
task for the sake of replenishing their purses. Persons out of em~ 
5
-P-A-G-E-64
{ 66 ] 
ployment will offer to teach till they can find something better to 
do. The young and inexperienced will always stand ready for the 
service, which will prove a dead loss to the pupils. As none of 
these classes of teachers will give satisfaction, a new teacher will be 
sought every session, so that nothing but change and confusion will be 
perpetual. The school boards, seeing the worthlessness of teachers, 
will lower their wages. The more promising teachers will retire 
from the field, which will be held by the incompetent. No ambi- 
tious youth will think of preparing himself for an office so little re- 
spected and so little remunerative. The schools will sink in char- 
acter and reputation just in proportion as the teachers sink. Good 
families will withdraw their children and place them in private 
schools, and will be opposed to voting money when so little good is 
accomplished. And with the great majority of children the golden 
period for education will be idly passed away, never to be re- 
ealled. 
The great fault with untrained teachers is that they do little but 
teach the words and formulas of books. A Normal graduate teaches 
things, principles, thoughts. Every point is examined orally; and 
subjects are sifted by the exercise of the judgment as well as mem- 
ory. The pupil is made to see with his own eyes and to rely on his 
own observations. Books are a mere syllabus, a skeleton, to be 
clothed with flesh by the teacher and pupil. 
Practical knowledge of almost every kind is worked in continually 
with the subjects of study. All the common objects of sight, such 
as flowers, plants, trees rocks ; birds, insects, tame and wild animals ; 
forms, colors and dimensions ; manners, morals, laws of health; gym- 
nastic exercises, drawing, and the cultivation of the voice receive 
special attention. This common sense knowledge of useftil things 
is.a vital part of popular education. Instead of this, how often are 
the poor children wearied with the endless repetition of mere words, 
and dry and stale lumber of the books. 
The only way to prevent such disastrous results and to make the 
schools the pride of the people, is for the State to make provision for 
thoroughly training.a large number of teachers. When schools are 
established in every district, and a law is passed that none but com- 
petent teachers shall be employed, a profession is established, and 
persons can afford to prepare themselves for it. It will thus become 
_ @ permanent and attractive occupation when the schools become an-
-P-A-G-E-65
[ 67 ] 
nual, and when graded schools open the way for promotion from the 
lower to the higher grades. _ 
To make a suitable provision among teachers certain, it is neces- 
sary to establish Normal Schools, which is the proper function of 
the State. This will give dignity to the profession, and produce a 
radical change in the Schools. Can anything be more desirable 
than these two objects? Is there any greater reproach resting upon 
our system of education than the low character of many of the schools, 
and the utter incompetency of many of the teachers? 
I know it is said by those who do not believe in progress that a 
teacher is born, not made, which in its true sense only means that 
he should have a natural aptitude for his calling, just as if this 
principle were not applicable to a lawyer, physician or even an 
artisan of any kind. In addition to this aptitude, which only indi- 
cates what one’s occupation should be without fitting him for it, ev- 
ery man should be bred to his profession. To be a great scholar, 
even a genius must be a diligent student. To be a great- general 
one must not only be born to command, but educated to command. 
There is nothing peculiar in the case of the school teacher. His 
profession is like other professions, and requires special preparations 
as all others do and precisely for the same reason. 
The objection has been made to Normal Schools, that knowledge 
is what the teacher needs, and that our literary institutions furnish 
it best. This is only half of what the teacher needs, and much the 
easier half. You will find twenty who have this qualification, 
where you find one who knows how to teach and govern. This aé- 
sertion is made not from a theoretical point of view, but from a 
large experience and observation. I was for some years connected 
with the Public Schools of Massachusetts. School Boards who had 
formerly employed College graduates, but more recently graduates 
of the’State Normal Schools, could not be induced to appoint as 
teacher a young man just from College without a, Normal training. 
This is the more remarkable as the members of the Boards were 
‘themselves generally College graduates. It was found by trial that 
a knowledge of what is commonly taught in learned schools is not 
all that a teacher needs, He must know how to enter into the hid- 
den recesses of the youthful mind, and from that point work out- 
ward and upward. The pupil is like a treasure in the sea, and the
-P-A-G-E-66
[ 68 J 
teacher like a diver who goes to the bottom to bring it up. If you 
do not descend and ascertain first exactly where the child’s mind is 
you will not bring him up where you are. The descent of the 
teacher is essential to the ascent of the pupil. 
The beginnings of knowledge are obscure and mysterious. This 
is especially true of written language, the first things with which 
the primary teacher has to deal. The sound of long 0, for example, 
has seven different representations, and each of these has a different 
sound in other words. How does the ordinary teacher go to work? 
He makes the child commit to memory the names, not the powers, 
of these letters. What would you think of the teacher of chemistry 
who, instead of showing what oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen are, 
should merely give out the names to be committed to memory. 
There is but one thing more absurd, and that is, what an educated 
man once did who could teach Latin, Greek and mathematics. He 
called up a child, and pointing to the middle of the alphabet, said, 
“Go to your seat and get that lesson.” 
He who can begin with a child and skillfully carry him through the 
JSirst fifteen years of his life, does the greatest thing that is ever done 
for him. . 
It is said by those who know no better, that a Normal School is 
nothing after all but a State High School. They might just as well 
say that the science of medicine is nothing but physiology, civil en- 
gineering nothing but mathematics, and mining nothing but miner- 
alogy. All professions are based upon general scieuce and literature, 
but are built up on a structure of their own. There is a science of 
teaching and an art of teaching. A complete, theoretical and 
practical course, illustrated in all the branches to be taught, with 
their environments, is found nowhere out of the Normal School. 
To make this evident, one needs only to 9 learn what a Normal School 
actually is, 
Besides reviewing elementary studies to see that there are no 
chasms, no weak points, and pursuing advanced studies toshed their 
light on the former, both courses are peculiar in this, that every" 
step is taken with reference to the art of teaching. Then there is 
the difficult but indispensable study of the juvenile mind: its intu- 
itions and instincts; its dominant faculties and the order of their de- 
velopment ; its delicate organism, weakness and perils; its active,
-P-A-G-E-67
[ 69 ] 
but one-sided curiosity; its tastes and aversions; the causes of its 
lethargy or apparent dullness; its social or unsocial tendencies ; the 
- play of its various passions; its biases to good or evil; its condi- 
tion, as affected by domestic example and training; the key which 
will unlock the secrets of its character ; the passion through which it 
can be governed ; its impulsiveness and changeableness ; its love of 
living, concrete forms and distaste for abstraction; its irrepressible 
imaginations; its active but feeble intellect. 
All these are psychological] facts relating to the minds to be taught. 
Next comes the art of teaching, its conditions and processes. In 
general, how to unfold a subject from its elementary principles ; how 
‘to awaken interest and excite curiosity; how to create a sense of 
propriety and form a pure taste; how to transmute the lower into 
higher motives ; how to direct all knowledge and practical utility ; 
how to make order do the work of discipline. In particular, one 
must know the adaptation of instruction to capacity and attainment; 
the way to find a firm footing to begin with ; a sure method of ad- 
vancing from the known to the unknown ; the right proportion of 
teaching to study and thought; the relative claims of each branch 
of study ; the management of the bright and the dull; the proper 
indulgence or repression of individuality ; the kind and amount of 
actual knowledge to be given. There is a still broader and higher 
view of education to which the teacher must aspire. On ~ 
this subject a new and progressive science is springing up. On 
what fundamental principles it should be founded, is a question which 
is now tasking the stronger intellects of the old world. The ablest 
philosophical writers of Germany and England have taken up the 
subject. : 
Since the education of the entire mass of the people has been un- 
dertaken by all civilized nations, a vastly wider range is given to the 
subject than was known to the old writers. The true aim of educa- 
tion is to be more carefully fixed, the kind and degree of it appro- 
priate to the Public Schools; and the better preparation of the duties 
for life are to be more nicely adjusted. Reform—not mere innova- 
tion made on untried theories or one-sided empirical methods, or 
any dead mechanism, but sound, rational, well-tested principles of 
reform are to control the whole process. Shall all this pass over 
our heads? or shall the great thoughts of the foremost men of the 
age be put into a practical form and applied in all the schools of the
-P-A-G-E-68
[ 70 ] 
land? They must be made known by means of Normal Schools to 
the great body of teachers. Unfortunatety Normal Schools, which 
ought to come first, come last in a State system of education. 
They ought to be in operation two or three years before the Pub- 
lic Schools are opened. Then we should be saved the mortification 
of starting schools that are hardly respectable, and of staking their 
reputation on an unfair experiment. 
In all these Southern-States we labor under this great disadvan- 
tage. This dead weight will hang upon us and create a popular 
prejudice till our teachers are professionally educated. The longer 
we delay the greater will be the sacrifice both in treasure and repu- 
tation. The money paid to poor teachers is more than half wasted. 
Our motto should be: “Good teachers or none; good schools or 
none.” 
And now a word as to the future of this Normal College. 
It has been in operation three years. The Peabody fund has paid 
$24,000 (and $3,800 scholarships). The University fund, $9,000. 
The State has not yet made any appropriation, but it has put it in 
charge of its Board of Education, and the University has given the 
use of its grounds and building. 
It is not difficult to see that this mode of support cannot long con- 
tinue. What shall be done? I can easily imagine that the ex- 
treme parts of the State might object that, though they should pay 
their full share of the expense, they would not have an equality of 
privileges, in a central Normal College. 
Let provision then be made, in some way, for paying the travel- 
ing expenses of those pupils who come from a distance, thus mak-~ 
ing the advantages equal to all. That certainly would be the most 
economical and convenient arrangement for the present, and if in 
the course of time anything else should appear to be more satistac- 
tory, the way would be left open for a modification of the plan. 
Will not some measure be adopted to place this College on a per- 
manent foundation? Will the State allow one of its best institu— 
tions to languish and die from negleet ? It can now easily be made 
not only a first-class Normal School for Tennesssee, but by means 
of fifty or more Peabody scholarships, a great Southern institution, 
Does any Tennesseean desire to see it removed to another State? 
Georgia has already ten scholarships, Mississippi has applied for
-P-A-G-E-69
[ 7 ] 
nearly thirty tor the next session. Five other States are looking 
to this place for the education of their teachers. Many thousands 
of dollars will be brought into the State, probably twice as much as 
it will itself pay for the school. You will be honored by having 
one more added to your great schools of learning. Let the peo- 
ple of the State secure the boon that is offered to them, and 
they will not find the Trustees of the Peabody fund wanting im 
generosity. ‘

CITY SCHOOLS: 
  
The schools of six of the cities of the State are sustained by their 
quota of the State and county taxes together with a municipal 
tax levied by the corporation, The statistical reports of these 
schools, viz: Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Edge- 
field and Clarksville are included in the reports of the Superinten- 
dents of the counties in which they are situated. Several other 
smaller towns aid their schools with a municipal tax, viz: Shelby- 
ville, Trenton, Lebanon, Wartrace, etc. 
The following additional information with regard to these cities 
is given, from the reports of their respective Superintendents :

Owing to the delay in completing two new buildings for the first 
and secondtdistricts, the schools did not commence until October, 
and one district was deferred until December 10th. 
The average belonging, as shown in the summary, represents the 
number, counting the term from the commencement in October, 
when only a part of the schools were in session, but counting the 
time actually in session for each school, the average belonging is 
1,282, The city is waking upto the importance of furnishing better 
buildings and accommodations for the schools, and on the whole the 
outlook is very favorable, although we must be crippled financially 
for some time to come. The schools, however, are very popular, as 
the large enrollment on enumeration shows, and our percentage of 
attendance, considering the facilities for getting to school in mud 
time, etc., is very creditable. Our teachers are in earnest and gen- 
erally do faithful work. 
CLARKSVILLE. 
J. C. Brooxs, SUPERINTENDENT. 
In reference ta the “Public Graded Schools” of the city of Clarks- 
ville, I will say that these schools were established by the Board of 
Mayor and Aldermen several years since, but no effort was made to 
grade them until the session of 1877-78. During the spring and 
summer of 1877, it became apparent to the School Board that to
-P-A-G-E-72
[ 74 ] 
make the schools successful and to perpetuate the same, it would be 
necessary not only to conduct them upon the graded system, but to 
make them of such a character that they would be patronized alike 
by rich and poor. In other words, that the schools must be inferior 
to none, to the end that they might meet the intention and purpose 
of the Public Schools of the day, which is not to keep up pauper 
institutions, only to be patronized by those who are unable to pay 
tuition, but by a united effort to have schools so good that they will 
be eagerly sought by all classes. In August, 1877, I was elected 
Superintendent of the consolidated schools of the city of Clarksville 
and the twelfth district of Montgomery county. I immediately 
proceeded to. grade the schools, starting with eight grades, intend- 
ing to add the three High School years as the schools should grow. 
We have already added the first year of the High School, making at 
present nine years. After the present session the course will con- 
sist of ten grades, divided as follows: Two primary, two interme- 
diate, three grammar and three High School years. Our schools 
are now all full, and are being attended by the children of our best 
people. The schools are upon a firm basis, with few opposers and 
a great many friends, Our accommodations in the way of houses 
is very poor, bit we now have nearly completed two magnificent 
brick buildings, which will accommodate the entire city. The 
building for its white children is a beautiful structure, three stories 
high, situated in the center of the town, upon the finest building 
site in the place. It has been very justly named for Mr. A. 
Howell, a member of the school Board, and a gentleman who has 
been indefatigable in his labors for the Public School interests, 
The other building (for the colored pupils) is two stories high, with 
a basement eight feet ceiling, well lighted and ventilated, which 
can be used as a recitation room. It will be finished in good style, 
and will be in every respect a first class building. We had employed 
last year seven white and five colored teachers, the salaries ranging 
from fifty to sixty dollars per month. The Superintendent is paid 
an annual salary of $1,000. Our enrollment in the white schools 
was 350, in the colored schools 345; total enrollment, 695. The en- 
rollments for the present year will be much larger, reaching fully 
1,000. The success of our schools so far may be partially attributed 
to the fact that the teachers have always been promptly paid. 
The schools are now moving on smoothly. Teachers, pupils and
-P-A-G-E-73
[ 754 
patrons alike appear deeply interested in the success of the system, 
and are working with a view to that end. Pupils undergo monthly 
written examinations and are only promoted from one grade to 
another upon the attainment of 70 per cent. in a written examina~ 
tion of the studies of their respective grades.

Notwithstanding the obstacles and defects incidentally alluded to 
in this report, certainly the facts and statistics adduced show that 
something has been added during the year in the direction of im- 
proving the system and making it, as it should be, the true expo- 
nent of the educational sentiment of the community. Just so long 
as no step is taken backwards, and all are concerned in devising 
better plans, we need fear nothing from excited or apparently un- 
friendly discussions of the organic school law, for it will become 
more thoroughly understood, and its provisions be the more rigidly 
observed. 
There can be no doubt that the training and discipline of the 
schools are having full effect in determining the character of pu- 
pils, or that the course of study has been successfully applied; in 
short, the full educational work of the system has been well accom- 
plished. 
It is possible that promotions have in some instances been too 
hurriedly made. The impatience of children te get through, the 
foolish vanity of parents, and unwise zeal on the part of teachers, all 
tend to render nugatory the wise provisions against such a fatal 
mistake; and, while we should carefully avoid even the appearance 
of inaugurating a “cast-iron system,” I am satisfied that ere long 
we will be forced to adopt some measure that will effectually pre- 
vent the advancement of pupils who are not unquestionably qualified 
for the work of the next grade. If ambitious teachers will make 
this their standard of aspiration, and improve the quality rather 
than increase the number of their promotions, they will build up 
really enviable reputations.

The lamented death of Col. James T. Leath, the able and most 
worthy Superintendent of City Schools, together with the fearful 
_ epidemic which desolated that unfortunate city, has deprived the 
public of a detailed report of the schools before this report was put in 
press. The loss of no man could have been more severely felt than 
that of this distinguished Superintendent. As a philanthropist, 
a good citizen, a worthy Christian gentleman, an educator and 
a scholar, he ranked among the first, and his name will ever be 
associated with whatever is pure, honorable, progressive and good. 
He won the respect of all, and the love of those who knew his lovable 
and high moral and intellectual excellencies, and died universally 
lamented.

County Superintendents’ Reports. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
J. A, CarpEn, SUPERINTENDENT, Olinda. | pi ony 
More schools have been in operation than at; any time since the, - 
organization of the present system. The quality, ies teaching has 
re ‘criti ‘examinations, 
which havé stimulated teachers to greater application, 
Public sentiment is more healthy and active,” The County: Court, 
at the April term, levied an additional tax on, ptoperty of ten cents 
on the hundred dollars worth, which adds to, our school revenue 
about fifteen hundred dollars per annum. I am glad to deport. that 
the action of the Court was unanimous. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
James L, Hutson, SUPERINTENDENT, Shelbyville. 
The schools are in more prosperous condition than ever before, 
notwithstanding the falling off in enrollment and attendance, which 
can be traced to the extreme amount of sickness. 
There seems to be a more favorable feeling to the public schools 
among the people—have made great improvement in plans, dis- 
cipline and methods of teaching. The District Directors exercise 
more care in the employment of teachers, giving the preference to 
professional teachers. And we have more teachers, without so 
many schools, which is a noticeable feature highly favorable to -bet- 
ter school work. I shall labor to cut down the number of schools 
and increase their quality. ,
-P-A-G-E-78

BENTON COUNTY. 
J. M. Castite, SuPERINTENDENT, Camden. 
There is some progress in the school interest—though some 
schools are not doing well. 
“There is also some advancement in the competency of teachers. 
With one or two exceptions, the schools are well disciplined. The 
Public School system is becoming more popular. I believe, if we 
could induce the County Court to order an election, that the people 
would vote the supplemental tax. 
  
4 \ \r )};, BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
> TP eosas: Oo. Brown, SuPERINTENDENT, Pikeville, 
After five years,experience, I am decidedly in favor of the County 
Superintendent: being ‘required to make all reports, except that of 
scholastic, population. | ie the teachers return their registers to the 
Superintendent. His duties should also be more specifically de- 
fined. He should ‘be. required also to settle annually with the 
Trustee. All orders for teachers’ pay should be issued by the 
Clerks,and: Treasurers to the Trustee, and should be approved by 
the Superintendent before being paid. 
Under our present system of collecting the school tax, it is prac- 
tically impossible. 
Our teachers are very poor, and unless some method can be set~ 
tled by which they can get their pay regularly, many of them will 
be compelled to resort to other employments! To carry out the 
system, under the law as it is, the schools must be suspended for one 
year, which would create much dissatisfaction. 
A majority of our schools have been closed, for want of funds. 
Some of them were opened in January—others in July. With but 
one or two exceptions, the teachers have given satisfaction. 
The colored schools have been much better than heretofore—ow- 
ing to a better class of teachers having been employed from Fisk 
University. These teachers have fully justified the recommenda- 
tions which secured them their positions, and their work has greatly 
engouraged their patrons.

{ 8 J 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
J. A. Gopparp, SUPERINTENDENT, Maryville. 
By earnest effort, I have succeeded in getting a report from every 
district in the county, for the first time since the organization of the 
system, and I think the reports are full and correct, with the excep- 
tion of one or two districts, save as to reports of private schools, in 
which much accuracy cannot be expected, since the teachers keep no 
registers. 
The schools are in a much better condition than I had expected 
before visiting them. The pupils were making rapid progress, and. 
the people were interested and willing to support the schools, with 
but little opposition. The sentiment in favor of public education 
has been on the increase. The prospect is more favorable now for 
overcoming the difficulties than ever before, and the schools are 
giving more general satisfaction. 
I may be allowed to suggest that the County Trustee should be 
required to disburse the money directly to teachers, on the order of 
the Directors, and that the teachers be required to return their regis- 
ters to the Superintendent at the close of the school term, all of 
which would increase the simplicity and accuracy of statistics, to be 
included in the reports. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
G. W. Forp, SupERINTENDENT, Cleveland. 
An unusual amonnt of sickness has lessened the attendance in 
some portions of the county, the schools having been suspended in 
some instances on this account. The schools, however, are in good 
condition, 
Many school houses I have found in a very dilapidated condition, 
and I have accordingly urged the School Directors to have them re- 
paired, using sufficient of the fund for that purpose, if necessary. 
In most cases, however, the people will make the repairs them- 
selves when called on to do so, and I have recommended to the Di- 
rectors to try this means first.

A County Teachers’ Institute was organized here after the Gen- 
eral Institute held by the State Superiniendent. The meetingshave 
been well attended, and the interest manifested is encouraging. 
I am glad to report that the outlook in this county is altogether. 
encouraging. 
  
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
J, E, Jounstoyx, SUPERINTENDENT, Fincastle. 
The schools are better in several particulars than they were last 
year, which is specially noticeable in the length of the terms and in 
the average attendance. Though there is not a marked progress, 
the very fact that we are progressing at all is encouraging. There 
is nothing in the working of the schools to discourage. Their ex- 
traordinary cheapness ought certainly to commend them, which has 
resulted from the inereased attendance and the decreased salaries of 
teachers. And yet our teachers have made such improvement that 
LI venture to remark that no counties, outside of those which have 
cities in them, furnish as good instruction at rates as moderate. 
Many Directors, not being prompt in making reports and others 
never returning them, make it impossible to render fullness and en- 
tire accuracy. The High Schools at Fincastle and Jacksboro con- 
tinue to exert a good influence by furnishing teachers of better 
qualifications, and fostering in the county a spirit of education and 
by the contrast furnished in the rates of tuition, which are respec- 
tively $1.75 and $0.65 per month. 
T hardly think any of our people desire a change in the main 
features of our Public School law, but it is believed thata change in 
the beginning of the scholastic year to July 1, is imperatively de- 
manded.    
          
     CANNON COUNTY. 
A. Max Forp, SupERINTENDENT, Woodbury. 
It has been impessible for me to send ina report sooner tha. 
December 30, from the fact that Mr, J. P. Hipp, former Superin. 
tendent, resigned on the first Monday in October, when the repoy
-P-A-G-E-81
P 83 j 
should have been made, and if he had received the district reports, 
_ he failed to turn them over to me, and it has been with great diffi- 
culty that I have been enabled to forward any report, to the entire 
correctness of which I cannot certify except as to the scholastic 
population. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
J. W. Brewer, SUPERINTENDENT, Buena Vista. 
Our schools are rapidly improving and are giving much better 
satisfaction than last year. While ten schools only were reported 
last year, there are one hundred and three reported this year. The 
school work has also been more satisfactory generally. I have en- 
deavored to correct the error of licensing incompetent teachers. Of 
sixty-nine applicants examined, thirty-five have first-grade certifi- 
cates. It has been difficult to obtain efficient colored teachers. 
Two Teachers’ Institutes have been held, and a third was post- 
poned on account of the excitement caused by the epidemic. Much 
interest has been taken in them, and I think they will prove suc- 
cessful. 
I have been compelled to visit the districts and make the district 
reports. One district failed to report, although I sent assistance to 
the clerk, which he declined, promising to make it himself. But 
he failed to do so. 
The schools are out of debt and havea balance ef over four thou- 
sand dollars. 
Our school houses are of an inferior quality. Many schools are 
taught in. churches or in private school-houses. Some of the 
schools will reopen again in December. 
  
CARTER COUNTY. 
A.J. F. HypER, SUPERINTENDENT, Cave Spring. 
Onur schools are better than in any former year, although there 
were fewer schools opened than in some former years. The people 
are so interested in some localities that it amounts to enthusiasm. 
The Teachers’ Institute is doing a very effective work for these who
-P-A-G-E-82
  [ 84 ] 
attend. I visited all the schools in the county, some of them fre- 
quently, and held various edueational mass-meetings and lectured 
from time to time, with goed results. School-houses are in better 
condition than ever before. The prospect in this eounty was never 
better. 
  
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
T. J. Apxisson, SUPERINTENDENT, Kingston Springs. 
The system is growing in popular favor more than at any time 
since the war. But the terms are only three and a half months in 
duration. Some districts consolidated with private schools, and 
thus lengthened their terms to five anda half months. The schools 
are mostly taught in churches. Twelve districts had schools—all 
but one. . 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
D. F. Suarp, SoPERINTENDENT, Tazewell. 
Our public schools were opened in every part of the county. The 
schools were well managed, but the terms were too short. Our 
schools will never flourish until there isa sufficient tund to prolong 
the sessions. 
  
CLAY COUNTY. 
Gro. W. SreeHEns, SUPERINTENDENT, Celina. 
The schools are of a better character than heretofore. District 
Directors have manifested zeal and interest by visiting the schools, 
A Teachers’ Institute was held at Celina during the year, at 
which there was a good attendance of teachers and the citizens of 
the surrounding country. The school districts need readjusting. 
  
COCKE COUNTY. 
A. A. Vinson, Jn.,SuPERINTENDENT, Newport. 
Some good school-houses have been erected, and the grade of

teachers has generally improved. The School Directors are also 
becoming more attentive to their duties than ever before. In my 
visits to the schools I was generally accompanied by one of these 
officers. I have spent much time in the schools this year, and have 
taken pains to make appropriate suggestions to the teachers as to 
methods of teaching. 
The scholastic year should be changed so as to end with the cal- 
endar year. ‘The present scholastic year is the cause of inaccuracy 
in the district reports. 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
T. J. Witson, SUPERINTENDENT, Manchester. 
The County Court, at its January term, 1878, appointed Com- 
missioners to redistrict the county,as to school districts, who pro- 
ceeded to create forty-five. At the April term, an order was made 
for the election of Directors of these new districts. The election 
was held in about one-third of these districts on May 18th. I 
made appointments of Directors in most of the districts where no 
elections were held. In other districts, at the August elections, 
Directors were elected, which was claimed to be the day appointed 
by Jaw. After this I made appointments for the districts unpro- 
vided for. A conflict thereby arose between old and new Directors, 
and many of those elected, appointed or holding over, resigned. 
Others failed to organize or serve. But few of the new Treasurers 
gave bond, while some refused to continue,and others held. on to 
books and funds, when their successors had qualified. A. conflict 
was thus produced, which continued all summer and fall, I was 
engaged all this time in trying to settle and reconcile the differ- 
ences, but failed to harmonize. I had therefore to visit every dis- 
trict and get the data for reports, when possible. The schools are 
all taught in churches except a few erected the present year. The 
scholastic enumeration is correct, but other statistics are imperfect, 
in consequence of the unfortunate disorganization hereinbefore de- 
scribed,
-P-A-G-E-84
[ 86 ] 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
R. S. THomeson, SUPERINTENDENT, Alamo. 
Greater interest has been manifested than ever before. We have 
had forty-five public schools and about thirty private schools. I 
have, without exception, visited them as often as possible. I feel 
confident we shall have an additional tax next year. Our ablest 
private school teachers are now boldly advocating an efficient public 
school system. I have a Teachers’ Institute, organized on a perma- 
nent basis. Three meetings have been held this year, each of two 
days, with marked interest and improvement. I would suggest a 
change in the time of beginning and ending the scholastic year. 
As it is now, it cuts our short sessions in twain and renders reports 
uncertain. January first is suggested as the beginning of the 
scholastic year. I think Directors would keep their accounts more 
accurately. I would also suggest an improvement in the grade of 
teachers. Permit no one to teach who cannot obtain five or more 
on every branch. Better teachers would thereby be segured, and 
many of the most competent teachers will not compete with the 
low grade and low priced teachers. Our School Directors are be- 
coming more active in their duties, though some still give trouble 
in their reports. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
Wa. A. Hamny, SuPERINTENDENT, Crossville. 
Our schools are in good condition. Most of the districts wil} 
have four to five months school. Our greatest obstacle is the 
failure of the Court to levy an additional tax, though I believe 
another year’s work will convince them of its necessity. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
R.W. Wrax.ey, SuPERINTENDENT, Washwille. 
‘The statistics show a very good status for the Publie Schools 
this county. I believe public sentiment is favorable to, and satisioy
-P-A-G-E-85
[ 87 ] 
with, the work of our schools. In the city of Nashville and town 
of Edgefield the schools are deservedly popular, are well attended, 
and are accomplishing a good work. In the country districts, 
though many difficulties arise which are not met with in cities ; 
our attendance has been good and the seeds of knowledge have been 
sown liberally, which, I am well convinced will, in after days, 
bring forth an hundred fold. I have no marked improvement to 
note in school houses, appliances, etc., the straightened condition of 
the time forcing directors to look solely to the success of the schools, 
I think, from the text of section 22 of the school law, it was the in- 
tention to legislate further in the matter of school districts. In 
this county, the school districts conform to civil districts, and in 
some instances corners of districts are isolated. I would sug- 
gest the conferring upou the County Courts the power to change 
school districts, in order to subserve the interests of the in- 
habitants, and thus promote the efficiency of the schools. I desire 
emphatically to urge a change in the law which makes the district 
clerk the treasurer of district moneys, and suggest this plan as likely 
to meet the case. Let school moneys be paid out by the County 
Trustee upon the order of District Directors, to be approved by the 
County Superintendent. This change will have these advantages : 
First, economy, by lessening amounts paid out to clerks and treas- 
urers; second, a saving of funds likely to be misapplied, through 
mismanagement; third, a facility in obtaining district reports ; 
fourth, a knowledge on the part of the County Superintendent of 
the status of the districts, their indebtedness, etc., thus furnishing 
him with the power to confine each year within its own channel, 
and preventing the flooding of the incoming year with the indebt- 
edness of the old. 
I congratulate you on the success which has marked your incum- 
beney of the office of State Superintendent, and hope that the future 
may bring forth still better things for the youth of the State. 
  
DECATUR COUNTY. 
Dr, W. H. H. McMriian, SupErtnrEenvEnt, Decaturville. 
The great wants of the Public School system in this county are a | 
sufficient fund to sustain the schools at least five months; good
-P-A-G-E-86
[ 88 } 
houses properly furnished ; qualified and energetic teachers and 
regularity in attendance. I regret that most of the teachers have 
failed to keep and exhibit accurate registers, thereby greatly hin- 
dering the report. Some of the directors are taking an active in- 
terest in the Public Schools and, I think, the system is gradually 
growing in interest with the people. Time is necessary to establish 
an efficient system of public instruction. Most of the schools are 
taught in the churches. Many of these houses have been built by 
the people for church and schocl purposes. But few are owned by 
the Public School authorities. . 
DeKALB COUNTY. 
J. T. Trapp, SUPERINTENDENT, Smithville, 
Commencing the next scholastic year with a balance on hand of 
$617.22, as shown by an account book, kept in my office, the 
financial condition of our schools is good, and the interest in the 
schools is better. We have had to encounter a multiplicity of dis- 
eases among the children, in the county, during the year. But as 
it more clearly appears that the Public Schools are the only means 
by which the masses of the people can be educated and the evils 
which afflict society diminished, the enemies of popular education 
are gradually giving way and falling into the great work. ‘The rich, 
the poor and the orphan are thus more cheaply enlightened, than in 
any other way known to civilization. 
DICKSON COUNTY.

DYER COUNTY. 
A. J. Hany, SUPERINTENDENT, Newbern. 
I have visited nearly every clerk and treasurer in the county and 
have examined and corrected their work and made most of their re- 
ports. Better work has been done in the school-room this year, in 
this county, than ever before. The Institute is contributing largely 
to the efficiency of teachers. We make ours as much on the normal 
plan as possible, that is we teach, or illustrate by teaching, the vari- 
ous methods. The increase of the school tax on property, from one 
mill to two mills, would indicate that the cause is gaining ground 
with us. A privilege tax of thirty-seven and fifty cents on saloon 
keepers and ten cents on the hundred dollars worth of merchants’ 
stock, in no case less than five dollars, is also levied, and altogether 
will enable us to carry on the schools from six to eight months. 
There is, however, quite a strong opposition to the increased tax. A 
few are opposed to the system. A larger number, who are not 
avowed opponents, are not willing to be taxed. We have alsoa 
sharp opposition to the offices of State and County Superintendents. 
These were ahobby with some candidates, in the recent canvass. 
FAYETTE COUNTY. 
Wma. Manis, SUPERINTENDENT, Somerville, 
We divide our scholastic year into two termis—the first com- 
mences in January and continues through March. The second com- 
mences in July and continues until the fund is exhausted. This is 
done to give allthe children an opportunity to attend school, as many 
of them are needed in the farms at some time. I think it the best 
plan we can adopt under the circumstances. I have, in some in- 
stances, induced the patrons to subscribe the money to continue 
' their schools ten months, which succeeds well; but few districts 
adopt it. 
We have held two teachers’ institutes during the year, in June 
and July. Another was appointed to be held in August, but the 
epidemic of yellow fever prevented its meeting. I think they will 
result in much good to the teachers. .

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
E. G. Surry, SUPERINTENDENT, Travisville. 
No interest is taken in education. Better teachers have been em- 
ployed and the schools have consequently improved. But one man 
alone cannot do much. If I could spare the time from my own 
business I could work up an interest in the county. They will pay 
nothing to the Superintendent to labor for them, and I cannot lose 
the time. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
W. P. Cuerry, SUPERINTENDENT, Awalt. 
There seems to be a general revival on the subject of education 
since you were on your tour, holding institutes. In the towns and 
villages, I find the greatest educational interest. Their academies 
are filled with the youth of the country who are making grest prog- 
ress in learning. We are proud of these schools and of their able 
and efficient faculties. The rural districts, in many localities, are 
blessed with good teachers and tolerably good houses. Some have 
black-boards and charts, but they lack in uniformity of text books, 
In other localities the reverse is the case, through the indifference 
of parents, who will not send their children to the schools, or pro- 
cure books for them. The 17th District had no school this year, 
Their indebtedness is reported at $108, but they have a small bal- 
ance of $41. Our county is somewhat in debt. My policy has been 
to liquidate the indebtedness and keep a balance on hand. We 
have some trouble in some districts, as to schools and school prop- 
erty. On all occasions I endeavor to harmonize these differences, 
but sometimes fail. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
A. 8, Currey, SuPERINTENDENT, Trenton. 
After a lapse of two or three years, during which the Public 
Schools had almost ceased to exist, for the want of that support and
-P-A-G-E-89
[ 9% J 
encouragement so necessary to their existence, they have again 
been revived, and for the past year have emerged froma state of 
gloom into one of greater prosperity than ever. 
After my election as County Superintendent, steps were immedi- 
ately taken to induce the County Court, again to levy a tax for the 
support of the schools which, however, the magistrates were un~ 
willing to do unless authorized by a popular vote, and accordingly 
on the 26th of May, the question was again submitted to a vote of 
the people, and by an overwhelming majority decided in favor of 
the proposition. Owing to the mode prescribed by law for the col- 
lection of the tax, a year must necessarily elapse before a sufficient 
sum accumulates to commence operations. Luring my term of office, 
nothing more was, or could be expected, than simply to revive the 
schools and make them as efficient as possible under the circum- 
stances. While it is claimed they will compare favorably with any 
in the State, yet, there is much to do to bring them up to that 
standard of excellence, which is due to the intelligence and public 
spirit and educational enterprise of the people. Unfortunately, the 
school law doesnot prescribe all the minutis for a perfect system of 
schools, but the details are left to the County Superintendent and 
local boards of education, or directors in each district. No system, 
and especially one of such vast importance thus left to chance, can 
be successfully projected within such a brief period, without some 
defect or flaw, being discoverable in its execution. To correct these 
errors and bring about a thorough efficiency in every particular, will 
require the unremitting toil, vigilauce, and experience of those en- 
trusted with its management. No system of schools can be con- 
sidered as thoroughly organized, therefore, until some uniformity is 
adopted in the method of instruction and wholesome regulations 
prescribed for their government. The school term during the year 
ending August 30, consisted of a winter and summer term of three 
or four months each, in a majority of the districts. Some four or 
five districts, however, which had previously been encumbered with 
debt, delayed operations until July and August, when a sufficient 
fund had ‘accumulated to authorize them to commence. I am 
pleased to report that there was not a single district in the county 
in debt on the ist day of September, but that each had a balance in 
the hands of the Treasurer or County Trustee. It is true that a 
small indebtedness is reported against some few districts, but this is

natural at the close of each month, even with cash on hand to 
meet it. 
The Public Schools were generally very well attended as the en- 
rollment and daily attendance show, under the many difficulties 
which surround them. In many localities dyphtheria, scarlet fever, 
whooping cough, and many other diseases were unusually prevalent 
during the winter months and the malarial fevers in the summer, 
together with the fears of the dreaded scourge (yellow fever), all 
combined to reduce the number of pupils in attendance, and it is 
surprising, that under so many discouragements militating against 
the schools, the average daily attendance should be so well main- 
tained. This is due to the vigilance of the directors who were 
prompt in suspending the schools when reduced to the minimum 
number, and is also an evidence of the general satisfaction which 
the Public Schools gave. 
The experiment of cheapening the labor of those upon whom the 
vitality and efficiency of the schools depend, while it has been at- 
tended with success so far is certainly a dangerous one in its ten- 
dency. It will eventually, if continued, drive out the better class 
of teachers and supply their places with others less competent, be- 
cause they are cheaper; it will produce a continual change of 
teachers, from a higher to a lower grade, which is always hurtful, 
even when those of the same grade of qualification are secured ; it 
will retard the progress and advancement of pupils, because it will 
require a waste of time for teachers and pupils to become mutually 
acquainted ; and it will increase the number of poor schools, which 
are always poorly attended. Good teachers who are employed for 
their superior qualifications, at a reasonable compensation, will al- 
ways inspire the public with confidence and awaken an interest in 
behalf of the school. Such schools are generally well attended and 
in the benefits, derived from better instruction, more than compen- 
sate for the extra allowance. 
The teachers, however, employed in the Public Schools the past 
year, were of a better grade than usual. They were generally very 
well versed in the theory and practice of teaching, and exhibited a 
commendable zeal in the discharge of their duties. The following 
grading will exhibit the status of the 136 teachers licensed :

During the past scholastic year I have visited 68 schools, exam- 
ined the work of the teachers, and whenever necessary suggested a 
change in the mode of teaching and of enforcing good discipline. 
There were only three school difficulties of a serious character, re- 
ferred to me for adjudication, all of which, I am happy to state, 
were amicably settled and the parties cheerfully complied with the 
decisions made. In addition to school visitations, as a means of im- 
proving and elevating the character of the schools, by introducing 
the best methods, etc., I have held seven teachers’ institutes in the 
county. These meetings accomplished much good, by awakening a 
lively interest in the community and infusing new life and vigor into 
the schools. The benefits derived from them were noticeable in the 
school room upon my subsequent visitations, Until normal in- 
struction is made accessible and convenient for those seeking the 
teachers’ profession, our teachers’ institutes, both State and county, 
are indispensable. They should be liberally encouraged and some 
provision made by law for holding them. 
There were in the county two graded schools, of an elevated char- 
acter, in which the higher branches were also taught, one at ‘Tren- 
ton and the other at Humboldt, each with an enrollment of 250 to 
300 pupils, under the charge of six teaehers in different rooms or 
apartments. These schools are an ornament to any community and 
have received the commendations of those who are capable of judg- 
ing of excellence. The Peabody High School at Trenton, has now 
been in operation for four years and cannot longer be considered an 
experiment. ‘The Collegiate Institute at Humboldt was not opened 
asa graded high school, until November, 1877. Its success has been 
unparalleled. They are both free Public Schools, supported by the 
State and county school fund, supplemented by a municipal tax and 
maintained for ten months in the year. Steps were also taken to 
organize another graded high school at Milan, which was to have 
commenced operations on September 1, 1878, but was delayed by 
the yellow fever. It has since commenced operation, with very en- — 
couraging prospects, and will eventually take rank with the schools 
at Trenton and Humboldt. I see no reason why, under the present 
school law, good graded schools cannot be established upon the same 
plan in every town in the county and State.

GILES COUNTY. 
R. P. Yancey, SUPERINTENDENT, Pulaski. 
The enrollment, as compared to last year, is greater by 233, but 
the average attendance is not so great this year, which is accounted 
for by the prevalence of whooping-cough, sore eyes, ete. My salary 
is not appropriated out of the school fund. 
There is one drawback which I have not been able to remove, 
which is, that in some districts there are too many schools. The 
Directors are too much disposed to yield to the claims of those who 
wish the school right at their doors. The school law should pro- 
vide for laying off the county into suitable school districts. The 
private school report is very defective. Most of the teachers do not 
keep registers and others remove before a statement can be had. 
There is not the opposition to the Public School Jaw that heretofore 
existed. I would suggest that there would be better directors if 
they were appointed. ‘here is a disposition to elect “ low-price” 
men, who put so low an estimate on education that, in this way, 
they foist very incompetent teachers upon the people, eventually, in 
every school district in which our sons and daughters can receive a 
liberal education without being “boarded out.” The subject has 
been respectfully urged by me upon the attention of our citizens 
and meets with their cordial approbation.

Public sentiment has advanced for a number of years, but during 
the last year it has taken a step forward beyond expectation. Form-~ 
erly nearly one-half of the schools were filled with teachers holding 
certificates, while now we have a corps of competent teachers, a 
majority of whom are alive to the great work they have in hand, 
public sentiment demanding advanced attainments. If Directors 
would take hold with a firmer grasp, and we had sufficient funds 
and some little change in the school Jaw, a system would be per- 
fected that would be successful in its operations.

There is a strong sentiment is favor of the Public School system

abused, has done a vast amount of good in this county. Twelve 
schools are in successful operation. I have visited ten. The en- 
roliment is larger than heretofore, with a better average attendance. 
I have been compelled to travel over half the county in order to 
get the facts for my report, on account of the inattention of Direc- 
tors to their duties. My small salary—only $50—would not allow 
me to give that time and attention which they should receive. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
H. M. SHerwoop, SuPeRINTENDENT, Russellville. 
Free schools have come to be regarded as a permanency in this 
county. Even the opponents of the schools only ask that the tax 
should not be increased during the present financial troubles. I 
have not, therefore, deemed it prudent to ask for an increase of the 
tax. In the matter of institutes we are going forward. The wide- 
awake teachers are much more punctual in attendance than those - 
who are less able to take care of themselves. There should be 
‘some way to compel the attendance of teachers. The average at- 
tendance was cut short by whooping-cough. I believe there was 
not a school in the county that escaped.

We have had some trouble on account of the uncertainty of the

is demanded here; but no legislation is preferable to too much, and 
it is questionable whether any amendments to the law should be 
asked for. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
H. F. Rogers, SuPERINTENDENT, Chattanooga. 
Our schools have been very prosperous during the past year with 
few exceptions. The people seem determined to make them suc- 
cessful. Notwithstanding the disposition on the part of some of 
the Directors to employ poor teachers because they are cheaper, 
which I have endeavored to correct, we have many excellent schools 
taught by the best teachers. Some discrepancy exists in the Clerk’s 
and Treasurer’s accounts, which I ascribe partly to the neglect of 
the Trustee to render his statement, as the law directs, and partly 
to his neglect to keep the school funds of each year separate,

interest has been manifested than ever before in some localities in 
the county. There is greater diversity, in different localities, as toe 
discipline of schools, efficiency of Directors and qualification of 
teachers. There is no uniformity in text-books. The registers, 
however, are generally very well kept. Public sentiment is gener- 
ally favorable, though the lack of a sufficient fund is a great ob-

more intelligent classes, by requiring a higher standard of qualifica~ 
tion for teachers. We are sadly in need of comfortable school- 
houses. I have advised the Directors to provide them out of the

great drawback is the employment of third-grade teachers at the 
same scale of prices as first-grade teachers are paid.

R. P. Jones, SUPERINTENDENT, New Canton. 
Our schools are much better than last year. They have increased 
in number, and many are excellent schools. The teachers feel the 
importance of their work and are laboring to advance the cause of 
education. The people, also, are manifesting more interest than 
heretofore, and are willing to contribute to the promotion of their 
best interests. The indebtedness in most of the districts has been 
cancelled, and in most of the districts the school-terms are four 
months, in some five months. I have visited all the districts and 
most of the schools, and find them well attended, and the people 
well pleased with the progress made. The consolidated schools in | 
the villages are a success. Principals of private schools have rend- 
ered able assistance for the advancement of Public Schools. I 
think, in‘another year, we shall have a Normal School. Several 
new school-houses have been erected during the year, and several 
others have been repaired. I feel justified in saying that the out- 
look for the future is very auspicious.

The Public Schools are gaining rapidly in this county, having

to prolong the schools beyond 3} months, with about four schools 
to each district. An election was held to ascertain the sense of the 
people as to a supplemental tax of 15 cents, and the tax was voted 
down by eighty-five majority, which was a great gain in popular 
sentiment, at a former election the vote being eight hundred major- 
ity against the tax. The management of the Public Schools is ap- 
proved by the people. We are out of debt, and the. proceeds of the 
taxes of 1878 will be over to commence the work of 1879.

Teachers’ Institute was very useful to the cause. The people of

cause of Public Schools. 
Only seventeen districts had schools, the others {carried their 
fand over to enable them to prolong the sessions. Two Teachers’

With the return of prosperity, I am satisfied, that Hickman County 
will provide facilities for education equal to any farming community

as to have the Trustee retain the fund in his hands, to be drawn

an increased tax for school purposes. - Some insist on an increased

Others would not send if ‘the schools were at their doors. The 
Directors take no interest in the schools, in many instances never 
visiting the schools, and many of them ‘not seeming to understand 
that it is their duty to encourage the teachers and pupils. Nearly 
all of our best teachers have left the county, as Directors for the most 
part think that teachers ought to be paid in accordance with the

grade.

In Jan. 1877, the county was destitute of respectable school 
houses and the districts owed a debt of $2,457.00. The County 
Court Clerk having left the one mill tax off the tax books for 1875 
and 1876, the districts were receiving annually only about $1,750.00 
and it was only when convinced that legal proceedings would be 
commenced, that supplemental tax books were made out for these 
taxes. 
The building and repairing done since Jan. 1877, together with 
that being made, to be completed by Feb. next, is worth more than 
$6000, above the amount of public money used in the work. 
The school fund raised by county levy through my solicitation 
will yield a net fund of $2,500.00 not counting the State levy that 
was recovered. 
The schools taught the year before I came into office cost an 
average of $1.33 per pupil per month, though, through mistake, it 
is stated in your last report at .65. Since J came into office the 
average cost per pupil per month, on actual attendance is .69 which 
is a saving of .64 per pupil per month. This saving on 1482 
pupils (my average daily attendance) for three and one-half months 
amounts to a saving of $3,319.68. The items aggregate $11,819.68 
The old debt $2457 and the cost of the 20 schools taught last fall, 
an average length of 3$ months, have been paid off. This fall I 
have had 43 schools taught, (a few of which are still in session,) 
which will average 34 months each, and these will all be paid for 
without using, to considerable extent, the tax of 1878. By judicious 
management, next fall, a five months school may be had at every 
site in the county and promptly paid for at its close. 
The business of the office, since election, has absorbed my entire 
time. Having almost every conceivable “species of opposition to 
battle against, the success of the schools has not been so great as it 
otherwise could have been. At times the opposition was so great 
that it {seemed the whole cause must sink forever. During the 
political canvass, last August, persons sought to ride into county 
offices hy enraging illiterate voters against the dearest interests of 
their children, Canvassing the county and taking these to task, I 
succeeded in arresting the tide of opposition. The public pulse-is 
now beginning to beat a little stronger for public schools, and by 
proper care and judicious management, they may yet be made to 
triumph.

' Our schools opened and continued about two months when the 
measels appeared in'an epidemic form, ‘which reduced the atten- 
+ dance largely allover the county. The great drawback with us is 
the lack of funds to pay competent teachers. This is clearly dem- 
enstrated in localities where the schools have been consolidated and 
experienced teachers employed. Our County Court has however 
made a step forward, by levying an additional tax of 25 cents on 
polls, and one mill on property for school purposes.

Dr. Sam, ANDERSON, SUPERINTENDENT, Dandridge. 
Our free schools show a yearly increase in thorough work done 
by school men generally. Hard times havs cut our enrollment a lit- 
tle short, without any diminution of average attendance. This has 
not thrown any damper upon the free school ardor in old Jeftersan 
yet. The county has the best set of Directors, for good work, that 
it ever had. The apparent discrepency between the number of 
teachers employed and the number of schools jtaught arises from 
ene teacher, in some cases teaching two or more school during the 
year. The offices of Superintendents, State and County, have 
gradually, grown in favor in all true free school circles, yet there is a 
strong host who have to heap curses upon these offices and upon all 
free school systems. Yet these offices are far more popular than 
they were when I came into office. An approving legislation for 
four years more and sleepless work will crush out all opposition.

The number of schools in the county the past year was 29, inola- 
ding our graded school at Taylorsville. The people are strongly in 
favor of public schools, as shown by the large vote polled in their 
favor both in the present year and in 1876, when the question was 
referred to a vote of the people by the County Court. A tax of 
twenty-five cents on the hundred dollars was levied by the County 
Conrt, which is five cents more than we have ever had in this county, 
and is fully adequate to carry on five months schools in all the die- 
tricts. The supply of teachers is greater than the demand. ~ Those 
employed are generally both capable and energetic. We have a few 
good school-houses, but the majority are inferior, though comforta-” 
ble. Uniformity of text books is more nearly accomplished than 
in any previous year. There is however, great room for improve- 
ment in this section. The Directors and parents throughout the 
county show considerable interest by visiting the schools frequently. 
The general interest in public school and the prosperity of the sye- 
tem has steadily increased and the prospect is fair for much im- 
provement to be made in the future. The people are waking up 
to the advantages of education and are learning to co-operate har- 
moniously and industriously to forward the system. The want of 
regular attendance is the principal drawback to the success of the 
schools.

In the latter part of the year 1877, I brought before an Institute 
of. teachers the matter of a Normal School for teachers and it was 
referred to a committee, whose report requested the county Superin- 
tendent to call to his aid some of the most active school Directors 
to aid in suggesting a plan to that end, and to insure the holding of 
a Normal School for the teachers of the county during the vacation 
of the year 1878. Wherefore I called a meeting of the following
-P-A-G-E-102
[: 104] 
gentlemen at my office, viz; J. W. Boyd, Rev. J. M. Brown, A.G. 
French, J. J. Thompson and W. D. Brown. This meeting was 
held in January, 1878. The conclusion arrived at was that we 
should call on the Directors of each district for an allowance of 
14 cent per caput of the scholastic population of their several dis- 
tricts. I prepared a circular accordingly, and visited as many as 
Tecould. When I secured a pledge for a sufficient amount to insure 
the holding of the Institute, or School, I proceeded to procure com- 
petent instructors, and was fortunate in engaging the services of 
Superintendent, H. Presnell of Jonesboro, and Principal W. H. 
Perkins of Powell’s Station High school. The Normal school was 
highly successful, enrolling 112 teachers, and having an average 
daily attendance of 92, The result upon the public schools is ap- 
parent to the most casual observer. The attendance in the schools 
is larger and much more regular. The interest manifested by pupils 
and patrons is such as was never known before, and the Normal 
School, as well as the regular county Institutes, are felt to be 
necessary. ‘ 
It is deemed necessary by the friends of education that more power 
should be placed in the hands of the Superintendent, and that he 
should be elected for a longer term, also that he should be subject 
to displacement on reasonable grounds of complaint, such as im- 
moral conduct etc., and also that his salary should be commensurate 
with the amount and character of his duties, and not. left to the 
mere caprice of County Court politicians. :

the reason that the work of the school year is now divided, which 
renders it almost impossible to make full reports. Private school 
reports are incomplete on account of change of teachers. 
Institutes have been attended with considerable interest thus far. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
Joun 8. Surru, SUPERINTENDENT, Lenoirs. 
Our public schools have been taught by a higher grade of teachers. 
There is a want of interest on the part of patrons. Irregular at- 
tendance is the great drawback. Directors are careless in making 
their reports, On account of the scholastic year ending at the time 
it does, the report includes necessarily different years. Ihave as- 
sisted in making the reports of clerks, in several instances, but for 
the reason stated, find it impossible to make a full statement. Iam 
satisfied with all the financial reports but one, but have not been 
able to get a full statement from the clerk of that district. Iam 
satisfied that district reports could be more correctly made if the 
time were changed for beginning of the scholastic year, to July 1st.

I regret to have to report that the school tax was voted against 
by the majority of the votes polled. Iam glad to say, however, 
that I am satisfied it was not the voice of the great majority of the 
voters of the county. There was a very small vote given at the 
election. ‘The majority were rot informed as to the the day of the 
election. With the small salary allowed me, I could not devote the ~ 
time and incur the expense necessary to the success of the cause. 
Reasonable compensation to the laborer is essential to the successful 
prosecution of all public as well as individual enterprize. In my 
opinion, public sentiment is still growing in favor of public free 
schools, and not retrograding; as might be inferred from the tax 
having been voted down;there has really been greater interest 
amanifested this year than ever before. If the question of the school 
tax had been submitted at the August election, in my opinion, the 
tax would have been voted for by a very large majority. I have 
been so advised by the friends of education from the districts of the 
county. The schools of the year just ended are of a better grade 
than those of the previous year. 
MADISON COUNTY, 
M. D. Meriweruer, SUPERINTENDENT, Jackson. 
With my best endeavors, I have not been able to make my report 
satisfactory to myself. I am pleased, however, to note that the 
Directors and our county officers are disposed to do all that is re- 
quired of them and that they and the masses are taking a deeper 
interest in the cause of popular edueation than at any time hereto- 
fore. The recent feverish state of excitement that has pervaded our 
entire community, in regard to yellow fever, has caused almost every 
school, that was in operation to close and has prevented others from 
opening. I have therefore not had an opportunity of visiting the 
schools of the county, but will do so, as soon as they resume. Iam 
pleased to report a growing interest in the schools. A better class

The attendance of the schools for the past four months has been 
poor, owing to the straitened circwmstances of the people. But for 
this cause I would favor a well regulated, definite compulsory law. 
But the people are too poor to buy books or to send their children 
to school more than they do, and if there are not some measures of 
relief speedily adopted I fear that our Public Schools with other 
good things—even the Missionary operations—without Divine in- 
terposition, will be retarded if not stopped entirely. 
Oh, God! for Christ’s sake forbid it, I would humbly pray thee, 
in His name! Amen. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
W. H. Sanpers, SUPERINTENDENT, Purdy. 
The cause of education and the present system of Public Schools 
are gaining the confidence of the people, as is seen in the fact that 
the County Court, at April term raised the school tax on property 
from one mill to two mills, and only one vote was lacking of rais- 
ing the poll tax from fifty cents to one dollar. The Institutes are 
accomplishing a great work with us. Wherever they have been 
held the people have been aroused to the importance of having 
better teachers. The Normal School of this county is sending out 
some very good teachers. We expect to be able to meet the de- 
mand, and by it send some students to the State Normal College 
for higher instruction. The greatest difficulty that we encounter is 
that the county is sub-divided into too many school districts, with 
too many officers. It is almost impossible to get reports, and get 
them in time.

It is impossible for me even to approximate the receipts and dis- 
bursements, as I have no reports from the clerks and treasurers. 
I have advised the directors only to carry on their schools as long 
as their money authorized, and our schools are out of debt. 
Our County Court refuses to levy a tax of any kind or amount to 
assist in Public Schools. We are, therefore, pensioners on the 
State. Taking everything into consideration, the Public School 
system is doing well. 
  
MONROE COUNTY.

We still lack uniformity of text-books. It is believed that a 
series provided by law would be beneficial. Our schools have been 
better than ever before. They are gradually growing into general 
favor. Teachers are preparing for the work. We are still build- 
ing houses and providing school furniture. The teachers’ Institute 
is in successful operation. 
The people favor compulsory education on a reasonable basis, 
One director in each district is thought sufficient. The Trustee 
should disburse the money directly to the teacher. If this system 
were adopted the financial accounts would be more accurately kept, 
and a large amount would be saved. Some favor a County Board 
of Education to transact all business of schools.

nearly double the number of schools in progress. This last cause 
is encouraging, as it shows the progress of sentiment favorable to 
the system among the people. The people everywhere in the 
county seem to be greatly encouraged with regard to the ‘permanent 
success of our public school system. The reports show the amount 
paid per pupil per month has generally been about $1.00, which is 
cheaper, by about one-half, than private schools. If we have at- 
tained such a measure of success, under the great difficulties we 
have encountered, what may we not hope to accomplish in the 
future ?

that our County Court will levy a sufficiént tax for four months’

I make no reports of private schools, as the Director’s reports are 
so meagre as hardly to do the county justice. There were good 
schools taught in the spring in nearly every district in the county,

ance. Could every school be made a district proper, and have its 
own Directors, the money could then be properly distributed, 
Were every school a district, many districts would add to the pub- 
‘lie money by private subscription, and thus have a flve months’ 
school. There are some cases of trouble in teachers getting their 
dues. A school is taught on the line of two districts. The teacher 
is employed in one district and the Directors of the adjoining dis- 
trict refuse to pay where more than one-half of its children are 
taught in the school. Sometimes the teachers sue for the money 
and how it will be settled is to be determined. 
At present, there are twenty-eight schools in session. The most 
of them will. probably not continue longer than three months, al- 
though some will continue five months, with the help of patrons, to 
pay teachers. : :

It affords me very great pleasure to be able to state that we have 
had another most prosperous year in all respects. The enrollment 
has been good, the attendance excellent and the grade of teacherg 
decidedly improved. There is but one slight opposition in Obion 
county, and this, generally, from a class of men prompted by selfish 
and sinister motives. In order to make the system still more uni- 
form and to secure reports absolutely reliable, I may be pardoned 
for again suggesting a County Board of Education, to be composed 
of one representative from each civil district in the county, ap- 
pointed by the County Superintnedent. This in lieu of the bur- 
densome, as well as expensive system, of three Directors for each 
scholastic district, is an amendment, in my humble judgment, abso- 
lutely indispensable to secure entirely satisfactory results. The 
Superintendent should also have some definite authority to enforce 
the attendance of teachers upon the County Institutes. The West 
Tennessee Division Institute, that convened in Union City, on the 
10th, 11th, 12th of July, was (to quote the language of Dr. Wm.

realized throughout our entire Division of West Tennessee. In 
this connection, permit me, through you, to express our gratitude 
and thanks for the liberality of Dr. Barnas Sears and the Peabody 
Trnstees, for the timely aid bestowed to one of our most worthy 
schools, as well as to the Division Institute, the success of which 
was, in a very great measure, attributed to the same cause. To you, 
personally, and the distinguished educators, who so kindly assisted 
us, we return sincere thanks, in the earnest hope that you may be 
spared and retained in your present position until you shall have 
accomplished our most sanguine desires for the highest possible 
achievements for the glorious cause of Public Schools in Tennessee ;

Our schools are giving greater satisfaction than they have ever 
done at any time before. Although we have not sufficient means to 
~ garry on our schools very long, yet there is a decided increase in 
interest among the people. We are now nearly out of debt, and 
generally pay off our teachers promptly. Many of the schools com~ 
menced about the first of August, but we failed to start them all at 
the same time, having some difficulty in getting competent teachers, 
About forty-five per cent. of our teachers are deficient, which is at- 
tributable to the low price paid them. In visiting the schools I 
found much improvement in school-houses, among them some com- 
pleted since last year. Ihave labored earnestly, to the best of my 
ability, to advance the cause, raise the standard and increase - the 
educational interest of the county, regardless of pecuniary benefit, 
and looking to appreciation at least from the educated men and 
women of the rising generation, I have some reason to complain 
of Directors for inattention to dufies. We have a teachers’ Insti- 
tute which we regard as the right arm of the system. Our County 
Court levied a tax of 10ets, at April term. There is a considerable 
increase in attendance. The school seats are generally rude.

here are schools in every district which are well attended for 
six or eight weeks. Directors give some attention to them, bit 
ought to give more. Iam glad to state that there are some noble 
exceptions. Schools are in good condition considering all the cir- 
cumstances. Only one school was suspended for being below the 
minimum. Our school-houses are unfit for winter. The teachers 
generally this year are not as good as those last year, some of the 
best teachers having been driven out by the low prices. Most of 
our teachers are young men, and with experience will make good 
teachers. Notwithstanding difficulties, the present outlook is flat- 
tering. When we note the abundance of schools and: the grade of 
teachers in the State at large, as compared to former years, we have 
reason to be encouraged in our arduous labors. The friends of 
education are buoyed up by your untiring energy and continued 
labors. The only wonder is that the schools have stood the crisis, 
while everything else has gone down more or less. Public School 
drafts are good paper. The motto is “Onward.” Give the system 
time and Tennessee will step to the front rank. I have worked 
more for Public Schools this year than ever before, and without any 
increase of salary. My salary is $50, paid out of the county 
treasury, and not from the school fund. .

my task is quite a tedious one. Onur enrollment and attendance 
and other figures to be taken from the teachers’ registers are not

too long delayed last year. Our school system is getting to be 
better understood and better patronized. There have been more 
schools than ever before. My report of licensed teachers does not

on the condition that they get certificates. I believe that the 
present report will compare favorably with any future report, unless 
we have a larger fund hereafier, It has heretofore been impossible 
to get the levy of a county tax. I do not believe that the last 
election on this question was a fair one. It did not express the 
sentiment of the county. It was held with other elections on the 
first Thursday in August, and only in a few districts. The 
Coroner’s advertisement said nothing about it, and when the

of minor importance. Hence they entirely overlooked this great

You will observe that there is a small decrease in scholastic

“casioned by errors in the enumeration of last year, These errors 
have been corrected by the clerks. I take pleasure in reporting that 
the progress of school work in this county has been encouraging, 
My efforts have been mainly directed to the organizing of district 
Boards and to systematizing their work. When I came into offiee 
I found there was little or no organization. Many of the school 
districts were deeply in debt and a want of systematized effort was 
plainly felt. My first duty seemed to be to put the directorship in- 
to shape. In this work I have succeeded to an encouraging degree. 
The Boards are now properly organized, transact their business in 
a proper way and the Directors generally have become more deeply 
interested. I have held Directors’ meeting ‘regularly every three 
months, which have not only been interesting, but profitable. I have 
not visited a great many schools, for the reason that I believed, under 
the circumstances, more,good could be done by first securing the 
hearty and intelligent co-operation of the directorship. The schools 
have generally given satisfaction and the teachers have generally 
been prompt and faithful. My examinations have been more rigid, 
and have had the good effect of making the teachers apply them- 
selves to study with a view of making themselves more proficient.

not as well attended as I desired. The people, I think, are getting

am glad to report an improvement. The attendance is better than 
heretofore. The chief abuse, which prevents the employment of 
competent teachers, is the very small pay. The class of men elected 
as Directors with us know but little about what should constitute a 
school teacher, and therefore know -as little of his pecuniary value. 
‘The small salaries are thus becoming a growing evil and unless 
averted, teaching will become in some localities, degrading. The

SHELBY COUNTY. 
G. P. Foure, SUPERINTENDENT, Memphis. 
The causes of delay in rendering this report are appreciated by 
you and understood to be in getting Directors to do their part of 
the work. But I believe they have done their best. The fever has 
been all over this county, not only along the highways of travel 
but in the hills and valleys. Without dwelling upon the details of 
the pestilence, I may say that its effects upon the schools have been 
only temporary, by delaying the time of opening. The principal 
cause of delay, however, has been a want of funds, no tax having 
been collected for three months, in this county. Happily there was 
asmall balance with which to begin operations, which has been done, 
with a fair start for the term. The epidemic, of course, has effected 
the city more than the country, but the city schools open on the 9th 
December, under most favorable circumstances. You will observe 
that the scholastic population of the county has increased, whether 
' from erroneous assessments, I cau not report. Would it not be wise 
.to authorize the county Superintendent to make the enumeration? 
At the last April term of the County Court I recommended an in- 
crease of the school tax to 10 cents. In the application the City 
Board of Education joined. The proposition was defeated. I have 
had some trouble in particular neighborhoods about employment of 
teachers, favoritism being the usual complaint. The fault seems to 
arise from the weakness of humanity rather than from the school 
aw. Whenever the people fully appreciate the blessings of the 
school system, they will yield all selfish consideration. I believe,

ation with me, on the part of Directors in the operation of the

have found it almost impossible to hold teachers’ Institutes, owing to 
the fact that we have so few professional teachers. More interest

Upon the resignation and removal from the State of Mr. W. H.

make the report from Sullivan, In his written report Mr. Gale 
says: The reports from Directors in very few cases make an ap- 
proach to completeness. None are full, and some are so meagre as 
to constitute no reports. The county thus appears to less advantage 
than it should in the reports of the State Superintendent, and no 
doubt the State at large suffers in comparison with her sister States 
from the same cause; for it is probable that complete reports are 
forwarded from few counties. I would suggest that the County 
Superintendents be instructed to assist Directors personally in this 
matter, for in this way alone can complete reports be obtained. 
This, will add to his labors, but in this manner only can correet re- 
ports be secured. The statistics of private schools should be fully 
included to fairly exhibit the educational spirit of the county. We 
have many excellent ones whose teachers would cheerfully furnish 
needed information. Our people every year are becoming more 
alive to the interests of education. Respectable school-houses are 
supplanting the disgraceful pens which formerly antagonized. every 
refined association. These are voluntary offerings, having been 
built by private subscription, and therefore do not appear in the 
statistical report, under the head of expenditures.

‘cilities for higher education. I find now very little opposition to 
the system. J have visited every school in the county, taking thir- 
teen weeks for my visitation. I usually visited two schools each 
day, and visited all the schools in the district before leaving it, 
closing by holding an Institute, to which teachers, Directors and 
citizens were invited. In these meetings different modes of teach- 
ing were discussed, and also the location of school-houses, impor- 
tance of good desks, black-boards, school attendance, defects and 
remedies: We have from three to five schools in a district, and 
twenty-five districts in the county. I have constantly urged upon 
the people the importance of visiting the schools, as a stimulus to

We cannot report as much progress as last year. I am disposed 
to ‘blame myself for this want of success, for while much good was 
done, much moré might have been done. Last year we found that 
many schools were taught by incompetent teachers, and were com- 
pelled to reject many. The enemies of the system and the friends 
of these rejected teachers combined to defeat the tax which was sub- 
mitted to a vote of the people, and thus succeeded, although if this 
election had not been held at the time of the general election, we 
should have succeeded. 
We have had many croakers in this county, crying out for econ- 
omy, when the truth is, that facts and figures show that no depart- 
ment of the public service has been more economically managed. 
Our teachers have been paid poor salaries, and yet they have done 
faithful, efficient work. Our High School at Covington is a com- 
plete success, under its efficient management, as also the consolidated

Mrs. E. B. BarKspALE, SUPERINTENDENT, Hartsville, 
I have nothing more favorable to report than that our county has 
levied the tax, and consequently we have better teachers, better 
schocls and more general interest in education. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
W. G. Anpserson, SUPERINTENDENT, Okolona. 
With one exception we have had schools in every district of the 
twelve in the county. Three or four private schools were taught. 
I visited all the Public Schools, and am gratified to report that 
teachers were trying to do their duty. Ours is a new and small 
county, and we have not money enough to prolong our schools as 
they should be. A few good men are in favor of a sufficient tax to 
carry on the schools for five months, Many of our School Directors 
have not reported correctly, and I have been compelled to travel- 
through the county to make up the reports. We hope you will ex- . 
cuse our weak county if we do not make the showing of older and 
wealthier counties. These mountains are full of bright boys and 
girls, and we hope that our people will soon take measures to edu- 
cate them all. 
UNION COUNTY. 
ALEX. L. MILLER, SUPERINTENDENT, Sharp’s Chapel. 
Schools were opened promptly about the 1st of August, and their 
progress and success equal, if they do not exceed those of last year. 
We have made a strong effort to establish uniformity in text books,
-P-A-G-E-121
    f 1% J 
but have only partially succeeded, though a decided improvement’ 
has been made on last year. We have no graded schools, and none 
of the schools have charts or globes, but nearly all are supplied 
with black-boards. A greater interest has been shown by parents 
and Directors in visiting the schools. Teachers are becoming better 
qualified and there is a deeided improvement in the discipline of the 
schools. A large number of the school-houses are not comfortable, 
but an improvement in this regard is hoped for. ,The people are 
becoming alive to the importance of good schools, and public senti- 
ment is favorable towards the.system. This sentiment is increasing. 
Lhave held three institutes during the year. Some of them were 
quite a success, and reflected credit on the county. 
  
VAN BUREN COUNTY. 
Wx. M. Simpson, SUPERINTENDENT, Spencer. 
As there has been no report made to me by the County Trustee, 
I cannot state what amounts have been received or expended. 
With difficulty I got a report of the scholastic population. Many 
of the District Clerks and Treasurers having made no report to me, 
it is impossible for me to make a statistical report of schools. There 
have been eleven schools taught, averaging about two and a half 
months in length of term. The most of these I visited. They 
were better attended and more efficiently managed than in former 
years. District Directors and parents give but little attention to 
the schools~yet the schools have done well. There have been no. 
school-houses erected during the last year. This county has always 
refused to vote a school tax, As County Superintendent, I have 
received no pay for the last two years. The private schools have 
done well. Ifthe school fund could be increased, the people would 
take more interest in education. 
WARREN COUNTY. 
J.J. Womack, SuperintenDEnt, McMinnville. 
The Public Schools have been taught in every district, some open- 
ing as early as 15th July. A majority of the teachers employed are
-P-A-G-E-122
{ 126 ] 
of very respectable teaching ability, more so, probably, than would 
have been expected, considering their small salaries. If the Legis- 
Jature would provide three mills on the dollar, or even two, it 
would enable Directors to employ still more efficient teachers, and 
at the same time prolong the schools to five months, as contem-~ 
plated by law. The sympathy of the County Courts is generally on 
the side of parents, or tax-payers rather than on the side of children, 
herice, the reason why our schools are not continued as the law con~ 
templates. All the provisions of the school law in relation to Dis- 
trict Clerks should be repealed and the County Trustees required 
46 settle with teachers, and thereby save hundreds of dollars. The 
séhdols of this County have been open about four months, on 
an average. We made an assessment for five months, but the 
shrinking in values prevented reaching it. : 
  
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
H. Presnecy, SuPERINTENDENT, Jonesboro, 
Some progress has been made. All the districts had schools 
for about four months. In most of them we had guod teaching, 
but in a few it was not satisfactory. Our people are slow to recog- 
nize the difference between teaching and keeping school. The school- 
room is no place for experiment; it costs too much, and is besides, 
dangerous. We.have had much opposition and many difficulties to 
meet. Salaries have been cut down from $32 to $28 per month. 
Several of our best teachers have therefore withdrawn from the 
work. It is false economy to consider cheapness, rather than effic~ 
dency, in employment of teachers. But little effort has been made 
t@ encourage the teacher in his profession, or to afford him an op- 
portunity to acquire that peculiar training which every one ought 
to have who undertakes to shape and fashion the minds of the ris- 
‘itig generation. Teaching is a noble profession, and none but noble - 
mex and women should ever enter it, nor should we expect to have 
stich men and women undertake it unless proper efforts are made to 
give such professional training as will bring the best results, The 
_ District Direetors are almost a supreme power in their districts, 
but until there is some way of compelling them to do their work in
-P-A-G-E-123
    [ 197 ] 
the proper manner and at the proper time, the reports will be the 
most unsatisfactory part of the County Superintendent’s work. A 
new Director is elected at the time these reports should be made. 
The Director has a difficult office and he should be paid for his 
labor and then compelled to do the work. We suggest that an edi- 
tion of the school law be issued to teachers and that they be ex~ 
amined on it as one of the prescribed studies. The Clerk and 
Treasurer should be under this examiner. 
I have not been able to visit all the schools, as the amount al- 
lowed by the Court would not allow it. Without supervision, I 
am convinced, by experience, the public schools must prove a fail- 
ure, A school system without life, is worthless. The false economy 
practiced, will ultimately bring the whole system into disrepute. I 
held six district Institutes, which were attended by some forty 
teachers. The object was to give the teachers an opportunity to see 
the actual work in the school-room. The plan has werked well. 
We also had a Normal class at Jonesboro, for eight. weeks; thirty 
teachers attended. The best results followed these efforts. 
We have not made satisfactory progress. The school tax is too 
small. The teachers have not been encouraged. The county has 
lost some of its most efficient teachers. But our schools are doing 
good and we are working on slowly, amid all the difficulties. We 
want a stronger school system—more State aid and county inter- 
ference. 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
Jonaraax Morris, SUPERINTENDENT, Waynesboro. 
The Superintendent makes the following written communication : 
I regret to inform you that, owing to the delinquency of District 
Directors, Iam unable to make a full report, as required by law, 
consequently I can only send you the scholastic population, which 
is 3,827, as appears from best information, gathered from reports. I 
have, during the year, visited about forty schools. They seemed to 
be in a prosperous condition. 
(Note.—The report of scholastic enumeration cannot be accepted 
without the items, which make it up. The Superintendent was 
urged to send it, but failed to do so. The enumeration of 1877 is 
inserted’in the table.) :

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
A. E, Duxs, SUPERINTENDENT, Dresden. 
My report has been delayed by the yellow fever in the county 
and the school interest has been damaged thereby. 
"We have had more and better schools than ever before. We - 
have had many good schools taught, but it has been almost impos- 
sible to get many Directors to make a full report. I visited every 
district, distributed the reports and gave full instructions, yét the 
reports are incomplete. All the districts are now out of debt and 
“séveral have repaired their school-houses. School interest is in- 
creasing. By consent of parties concerned, district lines have been 
changed in some cases. 
I have examined the books of all clerks and treasurers, and have 
examined all their vouchers. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
J. M. Jounson, SuPERINTENDENT, Darkey Springs. 
The Superintendent of this county submitted no written state- 
ment of the condition of schools, with his statistical report. It 
will be seen from the latter, that the enrollment was 2,500 and 
average attendance 1,800, all of which seem to be estimates, being 
in round numbers. , 
  
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
C. R. Berry, Superinrenpent, Franklin. 
"The death of two of our District Clerks is the cause of the delay 
in my report. Iam gratified to state that we have made much pro~ 
gress during the past year. We have kept our schools open longer 
than ever before in the history of free schools in our County. The 
cost of tuition is an improvement upon last year. Our Teachers’ 
Institute has proved a valuable auxiliary to the cause. It has evi-~ 
dently elevated the “grade” of teaching in our County. We in-
-P-A-G-E-125
[129 ] 
tend to continue this potent means of adding to the efficiency of the’ 
system. While we cannot claim to have excelled others in the work, 
yet we have the pleasure of feeling that we have done what we 
could. 
   WILSON COUNTY. . 
H. L. Pickerr, SupeRinpenvety/ Lebanon, ‘ mn 
Our schools have been very successful this year, considering: the 
amount of funds, and our teachers, as a class, have been better qiual- 
ified than in any previous year. In Lebanon they hate’ been of 
the first order, and I flatter myself that they would compare favor- 
ably with the best in the State. The marked suecebs!of the Public 
Schools in Lebanon, is due, in a great degree, to the liberal dona- 
tion of $500 received from the Peabody Fund. It has done much 
to encourage the advocates of free schools throughout the entire 
county. It is hoped that its influence will be felt for many years 
toecome. The people are gradually taking their stand in favor of 
free education, having seen what free schools can do when they have 
money enough to sustain them. I would suggest that the law pro- 
vide that no county shall use its funds oftener than every other 
year, unless there is an additional tax levied by the county—from 
the fact that the money derived from the permanent school fund 
and the tax imposed by the State are not sufficient to sustain the 
schools five months in one year, and a shorter time cannot accom- 
plish the object for which a free school system was designed—the 
education of the masses of the State.

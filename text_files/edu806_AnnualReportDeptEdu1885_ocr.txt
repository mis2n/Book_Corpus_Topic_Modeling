REPORT. 
It is evident, from the accompanying statistics, that our Pub- 
lic Schools throughout the State are steadily advancing, both 
as-to interest in them upon the part of the people and the work 
done by the teachers and pupils. The following summaries in- 
dicate the general condition of the schools for the year ending 
June 30,1885, and show the receipts and expenditures of public 
money.

This is exclusive of the county of Henderson. The report of 
this county gives the scholastic population, white and colored, 
without regard to sex, and therefore can only be placed in the 
total columns. The total white of Henderson is 4,514; the 
total colored is 688—making a grand total for the county of 
5,197; Adding this to the grand total of the State gives a scho- 
lastic‘ population of 609,028—an increase over that of the’ pre 
ceding -yéar of 23,637. This omission of Henderson in certain: 
columns explains why the total male and. total female in Table’ 
No.1 of the Appendix do not make the total white as found in 
that ‘table, and the same of the colored male and colored female.

Since the addition of the study of the Elements. of Agri-

are 386 more this year than last. .

The report of the average daily attendance is not quite so 
large as last year, which.is explained by the fact that several large 
counties failed to report this particularitem. The most of these 
gave satisfactory reasons why it could not be correctly done. 
For instance, in Dyer county the Superintendent was called to 
another field of labor about the time his report should have | 
been made to this office, and his successor was unable to find 
this particular part of the record. In McNairy county the | 
Superintendent’s house was burned, and with it his school sta- 
tistics; so he was only able to report such facts as could be 
gathered in a general way. 
Assuming that all the counties which have failed to report 
the average daily attendance of pupils could show as good at- 
tendance, according to population, as those which have re- 
ported, our table would show a considerable increase over that 
of last year.

greater number..were:held and a. larger number of teachers 
attended them than in any previous year. In addition to the — 
County Institutes reported, the State Superintendent spent three 
months last. summer-superintending State Institutes. For this 
work he secured the services of a number of our ablest educa- 
tors, such as Capt. W. R. Garrett, Supt. Frank M. Smith, Dr. 
N. T. Lupton, Prof. A. P. Bourland, Prot. T. C.2Karns, Prof. 
J. 8. Griffin, Supt. M. R. Abernathy, and several others, forthe 
benefit of white teachers; and Prof. A. J, Steele. Prof. H. H. 
Wright, and Prof. M. E. Ridley, for colored teachers. These 
gentlemen were aided by most excellent teachers and.earnest 
institute workers. For full information as to thig work of Nor- 
mal Institutes, reference is made to the reports of the gentlemen 
by whom tbey were held, tobe found ii the Appendix. Capt. 
W.R. Garrett held one at each of the following places: Adams- 
ville, McNairy county; Centerville, Hickman county; Harts- 
ville, Trousdale county; Fayetteville, Lincoln county,and Spar- 
ta, White county. Supt. Frank M. Smith held one at. the: fol- 
lowing ‘places: Dyersburg, Dyer county; Jackson, Madison 
county; Charleston, Bradley county; Blountville, Sullivan 
county; ‘and Clinton, Anderson county. At?all these I was 
present and witnessed the work done. © 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
The reports of County Superintendents show a very decided 
increase. of interest on the part of teachers in County Institutes, 
there having been held 349 during the year—an increase of 98 
over the number held during the preceding year. Many of 
these were well attended; much interest prevailed, and the 
participants returned to their school-rooms strengthened and 
cheered for doing good work. As evidence of the good results 
of these meetings, the following account, taken froma commu- 
nication of a Hickman county gentleman, recently published in 
one of our daily newspapers, is given: 
“At present there is a good sentiment throughout the coun- 
try in favor of education. Last year the educational interest 
was worked up to a high degree. Three years ag~ **-~- ~~ 
but two or three good schools in this county. Thi
-P-A-G-E-13

interest was at a low ebb. Nothing like institute work or nor- 
mal methods had ever been introduced. : ‘ 
nel ‘Last July. Hon. Thomas H. Paine, being earnestly solicited, 
held, ‘a State Teachers’ Institute at Centreville. The-institute 
convened at the Centreville High School building. At tirst 
there were only a few teachers present, and they seemed drawn 
by curiosity ; but when the work. of the institute, began the 
- curious became interested, the attendance increased daily, and 
many of our citizens became greatly enthused on the subject of 
education. The local and visiting teachers immédiately organ- 
ized.a County Institute. We have had four successful meetings 
since, with good. results. The impetus given by the State 
Institute will result in great good. The teachers have been 
edified and stimulated. This stimulus has spread among the 
people and the result is most gratifying, for within the past six 
months many new and comfortable’ school-houses have been 
erected, and good teachers from other parts of the country 
have: been employed.” : 2

These State Institutes were supported by the Peabody Edu- 
cation Fund, $1,500 having been furnished by the General Agent 
of that fund, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, for this purpose. In view of 
the fact that the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Education 
Fund have indicated by resolution that the policy of helping 
only those who help themselves will hereafter be adopted by 
them, the.teachers and citizens attending our State Institutes 
have passed resolutions asking a smatl appropriation out of the 
school fund for the support of institutes. These resolutions are 
on-file in this office and will be submitted to the Legislature al. 
its  Boxt « session. 
  _GRADED COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
One particular feature of the institute work of the past sum- 
mer was that of encouraging the grading of country schools. 
Several counties have begun this work during the year, so the 
gtading of‘our schools ard the ‘pursuit of a regular course ° of 
study: with a definite plan of work is progressing steadily...

STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-first annual session of the State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation was held at Jonesboro in August, 1885. The attend- 
ance was large and an unusual good interest was maintained 
during the entire proceedings., Great hospitality was shown 
by the citizens of the town in their entertainment of the mem- 
bers of the association and other visitors. Hon. Howell E. 
Jackson, United States Senator from Tennessee, was present 
and favored the association with an.able .ddress on National 
Aid to Education. Altogether the'session at Jonesboro was a 
most profitable one, and the members were delighted in mingling 
with the good people of that old historic town. . 
TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE. 
At the last meeting of our State Teachers’ Association, the 
necessity of a Teachers’ Reading Circle was: urged by Prof. 
John L. Lampson, of the State Normal College, Nashville, as one 
of the many means of improving teachers in professional and 
general.culture. Its necessity and propriety were immediately 
recognized by the association, and in order to establish reading 
circles through the State, a State Board of Directors was ap- 
pointed to act until the next meeting of the association. __ 
For further information on this subject, reference is made to 
the report of the Secretary of the State Board of Directors, 
which may be found in the Appendix. 
CITY SCHOOLS. 
e 
The reports from the superintendents of the various cities of. 
the State having a system of graded public schools show con- 
tinued progress. It has been my pleasure to visit several of 
these during the year, and in doing so I have been much im- 
pressed with the painstaking and thorough work done by both 
superintendents and teachers. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
I am pleased to note that our county superintendents are 
doing most excellent service in promoting the interests of the
-P-A-G-E-15
15 . 
public schools. They richly deserve public praise for their 
earnestness and skillful management in this regard.- ‘They are 
familiar with their own fields of labor, and know the needs of 
the schools which they superintend, and it is no more than Just 
to say here that they are doing well their work. 
COL, LEON TROUSDALE. 
uring st weeks that. I was ‘absent on account of    
     
      
    ins\itute w Col. Trousdale was employed to take my. place 
in office. It is needless to say that all the responsibilities 
ecohnebted withthe department were promptly met and, all 
duties 8 tisfactorily discharged. He has so log been, at the 
of o&y public school system, and has so faithfull served 
, Sate in\this capacity, that, the mere sl the 
fatt tht he is\gt the helm i inspires confidence that all is well. -

and Itbera encouragement in an-effort to promote the. cea

R EPORTS. 
Nasuyittz, Tewy., February 15, 1886. 
Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—In, accordance with your request, I submit the 
following report of the five Normal Institutes held by me during 
" the summer of 1885, under your general supervision. 
These institutes continued in session, each one week; begin-’ 
ning respectively on the dates and at the places designated in 
your published announcement, viz: 
Adamsville, June 29. 
Centerville, July 6. 
Hartsville, July 18. 
Fayetteville, July 20. 
Sparta, September 1. 
They were conducted on the plan indicated in your instruc- 
tions, and the general character of the work was similar in 
each. The respective programmes, minutes and lists of attend- 
ance are herewith filed, as a part of this report. The following 
regular instructors, employed by yourself, were associated with 
“me in conducting them: Prof. Frank M. Smith, Primary 
Methods and Grading of Country Schools, at Centerville, Harts- 
ville and Fayetteville; Prof. A -P, Bourland, English, at Adam- 
ville and Fayetteville; Prof. 8. A. Mynders, Geology of Ten- 
nessee, and Supt. M. R. Abernathy, Primary Methods, at Adams- 
ville; Prof. W. T. Payne, assisted by his accomplished wife, 
Primary Methods, at Sparta. : 
In addition to the regular instructors above mentioned, many 
teachers resident in the respective localities where institutes 
were held, took part in the exercises, and rendered valuable 
assistance. Among these were some of the most skillful teach- 
ers.of the State. It would exceed the limits of this report to 
4
-P-A-G-E-50
50 
give a synopsis of their work, and would, perhaps, be invidious 
to give a portion of it. (Of this work so cheerfully and skill- 
‘fully performed, you were yourself a witness, being present at 
all the institutes). Some of them displayed a high order of 
ability, and won the approbation and gratitude of their fellow- 
teachers. 
The total attendance at the five instiutes was about 500 teach- 
ers, and about 5,000 citizens. The largest attendance of teach- 
ers, a8 will be seen from the accompanying rolls herewith filed, 
was at Adamsville, at which place 121 teachers were present. 
At Sparta, although held in the month of September, while the 
schools were in session, more than 100 teachers attended. In 
addition to the regular institutes, I spent one day, in accordance 
with your instructions, in conferring with the people of Tulla- 
homa, and addressed them at night on the subject of “Grading 
the Schools.” 
At each institute, three sessions were held each day. The 
morning and evening sessions were. occupied with illustrations 
of school work. The night sessions were devoted to popular 
addresses on literary and educational topics. In the strictly 
professional work which occupied the morning and evening 
sessions, our efforts were devoted to the development of common 
school education, and were mainly directed to the primary de- 
partments. We endeavored to carry out your instructions, “to- 
make the work practical.” We did not consider it our office 
to attempt to impress upon the teachers our individual ideas of 
education, or to lay down dogmatically any particular mode of 
teaching as the method, or the fixed standard. While express- 
ing our own views freely, and in some detail, our main efforts 
were directed to showing that there are many ways of doing 
the same thing, and that teachers should know all the methods: 
and principles of teaching; that teaching is a science and an 
art, and lacks only inter-communication among the teachers,, 
and investigation and practice, to make it a profession. We- 
endeavored to induce teachers to consult each other, to compare 
the methods used in their own localities, and to widen the 
sphere by reading and investigating; thus summoning to their- 
aid the experience of the educational world. We endeavored 
to cover in our work the ordinary course of the common school
-P-A-G-E-51
  51 . . 
curriculum. We exemplified methods of instruction in the 
various branches embraced in the school law of Tenpressee, aud 
invited those present to illustrate the methods in-use in their 
respective localities. In response to this request, many of the 
’ teachers took part in the exercises, and exemplified some very 
_beautiful work. It gives me pleasure to report that in many ... 
portions of the State we found the most admirable methods in 
use, and a high degree of skill and intelligence on the part of 
teachers. I regret that I cannot report that this was general. 
Although we found many excellent primary teachers, and saw 
some capital primary work, yet, in general, the primary depart- 
ment is the most neglected and worst taught department in the 
- common schools of the State. The teaching in the grammar 
and high-school departments usually receives much more atten- 
tion from the people, and is more. skillfully conducted by the 
teachers. Irecommend to you to give special attetition to the 
improvement of primary work. 
I think I may safely report that we succeeded in arousing a 
spirit of inter-communication among teachers’ and people, a 
desire to investigate and test improved methods, to read, to 
attend institutes, and to use all the appliances of investigation 
and mutual aid. In this connection, I cannot refrain from tes- 
tifying to the efficient work of my colleagues, Profs. F. M. 
Smith, A. P. Bourland, 8. A. Mynders, and Prof..and Mrs. 
Payne, in their respective departments. 
Believing that all public institutions in this country must 
* rest upon the solid foundation of popular sympathy and sup- 
port, we directed the work of the institute to the people as 
well as to the teachers. When education shall touch the publie 
heart, and be recognized as a public care; when the people 
shall, understand improved methods and educational needs; 
when they meet to discuss education as they now meet to dis- 
€uss politics; then the educational institutions of. the United 
States will become, like its political institutions, the admiration 
of the world. 
. It gives me great pleasure to report that the citizens every- 
where‘attended the institutes in a body. At various points the 
‘merchants closed’ their stores, the farmers left their fields, the 
judge and lawyers closed court, to attend the meetings of the
-P-A-G-E-52
52 
institutes. The newspapers placed their columns at our dis- 
posal, the ladies aided “us with music, recitations and essays, 
and-in every form the most cordial sympathy and hospitality 
was extended. Many citizens of influence and eloquence lent 
cordial aid to our work, and participated in our exercises. 
Among these were: Gen. Alex. Campbell and Gen. M. H. 
Mecks, at Adamsville; Col. O. A. Nixon, Rev. J. G. Bolton 
and Rev. J. J. Comer, at Centerville; Hon. John M. Bright, 
Hon. J. B. Lamb, Col. D. W. Holman, at Fayetteville; Gen- 
G. G. Dibrell, Col. C. Marchbarks, at Sparta. : 
County Superintendents M. R. Abernathy at Adamsville, 
W. P. Clark at Centerville, John M. Price at Hartsville, J. W. 
MeDaniel at Fayetteville, and J. M. Johnson at Sparta, deserve 
the highest commendations for the zeal snd ability with which 
they discharged the duties of local managers at their respective 
institutes. The success and popularity of the meetings was 
largely due to their excellent management. : 
At every point resolutions were adopted by the citizens, ex- 
pressing their approbation of the work, and petitioning the 
Legislature to give to the “Normal Institute” a legal status. 
These resolutions will be found among the minutes herewith 
filed. I believe them to express the earnest sentiment of the 
people.” In every case they were carried with enthusiasm. I 
give below a portion of the resolutions adopted at Fayetteville. 
These resolutions, were offered by Col. D. W. Holman, an 
" were unanimously adopted : 
1. Resolved, That we are deeply impressed with the fact that 
the institute is exercising a deep and wide-spread power and 
influence for good in advancing the intelligence and morals of 
the people of the State, and we hope that it will become per- 
manent by legislative enactment, with ‘suitable powers vested 
in the Superintendent to require from teachers of public schools 
such attendance on the exercises as public interest may demand. 
2. Resolved, That we respectfully petition the General As- 
- sembly of Tennessee to adopt suitable legislation, and to pro- 
vide an appropriation of $10,000 to enable the State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction to hold State Normal Institutes 
annually at suitable points throughout the State. 
In concluding this report, I express the sentiments of all my 
colleagues and associates, in.tendering to you our thanks for

Following the above programme, a Normal. Institute was. 
_convened at Dyersburg, Tenn., June 15, 1885, and was con- 
cluded June 22. 
The instructors did the work outlined for them on the pro- 
gramme. 
Of the ‘lecturers appointed, Dr. D. J. Smith performed his 
part. Of the essayists, much is worthy of being said, for all 
performed their duties well. In addition to lectures arranged 
for beforehand, State Superintendent Thomas H. Paine lec- 
tured on “The Public School System,” Frank M. Smith on 
“The Old School and the New,” A. P. Bourland on “The 
Language we Speak.” 
The Kindergarten of Miss Trousdale was of special attraction 
- and profit to. every one present. 
Especial mention should be made of the fact that successful 
steps were taken to build an elegant and commodious school- 
house in the city; one night was devoted to a mass-meeting for 
this purpose. 
At the close of the meetings, Hon. Tom W. Neal, H. Parks, 
Jr., and other leading citizens, made strong speeches, indorsing 
the work, and urging the necessity of the State furthering the 
efficiency and extension of these Normal Institutes.

ENGLISH TEACHING, 
BY A. P. BOURLAND, IN THE STATE NORMAL INSTITUTES IN WHICH 
HE WAS EMPLOYED. 
Methods. 
The child's mind must be trained in creating and arranging 
ideas, which can be done by having it. to see first the things of 
the world around him, and understanding some of the sugges- 
tions that emanate from every object that comes from the 
hands and spirit of God. 
The teacher of our own tongue, which is simply a congeries 
of symbols used by our nation as symbols for the things and 
the thoughts suggested by them, must also pay continuous 
heed to the training of the articulating organs, so that the 
child’s thoughts may have an easy and effective transmission. 
The words and sentences of our language will obey no one who 
does not acquire a practical intimacy with them. How to talk: 
with the tongue is one.thing, and how to talk with the pen is © 
another, hence arises a third object for the English teacher. A 
trinity of powers is to be developed in the child. The nerve |

cells. constituting the yellow layer on the outside of the cere- 
brum; the larynx, voeal hords, and tongue; the muscles of 
the arm, must be exerv&ed sufficiently to produce easy, pleas- 
~ urable action in thoughigetting, thought-making and thought- 
expressing. The facet that immense stores of educating power 
lie in our literature, the greatest ever produced, is never to be 
‘lost sight of; but the teacher must develop the mind into a love 
that will-enable him to be easily conversant with Chaucer, 
- Shakspere, Milton, Keats, Hawthorne and Scott. 
    
HOW TO ACCOMPLISH, IN 3 A MEASURE, THE FIRST AIM, 
Prepare a course of objects to be looked at and into, to be 
talked about, and written of. Begin with the child’s toys and 
pets, such as the doll, bal, wagon, top, cat and dog. The child 
must have something that will arouse its thinking powers. © 
«This must be an object of interest, partly understood therefore, 
partly new, familiar, but unknown. The inside of common 
things is intensely interesting to the curious child.” Objects 
about the school-room and in the yard, articles of clothing, 
fruits, articles in use at home (knife, fork, spoons, etc.) : 
When an object is presented, to be sure, the aim is to get the 
child to talk, and when this is gained, the talking should 
be developed into an organized growth, so that the child will 
be led to the discovery of more things about this object, as well 
as to the observing of others. Make him an investigator, you 
make him a thinker, hence the way to easy, forcible expression 
is not difficult, From Mrs. Knox’s admirable work on “Lan- 
guage Lessons,” we quote the following plan for the lessons the 
first year: 
1. The name of the object. Drill on the pronunciation of 
the name. 
2. How many have seen any other or others like this? 
Where? A question which will elicit in answer the name Gf 
not too difficult) of more than one. 
3. What people have them for, or do with them, or of what 
use they are? 
4, Color; very large or small; like or unlike others which 
they have seen ; why others did not look like this?
-P-A-G-E-57
a 
57 
5. Questions which elicit in answer the words of the lesson 
upon which they need to be drilled. 
6. A simple home task to cultivate perception and ‘compari- 
son; as, if the lesson has been about a chair, to look at the 
chair in which baby is rocked to sleep, or the chair in which 
the little brother or sister sits at table, and tell about it to-mor- 
row. « 
These conversational lessons, brief, and in pure English, can 
be made of the greatest potency in causing the child to develop 
the powers of perceiving, comparing, classing and reasoning. 
They should continue throughout the entire course of seven or 
eight years. From the child-world we pass to the boy and girl- 
world, with its objects fraught with the deepest interest, such 
as bugs, plants, the more common animals, and the simple pro- 
cess of plant and animal life. Then into the man and woman- 
world we go, and become students of those realities that have 
educated man from his childhood in the remote past, and that 
will continue to be of power in calling forth the pure and high 
in the soul until the body sinks back to earth. Keep up a sys- 
_ tematic looking into the objects of nature, the conscious beings 
_ as well as the unconscious phenomena of nature. What funds 
of rich material in the rain-showers, snow-falls, ice-formings, 
frost-crystalizings, sky and cloud-appearings! The intelligent 
and live teacher will ever be on the alert seeking out and dis- 
posing this material, which will give a strong action to the 
mind, which in turn will find strong words to put into strong 
sentences. Unity with variety is the underlying principle which 
will insure success. We can not close our remarks upon these 
. “observation lessons,’ “object lessons,” ‘conversation les- 
sons,” more appropriately than by quoting from Herbert Spen- 
cer’s masterly article on “True Method of Object Lessons,” in - 
which he says: “To tella child this, and to show it the other, 
is not to teach it how to observe, but to make it a'mere recip- 
ient of another’s observations; a proceeding which weakens | 
rather than strengthens its powers of self-instruction—which 
deprives it of the pleasures resulting from successful activity—_ 
which presents this all-attractive knowledge under the aspect of 
formal tuition—and which thus generates that indifference, and 
“even disgust, with which these object lessons are not unfre- 
- quently regarded.” .
-P-A-G-E-58
- 58 
It was insisted that the country teachers had the most ample 
facilities for the successful collection of the materials for object- 
work, and that the need for developing such series of lessons was 
great. Devices and practical work were presented, so that 
much interest was aroused that is likely to take some of the 
workers out-of the old word-methods, shadow-dealing and ma- 
neuvering processes. 
PICTURES. 
Another valuable means of stimulating the mind to, perceive, 
“compare, reason and imagine, indeed, are these! 
The pictures are found in the readers, and can be collected 
from illustrated papers, magazines, ete. Those cut from papers. 
should be pasted upon nice card-board, so that they can be 
passed among the children. Encourage them to make collec- 
tions of these as well as collections of objects. They will find 
intense pleasure in doing something for themselves. 
This work should be continued throughout the entire public 
school course. Almost every day will not be too frequent for 
the lessons. At first merely talk of the names of the objects 
seen, their number, and their actions. “We will find the pic- 
ture on page 17. What are the names of these children? 
‘What has the little girl asked the boy?” “Now, we will have 
a talk about the picture on page 45. How many children are 
here? What are they playing? Where did they put the flag? 
What can you say about the flag?” Have them to write sen- 
tences about the rabbits, about the boys, etc. Such will be 
effective work for First Reader pupils. 
Second Reader—Picture, page 35— 
1. What does Henry do for a living? 
. How do you know he was an honest boy? 
How was he rewarded? 
. What did he buy? . 
. Why did men notice him and give him work? 
. When did he go to school? 
» Why would you call Henry a yood boy?

. How. does it keep itself clean ? 
. Of what use will it be when it is older? 
(The above is quoted from “Language Exercises,” published 
by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co., Cincinnati, O., to recommend 
them for extensive use in our schools). 
The answers to the last exercise can be combined into a com- 
position. From now and on, frequent compositions should be 
prepared in this way. Words selected by the teacher from the 
reading lessons should be used by the children in describing, in 
this way they will materially increase their vocabularies and be 
started upon the important work of accumulating word-stocks, 
‘Parallel with the pictures in the reading books, those collected 
should be used; and after the students pass from the Readers, 
the work should be continued. Animals claim the intensest 
interest of children, so, if possible, use pictures of these largely. 
Encourage a'study of the animals themselves, and have them 
to find and bring stories of the animals themselves, as well as 
‘to draw,pictures of the simpler forms. 
Methods—Suppose you have pictures of a turtle and a eroco- 
dile.. Have them compared. Learn anything you can from the 
children concerning these, where they live, how they look, of 
what use are they.. Pictures of Sandpiper and Dragon Fly—de- 
scribe each; develop as above. If you have a picture, say of a 
rabbit family, have it described, and a story told of it. Pic- 
tures of the farm-yard, of natural phenomena in violent action, 
as storm on land or sea, scenes in mountains or on the deserts, 
views of. great cities and buildings among various nations, 2 are 
of the richest power. 
Be careful to supply the students with the words you want 
used in the descriptions, and narrations which the students are 
not likely to have. 
I have prepared for my work in the higher classes in the col-
-P-A-G-E-60
60 
lege course some interesting and profitable exercises.. Form a 
' finely written illustsated article in Harper’s Monthly on “Strat- 
ford on the Avon,” I clipped pictures of “ Shakspere,” “ House 
in which Shakspere was Born,” “Room in which Shakspere 
“was Born,” “Interior of Anne Hathaway’s Cottage,” “The 
Guild Chapel and Grammar School,’ “Holy Trinity Church,” 
“Charlecote Hall, seat of Sir Thomas Lucy,” “Interior of 
Charlecote Hall,” “The Weir Walk,” ‘“Shakspere Memorial 
Hall.” 
These pictures were nicely pasted upon bristol-board, and 
upon the backs were put the verbal descriptions clipped from 
the same article. If such could not be secured, words to be 
used were placed there to be wrought into the student’s compo- 
sition. Highly valuable was this for a class studying Hamlet. 
‘and Shakspere. 
From the Century, Harpers, and other illustrated magazines, 
Ihave prepared some magnificent work; e. g., “Artist Strolls 
in Holland,” “Through the Dark Continent,” “On the Wild 
Welsh Coast,” “The White Mountains,” “The Borderlands of 
Surrey,” “A Provincial Capital of Mexico,” ete. The utility of 
such can be learned by a trial of this plan. Tlustrations of the 
scenes of Irving’s, Hawthorne’s, Dickens’ and Scott’s romances ; 
of Longfellow’s, Tennyson’s, Bryant’s, Whittier’s and Holmes’ 
poems, secured and prepared the samé way, I assure you, are 
valuable aids to the teacher in leading the student to a loving, 
' receptive study of the masterpieces of these great writers. I 
must not fail to add that from the Reports of the United States 
Geological Survey, I have had some magnificent picture-lessons 
on Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and, Yellowstone Park. They 
infuse a love for our own fair America, and an earnest desire to 
aid in the outdrawing of all her possibilities. Such is a great 
need for the teachers to accomplish. 
Upon the object and picture work I have dwelt : 
because I find such a woful neglect and urgent net 
work in all of our schools, from the humblest log cal 
proudest university. In the treatment I have been led from th 
strict consideration of the “faculty of interna) speech” and it 
training to that of the external and its training. Such wa, 
unavoidable, tor, to think is to speak to one’s self; to speak i 
to think aloud.
-P-A-G-E-61
61 . 
LANGUAGE WORK.. 
The oral part has been considered sufficiently. How to ex- 
press thoughts with pen; how to understand the nature of 
English words, sentences and paragraphs; how to be able to 
comprehend English chapters and books, English Literature: 
will next claim our attention. 
«The ideas upon which grammatical classification vests,” can” 
be devéloped from the very beginning of the child’s school 
course. In the English language a word is a certain part of 
apeéch, because it does the work of that part of speech. - “Ship 
money was needed.” “This is a large ship.” “The mer- 
chant ships me goods.” “This is a silver dollar.” “Have you 
any silver?” “Silver these spoons.” We see very easily in 
English that words are classed according to the work they do, 
‘that their class depends upon their powers and functions ina: 
particular sentence. The fact that the English is such a lan- 
guage makes it a power in developing the reasoning, as well as 
judging powers of the mind. 
In the First Reader grade, children can be taught what words 
are nouns, how they change for the various uses in the sentence. 
An, addition, lessons in quality words will be of great value, . 
The correct use of a few verbs, such as: is—are; was—were; 
-has—have ; correct use and orthography of a few irregular 
verbs, ag well as of words pronounced alike, but spelled differ- 
  _ ently, can be taught by a series of attractive exercises, by filling 
in blanks in sentences, and combining these into simple stories. 
uring the Second Reader grade, in addition to the above, 
ve 3 can be introduced definitely, and statements, commands 
uestions, in all times and moods, can be taught. 
“During the Third Reader grade, children can learn how 
rords change when we speak of one, or more than one, as well 
ww words change when they denote possession. 
‘ing the Fourth Reader, teach all about comparison, in 
ion to the continuing of the other work. 
Ain hie’ way all that is to be learned of so-called English Gram- 
can be taught so pleasurably that the acquirement will be 
scious. Grow it into the expanding mind. Such can be

Frequent oral and written reproductions of reading lessons, of 
stories at home and at school, will be valuable in training how 
to express thought with some weight. A good plan is to cut 
short stories from whatever papers you can; paste them upon 
cards; give each ‘student a story; allow him so many minutes 
to read it; remove the cards, and have each one to reproduce 
what he has read. Experience has taught me that this plav is 
far better than the old one of reading the stories. 
In every sentence. there should be but one thought. Each 
sentence should bear the thought in the preceding one to the 
succeeding one. In other words, there should be a unity, a 
method in each sentence, and a flow, a movement from one to 
the other. So with paragraphs and chapters. These constitute 
the main qualities of great writers. Select some series of 
stories: “Stories from Grecian History,” “Tales of a Grand- 
father,” etc. ‘Select the leading words from each sentence, put 
these on the board, commas, periods, etc., in proper places, in- 
dicate where the paragraphs end, have children to copy, read 
the story, and have them to reproduce. If we learn how to 
swim by swimming, we can certainly learn how to sentence by 
sentencing, how to paragraph by paragraphing. In this the 
pupils will get the power of putting unity and movement into 
their writings. A vast deal is gained. 
Teachers, by all means keep in view the overcoming of the 
mechanical difficulties of style as early as possible. The mind 
of the student must be given to substance and not to form when it is 
in. the genial mood of creating. 
In the great books of our literature are materials for a lib- 
eral education. The loving soul open to all of their power 
must come to them to realize their high benefits. It must have 
the ability to see the beauty, to know the light, to taste the 
sweetness, to know the spirit that Dante, Shakspere, Goethe 
and Emerson have infused into their works of mind, heart and. 
soul; in other words, it must realize the content of these books. 
Knowirig the content of chapters enable one to know the content 
of books; knowing the content of sentences insures the know- 
ing of the content of.chapters. knowing the content of words 
will lead, with their bearings, to the knowing of the content of 
sentences. Tue content or worps! Two men hear Pogota men~

tioned. One has never been out of Tennessee, to him it is 
merely a city in South America; the other has been to the 
lovely city on the temperate mountain-summit, has seen its 
lovely gardens, lived charmed days amid its flowers and breezes, 
lingered around the majestic rocks embowered with trees, alt 
spattered with the foam of its great waterfall. To him the 
word. calls up such a crowd of pleasing memories, so many 
charming, alluring scenes, that he feels the deepest pleasure. 
Two men see the word, sun; the one views a simple ball of fire, 
rising in the morning and setting in the evening. The astron- - 
omer sees the great fire-ball, so large that if we could hollow 
out the sun’s globe, and put the earth in the center, there would 
be room enough still for the moon to keep on moving two hun- 
dred and forty thousand miles from the earth, all within the 
globe of the sun itself, and have plenty room to spare. The 
mysterious spots, the strange pores, gnd wondrous corona of 
this source of the light and life of scores of worlds, all appear 
to him with a majestic grandeur. He feels himself in the pres- 
ence of a great power, and all the better, grander for the feeling. 
We believe that such a course of training as we have outlined, 
objects, pictures, words used in talking and writing, will lead 
to the thorough understanding of the content of words. The 
solid, enlarging and sustaining elements are then within the 
reach,of the pupils. Now, for them make a working selection 
of books, and they have the materials for their education. 
- The poetic and emotional side of literature is the most needed 
for daily use. We agree with Mr. Frederic Harrison when he 
says: “TI take the books that seek to rouse the imagination, 
to stir up feeling, touch the heart; the books of art, of fancy, 
. of ideals, such as reflect the delight and aroma of human life.” 
: Hence we would recommend that the students be first intro- 
duced. to Irving in his “Alhambra,” “Tales of a Traveler,” 
“Crayon Papers;” then to Dickens in his “Old Curiosity 
Shop,” “Christmas Carol,” and “David Coppertield;” after 
this to Sir Walter Scott in his “Guy Mannering,” “ Ivanhoe,” 
“Quentin Derrward.” To have drunk in the whole of these 
glorious spirits isa liberal education in itself. “Evangeline,” 
“Tdyls'of the King,” “Tales from Shakspere,” and the “ Vicar 
. of Waketield” will furnish material for much sustenance.

Norz 1.—Such courses as I have attempted to outline have ~ 
been adopted in the principal city schools of the United States, 
‘and from the majority of the reports, I gather that results’ 
have been satisfactory. The Language Lessons are the main 
attractions of the work done in the celebrated Quincy Schools. 
The course is distinct from the other studies. Still, if the 
highest results of expression are to be attained, every lesson in 
every study must bea language lesson. It is with pleasure we 
note the making of language a part of the instruction in num~ . 
. bers, as well as in other branches. The boys from Eton and 
Harrow stand as the best writers in the English Universities. 
They are never allowed to passa recitation without careful heed 
given to expression in the mother-tongue, be it in Latin, Greek, 
German, Mathematics or Science. 
' Notz 2.—The following books will be of much service to any 
one engaged in this Language work: “Zigzag Journeys in 
Europe,” “Zigzag Joutheys in the Orient,” “Fairy Land of 
Science,” “Life and her Children,” Johonot’s “ Natural His- 
tory Readers,” “ What Mr. Darwin Saw in his Voyage Round 
the World in the Ship Beagle,” Miss Muloch’s “A Noble Life,” 
“Little Arthur’s History of England.” 
Nore 3.—To teachers I heartily recommend Swelt’s Methods 
in Country Schools; Teacher’s Edition of Mrs. Knox’s Lan- 
guage Lessons; Eclectic Series of Language Exercises (Teach- 
ers’ Edition) ; “ Quincy Methods.” 
Among the many excellent school journals I heartily indorse 
the following as giving special attention to Language work: 
“ Teachers’ Institute,” “ Popular Educator,” “ Practical Teach- 
er,” and “Southwestern Journal of Education.” 
To Prof, Frank M. Smith, President of Hast Tennessee State 
Normal Institute: 
Dear Srr—With regard to my + work in the State Normal 
Institutes of 1885, I beg leave to report as follows: . I was em- 
ployed by the Hon. Thomas H. Paine, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, to assist you in the institutes to be held 
respectively at Charleston, Blountville and Clinton. , Previous 
to the opening, I spent several days in arranging for the insti- 
tutes, the work consisting of a personal visit to Charleston, the
-P-A-G-E-65
65 
_ printing and mailing of circulars, and correspondence with 
county: superintendents and others, with a view to securing an 
interest and attendance. I was present at the opening at 
Charleston on the 27th of July. My first,work was lecturing 
on Primary Methods. This embraced methods of teaching all 
the branches in the first years of 2 common school course. I 
treated the subject both theoretically and practically. The first 
branch discussed was Reading. In discussing this subject I 
presented the principles and practices of the most advanced 
teachers. The necessity of mental culture and development, 
including oral expression of thought, before the child comes to 
read, was dwelt upon. The greater the stock of well-selected 
igeas, and the better the powers of expression when the child 
enters school, the faster and the more satisfactory must be its 
‘progress. I showed that the teacher must discover the child’s - 
mental condition, and begin to build up af the Very point where 
the child’s knowledge ends. This appli¢Xto ull Uranches. The . 
instruction must be closely adjusted to ‘the child’s present. de- 
velopment. It must occupy the same, relation. to the @hild’s 
mental growth that food bears to the growth of its body. “That 
only which can be assimilated and «produce mental vigor should 
be presented for the pupil’s consideration. The word-method 
was recommended as the only true method for beginners in 
' reading. The words should be taught from the black-board in 
the script form. The child should write from the start. The 
object, the mental picture or conception, the spoken sign or 
word, and the written sign were shown to be in close and logi- 
cal connection. The instruction must recognize this fact, and 
harmonize with it. It is as natural to teach written words as 
“wholes as it is to teach spoken words as wholes. This is the 
mother’s plan, and nature has no other. Reading was shown 
to be the getting of thought by means of written or printed 
signs called words. It is not simply an elocutionary effort. 
Most of the practical reading of life is silent reading. As 
words are the signs of ideas, the idea must always come in the 
_child’s mind before its sign. Therefore words, without ideas 
behind them, should never be taught, Reading, writing and 
spelling should all be developed at the same time. Spelling is 
nothing more than writing the word. ‘very time a child B .

writes a word correctly, he spells it, though he may not‘even. 
know the names of the letters. The letters should not be 
taught at first, and need not be taught at all. Oral spelling is 
without value ands useless. During the first year the child 
should copy words, and not attempt to write from memory. In 
the second year its vocabulary will become sufficient to attempt 
simple composition. It should then be taught to only write its 
thoughts in natural form instead of speaking them. It thus’. 
comes to recognize the truth that the only true difference: be- 
tween oral expression of thought and written expression is in» 
the form and not in reality. I illustrated also, with a class of 
children, the practical application of the theory set forth'for ~ 
teaching beginners to read. It would be too tedious to detail 
here all the devices used to win the minds of the children and — 
impress the » first words taught. I also pass over the details of 
the n Rael wots Ag taught, and the transfer from script to

writing... I would teach writing to primary classes only through 
imitatiomand. practice. Qvientitic penmanship, if taught at all, 
would corid/th(pyly with the higher classes. The children use 
pencils only for two or three years. : 
I based my instruction in number on the Grube system. 
_ Here as elsewhere, the teacher must learn what the child ac- 
tually knows, and begin to build there, At first, number must 
bé taught wholly by objects. These are as necessary in teach- 
ing number as in teaching color. Number is an attribute of 
objects as much as color is. Pupils are not prepared for the 
. abstract until they are made very familiar with the concrete. 
All fundamental rules are to be developed at the same time. 
All the: properties and combinations in each number must be - 
taught i in order. First take 1, and then 2, then 3, and so on for 
every number in accordance with a proper imodification of the 
Grube system, All rules must be deduced from the child’s 
| experience, and not memorized. I cautioned teachers against
-P-A-G-E-67
67 
teaching the mere signs of number instead of number it-- 
Sself.; All fundamental operations must be made so familiar to 
the pupil that they become automatic. If the foundation is 
properly laid the advanced rules of arithmetic are acquired with 
. but little effort. 
In language, my work did not extend, to technical grammar. 
The development of ideas and their expression were dwelt 
upon. Into this department the concrete must enter largely. 
Objects are to be described. Actions, conditions and relations 
are to be recognized and expressed, both orally and by writing. 
‘The child learns to talk with the pencil. Language must be 
taught in every recitation made by the child as well as in the 
regular language lesson. Stories and their reproduction are_ 
very useful. Capitals and punctuation are taught by practice. 
Constant practice should be the watchword. The pupil finally 
finds talking with the pencil as agreeable as talking with the 
tongue.. 
In. my lectures on Geography, I showed that this science 
must begin with the simplest ideas. In the first year the right 
hand and the left hand should be taught, and the simplest ideas 
of direction in its application to local objects. The situation 
of objects in the school-room, on the play-ground, or in the 
vicinity,.is made available by the teacher. As the pupil ad- 
‘vances in the second and third years, the map of the neighbor- 
‘hood or of the town comesin. Stories about different countries” 
and their inhabitants can be told by the teacher. Pictures of 
mountains and plains, rivers and oceans, cities and country are 
exhibited and explained. The teacher must be full of informa- 
tion. Such books as “The Seven Little Sisters” can be put 
into the hands of the children who begin to read well. ‘Sand 
mapa are constructed to assist the imagination in getting a just 
conception of mountains and valleys and the contour and ele- 
vation of continents. Shelves and paper boxes are provided in 
which ‘products of different countries are placed. These con- 
" sist of sugar, tea, coffee, rice, tobacco, all kinds of grain, woods, 
’ ‘gea-shiells, aid whatever else will interest and instruct. After - 
the introduction of the text-book in the third or fourth year, 
the ‘and ‘maps are continued with much profit. -Too many”
-P-A-G-E-68
68 
details must now be avoided. In this branch, as well as élse- 
- where, signs and shadows must not be substituted for realities. 
The repetition of lists of names is to he avoided. I counseled 
teachers to cultivate in the minds of: their pupils a living con- 
ception of real countries and cities rather than mere lines and 
dots on maps. They must build up the true mental picture. 
. Books of travel should be read, and geographical pictures 
exhibited and studied. The news of the day with geography is 
important, and the study of commercial features and lines of 
trade and travel. 
My lectures on History were brief. The same spirit of in- 
struction was advised for this department as for others. The 
smaller pupils are eager for stories of old times, old wars, 
heroes and heroines. The teacher must be a story-teller. In 
the use of text-books too many details must be avoided. Strike 
the salient points. Have the pupils see in imagination the suc- 
cession of events described so vividly that they will recite from 
their own mental picture and not from the words of the author. 
In history three points must be kept in mind—the how, the 
when, and the where of events. These embrace all that can be 
known of them—the description, the date, and the geography. 
The leading dates only should be insisted upon. Use a date 
line to assist the memory. Put at the left end 1492, if studying 
United States History. At the right end place the present 
time, and then fill in, always putting down mdst important dates 
first. This: method may be used in reviews, and will prove 
interesting and very profitable. 
The State Geology of Tennessee belongs to our common- 
school course of study, and so I gave one lecture on this branch 
at each institute. Instead of taking up State Geology especially, 
TI illustrated by black-board drawings a method of making clear 
the elementary principles of the science which are so necessary 
to a proper appreciation of the whole subject. I explained the 
successive steps in the formation.of our solar.system—the orig- | 
inal gaseous state of matter, the forming of centers of rotation, 
the condensation of masses, the formation of rmgs, and the 
‘birth of planets and satelites. Our solar system was thus 
formed. The planets are children of the sun, and among the
-P-A-G-E-69
69 
number is our’ earth, the third in order from the sun, and one 
of the youngest of the family. The earth was first gaseous, 
then liquid, and now solid, at least as to its surface. That the 
old fires are still smouldering in the interior, volcanoes aud 
earthquakes attest. The gradual cooling down of the mass and 
the formation of the earth’s crust were explained; also the 
growth of the continents and the accumulation of the rocks and 
fossils of the successive geological ages. In this way the proper 
order and sequence can be impressively fixed, and the founda- 
tion laid for a detailed study of the subject. 
I have thus given you an outline of my work, which is neces- 
sarily brief.and defective, My constant aim was to put teachers 
on amore solid and more rational footing for purposes of in- 
struction. I wished them to recognize the difference between 
rote teaching and natural ortrue teaching. I would have them 
give their pupils thoughts instead of the signs of thoughts, and 
train them to think rather than parrot the thoughts of others. ~ 
‘I tried to follow the principles of what is commonly known as 
“the new education”—not blindly and slavishly and because 
they might be new or popular, but because they lead to nature 
and the truth. All of which I respectfully and obediently 
submit. / T. C KARNS, 
: : State Institute Instructor-for East Tenn. 
The character of the work performed at these institutes was 
the same throughout. The principal objects kept constantly in 
‘view: were better methods for primary work and grading 
the country schools. The grading of the country schools was 
discussed fully at each of these institutes, from the outline 
given in your report for the year of 1884. 
-,-I am pleased to report that I have corresponded with parties 
-who attended these institutes, and find that an effort has been 
made with considerable success to grade the schools. It fact, I 
Know of no failures where au attempt was made. These insti- 
tutes, being more practical in their work and reaching a larger 
“number of teachers, school officers and patrons, did a work that 
can scarcely be realized: 
. The citizens everywhere turned out, and before the close the 
“hoggee where the meetings were held were filled to the utmost.

and a determination by private study and otherwise, to become 
better fitted to perform their duties. I believe these institutes 
do much toward inciting to this special study and effort.

Dear Str—I have the pleasure of reporting to you concern- 
ing. the recent State Teachers’ Institute, held at Nashville, 
Tenn., for’the colored teachers of Middle Tennessee: 
.The entire enrollment reached one hundred and thirteen per- 
sons, but many who gave their names proved to be transient in 
attendance. The institute continued three weeks and was fol- 
lowed by an examination by the Superintendent of Davidson 
County of those who desired certificates for this county. The 
branches taught were arithmetic, geography, grammar, spell- 
ing, United States history; geology of Tennessee, elements of 
agriculture, theory and practice. Besides these subjects, lec- 
tures were given by Prof. A. K. Spence on School Movements ; 
Prof. H. 8. Bennett on The Teacher and his Books; Prof. 
_Woolwine on Management; Dr. J: Braden and Mr. W. R. Mor- 
tis on School Government, and Mr. J. W. Grant on Needs of 
the Schools. 
At the close of the institute appropriate resolutions were 
passed by the teachers, which were published in the’ American 
and Banner of July 3d, 1885. The instructors of the institute 
were H. H. Wright, Principal, Dr. @. W. Hubbard and Miss 
Jennie H, Hobbs.

Deax Srn—The East Tennessee Normal Institute for colored 
teachers closed this afternoon with an address from Senator 
Case. After we opened the institute we concluded that the 
fewer in number of public addresses we had the more time the 
teachers would have for private study, hence we have given no 
time to popular addresses except one hour to-day to Mr. Case 
and a few short talks by our County Superintendent at differ 
ent times. Mr. Heywood has given us all the aid his health 
and official duties would permit. We have been fortunate in 
securing the services of Prof: Gill as my associate in the work. 
The institute has continued twelve days with an interest be- .

been devoted partly to instruction and partly to examination.

  TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE. 
NasHvitiy, Trny., Feb. 15, 1885. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—As requested, I submit a partial report of the 
condition of the Tennessee Teachers’ Reading Circle throughout _ 
the State, and “ plan of organization” of the Circles: 
PLAN OF ORGANIZATION—(FROM OFFICIAL CIRCULAR). 
. 1. The management shall be vested in a State Board of Di- 
rectors, five in number, elected annually by the State Teachers’ 
Association from its members, which shall meet as soon as 
possible after its election, and organize by electing a president, 
secretary and treasurer. 
2. It shall furthermore be their duty to make annually to the 
State: Teachers’ Association a report of the condition of the 
Reading Circles throughout the State, and of moneys received 
-and disbursed by it. The State Board of Directors shall pre- 
‘pare and publish annually a course of study, adopt books for 
reading, and exercise a general direction over the work of the 
Reading Circle. 
3. County Circles shall be organized, and their management 
shall be vested in a County Board of Directors, consisting of a 
president and secretary and treasurer, and three other members 
of the County Circle, to be elected annually by the circle. (In 
the formation of County’ Circles for this, the first year, it is 
expected that the County Superintendent will take the initia- 
tive by sending to the State Board of Directors the names of 
six persons qualified to take part in the county organization. 
From these six candidates the State Board of Directors will . 
select four, who, with the County Superintendent, shall consti- 
tute the County. Board, which shall organize %s above).
-P-A-G-E-76

4. The County Board shall receive and distribute the courses 
of study prepared by the State Board; shall promulgate the in-_ 
structions received from time to time from that board ; shall call ” 
quarterly, or oftener, meetings of the County Circle for reviews ° 
’ or discussions, and shall direct the affairs of the County Circle. 
It shall furthermore be the duty of the County Board to report 
to the State Board the names of its officers and members, to 
account for all moneys coming into its hands, and to give at all 
times such information about the County Circle as they may 
desire 
5, Any teacher or other person in the State of Tennessee 
may become a member of the Reading Circle by forwarding his 
name to the County Board of Directors, together with a pledge 
to faithfully pursue the prescribed course of study, and paying 
in advance a fee of fifteen cents, oné-third of which shall be 
“yetained for the expenses of the County Board and the two- 
thirds shall be transmitted to the State Board for its expenses. 
6. The books adopted for the first year’s course of reading 
are: 
Barnes’ General History of the World. 
Page’s Theory and Practice of Teaching, revised edition. . 
Watts’ Improvement of the Mind, revised edition. 
7. The State Board, without requiring it, recommend that 
members of the Reading Circle subscribe for and 004 eoreneT 
educational journals, and especially the Southwester 
Education, published at Nashville, is recommende 
is the adopted organ of the Tennessee Teachers’ Re: 
and State Teachers’ Association, and is a valuable 7 
teacher. It will, in the future, contain outlines ai 
the course of reading prepared under the superv 
State Board. 
8. The State Superintendent of Public Instruc 
that membership in the Reading Circle, and comy 
courses of reading, shall be recognized in the fu 
teachers’ certificates, issued by County Superintenc 
9. The State Board of Directors earnestly hc 
County Superintendents will assist it promptly in th 
of a County Board, as mentioned in section 3, an

PLEDGE. 
I hereby engage to ‘entér upon and faithfully pursue the course 
of reading, as outlined by the Board of Directors of the Ten- 
nessee Teachers’ Reading Circle. : 
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION, 
Recognizing the great good that could be accomplished by such 
an agency as the Reading Circle, at its meeting, October 5, 1885, 
Gov. Wm. B. Bate presiding, passed the following: 
.Wuergas, The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association, at its 
last session at Jonesboro, organized a State Teachers’ Reading 
Circle, by the election of a Board of Directors; and, 
‘Wuernas, We recognize the great advantage of such an 
organization to the teachers of the State by affording them 
opportunities of becoming better informed in regard ,to their 
work; therefore, 
Be it resolved by the State Board of Education, That we do most 
heartily indorse this action of the State Teacher’s Association, 
and do most earnestly recommend to the teachers of the State 
the importance of such a Reading Circle, and.the advantages 
thereof. 
The following counties have organized under the above plan : 
Washington, Hardin, Marshall, Campbell, Greene, Fayette, Law- 
rence, White, Robertson, Anderson, Henry, Sullivan, Monroe, 
Madison, Loudon, Davidson, Grundy, Cumberland, Shelby, 
- Obion, Van Buren, Bedford, Hamilton, Benton, Hamblen, 
Union, Blount, Polk, Stewart, Sevier, Coffee, Knox, Hancock, 
Carroll, Roane. Several more are being organized. 
The State Board of Directors consider cities with a regularly 
_ organized system of schools as counties, and they have organi- 
zations of their own similar to that of counties, except that the 
Board of Directors consists of three instead of five members. 
The following cities have organized: Nashville, Jackson, Union 
City..
-P-A-G-E-78

The Board is preparing a careful report of the Circle, which 
will soon be ready. It is estimated that about one thousand’ 
teachers are members, and reading thé course prescribed. .. 
The Board of Directors publishes every month, in the South- 
western Journal of Education at Nashville, outlines for the assist- 
ance and guidance of teachers. ,

CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
Is ‘gradually growing less in all of the best schools of the land. 
The steady pressure of the best teachers is against the use of 
the rod, Milder measures are found to he quite as efficient, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
86 
The Board of Education of this city have abolished corporal 
punishment, and after a trial of many months the result is very — 
satisfactory. The question may arise in the minds of some: 
“ What have they instituted instead?’ When a pupil disobeys, 
he is sent to the office of the Superintendent, and if the nature 
of the misconduct is sufficient to justify, the refractory one is 
sent home with a note stating.the disobedience. The parent 
must write a note, or go and see the Superintendent. When a 
pupil has been sent home the second time, my experience is, he 
is generally cured, . 
Tdo not claim this will work well everywhere, but it works 
like a charm here. 
EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT. 
During the month of November last an exhibit of the work 
done in our schools was prepared and sent to New Orleans, La., 
and theré placed on exhibition in the Educational Department 
of.the-“ World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exhibition.” 
I received a few days ago a “Certificate of Award” from the 
managers of said Exhibition : 
“FOR THE BEST EXAMINATION PAPERS.” 
AWARDED TO : 
~ The Jackson City Schools, 
Jacxson, TENN, 
PEABODY MEDAL. 
The Peabody Medal received last year was awarded Miss 
Elizabeth Susan Brown. 
The Jackson City Schools have come to stay.

The scholastic enumeration, as reported, is 806 greater than 
that for the preceding year. This is a much more rapid ratio’ 
of increase than has occurred for several years, and taken in 
connection with the fact that there has not been a proportion- 
ately larger enrollment of pupils, a doubt is suggested as to its 
accuracy. The latter discrepancy, however, may be attributable to 
the want of sufficient school accommodations for all applicants. 
' Of the total enumeration, 9,829 were white children, and 5,487 
. colored, while of the total enrollment, there were of the former 
_ 4,983, and of the latter 2,072. In other words, the per cent. of 
enrollment on enumeration was for the white schools 59 and for 
the colored 42. As the pressure for additional seats was not so 
great in the white as in the colored schools, this comparison 
may be somewhat unjust to the latter. We, therefore, institute 
another on a different basis. There were 3,987, or 41 per cent. 
of white and 1,617, or 32 per cent. of colored pupils in attend- 
ance, on the basis of enumeration: This goes to show a want 
of appreciation of the advantages offered on the part of the 
latter class of population, and offers so far, a statistical excuse 
for the apparent tardiness of the city authorities in providing 
seating capacity for all who clamor for it at the opening of each 
session. The school registers will show from year to year that
-P-A-G-E-95
95 
of those admitted the habit of many is to fall out again, thus 
making it difficult to preserve intact the organization of classes. 
This disintegration would be more serious than it has been 
‘were it not that teachers are directed to keep lists of those re- 
fused admission, so that they may be given seats whenever thus 
vacated. This keeps a constant pressure on those attending 
for fear they will be permanently excluded. — 
That this and other causes have conspired to induce a healthy 
. progress in the right direction is evident, when we state that 
ten years ago the per cent. of attendance on enrollment was 76 
in white schools and 63 in colored, whereas now the former is 
79 and the latter 78. 
From the comparative and aggregate tables it will be seen 
that the per cent. of attendance on number belonging is 0.07 
higher this year than last, and the per cent. of tardiness is the 
same that it was. 
From the same tables it will appear that the total cost per 
pupil is $14.73 or 23 cents less than for last year.

“There were past due accounts unpaid at the close of the year 
amounting to $270.25, which would leave the true balance on 
hand $21,473.71. The total cost of tuition this year was $71,- 
895.55, against $66,182.10 last year, and the total incidental ex- 
penses $14,857.59, against $20,755.32, making the annual cost 
$1,184.28 less than for last year. 
The saving in incidental expenses results chiefly ‘from, the 
smaller amount expended for permanent improvements on build- 
ings, and the increase in cost of tuition partly from the addi- 
tion of five members to the corps of teachers and partly to the 
. inerease of salaries in responsible places. 
The conditions under which the schools have been operated 
during the past two years have been so nearly identical that 
very few changes in results are to be recorded. Externally 
there have been this year fewer interruptions from such causes 
as inclement weather, floods and contagious diseases. 
While the former course of study has been observed, with no 
change in text-books except Readers, the same corps of teachers 
were re-elected, and with but one or two exceptions have con- 
tinued in charge during the session. 
It is not, therefore, surprising that as the foregoing compar- 
ative facts and statistics show, the tesults have been very nearly 
identical with those attained last year. 
The feature most likely to attract the attention of the gen-
-P-A-G-E-97
97 
eral observer is the improvement in the appearance of the 
school buildings, the largest of- which have been recently rée- 
painted, and now compare favorably with the most elegant edi- 
fices in the city. Respectfully,

COUNTY SUPRRINTENDENTS REPORTS ‘ 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
J. P. Morvon, SupzRinrenpEnt, Andersonville, 
We are unable to present a full report because of the neglect 
of the Directors. We found in the beginning of this year (1885) 
confusion in text-books. We now have a series of books 
adopted instead of the multiplicity of kinds, many of which 
had become chronic and stale. The schools that are using these 
books are doing well. 
We had a Normal School for the teachers, which was well 
attended, the results of which are seen throughout the county. 
We were also favored with a State Normal Institute, conducted 
by Profs. F. M. Smith, T. C. Karnes and yourself. The insti- 
tute has been already prolific of good, and the principles are | 
yet among us. We would welcome another institute of the 
kind. We are working for a higher standard of education in 
our county, and all seem to be more interested than in any pre- 
vious year. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
J. H. Auuen, SupERINTENDENT, Shelbyville. 
The school work of this county, for the year just ending, has 
been pleasant, progressive and crowned with gratifying results, 
Very few of our schools have failed to give a reasonable degree 
of satisfaction and evidences of success. I have given my time 
and energy to the work, and now acknowledge, with thanks
-P-A-G-E-99
99 
and feelings of sincere gratitude, the ready assistance given by 
directors, teachers of both public and private schools and the 
friends of education generally, . 
‘Your ruling on the “ Grades of Qualification ” took a job out 
of the hands of our directors and proved beneficial to our schools. 
Most of our teachers are reading good educational works, 
were regular attendants at the “Institute,” and are patient 
séekers of other means of improving their efficiency and influ- 
encé for good. The “coming teacher” has come to many of 
the schools of Bedford county, and the hope of seeing our chil- 
dren under the management of trained, energetic and conscien- 
tious teachers is ending in reality. 
Directors, with few exceptions, are attending to their duties 
“in an efficient and business-like manner. That they are not 
visiting schools as they might, is true; that they are not always 
as careful in employing teachers as they shonld be, is true; yet, 
they are manifesting as great an interest and doing as much for 
public good as could be expected under existing circumstances. 
The institute held in Shelbyville the last weeks of June gave 
me more encouragement and greater satisfaction fhan any other 
. one thing connected with my official experience. The general 
class-work plan was carried out. From first to last the interest 
was more general and intense, the work more pleasant, practical 
and profitable, than we have ever seen on such occasions before. 
Not a wave of discontent was visible in any quarter. No note 
of discord or dissatisfaction was heard. We expect a repetition 
with improvements in quantity and quality, next June. 
. ‘Every’ school, I suppose, has been visited since the date of 
last year’s report. Many of them have been visited twice. I 
_ have made 182 visits, in addition to those of my predecessor 
during the first six months of the scholastic year. 
“Other items of which I might write have changed so little 
since last year’s report that I consider it unnecessary to tax 
your space, time and patience further.

great improvement in the school interest here—teachers better 
prepared. Some have attended normal schools, others are tak- 
ing items from them, consequently when we meet in the county 
institute there is an opportunity for young teachers to make 
improvement, though I yet think we should have more local 
normal schools, as some are not able to bear the expense of 
attending schools at a great distance, and the cheap teacher is 
still looked for by some instead of the good, practical teacher, 
though directors are generally our best men (I always appoint 
that kind when left to mé), and they are waking up, as. they 
cannot help to see that as the teacher is, so is the school ; and then 
I find the masses are taking more interest in the schools, espe- 
cially where there isa live teacher in the school-room, he gen- 
erally infuses interest among the patrons. And then our County. 
Court, which is composed mostly of judicious men, and a ma- 
jority of whom’ are in favor of a five months school, say that 
they will make it that long before another twelve months, and 
would have done so this year if it had not been for other local 
taxes, which will pass away with this year. Iam glad to see 
that the masses are waking up on that subject. I am still look- 
ing forward for a brighter day in the future, when al] will gladly 
receive the benefits of a free education. : 
  
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
T. F. Hane, Supzrinrenvent, Pikeville. 
© 
The schools of Bledsoe county are doing very well, except 
the patrons, in many places, do not keep their children regu- 
larly in school. While the number enrolled this year is much 
larger than last, yet the daily attendance is not any better. 
We have this year some very young teachers, who have done 
very well; in many instances they have excelled some older 
ones. 
}   
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
A. M. Gamoue, Supsrintenpent, Maryville. 
We are still improving, but very slowly. The people are
-P-A-G-E-101
101 
taking more than usual interest in ourcommonschools. Many 
of our District Boards have visited their schools from time to 
time—something new in this county. Our directors are in favor 
of paying better wages, but without regard to qualification. 
They seem to think the time of one teacher worth as much as 
that of another. , 
Our institutes have not been so well attended this year, but 
those who attended have taken a more lively interest. 
I tried twice or three times to get the colored teachers together 
_for the purpose of organizing a colored teachers’ institute, but 
failed. . . 
The greatest want with most of our teachers is a knowledge 
of the art of teaching. 
In nfy school visitations I take notes on manner of hearing 
ditferent classes, order in school, class-drill, ete. These notes I 
publish in our cgunty paper under head of “School Notes.” 
Though this has given offense to some parties, I am persuaded 
it does considerable good. 
  
. BRADLEY COUNTY. 
M. R. M. Burks, Supsrinrenpent, Chatata. 
I find great difficulty in getting correct reports in time to 
make my report by October. I believe if the law was so 
amended to have the directors report to Superintendent by 
July 15, it would be much better; also to require teachers to 
return abstracts to Superintendent at the close of session, and 
have the Superintendent sign last order of teacher, thereby in- 
suring abstract reports before the teacher receives his pay.. 
‘Another difficulty is, when another trustee is elected, he does 
not receive the books until first of September, and the Superin- 
tendent.is required to make his report from July Ist. He is, 
therefore, compelled to get reports from both trustees. . 
_» The scholastic part of this report is correct, the remainder is 
‘the best that can be given from papers in my office. The edu- — 
cational interest in this county is on the increase. The County 
Court last April made an appropriation of $75. to meet the ex- 
fa normal school to better qualify the teachers. Three   
-P-A-G-E-102
102 
weeks were given to the whites and one week. to the colored. 
I procured the services of Mr. Wilford Calkins, A. M., professor 
of Greek and Latin in the East Tennessee Wesleyan University, 
as principal teacher. About fifty-six white teachers were: in 
attendance. New life was infused, and the school was a success. 
In May we readopted the course of text-books adopted four 
years ago. There is greater uniformity at present- than ever 
before. I ar visiting other different districts, and holding edu- 
cational meetings each week, and agitating the question of 
building suitable houses. Already there are four being erected, 
and plans are being perfected for others. The city ‘of Cleve- 
land has just completed their public building at a cost of 
$10,000. I think during the coming year quite a number 
will be built. I believe our houses should be well located, prop- 
erly furnished, and have our schools begin first of November. 
At present our schools are well attended about two months, 
and thén the busy season comes they decline, and are never 
again what they should be. To be. successful we must have 
good houses, properly located, well furnished, live, ener- 
getic teachers and directors, who take an interest in education. 
In July we. organized a Teacher’s Association, which meets 
from time to time for the purpose of discussing questions per- 
taining to our educational work. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
W. J. McGzx, Supgrinrenpent, Wellspring. 
_In making this my first annual report, it gives me satisfaction 
to state that the schools all over old Campbell county are in 
good running order. Our schools commenced, sixteen of them, 
July 6, as the children could attend in warm weather, and as 
our houses in some places, especially in the rural districts, are 
not very good. Our County Court levied a good school tax, 
say 25 cents on the $100 on property and $1 on potls. This 
made the largest school tax that ever was in this county. The 
best teachers were hired; the schools will run, say five months 
each. Our county. is so divided that each school district will 
have the same time taught. The school-houses are tolerably
-P-A-G-E-103
108 
good. .At this writing one good house is going up for a high 
school; this will make four consolidated schdols. I have held 
nine teachers’ institutes, or teachers’ meetings, of two days 
each, with good success, and were well attended both by teachers 
and school patrons. 
The schools all over our county are well attended; some have 
a regular attendance of 80 per cent., and the schools will aver- 
age 65 per cent. I have visited all the schools. I visited twoa 
day, so I would have two to four hours to spend in each school. 
I made a speech to each school. I notice one thing in my school 
vjsits—that those teachers who love to attend institutes and 
read educational. journals are teaching school, while those 
teachers that do not are only keeping school. My aim next 
year shall be to get all the schools run by teachers, and let 
Keepers do something else for a living. SN, 
As I do not know how the schools were cow tas ‘yeahapd the 
trustee is very sick, I only report what F- yw as County 4 : 
perintendent of this year. I learn that “there is some monty, 
on hand; will say that I can only report, win J Je Henow, hope’! ie :

  8. E. Tucker, SuPERINTENDENT, Cast. 
T have the honor of submitting to you my third annual report 
. of the schools of Carroll county, Tennessee. 
Our financial condition is good—over $7,000 in the treasury 
and. only two districts in debt $100 or $200. Our directors do 
_not allow the schools to run in debt, which isright. Our trustee 
attends to business promptly in every respect. Our directors 
are interested in the success of our schools. They work ~ 
promptly.and diligently. Nearly every school of the ninety 
that were taught this summer has been visited by some one of 
the directors. They have built six new frame houses, of which 
two are nice academies, and have supplied over a dozen houses 
with good desks. They encourage our teachers, and pay them 
liberal: prices, always considering their qualifications and the 
work to-be done, The prices range from $20 for 2d grade cer-

tificates to $75 for the best teachers, the average being $27.93, a — 
gain over last report of 51 cents. : 
They have aided and about persuaded all to .get the adopted 
series of text-books (adopted in 1882), which aid i in classifics- 
tion, uniformity and harmony. . 
All our financial success is due to our County Court. “They 
have increased the tax to 15 cents on property and $2 on the. 
poll. The majority of the people are now in favor of more than. - 
this. The pro rata to each scholar for. this year is $2.10, a gain’ 
of 60 cents on last year. / - 
Our teachers have made rapid progress. I cannot perceive 
why any legislature would add non-essential branches, such as 
geology, and leave off more important one, as physiology:and - 
book-keeping. The better class of teachers, and in fact nearly 
all, nomeome ap. promptly to the public examination, and give

Our higher institutions are doing a great work for our county. 
These schools, for the closing year, continued ten months—one 
at Huntington, three at McKenzie, one at Trezevant, Atwood 
and Macedonia Academy. At the above-named places schools 
are ow in session (October) for ten months, and also at Hollow 
Rock Seminary, Buena Vista Academy, Williams Chapel and 
and Clarksburg Academy. 
In conclusion, I will say I presume this will be my last report 
of schools, but I shall ever be interested in the advancement, 
elevation, and education of not only our county and State but 
of all.

CARTER COUNTY. 
A. J. F. Hyper, Superinrenpent, Hyder. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report. It 
has been impossible to get a full and accurate report from all 
the directors. The report, however, is nearly correct. On 
coming into office last January I visited and examined nearly 
all the school-houses in the county, and recomriended such ~ 
buildings and repairs as I thought essential to the success of 
the schools and the comfort of the children, which advice, in 
_ many instances, has been taken. New school-houses are now in 
process of erection in many parts of thé county, while the old 
ones are being made more comfortable and attractive. On ac- 
count of the meagerness of our school fund the directors are 
obliged to pay small salaries. This has caused many of our 
best teachers to seek more remunerative fields, or go out of the 
profession entirely, to the great injury of education in our county. 
  
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
R. 8. Turner, Suprrmrenpent, Ashland City. 
I have the honor to render a partial report for the year ending 
June 80, 1885. It is to be regretted that the health of the Su- 
perintendent was so poor as to confine him to his room from 
_ early spring till his death, carly in December. It is impossible 
now to make a true report, and as I feel a true and earnest in- 
terest in this work I will send nothing but actual facts and fig- 
ures: 
‘Considering the amount of wealth in our county I think it is 
doirig a fair portion of work in the direction of public schools. 
We h wwe two excellent high schools in our county, run all the 
year—Ashland Institute here, Prof. B. H. Malone, principal, 
and Pleasant View High School, at Pleasant View, Prof. Wm. 
Harper, principal. These schools have good buildings and able 
faculties. They are classical and practical, uniting public funds 
and private subscription for tuition. — . 
Our schools are now out generally and teachers scattered,
-P-A-G-E-106

hence J cannot get abstracts of their schools, also I find the re- 
ports from the districts notin shape. I will endeavor to get-up 
a minute and true statement of the matter next time. 
  
CHESTER COUNTY. 
W. A. Ross, SupeRINTENDENT, Henderson. 
In submitting this, my first annual report, it gives pleasure to 
state that our public schools are in a prosperous condition. 7 
Our teachers are doing all in their power to make their 
schools first-class. Four of them hold certificates for five years, 
and more than half of them hold first grade. 
In the last twelve months there have been several good houses 
erected, both public and private. 
We had this year a five days’ institute, conducted on the plan 
of general class-work. We had quite an interesting time. All 
the teachers in the county were present. : 
I have visited all the schools in the county, lecturing at night, 
and by this means have created quite an interest in public 
schools. Where the teachers have been selected with sole regard 
to capacity to teach, the schools are doing well. 
Our financial condition is good; our directors do not allow 
our schools to run in debt. We hope the County Court will levy 
a greater tax for school purposes, and allow our schools to run 
on longer time. 
I catled a convention composed of delegates from each dis- 
trict, and adopted a series of text-books to run six years, which 
has been adopted throughout the county, and is giving general 
satisfaction. : . 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
G. 8. Mayzs, Supzrinrenpent, Bacchus. 
L herewith transmit my annual report. I have visited most 
all of the schools of Claiborne, and find them in a prosperous 
condition, under good control, and all of the teachers seem to 
be enthusiastic, and each try to excel,
-P-A-G-E-107
107 
Our schools are doing exceedingly good work. I think the 
time is not far distant when Claiborne will rank with the best 
of counties as to the educational work. It is my opinion that 
next January our County Court will levy a tax sufficient to run 
our schools from five to seven months. I have seen some of 
the magistrates, and they all seem to be anxious that the schogls 
shall run longer. I find a great many parents who are awake 
as to the importance of ‘education, and seem to be enthusiastic 
as to educating their children. I think with the right energy 
used in this county, the public school system will far excel what 
itis at present.. There is a decided improvement in the schools 
already. If we could only receive some assistance, or the ben- 
efit of the State Normals, our teachers would be able to do 
more efficient. work, but the State Normals are always held in 
some other county, and our county being a back county, and 
no railroad or convenient conveyance, we are deprived of its 
benefit.   
CLAY COUNTY. 
W. L. Brown, SurERintenvent, Celina. 
Inclosed find my report for the year ending June 80, 1885, 
which, I believe, is very near correct. Our public schools for 
the last year have been in a great measure a success. We have 
had,a better grade of experienced teachers employed, and as a 
consequence have had better schools. The directors and the 
people have dé last awakened to and become convinced of the 
fact tha: in order to make our public schools a success we are 
necessarily compelled to employ well-qualified and experienced | 
teachers, and consequently the belief that one man can teach . 
and govern a school as well as another has about died out. But. 
notwithstanding the improvements which our public schools 
have undergone, I find that there is one great deficiency on the 
part of a number of the ‘patrons, and that is the non-attendance 
of the p orer class of pupils on account of their parents failing 
to mani‘est a proper amount of interest in their behalf. —

COFFEE COUNTY. 
  C. N. Townsenn, Superintenpent, Manchester... .:. 
Inclosed you will find my annual report of the schoolg for 
Coffee county for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1885. - It 
is with regret that I submit to you an imperfect report, which 
could and would have been otherwise had the trustees’ Teport 
been made. . 
Tam very glad to report our schools in good condition, with | 
their future prospects brightening. Our schools are not what 
they ought to be, but with the small amount of revenue ex- 
pended for school purposes I am inclined to believe that: they 
have done exceedingly well, and have steadily grown into pop- 
ular favor.. There has been considerable improvement in the 
school-work in this county during the past year. A great many 
of our teachers appear ta be aware of the fact that the pros- 
perity of our county and State depends largely on the work done 
by them in ‘our public schools throughout the State, and have 
availed themselves of every opportunity offered to improve 
themselves in the art of teaching, etc. : 
While my report shows a lack of interest on the part of some 
teachers in. our “County Teachers’ Institute,” yet it has done 
much to arouse an interest’ with teachers and to create a public- 
sentiment favorable to a popular system of education. I am 
inclined to the belief that no teacher should be permitted to 
teach a public school unless he or she attends these institutes a 
reasonable number of times during each year. 
By way of closing this report permit me to congratulate you 
on your noble work as State Superintendent in the cause of ed- 
ucation during this and other years through which you have 
labored most earnestly and successfully. 1 trust you may find 
it necessary and practicable to hold an institute in our county 
some time during next year.

county for the year ending June 80, 1885. The Superintendent 
who was elected last January resigned in July, leaving almost 
the whole year’s work to be done. 
In visiting the schools of this county, I have carefully noted 
the “general condition and management of our public schools, 
and, after a critical review of facts, am prepared to say that 
the schools, as a general thing, are progressing fairly, consider- 
ing the disadvantages under which many of them labor. One 
great obstacle in the way is the lack of suitable hotses and ap- 
paratus.. Another great drawback is that every man wants a 
public school at his own door. We are trying to support too 
many schools to the square mile for many of them to prosper. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
A. A. Mituarp, Superintenpent, Grassy Cove. 
My report is rather late. While I have not realized during 
the last scholastic year ali that I hoped for and expected, [ 
should, I suppose, to a great degree be satisfied with the educa- 
_' tional progress and results of the public schools in my county. 
The most of our schools are normal in method, and are excel- 
lent. The standard of schools and the educational interests of 
the county have been elevated considerably by institute work. 
I, in connection with Prof. Silsby, of Grassy Cove Academy, 
held a county institute at Crossville, which was largely attend- 
ed, and a great interest manifested by teachers. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
. W. H. Ferrint, Superinrenpent, Nashville. 
I have the honor of transmitting to you the annual report 
from Davidson county for scholastic year ending June 30, 1885. 
It affords me great pleasure to report the progress made, not © 
only in the school-room, but in the erection of six handsome 
school-houses, the repairing of many others, and also tilling . 
them with beatitiful desks and comfortable.sests, which, I think,
-P-A-G-E-110
110 
added very materially to our success for the past year. A large 
amount of the expenses was defrayed by private subscription. — 
By reference to the statistical part of this report, you will 
find an increased enrollment of 1,056, and daily attendanee of 
1,009. The increase in daily attendance is 366 for the white, 
and 648 for the colored schools, which shows that the colored 
people are arousing to a sense of duty. The outlook for. this 
year far exceeds that of any previous year. Much good has 
arisen from our inétitutes which were held during July.;. 
our annual examination it was easily ascertained what eiere 
-attended the institute by their readiness to answer almost'any 
question. We have monthly institute meetings, which are at- 
tended by most of our best teachers. We have also organized 
“ Reading Circle” for our mutual improvement. Our teach- 
ers are more deficient in teaching “reading” than any b branch 
of study. 
There is also a lack of discipline i in some of our schools. If 
these two evils are eradicated (and we are laboring for it, dis- 
cussing it, and lecturing teachers and pupils wherever it is being 
neglected), I think ours will compare favorably with any schools 
in the South. The most of our teachers are ladies and gentle- 
men of culture and of high moral standing. They have done 
very efficient work, and will not receive their full pay for ser- 
vices rendered till their labors on earth are ended, and they 
received into the Great School-house above, and hear from their 
teacher, “ well done.” : 
T cannot close without returning to you and Col 
dale many thanks for favors received at your har. 
kind directors for valuable assistance in maintain 
ing our schools to a position second to none.

W. H. H. McMitzan, Supsrintenpent, Decaturville. 
I herewith submit my annual report, and am pleased to say 
that we are making some progress. School tax on property 
same as last year-—18 cents, added to the 10 levied by the State, 
makes 28 cents. 
Several items in this report are estimated from last year’s re- 
port. Many of the teachers never return their abstracts, and 
consequently I cannot make a correct report. If the law’ re- 
quiring the signature of County Superintendents on all warrants 
issued for school funds in their respective counties was re- 
enacted, it would greatly facilitate the making of reports, and, 
I think, in many other ways advance the school interests of the 
State.

A. L. Maton, SupeRiIntenpDent, Alexandria. 
I have the honor of sending you my first annual report of 
the schools of DeKalb county. It is much delayed on account 
of not getting in my reports from the district clerks. I have 
made a strong effort to get a correct report, and I think I have 
succeeded. The schools have been very: short this fall, owing 
to their being in debt, and in some districts had no schools. 
But ‘now every school is out of debt, and I aia sure next fall we 
will have much better schools than we have ever had in the 
county. More interest is now being manifested than ever be- 
fore. Our institutes in the different parts of the county have 
done great good.

The law requiring County Superintendents to appr:

in visiting the schools. I have visited every school in th ' 
once and about nine-tenths of them twice, and I | 
deavored to impress upon the minds of the teachers a: 
the necessity and advantages of an education. I founc | 
the teachers doing their work thoroughly, and guite a

I have held throughout the year my regular quarterly teach- 
‘ers’ institutes. Patrons and pupils of the schools have always 
attended them, and manifested great interest in our efforts to 
improve our schools. <A session of the State Institute was 
given us at our county seat by the State Superintendent at the 
request and invitation of the-County Court of Dyer and the 
people of Dyersburg. There was never such an educational 
awakening in, our section as was witnessed during that occasion. 
‘The exercises of the institute were held in the capacious Meth- 
-odist church. Throughout the entire week immense crowds 
filled the church night and day, sometimes to overflowing. The 
exercises were exceedingly interesting and beneficial. Profs. F. 
M. Smith and A. P. Bourland were the instructors sent us by 
the State Superintendent, and they succeeded most admirably 
’ in making the meeting a grand success. The essays and music 
furnished by home talent was pronounced by good critics in- 
comparable. The masterly efforts of the State Superintendent 
in behalf of common schools was, allow me to say, the crown- 
ing event of the week. "Many pronounced it the finest effort 
and argument they had ever listened to. Its effects were seen 
long after the adjournment of the institute. Dyersburg set to 
work at once to increase her educational facilities by erecting a 
$15,000 new college building. The contract is out, the con- 
tractors at work and making rapid progress. When completed, 
the building will be a model of architectural beauty, and at the 
same time perfectly lighted and ventilated, perfectly adapted 
for a school of four hundred pupils. The plans are mostly 
those of that eminent physician and scientist, Dr. J. D. Smith, 
of Dyersburg, whose lecture at the State Norma] Institute con- 
tributed so much to the interest of the occasion. 
Dyersburg is not alone in this forward educational movement. 
Our sister town of Newbern has her face to the Hast also. Prof. 
J. H. Peay had in his seminary at that place the past year up- | 
wards of three hundred pupils. His school is popular, and his 
administration satisfactory to the people for whom he labors. .

had been my purpose to devise a scheme of common school 
graduation like to that devised by Superintendent Wade, of 
West Virginia; but before perfecting my plans I have been 
called to other fields—the superintendency of the Indian Gov- 
ernment Schools on Sisseton Reservation, Dak. Ter. My office

county is well supplied with good, comfortable school-houses. 
I have visited the schools throughout the county during this 
summer and fall and I believe I did not find a family more than 
two miles from a good school-house, I think we have as many 
houses now as we need, more would actually be a disadvantage. 
The tendency to disintegration requires a constant check, every 
man would have a school-house at the back of his field. 
We have a better force of teachers now than we have ever 
had before. I have held institutes about over the county. I 
have endeavored to induce patrons, and directors especially, to 
attend these Teachers’ Conventions, and I have succeeded rea- 
sonably well. Iam convinced that the way to get rid of fogy 
teachers, who merely keep school, is to destroy the demand for 
them." 
If the directors of the respective schools are properly edu- 
cated they will not employ such teachers, and if the patrons are 
introduced to the best methods of practical teachers they will 
not tolerate fogyism. I try to impress upon the teachers of the 
county. the importance of reading good school journals, of pro- 
viding themselves with a teacher’s library and of keeping them- 
selves conversant with the most improved methods. I require 
every candidate to stand a satisfactory examination, especially 
on the Theory and Practice of Teaching, before I grant him 
license to teach. . 
‘During my visits to the schools, by observing the internal 
working of the various schools of the county, I find that ten- . 
dency’ to disintegration before mentioned existing within the 
schools. A tendency on the part of classes to divide and sub- 
divide ad infinitum. All system or organization is destroyed. 
Irregularity of attendance, a disposition to drag and the want 
of a regular graded system, favors a constant increase of classes 
till teaching becomes so complicated that the teacher cannot im- 
provise a programme even for one day’s work. I brought this 
question before the last meeting pf the Board of School Di- , 
rectors, and a committee was appointed with a view of ar- 
ranging a regular graded public school course, and I hope when- 
I make my next annual repors to be able to say that Gibson. 
county has a thoroughly graded system of public schools.

Our County Court has been quite liberal in its provisions fir / 
the schools. . , 
Our directors hold quarterly meetings now, at which every 
school in the county is represented, and the attention of the 
court is promptly called to the various wants and defects of the 
schools. Our people are beginning to realize that it is poor. 
economy to employ the cheapest anybody to teach. There is a 
growing demand for enterprising, progressive, thorough teach- 
_ ers, and a disposition to procure the services of such teachers at 
an increased salary, even if the public money has to be supple- 
. mented by a private fund. 
The people are aroused; they are beginning to recognize the 
value of a good, practical education, and to learn that they 
must look to the public school system alone to furnish it. 
Children feel the warm enthusiasm of parents, teachers are en- 
couraged. Good schools are the pride of the communities that 
‘support them. The current of public opinion flows in the right . 
direction; the outlook for the future is hopeful.

GILES COUNTY. 
H. G. Apernatuy, Superinrenpent, Pulaski. 
I hereby transmit to you my first annual report of the public 
schools of Giles county. Failure on the part of many teachers 
to return abstracts and directors and trustee to make their re- 
- ports, has delayed my report to you. 
The public schools of our county are in a healthy condition, 
and the public sentiment is growing favoring them. As an evi- 
dence of it our County Court levied for this year an additional 
tax of 10 cents for school purposes. This will enable us to run 
our schools six months. In the absence of a teachers’ associa- 
tion or normal institute for, four years past, teachers that could 
not originate methods were in the old ruts in teaching, but they 
promptly and liberally responded to our late institute, and the 
result is: ‘The interchange of ideas, the introduction of new, 
methods of teaching, and the adoption of a uniform series o:
-P-A-G-E-117
117 
text-books for our county has made a decided improvement in 
our schools. 
. In visiting the schools of our county, I have been careful to 
see that the school-houses were comfortably seated and the 
teachers supplied with the necessary school apparatus to teach 
the branches of study required in the public schools. Our di- 
rectors are fully awake to the necessity of consolidating the 
schools; that is, having fewer schools, longer terms, and employ- 
ing first grade professional teachers when they can be had. ~

humble teacher, and as a friend to true education, onward pro- 
gress and Christian civilization. I have been trying for eight

“labored most diligently to make a useful and an honorable 
one-how well, time will tell. 
The schools of Greene county are in good condition. I 
speak in a comparative sense. Wish they were better. Wes 
may need a compulsory law; but I think not. An appreciative 
‘one, written in the hearts of those whom the public school ays-

tem is designed to benefit, would be better. Our present system. 
of schools could, in my opinion, be much improved, but much ° 
more good would be accomplished by it as it is, if-selfishness - 
' were not, in many respects, the motive power that moves the 
will, This is a part of the dark side. One earnest director 
says they are all directors and many county superintendents in 
his district. Another says, all but three. There may be none, 
save name, in some. Our directors are, many of them, the best 
men in this county. They strive to do “the greatest good to 
the greatest number.’ Success attends their efforts. By, the 
hearty co-operation of all who desire the rising generation to 
be wiser and better than we, our schools will continue to be a8 
they have been, productive of much good. 
Our teachers are. alive. We have organized the Greene 
County Normal Institute. . Our first meeting will be held the

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
“J.B. Cox, Surerintenpant, Russellville. 
I transmit to you my first annual report, which is correct, ex- 
cepting the points indicated, which are approximately so. 
I am a little late, a few days, in making this report, owing to 
sickness, and I wanted to visit all my schools before sending, 
which I have done with one exception; have visited many of 
them twice and some three times. I am glad to note a consid- 
erable improvement in the grade of both teachers and schools. 
I am striving to elevate the grade of teachers as well as schools. 
- We held a normal institute in July, quite to the satisfaction of 
all present, which most of the teachers attended. I promised 
those who did not attend that I would make their examinations 
a little more. “interesting” for them, which I assure you I did. 
By the time our next normal meets, I feel sure they will be 
ready to attend. I have positively refused to duplicate certiti- 
cates, for I do not believe it to be a good plan. It means little 
work and no improvement on the part of the teachers. 
We are holding institutes in every part of the county as you 
direct. At every meeting I find wide-awake, progressive teach- 
ers, Some do not attend at all; we shall try to work them in 
next year. : : 
You will pardon me for presuming to say that we have, I be- 
lieve, in this county, some as good teachers as any county in 
East Tennessee, and those, too, who stand by me in. working 
up the school interest. In our institutes we endeavor to get the 
people to attend, feeling that there is where the public school’s 
success depends. If they cannot come in the day, we hold 
night sessions, discuss such subjects as interest them, and have 
them take part in the discussions. 
In visiting the schools I visit the people, and, when conven- 
ient,:have them go with me to the schools. I speak to them of
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 
the schools as being their interest. Bometimes I find it neces- 
sary for me to stay all day with the teacher and assist hith in’. 
better organizing. The necessity of this arises from the multi- 
plicity of text-books with which they are forced ‘to deal. I 
most respectfully suggest that you request our Legislature to 
give us some law by which we.can have a uniformity, at least, ° 
in each county, which I believe to be preferable to, having it 
over the State. 
Allow me to suggest that T think the directors should be re- 
munerated for their sservices, and then required to perform 
them: The amount allowed per capita for enumerating the 
scholastic population is not sufficient remuneration to justify 
them to give the matter any time and attention. I find the at- 
tendance much smaller than it should be, and would again sug- 
gest that we have some legislation by which the per cent. can. 
be increased, even if -it be compulsory. 
I close this report by saying that County Superintendents 
should be ‘required to approve all orders, as he would thereby 
be enabled to force teachers to return abstracts and thereby aid 
himself in gathering the material necessary to make his report. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
iL B. Herwoop, SUPERINTENDENT, Chattanooga. 
I have the honor to submit herewith my annual statistical 
report for the year 1884-6. The exhibit embraces all items and 
particulars called for, and no pains has been spared to:make the 
same entirely correct. Interest in the schools is increasing. 
_ The average ‘attendance in the State schools was, for 1883-4, 
1,718; for 1884-5, 2,168. About 20 per cent. of this difference 
is due to the fact that a greater number of children were sup- 
‘plied with teachers; the remainder is due to more interest taken 
in education. Our system of grading is working well in nearly 
all the schools; but some difficulty i is encountered occasionally 
in keeping pupils to grade, owing to the fact that in some in-| 
stances’ special branches are insisted upon, to the exclusion of 
others, “The following suggestions are respectfully made;
-P-A-G-E-121
121 
That instructions on abstracts direct teachers to send those 
reports direct to the County Superintendent at the close of the 
school. 
That no applicant be granted a certificate who shall, on ex- 
atnination, fail to attain a minimum grade of 70 in any one of 
the seven branches first named in the school laws. 
That a synopsis of the decisions of the higher courts on the 
school law, and on matters of practice thereto directly related, 
be printed in the next pamphlet edition of said law. 
That liberal provision be made by law for county, institutes. 
That the granting of proper certificates to all pupils who may 
complete the school course be made a part of the school regu- 
lations, and that suitable blanks therefor be distributed by the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
We are yet in the rural districts but indifferently equipped 
in the way of school-houses and their appointments. This state 
of things must in some degree continue until more liberal pro- 
vision is made in behalf of education. Good schools do not 
differ in the least from all other things that minister to the 
. amenities of human existence ; their excellence in like manner, 
as a rule, being referable to their cost. A history of the prog- 
ress of thought as observed in useful thought—products in our 
country for the last half century—would doubtless reflect some 
luster on thought-training, and do much to commend superior 
schools and school systems to the people. It might also induce 
a willingness to expend money more liberally for results so 
desirable. As it is, much stands for what has been expended, 
and the end is not yet. In this great cause there should be no 
halting or relaxation of effort. With a somewhat shifting and 
rapidly increasing population, we may well look to it that the 
educational status and spirit that goes hence—that the seeds 
thereby planted in other States and other lands shall bear fruit 
which shall illustrate a high order of paternity.

G. JARVIS, Supmrrvrenvent, Sneedville. ee 
I have the honvr to transmit to your office a report of thé 
public schools of my county, and truly hope that it may meet- 
your approbation. : 
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
A. J. Coarus, SupERINTENDENT, Bolivar. 
I herewith submit my annual report as Superintendent of 
Public Schools of Hardeman County. 
Our schools are in a good working condition. We have had 
one hundred and thirty in this county during the year, and I 
believe all gave satisfaction. I have held institutes in different 
parts of the county and I find them very interesting and in- 
structive. Iam trying to raise the. standard of teachers and 
have succeeded to a certain extent. I find that issuitig only two 
grades of certificates is working finely. The school interest is 
growing more and more every year in this county. The 
County Superintendent should audit or approve the teachers’ 
warrants before they are paid by the Trustee, and on account | 
of this defect of the law it is utterly. impossible to get the 
teachers to report to the County Superintendent as required 
by law. : 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Wi. J. Watson, SUPERINTENDENT, Savannah. 
T herewith submit my first annual report as Superintendent 
of Hardin county. In some localities of the county I find much 
interest manifested in education, while in others there is but 
little, and that little is confined to a few individuals. There is
-P-A-G-E-123
128 
a good deal of complaint throughout the county that the public 
fund is not large enough; that we had better have none than 
just enough to run our public schools two or three months. It 
is admitted that there is a very great lack of funds, but the 
amount we have would go further were it not divided into so 
many parts. For instance, there are in our county, as shown 
by the report of the directors, 6,474 children, white and colored, 
for the year ending June 30, 1885, and we have eighty school 
districts in the county. Now, suppose we have $1.05 per child, 
that would give us $6,797.70, or about $95 per district, were 
they equally divided. But some of the districts have nearly 
two hundred scholars, while others have less than thirty-five ; 
hence the small amount of money in many of the districts. 
When the people fairly understand this they will certainly rem- 
edy this error by enlarging the small districts, and thereby in- 
creasing the amount of their public fund. 
Instead of visiting the various schools of the county’ this 
year, I have held district institutes in each of the civil districts 
of the county except one, which was consolidated with another 
for the sake of convenience. I have held fifteen of these insti- 
tutes, giving one day to each, and find that where the attend- 
‘ance was. good there was general satisfaction. 
{The Superintendent gives much statistical information, the 
most. of which may be found in appendix]. 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
W. A. Sutrrsy, Superinrenpant, St. Clair. 
Iam glad to say that I think the present the most successful 
year for our schools that Ihave known. Though not by any 
means in the condition to be desired, our schools certainly are 
accomplishing as much as can reasonably be expected under the 
circumstances. As you will see from report herewith submitted, — 
I visited: about three-fourths of the schools in my county—some 
of them oftener'than once—and found them, generally speaking, 
doing very well.

T have some difficulty in trying to enlist the interest:an? -* 
tendance of some of my teachers in our county institutes. 
me this is strange, and yet itistrue. In thinking over the 
ject I have wished that the power of Superintendents wer 
more mandatory character than they are—or than I think 
are. Were this so the difficulty might be overcome. ': / 
I find the study of Elementary Principles of Agriculture not 
at all popular, there being some teachers who have net o7-" 
seen the work, as our merchants do not keep it and we ar: 
the necessity of ordering from a distance. I do not 'k 
its being taught in a single one of our county schools. _ 
HENRY COUNTY. 
W. B. VanCueve, JR., SUPERINTENDENT, Paris. 
In making this, my annual report, I have no ve: 
changes to make on my last year’s report. Our s¢ 
has moved smoothly on, showing a gradual and healt! 
of enrollment and average attendance.

the very best I could. 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
M. J. Parcumen, SupeRIntenvEnt, 'Hrin. 
Our schools are doing well this year. We havea much better 
grade of teachers. Our directors and people are taking more 
interest in schools, and the consequence is, they are on the 
“boom.” Private schools are almost a thing of the past in our 
county. . 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
W. W. Lirron, Supzruvtenpant, Bakerville. 
During the months of July and August I visited nearly all 
the schools in the county, and found them, for the most, doing 
reasonably well. -I think I am safe in saying that the public 
schools of Humphreys county are on a higher plane than ever 
before. Still, we have many imperfections. Our school term 
is entirely too short. All of our school-houses are not yet sup- 
plied with the necessary appliances to impart thorough instruc- 
tion. We have a few teachers in the county that are well 
equipped for their work, and the efforts of a still greater num- 
ber are praiseworthy ; still, one of the many things that we lack 
is trained ability to teach well. This lack of trained ability to 
-teach. is, and has ever been, one of the weak points in the 
- schools of this county. This evil I have endeavored to over- 
come by establishing Teachers’ Institutes, but, as yet, have 
been unsuccessful in the attempt. The teachers who need them 
most will hot attend. However, I expect to approach the scene 
of my former disaster and “try again.”

JAMES COUNTY. 
J. E. Tantanz, SupeRmntenvent, Ooltewah. 
There seems to be a permanent educational interest among - 
the people of James county. I say permanent, not ‘because it 
has reached the masses, but because it is manifested by the most 
influential citizens. We have now reached a point where 
we can advise young men and young women to prepare for 
school workers, assuring them that this work will pay them as 
. mnuch as any business in which they can engage. 
Since my induction into the Superintendent’s office I have 
endeavored to broaden the educational interest in the county. 
I have held public meetings at various points, where the people 
were called together to hear what myself and others had to say 
concerhing the duty of parents towards their children. At 
these meetings we have enforced the thought that the next gen- 
eration cannot prosper in ignorance as this one has done. We 
“could instance several beneficial results from this meetings. We 
have as good teachers as can be procured with our present means, 
but almost every school-house needs better accommodations for 
children. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
G. L. Zinkuz, SupeRINTENDENT, Dandridge. 
I herewith submit my annual report. I regret that Iam not 
able to make a more complete one. 
The schools of our county are being graded as fast as they 
can be supplied with a uniform series of books. We have pre- 
pared a graded course of study, which is being introduced, and 
the schools conducted with more system than ever before.. The 
people are becoming more interested in the subject of educa- 
_ tion, and we now expect to see the work make greater progress 
than ever before. 
We are glad to note that teachers are taking more interest § in 
normal work: We have two normal schools in ‘this county 
this year, with an attendance of forty teachers.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
- TA. Writs, SupERINtENDENT, Mountain City. 
I send you to-day my first annual report-for the year ending 
June 30, 1885. My report is somewhat delayed from no other 
cause but the failure of the teachers and directors to make out 
and return their abstracts. and reports. This indifference on 
. the part of teachers and directors cause a great amount of 
trouble and no little delay. 
The schools of Johnson county are better than common. 
The patrons of our public schools are beginning to be aroused 
to the .proper sense of their duty, and are beginning to see by 
educating people we have better society, and also better. gov- 
ernment, Our graded or high schools are doing well; they 
are being taught by very able and proficient professors; they 
are well patronized by the local patrons, and some from a dis- 
tance. One thing we sadly need in our county is a good nor-- 
mal school conducted by a good normal instructor. I intend 
to use my uttermost endeavors to secure a sufficient amount of — 
funds to conduct a good normal of six weeks next summer. 
One other thing we need to make our schools more efficient, is 
moxe money to lengthen our schools, run then from eight to 
ten months, then we would see far more good coming out of 
our school system. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
James W. Savtor, Superintenpent, Knoxville. 
I herewith submit the annual report of the public schools of 
Knox county for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1885. I 
am very much gratified to state that our teachers are working 
with zeal and the schools are in a very prosperous condition. 
Since my election to the office of Superintendent, I have been 
urging the school directors to employ no teacher who is not’ 
fully in. sympathy with the grading system. Last May we had 
a meeting of the directors and teachers for the purpose of dis- 
.
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 
cussing questions pertaining to the general interest of the free 
schools, in which we urged the importance of having all the 
free schools thoroughly graded; now every district is working} 
under that system, and it proves to be a partial solution to the 
difficult problem: “How to secure the attendance of pupils in 
our free schools.” Most all of our school-houses are neat, ne Ww 
frames, well painted and furnished. with good desks, black- 
boards, charts and outline maps of Geography, and we hav 
uniform system of text-books. Maj. John W. Paulett, 
Knoxville, has done mnch in bringing about this system by n1s 
untiring labor. Our teachers seem to realize the fact that teach- 
ing is a progressive work, and are earnestly laboring each year 
to make themselves more efficient in the same. With a few 
exceptions they are employed according to their qualifications. 
and ability to teach rather than from personal favoritism. In 
a few districts the directors fail to pay their teachers a salary 
sufficient to secure good work. Our financial condition has not 
changed since the last annual report. There should be a tax 
levied sufficient to run our schools at least three months longer 
each year. 
LAKE COUNTY. 
L. Dowanpson, SUPERINTENDENT, Tiptonville. 
I herewith submit my annual report, showing the various 
statistics of my county for the year ending June 80, 1885. 1 
am pleased to say that there has-been an increase in the popula- 
tion and an increase in the average attendance both in the white 
and colored schools since last report, and a decrease in the cost 
of tuition per pupil per month. Have taken some pains to 
‘hold Teachers’ Associations and institutes, and find the result 
‘encouraging beyond my expectations. 
_ Our’ schools ‘have generally been well conducted by good 
“ teachers, and some considerable manifestations of interest have 
been made by the ® patrons and people, showin su their satisfaction

I would suggest that English History be incorporated in the 
list of studies under our public school system, it being inseper=, 
able from the history of our own country. I also suggest that 
-County Superintendents be furnished suitable blanks for the ap- 
pointment of directors, as a great deal of this is required to fill - 
vacancies caused by non-election. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Gzo. W. Younes, Surrrinrenpent, Ripley. 
My report is unavoidably late. Iwas elected Superintendent 
in July, Superintendent Sanford having died in June. It has 
been absolutely impossible for me to get a full report from dis- 
trict directors and teachers. 
, As many others have done, I also offer the suggestion that 
the law be changed so as not to allow teachers to draw money 
until their warrants are approved by the County Superintend- 
ent. Then annual reports could be made much more accurately. 
Our County Court, at its last October term, abolished the 
charge of two dollars for certificates—a much-needed change, I 
| think, © 
My report is far from being full, but under the circumstances 
it is the best that can be done.

By my statistical report, which I sent you some days ago, you wil see that the interest in the public schools of this county

real, and not. mere conjecture, is shown by the increase in a4 
‘tendance in the schools. I have visited most of them thi | 
ag I did in the two years of my first term, and I see that 
is a decided gain in favor of public schools in this county ~...~ 
my first visits to them, nearly three years ago. Still there i 
avery wide field for improvement. But with a for chenens 44

time, owing to the inability of our County Trustee to re, __ _L 
me the condition of the public school fund of the ¢-~~+~ -* 
earlier date, but I trust it may arrive in time to prevei 
in your arduous work. I am gratified to say that tl: 
my county are growing better yearly. A glance at; 
shows an increase of first grade certificates, better-pz 
a greater enrollment, a better attendance and longer 
at any previous year. The officers are more effic 
tentive to business and teachers more painstaking a: 
sive. Add to this an increase from 20 to 30 cent 
hundred dollar’s worth of property, with a growin; 
in favor of 10 cents additional taxation for public oop ee 
poses, and you can then determine for yourself whether or not 
the spirit of free education has fully reached the masses of the 
people of my county. A uniform series of text-books are used, 
and they have.proven so satisfactory in way of classification

J. L. Lang, Supzrintenpent, Unitia. 
In submitting this, my first report of the public schools of 
Loudon county, can say that it is correct in nearly every par- 
ticular. 
' We have some excellent teachers in this county. Interest of 
teachers and patrons generally good. 
There was a Teachers’ Normal held. A few institutes of in- 
terest have been held. It seems to be the desire of the people 
to build good and sufficient houses for the comfort of the chil- 
‘dren. Some schools have been shortened and some postponed, 
and the public money used for repairing and building, which is 
an encouraging feature. 
I hope next year to be able to give a better and more encour- 
‘aging report than this.

. MADISON COUNTY. 
'W. G. CocxrILt, SuPERINTENDENT, Jackson, 
Onur last fall and winter schools opened ‘with large enroll- 
ments; but the weather was so very severe during the winter 
-tdonths our daily average became so much reduced that we 
thought it best.to dismiss, and did dismiss, many district schools, 
which caused the daily average in our district schools to be very 
small. 
Our average cost of tuition per pupil per month is made on 
the enrollment. We closed out our schools for the year 1884-5 
leaving a balance on hand, June 80, 1885, of $7,600.82, which 
belongs to the country districts, the 15th district, including our 
city schools, having exhausted its full share. This balance 
shows that, although there has been a failure to school the chil- 
dren, the directors have not spent their money. 
We are proud of our city graded schvols, Under the man- 
agement of Frank M. Smith, City Superintendent, they are 
very popular, and are doing good work, Our colleges in Jack- 
son are first-class schools, we think second to none in Tennessee. 
MAURY COUNTY.

-P-A-G-E-134
184 
- fect, I am satisfied,-but from the reports of directors and 
teachers, I have done the very best I could. I was unable to 
visit ' my schools last year, and had to depend solely upon very 
imperfect reports, many of the directors and teachers making 
noreport at all. From the report of the public we Rave had 
good schools in every part of the county. Our institutes are 
improving our teachers, and creating a better feeling among all 
classes toward public schools. I hope to be able to make a 
better report next year, as I have tried to do good work this 
summer. The Columbia schools are not included in this is report, 
except scholastic population. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
- W. B. McKzown, Supmrintenpent, Decatur. 
This report is much behind time on account of teachers, di- 
rectors and trustee not responding to me in time. 
Our teachers have been somewhat careless in regard to their 
school work. The terms are short, and this makes against our 
getting good teachers. Some would-be-teachers are of opinion 
that they must have a certificate whether they know anything 
: ornot. Ihave succeeded in getting a tolerably good corps of. 
teachers for the county. They are generally persons of energy 
and good teaching qualities. 
One marked feature is, the citizens are becoming willing to 
be taxed to prolong the schools. The usual prejudice against 
female teachers is giving way, and we can hope to have a greater 
number of them enlisted. 
There have been two commodious school-houses built during 
the year. Next to an increased school fund, we need a uniform~ 
ity of text-books.

J. E. M. Enooxs, Superinrenpent, Lynchburg. 
I herewith transmit my annual report of the Moore county 
schools for the year ending June 30, 1885, which, I believe, is 
very near correct. I have used every means in my power to 
revive the interest of education in Moore county. I first organ- 
ized a teacher’s institute in the early part of our schools, and 
held them at different points in. the county, and I am pleased 
to say that there were several of our teachers who took a lively 
interest. We met twice a month, and conducted it on the plan 
of general class-work. I think there was more interest mani- 
fested upon the part of the teachers that attended, and the 
people of the neighborhoods where they were held, than ever 
before in our county. I visited every school-in the county; 
spent, upon an average, five hours at each school; advised with 
our teachers as to the best methods of teaching. I see from 
last year’s report that the enrollment is larger, but this year 
the average attendance is much better. Taking every thing 
into consideration, I think we are advancing. I am proud to 
say we have some as good teachers as there are in the State. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
J. Mrtuzr, SuprrintenDent, Clarksville. 
_In compliance with the law, I submit this, my third annual 
report of the Montgomery county schools, for the year ending 
June 80, 1885, Since my last report we have built five neat and 
comfortable school-houses. It will be seen from my statistical 
report that we have not run as many schools this year as we did - 
last year; as, also, it will be seen that our schools were of longer 
average continuance. ‘This may be readily accounted.for. In 
some of our school districts the directors have consolidated two 
schools, consequently diminishing the number of schools and -
-P-A-G-E-136

continuing them longer. There has been no perceptible change 
in the school finances of this county. Our directors do not al- 
‘low our schools to run in debt. Our very efficient County 
Trustee makes prompt distribution of the school fund, and our 
_ teachers receive their pay monthly. Our school directors have 
managed the school funds of their respective districts very Ju- 
diciously, and on the 30th day of June, 1885, we had a balance 
. of $15,584.33" on hand, an inerease of $995.25 over last year, 
notwithstanding our schools were continued longer. 
I visited about eighty schools, and found most of them doing 
well. It is my opinion that if the County Superintendents 
were paid a salary that would justify them to give-their entire 
time to visitations to the schools, to the establishment of graded 
schools throughout the county, and to normal work, etc., it 
would be a great saving to the county. The salary of the 
County Superintendent of this county is so small that he cannot 
make his visitations to the schools what they ought t~ *-  _* 
_ think the opposition heretofore existing to public sck 
about disappeared. The people are willing to be taxec. 
demanding a higher rate of taxation for school purpose: 
public schools are too short to meet the wants of th 
and to educate the rising generation. The Legislature 
by proper enactment, give us more money for the su 
our schools.

McMINN COUNTY. 
_. BR. M. Lowry, Superintenpent, Riceville. 
I have the honor to submit you my first annual report, which 
is not correct, but probably as nearly so as could be under exist- 
ing circumstances. Ihave been delayed thus far on account of 
the directors failing to send in their reports. 
Our teachers are most all well qualified to teach. Many of 
our young teachers lack that important element so necessary to 
successtul schools, viz: Practical experience in the management 
of the school. ‘It is impossible to secure experienced teachers 
for all the schools, and I cannot see but one way to supply this 
deficiency. If our Legislature would establish a normal in 
each county for one month or more in each year, we would soon 
_ no more ery “ poor teachers” and “wasted money.” 
During the year I have visited most all the schools of the 
county, and have found the schools progressing finely under the 
circumstances. I have found, also, several houses totally unfit 
for use. However, Iam glad to state that during the year there 
have been several new, conimodious houses erected, which add a 
great deal to the comfort and credit of the people in the com- 
munities where they were built. 
The question of means for school purposes is, in my opinion» 
an important one, and one which ought to receive the attention 
and consideration of those whose business it is to aid in perfect- 
ing our system. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
M. R. Apernatuy, SUPERINTENDENT, Purdy. 
Tinclose you herewith my report as Superintendent of Mc- 
Nairy county. For lack of data, which was destroyed by the 
burning of my residence in September, my report is necessarily 
defective in some respects. 
Instead of visiting schools, I devoted the summer to holding
-P-A-G-E-138
138 
district institutes. By this means I had the opportunity of 
bringing the teachers together and drilling then in methods. My 
institutes were well attended by the citizens of the county, 
having during my rounds met and lectured not less than 3,000 
of the best citizens in the county. I am much pleased with the 
experiment of district institutes. It is my purpose next year 
to develep more fully the plan of district institute work. 
During the year I have succeeded in getting uniformity of | 
text-books in most of the schools of the county. As the people 
learn of the “new education,” they will support with increasing 
liberality our public school system. The plan that will reach 
the people and bestir them to action is the one to be commended 
at this time. 
OBION COUNTY. 
W. B. Srovann, Supzrmrenpent, Troy. 
I have the honor to transmit herewith my first annual report 
of the public schools of Obion County, Tenn. 
Iam glad to note the increased interest that is being taken 
in behalf of popular education. New houses are being con- 
structed and old ones repaired, many of them at private ex- 
pense. In most districts the directors endeavor to procure the 
services of the very best teachers to be had, and show a dispo- 
sition to pay liberal salaries. They have learned that cheap 
‘teachers mean cheap work. Some dissatisfaction is manifested, 
however, owing to the unequal magnitude of school districts, 
_ and consequently, in the aggregate, an unequal distribution of 
“the school,funds. I am inclined to believe that it would bea 
wise step for the Legislature to pass an act authorizing the re- 
districting of the entire State. 
Please notice that I gave the amount of funds on hand Sep- 
tember first. The present trustee went into office at that time 
and there is no report from the ex-trustee to show the amount 
‘on hand July Ist, 1884. .

OVERTON COUNTY, 
R. N. Corruz, Superinrenpent, Livingston. 
The public schools of this county, with few exceptions, have 
_been very prosperous, most of the teachers being persons of 
experience in teaching. 
I had intended visiting all the schools of this county, but was 
prevented doing so on account of sickness. 
The holding of teachers’ institutes meets with but very little 
encouragement in this county, yet I will continue my efforts in 
that direction. . . oo 
My report may not, in all respects, be correct, but it is believed 
it approximates correctness. 
As a general rule, our directors are good and efficient officers, 
excepting that they are negligent as to reporting in due time. 
I think the schools of the county have nearly all done well. 
PERRY COUNTY. 
J. K. Hurstepiur, Superintenpent, Linden, 
I have visited all the schools in the county, and am satisfied 
that our schools are improving rapidly. I had but little success 
this year in holding institutes. Patrons as well as teachers seem 
too careless in holding educational meetings of all kinds, which 
Tam certain would be of vast importance to our schools. 
Books in our schools are mostly uniform this year. The 
schools in this county are entirely too short, and this is the 
hardest thing that I have to contend with. In many instances 
the schools are closed and money left over from year to year in 
the hands of the trustee. A majority of the districts, however, 
are in favor of longer schools and better schools.

it something like correct. 
Our county has been dragging along and not keeping any- 
thing up. We have now sixty-three school districts, which 
makes it very difficult to get any report correct. I have an ar-

get matters in much better shape. I now promise that I will

Isend you to-day my annual report, which is as nearly cor- 
rect as I could make it by visiting all the clerks in the county 
’ and hunting up registers of last year’s schools. 
Our Normal School was thought to be the most successful 
one ever taught in the county. It continued ten days. En- 
rollment fifty-six. 
In order to keep down disturbances among school directors 
and others, and to insure ultimate success in our public schools,

,and because of the great good that would result to this and 
" succeeding generations, I believe that the school law ought to 
require each County Court to appoint a commission of three or 
five persons to redistrict the county; that is, lay it off into dis- 
tricts independent of the civil districts and to locate the school- 
houses, or sites-for the same; that Superintendents should ap- 
prove every contract for building or repairing school-houses 
and every warrant drawn upon the trustee in favor of teachers 
and others; that all schools in the county should continue the 
same length of time; that each County Court should levy a 
sufficient tax, in addition to the State fund, to continue the 
schools the required length of time ; that school directors should 
be reasonable compensated for their services and be required to 
discharge their duty more fully than they do. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
B. F. Fyxz, Supzrintenpent, Hudbertsville. 
I have the honor to transmit my first annual report of the 
schools in Robertson county. The school interest in Robertson 
is growing. There is an abatement in active opposition to pub- 
lic schools. The people realize and appreciate the fact that it 
is by having an efficient system of public schools that the masses 
can be educated; by education, preserve morals and suppress 
crime. For these reasons the people } have called for a higher 
grade of teachers. 
To comply with the request and prepare the teachers for the 
contest, I conducted a normal school at Springfield for one 
" month, and asked the co-operation of district directors and 
others, who were deeply interested in the subject of education. 
The school. was well attended, but not as much so as it should 
have been. My efforts to elevate the standing of our teachers 
were highly appreciated by several directors. They assisted me 
to the extent of urging and persistently insisting on their teach- 
ers attending, with the penalty, perhaps, of forfeiting their posi- 
tion as teacher if not attending. Have held fifteen teachers’  
-P-A-G-E-143
148 
associations at different school-housesin the county, and accom- 
plished much good, which was evidenced by the qualifications 
the applicants for certificates exhibited on examination day. 
Our people are awakening to a school interest, and are mak- 
ing many improvements in school facilities, by building large, 
comfortable and well-arranged school-houses, and ask that the 
school fund be made large enongh to support our schools at 
least eight months in the year. 
‘I suggest that an act be passed by our next Legislature to have 
the scholastic year and term of office of the County Superin- 
tendents to close on the same day, that succeeding Superintend- 
ents shall not be compelled to to report the unfinished business | 
of his predecessor; to require each county to have a. uniform 
system of text-books, to be adopted by the County Superin- 
tendent and Board of Education, who shall be appointed by the 
Superintendent and elected by the County Court, and require 
them to be used without changing for six years, and make it a 
misdemeanor for a teacher to use any other books. 
Our schools are in a fair condition.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
J. H. Jurrers, SuPERINTENDENT, Vew River. 
I herewith submit my annual report. There has been very 
little change made since last year. Our school work has moved 
quietly and smoothly on, showing a gradual and remarkable 
increase of enrollment and average attendance. 
One thing which I note with pleasure is the growing senti- _ 
ment or determination on the part of the people to henceforth 
elect none but the best men for directors. 
The teachers of this county deserve much credit for the in- 
terest and energy displayed in their work, many of them spend- 
ing their means and leisure time in the very best schools in our 
county, and otherwise fitting themselves for their work in the 
school-room.; and the result is that our schools are keeping 
pace with the best in the State.

P. A. Waar, Supzrinrenpent, Sevierville. 
As may be seen by referring to my statistical report, v.

which we should be most greatly. concerned.

ever fully successful, our people must be educated unt:

tendance by making our school-rooms more comfortabl- -- 
attractive. This may be done by furnishing each house 
improved desks,and outline maps and charts. This i. o. 
thing in which we have made miserable failures in the pas
-P-A-G-E-145

but the prospect is flattering for a better day, when more in- 
terest will be taken. 
I find that we have greatly improved our schools by equal- 
ization of school terms in days in the districts. However, this is 
not universal, but it is becoming so with but very little oppo- 
sition. We consider each district as trustees considera high 
school. Let all the schools in the district open on the same 
day and continue the same length of time. It would add 
greatly to the progress of our schools to redistrict the county, 
which I think is probable at an early day. 
-I close by referring to our school-books. So far we have 
failed to have anything like a uniform system of school-books, 
‘this is due to the fact that we have not a regular book-store in 
the county, and our merchants having different kinds of books 
- the patrons afé induced to buy them. Our teachers are becom- 
ing stronger and stronger in expelling old books and replacing 
them by new ones, consequently we may soon have a complete - 
list of school-books in the county.

My report is not as full as I would like to have it, owing 
mainly to the incomplete report of the County Trustee. The 
schools ‘have been full and very regularly attended, and Iam 
' satisfied that we have had a better lot of teachers than usual. 
The great drawbacks in Sequatchie county is, we have too 
little money to continue for a sufficient length of time.

Mrs. W. H. Horton, Supsrintenpent, Memphis. 
I have the honor to submit to you my third annual report. 
You will find the scholastic povulation has increased, conse- 
quently the demand for more schools. I spent three weeks at 
Monteagle attending the Normal; since that time I have been 
holding institutes in different parts of the county for the benefit 
of the teachers ; made several public talks to the people at large . 
to stir up more enthusiasm and interest. on the subject of the 
common schools of our county. The-directors had a meeting a - 
few weeks since, and adopted a uniform series of text-books, 
which will aid the teachers greatly in their work. Many who 
received second grade certificates last year this year made first 
grade, which shows ther’ is a marked improvement in scholar- 
ship and methods going on among them. The directors are 
more interested, and the County Court has aided and encouaged 
me in my work: by jncreasing my salary and having my office 
fitted up comfortably avd beautifully. Iwill be happy to see 
you at any time you may see fit to visit our part of the country. 
SMITH COUNTY.

I herewith submit my annual report of the schools of Smith 
county.. 
There has been decidedly more interest taken in schools this 
season in this county than any time heretofore. Teachers, offi- 
cers and patrons are more zealous in this noble work than ever 
before, and the consequence is, we have had the best schools we 
ever had in this‘county. New houses are being built in every 
~ community, and d they are being filled with a better class of 
teachers.

But we have much to do yet to educate the public to that, 
point where they can see that a public school is the only help 
for the thousands of people that cantot be educated any other 
way. We have other difficulties; and one very grave one is 
the trouble of text-books—there is sucha mixture and no sys- 
tem, it tends to confusion. I do hope that you and other good 
and wise men of our State will look to this matter of a uni- 
formity of text-books. In September I visited very nearly, 
every school in the county. I found them alive, and, with. very 
few exceptions, full with live and efficient teachers. I did my 
utmost to encourage them to continue in the noble work. In 
November we organized a teathers’ institute. Hope we may be ~ 
successful with it. Our county is so geographically. situated 
that it is difficult to get the teachers all together at any one 
point. ' Our county is divided into three parts by two rivers. 
L.will make an effort to get up a reading circle as early as 
practicable. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 7 
J. B. Harr; Supprintenpent, Blountville. 
I send you to-day my annual report. Our schools this year 
are doing well. The County Normal, conducted by Professors 
N. B. Sherfey, Wm. Roe and L. M. Warren, and the State 
Normal Institute, conducted by the State Superintendent, Super- 
intendent Frank M. Smith, of Jackson, Tenn., and T. C. Karns, 
of. Carson College, made good impressions, and implanted new 
ideas and methods which many of the teachers are successfully ‘ 
introducing into their schools. We have our County Institute 
organized, which will hold its first session this year on the 6th 
and 7th of November. A few of the directors are disposed to 
employ cheap labor, but the majority seek the best teachers. 
Our teachers are laboring to improve themselves, and I can | 
safely say that we will do better work this year than we have 
done in any former year. The scholastic population of this
-P-A-G-E-148

county in the last year has increased about two hundred. The 
county is free of all school debt. . The schools, as shown by the 
directors’ reports, continued in session four months last year, 
put this year they will run longer. Two of our greatest diffi- 
culties to overcome are too many school districts and a multi- 
plicity of text-books. . 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
C. 8. Doveras, Superinrenpent, Hendersonville. , 
"In submitting this, my annual report, I feel it due our county 
that I'say something of the progress and maintenance of the 
system and the good work that most of our worthy teachers 
- are doing in the cause. We feel fully satisfied that with a few 
exceptional clauses that the present law is a’ good one, and that 
it is only necessary that our sessions be extended and the normal 
methods promulgated to make the public school system a grand 
success. ‘For the past two summers we have held Normal Schools, 
managed by professionals, and more than half of our teachers 
enrolled themselves as pupils, determined, as it were, to cultivate 
every opportunity and enjoy every advantage that would pre- 
pare them for, their “high calling.” These normals were con- 
tinued each for thirty days, and I assure you that during that 
time there was neither room for drones or idle spectators, but 
business was meant in every hour’s work. Our people and di- 
rectors alike manifested much interest in the success of the en- 
terprise, and so thoroughly were the directory persuaded that it 
was the very essential so much needed, that teachers were re-~ 
quired to attend these schools before they would employ them. 
Iam proud to report another good indication, to-wit, the build-_ 
ing of good houses and repairing of old ones. We have erected 
during the year just closed eleven frame buildings and repaired — 
others. It is due to this fact that you observe a decrease in our 
enrollment and average attendance, as three districts are pre-
-P-A-G-E-149
149 
paring good houses, and hence their schools are not running. 
As you are aware, sir, I am not prone to boasting, yet I am con- 
strained to “ measure lengths” with any of your counties as to 
competency of teachers. We are proud of our pedagogues, 
“ still we are not happy,” ' for many of our people do not recog- 
nize the importance of regular attendance, and hence our schools 
are not as full as they should be and the average daily attend- 
ance not so good as we could wish. The colored schools are 
improving and seem to be deeply interested in their work. 
Have just completed my rounds, and must admit that there is 
a steady, progressive tendency “all alorg the line,” and with 
energy and grit on the part of our public school advocates 1 
feel that in the end we will realize a golden harvest. We need 
more money, more time and more work, and “all will be well.” 
Our county has levied a tax of only 20 cents for schools, but 
this is owing to the fact that we are burdened with a heavy 
railroad indebtedness and at present can do no better. 
Much is yet to be done in our county toward persuading our 
people that it is only through intellectual development that suc- 
cess in any sphere is attained and that an inheritance of this sort 
for our children is “more to be desired than gold;” to con- 
vince them that the boys of the future need something else be- 
side muscle; that “knowledge is power.” When these impor- 
tant truths shall be made manifest to them through education, 
then will they become a wiser, better and consequently a happier 
people. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
P. A. Fisuur, Supermvrenpent, Covington. 
I'am happy to be able to report to you an increased pros- 
perity in the public schools of this county, and that our teach- 
ers are much more efficient. ‘ 
The public examinations which we have semi-annually in 
June and December have produced excellent results, eliminating
-P-A-G-E-150
150 
the incompetent &nd urging all to renewed application. But I 
believe nothing has tended more to arouse the teachers, school 
officers and patrons.than the institutes which you have held in 
various parts of the State. The one held here eighteen months © 
since gave a great impetus to‘schools throughout the whole 
county; since that time we have held monthly meetings of 
teachers, which have been generally well attended. 
I have been unable to secure any report from the private 
schools; in fact, there is but one school in the county which 
does not consume a part of the public funds. 
I would respectfully suggest that Physiology and Civil Gov- 
ernment be added to the list of public school studies instead of 
Geology and Elements of Agriculture.

We are moving along as well as could be expected, taking 
into consideration our many disadvantages. We have some 
good school-houses in the county. It is impossible to get a 
uniformity of text-books, at least we have exhausted every 
effort and failed. While we have many disadvantages to meet 
and drawbacks to contend with, we are trying to make use of 
all the means within our reach as best we can. Our people 
know that the public school system is their dependence in a 
great measure, and they are united in their efforts to make 
every year an improvement. on the past. I think, with such 
' sentiments manifested, we will have better success this year 
than usyal, Our schools have opened with fine prospects.

organized a teachers’ institute, which meets monthly, and is 
doing much good. Our county has built some good school- 
houses and has more in process of erection which reflects credit 
on our people. Our schools are improving and. our teachers 
are becoming more efficient. I intend to ask the County Court 
to levy a tax sufficient to continue our schools longer next year,

year. I expect next year to run a Normal Institute in our 
county, and you are invited to attend’ it and assist us in our 
school work.

is my first year as Superintendent, I cannot say to what extent 
our schools have improved, but according to the report of last 
year we have a better grade of teachers. I have issued five 
first-grade certificates this year. I have visited nearly all of 
the schools. Our county is free from debt, and I think it should 
levy a tax sufficient to continue the schools at least five months 
in the year,

This, my first report, is not as.accurate as it should be, because 
a few teachers and directors failed to make the reports required 
of them by law. I promise, however to render a faithful and 
accurate account of the present year’s work, and this is no idle 
promise. 
_Upper East Tennessee Normal Institute convened at Jones- 
Jonesboro the 18th of last July, and continued in session three 
weeks. Prof. John L Lampson, of the State Normal College, 
acted in the capacity of principal. He was assisted by Prof. 
Charles Mason, principal of the Jonesboro Graded School, and 
three other instructors of excellent abilities. : 
The methods of teaching advanced at this normal meet my 
hearty approval. They are sound to the core, in keeping with 
modern pedagogical thought, and admirably calculated to aid 
one in the delicate work of teaching. The teachers in attend- 
ance were, and are, delighted with them. We anticipate good 
results from their use in the school-room. 
The last annual session of the State Teachers’ Association 
was held at Jonesboro during the first days of August. The 
session was a profitable one. The normal and the association 
enthused our teachers no little. Several scholarly and practical 
addresses were made. . Especially did our teachers and the 
friends of education appreciate Senator Howell E. Jackson’s able 
argument in behalf of national aid to education. Thé distin- 
guished Senator delivered an exhaustive, scholarly and im- 
"pressive address on this important question. Even his oppo- 
nents in this matter were almost persuaded, like Agrippa, of . 
biblical fame, to believe in the righteousness of his doctrine. 
Those conversant with the public school affairs of the South 
recognize the meager amount of funds available for. common 
school purposes as a great drawback in the education ofthe 
masses. As @ necessary consequence of this defficiency, we 
‘give our children very short school-terms and our teachers and 
school officers miserably poor compensation. The imperfections
-P-A-G-E-153
‘ 153 ’ 
in the education of the masses to-day are not so much the result 
of improper training during the “tive months’ school” as the 
“seven months’ school” of intellectual rust and indolence. 
The financial condition of our schools is, comparatively 
speaking, very good. We will do good work this year. We 
have adopted a uniform system of text-books, a matter long 
neglected. This will materially improve classification, and 
hence enable the teacher to do better work. Physiology ought 
to be taught in our common schools. A strict following of the 
teachings of physiology lessens the use of alcohol and tobacco 
and increases our health and happiness. —_ 
On the 29th of August, 1835, a County Board of Education, 
composed of public school directors, was organized. The board, 
after due consideration of the question of uniformity in text- 
books, decided to adopt text-books for exclusive use in the pub- 
lic schools of Washington county during the ensuing five years. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
8. O. Hooper, Superintunpent, Dresden. 
I herewith present my second annual report of school work 
in Weakley county. 
I find that our teachers are improving in every respect, and 
are ever ready to acknowledge the utility of teachers’ institutes 
in preparing them for their work, yet very many fail to avail 
themselves of ‘these advantages, and will continue to do so until 
attendance at some normal or institute is made necessary by 
legal enactment to the procuring of a certificate. I also think 
it would be best to fix the salaries of County Superintendents 
by legislative provision, as County Courts, in many instances, 
will not allow sufficient salary to have the office competently 
‘ filled. < 
I-have had brought under my notice several instances of 
fraudulent efforts to obtain money by forging and charging

I have to report a slow but sure progress of 1” 
school cause; the opposition to our system has al

is the disposition on.the part of some of our sch: 
to let out their schools to the lowest bidder or soni

fitness to teach. This should not be, and we are u

_ [have the honor herewith to transmit my annual repor 
the public schools of this (Williamson) county. It is as near 
_ correct as I could make it. The public school iuterest in the 
county is growing, and the people, and especially the energetic 
and substantial citizens, are more alive and in earnest than I 
ever. knew them on this subject. ‘The people of the count: 
beginning to realize the fact that the public schools can

tion of their children, and they are going to make them such.
-P-A-G-E-155
  155 
The time that “ public schools were only good for paupers and 
negroes” is over with in this county, and on the contrary, men 
of property, pluck, energy.and influence—the bone and sinew 
of our country—are taking the school matters in charge, and are 
educating their children in them.- When.the public money is 
not sufficient to employ a good teacher and run a long-term 
school, in a good many of the districts the patrons just put 
their hands down into their pockets and supplement the fund 
until itis. Ihave for the coming year (June 26, 1885—June 
26, 1886) the most competent and efficient corps of teachers, 
white and colored, that has ever been in the county since I 
have been Oounty Superintendent. The county school-tax was 
raised last January to twenty cents, and I hope the County 
Court will raise it again this coming January, for I am satistied 
it is the best. paying investment that a people can make with 
their money, and if the taxis only levied sufficient to run good 
and efficient schools, it is the cheapest and fairest way to pay 
tuition. -I have held four white and four colored institutes this 
year of fourteen days. There was an annual meeting of the 
teachers’ institute, for the white teachers, June 24-26; for the 
colored teachers June 1§-17; and since then there has been a 
monthly meeting of each of the two institutes, which will be 
continued throughout the year.’ At the white institute there 
have been in attendance from sixty to thirty-five teachers, 
never below the latter figure. At the colored institutes, from 
thirty: to twenty teachers. The institutes have awakened, 
stirred up and interested the teachers as nothing has ever done 
in my remembrance. They are alive, in earnest, working and 
trying to improve. The colored people are stirred up on the 
subject of education, and at their request I have made a num-. 
ber of addresses at their school picnics, commencements, ete., 
and I am satisfied what I have said has not been lost. Almost 
every district in the county is trying to get out of debt, and 
are gradually and earnestly making for that end. , 
Thave done all I can by words and example to get them out 
of debt and to keep them out. I issued a system for grading 
the public schools of the county and rules for their government, 
and. this system has been adopted almost in full by the best and - 
most prosperous schools of the county. On account of the fail-
-P-A-G-E-156
"156 
ure of some of the directors to make teachers return their ab- 
stracts, the enrollment avid average daily attendance of pupils 
in the schools are not as much as they ought to be, and does 
not do the county full justice, but I just report to you as was 
reported to me by the directors. : 
I have visited the schools of the county, talked to the direc- 
tors, teachers and patrons at every opportunity about the neces- 
sity of good schools, and have tried in every way to keep the 
school interest in their minds and alive in the county, and I 
must say I feel greatly encouraged in my work, and especially 
about the financial condition of our school affairs. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
R. McMituan, Superintenpent, Lebanon. 
‘You will find inclosed my statistical report. After several 
months’ strife, the question in regard to the distribution of the 
’ funds is finally and fully adjusted, and this for the first time in 
ten years. 
The grading and tone of our teachers are without a doubt 
higher than ever before. The institutes held here for the last 
two years have been of immense advantage. We.have had 
none this year because the teachers desired a rest, but prepara- 
tions are making for an interesting time during next summer. 
I have endeavored to supply the place of an institute this last 
season by going to each district and holding public examina- 
tions. Our young men are the best, as well as the most popu- 
lar teachers in the field. Rigid public examinations are driv- 
ing all of the character of “Ichabod Crane” out of the way. 
Public sentiment is rising above such “fogys.” We will have 
but three or four of them next year, and I think-T shall insist 
on just paying them their $25 per month and letting them go 
on out of the way.
-P-A-G-E-157
187 
I have done my very best to rouse the people on the subject 
of schools, and of public schools. The old people are becoming’ | 
educated in this public school work as well as the children, 
-and every teacher knows these same old folks are the hard- 
est to manage of the two. JI have already visited every 
school in the county once, half of them twice, and many as 
often as three times. I suppose I have made as many asa 
hundred and fifty speeches to crowds during the year, and if I 
cannot get an audience consisting of a crowd, I just collar one 
fellow by himself. You see our court requires'me to give my 
entire time to this work during most of the year. The people 
are showing the advance of their ideas by the kind of teachers 
they want to patronize. The day when a small salary was a 
teacher’s only merit is gone by. They are selecting better men 
for directors every election. Most of them have stopped voting 
for a man just to defeat some other candidate. They are get- 
ing so they hunt up the best citizens—those who can take care 
of their own affairs, who are capacitated, honest and impartial, 
those who are judges of what a teacher ought to be. They are 
beginning to understand more of the school law and the prac- 
tical workings of the system. 
This reminds me that I, unlike many of my brother Super- 
intendents, have no changes in that law to suggest. A poor 
system well understood and operated is better than the most 
perfect if the people know nothing about it, and the way to 
keep them in ignorance of it is to keep changing it. I wish, 
however, we could overcome the difficulties constantly met with 
in regard to district lines. These same lines are the bane of 
the free school system, - 
We do not complain for the lack of more money, either. 
With right management we can run five months in the year. I 
believe, if well used, that is nearly enough. We want the boys 
of this country to learn to work their bodies as well as their 
minds. I have seen them surfeited with opportunities. And 
of what account is a head full of learning and no body to carry 
it around? 
You notice we are building school-houses—not with public 
money, however. It would be ashame if in a county full of 
timbef and saw-mills, and men who have no work for two
-P-A-G-E-158
158 
months in the year, to use the children’s money for building 
houses. A community who do not have sufficient interest to 
build a house would not seid to one if it was furnished for 
them. We have no spring terms of public schools. 
In conclusion, I will assure you again that our schools and 
system are in a higher state of perfection than at any time since 
the incipiency of the plan, and the tendency is upward with a 
strong and accelerated progress. I hope to see you at our in- 
. stitute next summer. Iam sure I can have a correct and en- 
couraging report to send you next October.

NEW ORLEANS EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT.

-P-A-G-E-161
NEW ORLEANS EDUCATIONAL EXHIBIT. 
As announced in my last Annual Report, I appointed Prof. 
Frank Goodman, of Nashville, as Commissioner for Tennessee, 
to take charge of the work of getting up and supervising our 
Educational Exhibit at the World’s Industrial and Cotton 
Centennial Exposition at New Orleans. This work he has 
well and faithfully done, and it is but simple justice to him 
to state that without his presence, his self-denying efforts, his 
tact and energy, the State would have been placed in a position 
of humiliating contrast with the great, well organized and ably 
conducted representations made by the States of the Northwest, 
placed, as they were, immediately alongside our own exhibit. 
As a result of the persistent efforts of Prof, Goodman, the 
visitors who thronged the Exposition had before them a very 
creditable exhibition of school work, from the primary grades 
to the college and university, offered as an evidence of what 
-Teunessee has aécomplished, and an earnest of still greater 
results in the near future, 
Prof. Goodman very justly acknowledges the personal service 
and wise counsel of Dr. Geo. W. F. Price, President of the 
Nashville College for Young Ladies; and the great interest in 
the success of the exhibit shown by Capt. Wm. Stockell, of 
Nashville. 
PROF. GOODMAN’S REPORT. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction 
of Tennessee: 
My Dear Sir—I have the honor to herewith submit to you 
my report as Educational Commissioner of the State of Ten- 
nessee for the World’s Industrial Exposition at New Orleans.
-P-A-G-E-162
164 
Upon receiving my appointment from you, I at once entered 
into correspondence with every County Superintendent, together 
with the representative of every school, academy, seminary, 
college and university in the State whose name and address I 
could obtain, and mailed them circulars containing full informa- 
tion as to the nature of the exhibit desired, together with such 
well-defined rules and conditions as would assist them in pre- 
paring their exhibits. These circulars were furnished me by 
United States Educational Commissioner Hon. John Eaton. 
At first but few educators seemed to be interested in an 
. exhibit, and few responses to the circular and letter were re- 
ceived, but in the meantime I was being assisted by yourself 
and Capt. W. R. Garrett, of Montgomery Bell Academy, in 
trying to get the representatives of the private schools, acade- 
mies, seminaries, colleges and universities of Nashville to unite 
and make an exhibit that would be creditable to Nashville, the 
Athens of the South, and after a number of meetings, all. of 
which I attended, it was decided to make a grand Nashville 
exhibit. This was the turning point, and a number of schools 
in different parts of the State commenced to arrange to make 
an exhibit, though some of the schools waited until the Expo- 
sition had opened, when, seeing the creditable exhibit of the 
Tennessee Educational Department, at once arranged to join 
in and share the success, and some large exhibits were received 
four months after the Exposition opened, and from schools that 
at first positively refused to exhibit. This, I consider, a grati- 
fying evidence of the success of the exhibit. 
One of the greatest obstacles was the lack of funds, but 
having received from the Hon. John Eaton, through you, three 
hundred dollars, with the instruction to use it for the public 
schools of the State, which I did, also Mr. Eaton’s guarantee 
of free transportation for all educational exhibits; and that 
counters, shelving, wall-space, etc., would be furnished free by 
the Government, and the officers of the private schools, semi- 
naries, colleges and universities of Nashville and elsewhere 
agreeing to share their part of any financial burden that might 
be incurred by me in the arrangement and care of their exhibits, 
eaused me to feel that all would be well henceforth. 
Having secured the requisite materials to make an exhibit
-P-A-G-E-163
165 
upon a respectable scale, I repaired to New Orleans about ten 
days before the opening of the Exposition, that I might super- 
intend and assist in the proper arrangement of the exhibit. 
On my arrival in New Orleans I found no arrangements 
whatever for the proper exhibition of the materials that had 
been so laboriously gathered together. After two days’ earnest 
solicitation for the space that had been previously promised, it 
was finally granted, but this was nothing but the bare floor and 
back wall space. There was one of two things to be done, 
either give up the idea of trying to make an exhibit, or advance 
the money. I did the latter. : 
As soon as our space was allotted, I availed myself of the 
valuable services of Rev. Geo. W. F. Price, D. D., President 
of the Nashville College for Young Ladies, who had accom- 
panied me, and without his valuable counsel and untiring 
efforts, day and night, the Tennessee Educational Department 
would not have been the thing of beauty and convenience it 
was. His assistance was for the general good of all, and at his 
own expense, and quite heavy it was—and I here retura him 
my own thanks, and those of all exhibitors who know or 
appreciate the circumstances. He also assisted me very ma- 
terially in hiring workmen, buying lumber, making counters, 
~ shelving, tables, sereens, partitions and painting, also decorating 
with paper, bunting and other devices, until by the opening 
day the Department had emerged from its chaotic condition 
into order, beauty and symmetry, 
That the exhibit might be properly cared for, and visitors 
receive such information as they might desire concerning any 
of the public or private school exhibits, I employed Miss 
Nannie R. Lyle, a French scholar, and a young lady of intelli- 
gence and cultivation, who took oversight and charge of the 
exhibit during the entire time of its stay in New Orleans. 
Her services were cheerfully paid for by all the schools repre- 
sented. She did her work well, very well. 
In this connection it is proper to refer to the generous and 
intelligent interest manifested by our patriotic fellow-citizen, 
Capt. Wm. Stockell. As it was impossible for me to remain in 
New Orleans all the time, Capt. Stockell gave his kind personal 
attention to aid Miss Lyle in opening, arranging and placing

Cotumsta Frmaxe Institute, Columbia, exhibited picture 
ofits school-buildings, and one volume labeled “ Our Daughters.” 
Howarp Frmare Contras, Gallatin, exhibited a full set of 
examination papers, and picture of the building. This exhibit 
showed the commendable enterprise of its efficient principal. 
Spring Hit AcapEMy FoR Youne Laniss exhibited one vol- 
ume Beech Croft. 
Goopman’s Business Cottzen, Nashville, exhibited a large 
specimen of penmanship, 8x5 feet, which adorned the center of 
the State exhibit. The exhibit showed the result of the old 
single entry method of book-keeping and the superior and 
beneficial results of double entry. 
VANDERBILT University, Nashville, exhibited one screen, 
10x12 feet, containing thirty-five pieces of students’ work, 
engineering figures, drawings, sketches, ete; a topographical 
chart, 4x6 feet, of the University grounds, with photographs; 
another chart, 5x8 feet, contained an account of the endow- 
ment, organization, etc., of the University; also two bound 
volumes of printed examination papers, and to this was added 
a beautiful gilt sign. The exhibit of this University displayed 
skill on the part of the students in their engineering studies 
and in other departments, and on the whole was very creditable 
to the State. 
Mowreomery Bett Acapemy, Nashville, exhibited eight bound 
volumes of manuscript, containing examination papers of the 
senior and middle classes, High School department; of junior 
class, written recitations in mathematics and United States 
history; one historical maps and drawings, one geometrical 
exercises; written recitations of Grammar School department ; 
also eleven maps and charts, three physiological. charts of 
muscles, circulation and viscera; six historical maps of a pyra- 
mid, Indian tribes, settlements, thirteen orignal States, territo- 
rial growth; chart explanatory of the series of historical maps ; 
two geographical maps, one of the Southern States and another 
of South America; also picture of teachers and pupils of the 
academy. This exhibit was good, and sustains the reputation 
of the school as being eminently thorough and practical.

of the buildings and grounds, and a number of reports from

ings of this famous summer normal school was on exhibition. 
CevrraL Tunnusser Counzaz, Nashville, exhibited eight vol_ 
umes of very creditable school work, also photographs of male 
teachers and another of female, one of College Hall, one of 
the Medical College Building. A good part of the exhibit of 
this College was in the Freedman’s Aid Society exhibit. 
Roger Winniams Universrry, Nashville, exhibited several 
bound volumes of students’ work and-some photographs, though 
the main part of its exhibit was in the Freedman’s Aid Society 
exhibit. 
Fisk University, Nashville, had its entire exhibit in with 
the Freedman’s Aid Society. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Jackson Pustic Scuoons. The Public Schools of Jackson 
had the largest and best exhibit of any of the schools of the 
State, much to the credit of Supt. Frank M. Smith and his gen- 
erous Board of Education, which sustained him and furnished. 
the means to carry his plans into successful operation. 
The exhibit of the Jackson schools consisted of twenty-four 
bound volumes of examination papers, embracing every branch 
of study, and from all the grades in the schools. The work of 
the pupils was not excelled by those of any other State. Large 
photograph of the members of the Board of Education, one 
of teachers, others of the Long School, Reid School, Primary 
Hall,.Seventh Grade Hall, one not named. All the above had 
the pupils in front of the buildings. Also, picture of Benevo~ 
lent Hall, one of colored teachers; also, reports, charts, etc.

Nasavitte Pusiic Scuoons. Nashville exhibited large pho- 
_ tographs. of her’ fourteen public school buildings, making a 
finer collection of ‘school buildings than was exhibited by any 
city, in any of the other State exhibits. Reports of the manner 
of conducting the Public Schools of Nashville, “the Athens of 
the South,” were also on exhibition. 
. Kyoxvitiz Pusiie Scnoors. Supt. Albert Rath is. entitled 
to much credit for interesting his Board in presenting an ex- 
hibit that did credit to a leading city in East Tennessee. The 
exhibit consisted of bound volumes of examination. papers 
from the Peabody, Girls’ High School, Bell House, Hampden 
Sidney, the colored and Ninth Ward Schools, all of which 
showed very creditable work. Prof. Ruth also sent specimens 
of work from the Industrial School, one little wooden block, 
and another block made of calico for a quilt, by two little boys, 
which were indeed good for children’s work. 
CuaRKSsVILLE Pusiic Scuoots. Supt. C. T. Kelloge took a great 
pride in having his schools represented, and while the Board 
of Education was short of means, it made up by encouraging 
its Superintendent to make the exhibit, and a creditable one it 
was, although gotten up under many difficulties. The bound ~ 
‘volumes of examination papers also contained specimens of 
writing and drawing, and the work of both white and colored 
pupils, speaks well for Superintendent, teachers and pupils. 
‘The excellent photographs of the two school buildings for 
white and one for colored, with children in front, shows Clarks- 
ville is not behind in school buildings. o 
Frienps’ Station Pusire Scuoor—(New Market). Prof. Ww. 
3B. Harshaw, the principal of the school, sent a fine exhibit, 
showing what pupils, having been taught the normal methods, 
could accomplish. Their specimens of work and examination 
papers were entirely different from the customary methods, and 
showed that as good work could be done in a country school as 
inthe city. The school is conducted by a daily schedule, the 
same as any city graded school.

ADDITIONAL TENNESSEE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS. 
In addition to the above, Alexis Brother, of the Christian 
Brothers of Memphis, occupied a very large space, arranged by 
themselves, exhibiting students’ work, such as geographical 
and crayon drawing, anatomical models, and many interesting 
and valuable lessons. This exhibit was a complete museum 
within itself, and gave a full illustration of the many studies 
taught by this college, and reflects much credit on the curator 
and librarian who managed the same. 
. : . 
COLORED EXHIBITS. 
In the Colored Department of farm products, mechanical 
and woman’s work, were numerous displays of educational 
work, among which was a large number of examination papers 
elegantly bound, also a number of volumes containing ferns, 
flowers and foliage, tastefully arranged, all from the Central 
Tennessee College. -A good photograph of the colored Public 
School of Clarksville; a photograph of Fisk University, or 
Jubilee Hall, also Livingstone Hall. 
The display of pictures was good, especially those by school 
children, and those in needle work, such as. “The Lord is My 
Shepherd,” and “In God We Trust,” were excellent. 
Frespman’s Arp Socrmty also had a separate exhibition in 
which was exhibited a large amount of creditable work from 
Roger Williams University, Fisk University, Central Tennes- 
see College, of Nashville, and other colored schools in Tennes- 
see. 
Had all of the above three educational exhibits been added 
to the regular Tennessee display, it would have been one of 
the largest exhibits in the Educational Department of States, 
but even as it was, the Tennessee educational exhibit ranked 
with the best, both in its attractive display and excellent char- 
acter and great variety of work. , 
Tn conclusion, I desire to thank you for honoring me with 
the appointment, and also for your continued assistance and ad- 
vice and encouragement, and your deep interest in the cause,

  NOTE 
THE book is divided into two parts. In the first we 
have attempted to discuss various problems which arise 
in teaching history to young children without sug- 
gesting any revolutionary departure from ordinary prac- 
tice. In the’second we wish to help the teacher who is 
not a historical specialist by indicating where recent 
research or thought has modified previous views, stating 
what sources, are available for studying various topics, 
and giving various other information of which we believe 
teachers often feel a need. 
Where some particular writer has treated a special 
method fully, as Miss Findlay-Johnson has described 
her dramatic method, or Mr. Keatinge his source method, 
we have merely said a few words on the topic to indicate 
our attitude to their views. In such cases we are 
influenced by a wish that the reader should obtain his 
knowledge of these methods directly from the works of 
their exponents.

INTRODUCTION 
To-pay the attention of everyone is fixed on the history 
‘that is being made from hour to hour. Our grasp of the 
ideals which we have formed in the past is being put to 
the test, and the course of the future is being determined. 
Patriotism is not a matter of discussion, but of action. 
The connection between the lessons which the citizens 
of Great Britain have learned from their knowledge of 
her history and the significance which they attach to the 
present momentous struggle is so close that we hope to 
be pardoned for publishing a book on the teaching of 
history even at such a time. It is true that, in the midst 
of such events,. it is hard to view the past in its proper 
perspective and not to regard the whole course of his- 
tory from the standpoint of the present issues. The 
- book, however, was in the main written before the war, 
when it was possible to look back on the past and for- 
ward into the future with less emotion and more cold- 
blooded judgment. What emboldens us to publish it 
now is that, reading our manuscript again in these days 
when interpretations of history are being tested in the 
fire, we see nothing to withdraw and little to alter. 
The nation has entered this war in no jingo spirit. 
We believe that we and our Allies stand for certain 
factors in the progress of the world, and that in this war 
at least those who risk their lives do so for a principle

and not merely for martial glory. Modern history, 
unlike ancient, can supply few instances of a war truly 
waged by a whole people. Hence in the many pages 
where we tend to turn aside from the territorial wars 
of thé past and to emphasize the development of condi- 
tions which lead to intellectual, moral and esthetic 
greatness, the growth of a feeling that states, like 
individuals, are bound by the moral law, and the 
gradual elimination of selfishness in the policy of nations, 
we feel that these things are more sacred now than they 
were a year ago, now that they are being consecrated 
by the sacrifices of our fellow-men. All these things can 
be looked at from the standpoint of the war, not because 
they are rendered important by the war, but because the 
war is important on account of them. 
History has not changed its meaning; it is we who 
have changed in our capability for appreciating its 
meaning. In the stillness of party conflict we see that 
these things in which we agree are greater than those in 
which we differ; we realize better that every side stands 
for a principle that all can accept, because no one is now 
claiming that his own party’s principle is the sole goal of 
endeavour before which every other aspiration must 
bow ; we can harmonize order and discipline, liberty and 
democracy, the social and intellectual elevation of the 
masses, when we see that we need them all to win this 
war and make it worth the winning. We can therefore 
appreciate the diversity of tendencies in the past the 
better, because we judge them from a wider standpoint 
in the present. 
Builders of our Empire, winners of our liberties ; kings 
who gave us order, and democrats who checked the 
power of kings; discoverers whose eyes were set on the

farthest part of four continents, and social reformers who 
insisted that the duties of the state began at home; all 
belong to us all now, for we believe that one and all, 
could they be with us now, would join with one another 
and join with the united leaders of the nation to-day to 
secure the victory which will be the victory of all of us 
and of all of them.

THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
PART I 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 
CHAPTER I 
THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 
A Commission appointed in the middle of the nine- 
> teenth century reported that history was not deserving 
of too large a place in the curriculum because it was 
concerned only with the memorizing of facts. The state- 
ment was probably true of the subject as it was then 
taught. It is only the last two decades which have 
seen any considerable change. 
Yet. history..may~-be-considered-as one ofthe oldest 
subjects of study, and one on the necessity of which all 
ages have agreed. Epics of national heroes, ballads of 
ational victories, are the primitive vehicles through 
which “fathers teach their children to the intent that 
they may tell them which come after.” Chronicles were 
written in abundance in the Middle Ages. The Renais- 
sance, wishing to revive classical ideals, turned to 
classical history. The Reformation made the masses 
familiar with the historical literature of the Bible. With

the growth, of national feeling Shakespeare dramatized 
large portions of English history. 
But every age has a different view of the precise 
value of history. All that is common is a belief that 
it makes better and wiser men and citizens, and a recog- 
nition, when the question is fairly faced, that names and 
dates have themselves no inherent power ‘of achieving 
this object. 
It would be impossible to enumerate all the ways in 
which history can affect men’s intelligence, their emotions 
and their wills. But we will distinguish two main classes 
of influence, (1) the more general influences. which we 
may call a broadening of the outlook, and (2) the par- 
ticular political lessons which directly help to form the 
pupil’s views on present-day questions. 
I—MorE_GENERAL_ INFLUENCES 
Imagine the mass of mankind to know nothing of its 
history. The existing level of civilization, existing 
social customs, existing political institutions would be 
the only imaginable things of their kind. No society 
has ever been completely in such a case; but those which 
have approached most nearly to it have experienced one 
of two results. If social conditions were tolerable, we 
find the intense dislike of change which characterizes 
Oriental countries; if acute evils existed, Utopian 
schemes of reform were believed capable of immediate 
realization, and anything from an undercurrent of dis- 
content to a revolution followed. This intense con- 
servatism and these revolutionary feelings may easily 
co-exist in two different classes in the same country, and 
then the danger of revolution is at its greatest. 
The germs of both these tendencies are everywhere.
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 3 
It is no sufficient safeguard that a small specialist class 
should be acquainted with history. In the Natural 
Sciences this is enough; these subjects do not affect 
men’s feelings, and their spheres of action are definite. 
If there are enough doctors, engineers and chemists to 
do the work required, the ordinary man may be perfectly 
ignorant of these subjects. But in the case of history 
it is different. It is not merely that in a democratic 
community everyone takes a share in appointing the 
legislators: even were the government of the country, 
like’ medicine and engineering, in the hands of. experts, 
the experts could not disregard the opinions and preju- 
dices of the governed. And outside politics there is 
a large sphere of activities where undue conservatism 
and rash notions of change are dangerous; the former 
may take the form of religious intolerance or of resistance 
to moral improvements, the latter may lead to a loss of 
all the standards of morality. 
Even the highest intellects are liable to grievous mis- 
takes through not taking account of the warnings of 
history in human affairs. The French Revolution was 
matured by minds of the first order. Had the eighteenth- 
century philosophers possessed the historical sense as 
well as a genius for abstract political speculation, the 
Revolution might have been avoided. ’ 
It is difficult to overrate the value of the historical 
element in English public opinion during the nineteenth 
century in avoiding these two extremes. It is easy to 
scoff at the worship of the British Constitution, and 
tempting to smile at the timidity of the middle-class 
Englishman in treading any path not marked out by 
precedent; but it can hardly be maintained that the 
motto “Reform, not revolution” was not of great help 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  4 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to the early Victorian period, or even that the sordid 
precedent of the “Glorious Revolution” did not satisfy 
many discontented minds that reform could be obtained 
without upheaval. 
Again, it is important to learn that “there is much 
to be said on both sides”; that other ages have been 
in certain respects happier and better than our own, and 
that many of the beliefs and institutions of our own 
time and country may not be worthy of the admiration 
which we usually bestow on them. This is a warning 
which history cannot fail to give, and it is specially 
needed by a people which is remarkable for its insularity. 
But we venture to think that even these are not the 
greatest lessons to be derived from history. They are 
influences which restrain us from ill-considered actions 
and enthusiasms ; but we need also some stimulus which 
will stir us to right enthusiasms and wise actions. 
Open-mindedness is a coldly intellectual virtue; it fails 
to fire the imagination or stir the heart. We need an 
aspiration, a ground of confidence that our aspiration is 
based on reality, and the stimulating knowledge that 
our acts can further our aspiration. 
All these needs are supplied by the dynamic view of 
history, by the idea of Progress. It gives an aspiration; 
for no one can believe it possible that men should become 
happier, wiser and better without wishing that it may 
become true. It gives a ground of confidence by show- 
ing that both our own race and the world have in the 
main moved in these directions. It stimulates us to 
action, because it shows that such progress has not been 
effected by blind mechanical laws acting from without, 
but through the thoughts, words and deeds of 
individuals.
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 5 
Two views have been put forward which militate 
against this sense of responsibility—the views associated 
respectively with the names of Carlyle and Green—on 
the one hand that progress has been the work of a few 
master minds, on the other that it is the result of ten- 
dencies which lie beyond the control of man’s deliberate 
action. 
But both views are based on a failure to realize facts 
which are obvious when once they have been pointed 
out. The work of great men has not been achieved by 
dispensing with the efforts of ordinary men, but by 
stirring them to such efforts. If they could not stir 
them, they failed. And, as to tendencies, their personi- 
fication should deceive no one. To say that the ten- 
dency of the last century was towards liberty or nation- 
ality or what not, only means that the men of that time 
came to desire those things and, if necessary, to fight 
for them, live for them, and die for them; it does not 
mean that, if they had not been ready to do these things, 
the results would have been the same. 
This aspiration after progress has not been by any 
means universal, but rather exceptional. Geographic- 
ally, it has been a mark of the West and not of the East ; 
chronologically, of the period from the Renaissance. It 
is characteristic of Christianity among religions, of the 
Teutons among races. 
Let us analyse a little more closely the nature and 
effects of this idea. : 
' First it leads us to realize the connection between us 
and all that is past. We are the “ heirs of all the ages,” 
it was for us that the Vikings learned discipline on the 
sea, that patriots fought and that inventors worked. 
Hence arises a feeling of responsibility. All future ages
-P-A-G-E-16
    6 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
are our heirs, and it is our duty to hand on to them what 
we have received, with interest. In some respects this 
feeling of trusteeship has been shared by ages which 
have not realized the idea of progress. Spartam nactus 
es, hanc exorna: your ancestors have inherited tradi- 
tions of character and a position among nations; take 
care that nothing you do loses that character and that 
position. This localized and patriotic feeling of trustees 
ship must not be lost sight of through the development 
of a wider ideal. We need not discuss the case of states 
which have contributed little to general progress or of 
those which have been left in a backwater. Citizens of* 
the great states of the West can feel that their countries 
have ideals to impart to mankind, and that the welfare 
of each man’s own nation is the means by which he 
can best further the welfare of the world. Patriotism 
will be as real with us as with an Athenian or a Roman, 
though the realization of progress will modify its char- 
acter. It will be more concerned with the permanent 
elements of civilization, with providing a full and free 
life for all its members and with such political, social 
and industrial conditions as make for such a life. It 
will be less concerned with securing political and 
economic predominance for the nation. The more we 
realize the ideals of our nation, the more shall we value 
all conditions which give them scope; but military suc- 
cess will not be regarded as an end in itself, and national 
ambition and vanity will be more and more regarded as 
individual ambition and vanity are already regarded. 
Patriotism that has been influenced by the idea of pro- 
gress has no place for Cleon’s speech to the Athenians, 
in which he tells them, not as an accusation, but as a 
guiding principle of policy, that their empire was a
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY z 
tyranny, their subjects inspired only by fear, and their 
proper aim their own advantage. Nor can it tolerate 
such a spectacle as a Roman triumph. 
Secondly, it develops the “social sense” through an 
increased realization of the future effect on the com- 
munity of actions which appear to have no grave present 
consequences. This applies especially to our conduct 
‘in matters of commercial morality and political purity. 
Misconduct in public life is often not regarded with 
the same serious disfavour as in private relations. In 
the civil service, it is true, the standard is as high as 
could possibly be desired. The conduct of Clive and 
of Warren Hastings, creditable compared with that of 
a sixteenth-century Spanish governor, was condemned 
by its own generation, and its ideal has remained the 
tradition of the service ever since. But this tradition is 
confined to those who are the representatives of the 
nation and conscious that its credit will be judged by 
their acts. It would be foolish to exaggerate the impor- 
tance of municipal scandals, but it is significant that 
such conduct does not meet with the reprehension which 
it deserves. Its ultimate effect is far more extensive, and 
the harm done is therefore greater than that which is 
done by common burglars and pickpockets, because such 
public malpractices tend to become a systematized insti- 
tution. Many people, however, think of such matters 
in the same way as they think of cheating a railway 
company or the income-tax officials. They seem to 
think that if you cheat an abstraction, no one suffers. 
As a matter of fact, when the thing is done on a suff- 
ciently large scale, everyone suffers. The remedy will 
be a slow one. A development of the social sense can 
only come from a clearer apprehension of the nature of
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
a community and of the State as a particular com- 
munity. No other subject but History can give this 
apprehension. 
It is impossible to over-estimate how fundamental is 
this conception of Progress in all spheres of modern life. 
It first showed itself in discovery and invention, about the 
beginning of the seventeenth century. Previous periods 
made discoveries, but thought of them as accidents occur- 
ring from time to time, and they did not greatly alter 
the popular belief in the “good old times.” Further, 
the Middle Ages were engaged in recovering lost 
ground.* The lost ground was finally made up at the 
Renaissance, then came printing, Columbus, modern 
astronomy, physics, and medicine; by the beginning of 
the seventeenth century Bacon was able, in the sphere 
of invention and discovery, to proclaim an age of 
progress. 
Next progress began to bé recognized as a feature of 
the Christian religion. . Not only had Christianity 
announced itself as the climax of a development, a 
“filling out of the law,” but by laying down principles 
rather than a code it had not like Mohammedanism 
stereotyped a system, but had provided a field for 
indefinite expansion. Thus it has often been pointed 
out that, though it did not command an immediate 
abolition of slavery, its principles contained an implicit 
* The fundamental loss had been good government. With 
this loss handicrafts, agriculture, commerce, architecture, art, 
learning, comfort, and refinement had all declined. It was the 
relearning of the power of forming a civilized community and 
the consequent spread over Western Europe of the seeds left 
by the old Graeco-Roman civilization in these respects rather 
than specific inventions which marks the difference between 
the barbarism of 800 and the civilization of 1500 a.D,
-P-A-G-E-19
   THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 9 
repudiation, of which Christendom gradually became 
conscious. Such consequences lying implicit in its prin- 
ciples came to light by a gradual process, till the general 
principle of progress in morality became established. 
Thirdly, a similar elasticity was found to be possible 
in British institutions. Such development had been pro- 
ceeding all through British history, but the authors were 
for a long time careful to assert that they were not intro- 
ducing changes but reaffirming ancient rights and 
liberties. The Whigs of the eighteenth century still 
paid a measure of homage to this fiction; those of the . 
nineteenth century definitely adopted the theory of pro- 
gressive modification. 
The world was thus familiar with the principle in the 
most important spheres of human life when Biology 
and Astronomy announced it to be the fundamental 
principle both of life and of the inanimate Universe. This 
scientific recognition of “ Evolution” has probably done 
more than anything else to fix it in the popular mind as 
something all-embracing and irrefutable. Yet it may 
have created misconceptions as to its operations in the 
sphere of human life. The evolution of animals and to 
some extent of primitive man, is an evolution which the 
race undergoes but does not purposively direct. The 
higher stages of human evolution are effected by con- 
sciously directed effort. Man not only adjusts himself 
to his environment, but adjusts the environment to him- 
self. There is a further point; whereas the scientist can 
only define progress as change from the simple to the 
complex, the historian means change from the less desir- 
able to the more desirable. The idea of value is intro- 
duced, and in the ultimate resort that of moral value. 
We would not therefore confine the effect of the idea
-P-A-G-E-20
10 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
of progress to politics. The idea that “through the 
ages one increasing purpose runs” must give a zest to 
our views of lifé in every aspect. Everyone knows the 
enthusiasm that comes of working for a cause, and of 
fighting what we hope to be a winning battle. If aman 
becomes convinced that progress is a law of the world, 
then to put himself on the side of this law is to be aiding 
the largest conceivable cause and fighting on the win- 
ning side in the greatest conceivable battle. Enthusiasm 
in any other cause, ethical, social, political, religious, is 
increased by the belief that it is only one branch of the 
greater cause. It is only the historical view of progress 
which can give this living, human, moral and practical 
evolutionary creed; it cannot be found in the merely 
scientific view of Evolution. Its application is universal. 
To say that any man is in such a position that his action 
will not aid or hinder any branch of progress would 
be tantamount to saying that he was in such a position 
that morality did not apply to him. : 
We have said nothing to show that the elementary 
school can give any idea of progress, and for a very 
simple reason. It already does give it; it is impossible 
for history, whether it aims at it or not, to avoid in some 
measure so doing. The idea may scarcely be explicit, 
but most children would repudiate the notion that cer- 
tain violent and cruel acts of the Middle Ages would be 
allowed to-day and could give some rational grounds 
why they prefer to live now rather than in such a period. 
The issue, then, is not whether any idea of progress 
can be given, but how clear that idea can be made. 
Before concluding this section, we feel obliged to 
mention the value which was regarded as most impor- 
tant, not only by primitive peoples and by the great
-P-A-G-E-21
   THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 11 
nations of antiquity, but by educational writers of the 
Renaissance—the direct moral effect of the study of 
the biographies of great men. It has been pointed out 
by various writers that this analysis of character can 
be given much better in literature than in history, 
since the poet or novelist has complete control over the 
development of the story, and can represent the play 
or motive as he wills, whereas the historian can only 
conjecture the motives of his real characters and 
hesitates to give an uncertain explanation. There is, 
however, a certain convincing quality gained from a 
knowledge of the reality of the characters which his- 
tory can give and literature cannot.* Nevertheless, it 
remains true that History only deals with a limited 
class of actions, that is with the public life of its char- 
acters, and that we cannot trust to it to give the kind 
of insight into the springs of action which children need 
for guidance in their every-day life. 
While history cannot therefore be regarded as the 
special subject for developing what Thomas Arnold 
called moral thoughtfulness, it still affords a large scope 
for its exercise. This effect often eludes us, because 
we take it to mean either too much or too little. We 
either think of a University student analyzing the 
mixed character of such a man as Francis Bacon, and 
conclude that the moral value of history presumes con- 
siderable knowledge and power of judgment : or else we 
think of a small child listening to the story of King 
John and Prince Arthur, sympathizing with the boy and 
* Questionnaires on children’s ideals have shown that very few 
characters from fiction have been given by children as their 
ideal, but large numbers from history (Meumann, Vorlesungen, 
p- 625).
-P-A-G-E-22
12 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
angry with the wicked uncle, and go away with the 
impression that the value is only found at that early 
stage of instruction when the stories scarcely differ from 
legends. But such extreme cases show that History 
gives scope for the formation of moral estimates to all 
ages from the youngest to the oldest, though they are 
more likely to be formed if the pupil does not regard 
them as the chief function of the study. 
II.—BEARING OF HIsToRY ON POLITICS 
It is now time to consider the specific value of History 
to a member of a modern democratic state. This value 
consists partly in the effect on the feelings, partly in the 
knowledge and power of judgment which is conveyed. 
A difficulty is sometimes raised that appeals to the 
feelings are not to be encouraged except where there 
exists a possible outlet in action, and that a school-child 
cannot have any outlet for feelings of patriotism. The 
principle here enunciated has its use in preventing moral 
training as a whole from stopping short at the arousing 
of feelings without disciplining the will or forming good 
habits. But its falsity as a maxim applicable to each 
individual moral idea is clear from its consequences. 
It cuts off nine-tenths of the population at ordinary 
times from all hope of patriotism. Yet the response to 
the call of duty in the war has shown that there are 
permanent feelings which may from lack of opportunity 
be ordinarily latent but are real all the time. Surely 
historical examples have helped to create these feelings. 
More scope for difference of opinion arises on the 
possibility at an early age of training the political judg- 
ment. Most of the lessons of history are disclosed only
-P-A-G-E-23

| 
to the mature judgment. They are generally attitudes 
of mind that could not, like the laws of science, be 
expressed in a general statement. The adult student of 
history, in a word, acquires a kind of sagacity akin to 
that practical wisdom which, in the ordinary affairs of 
life, comes from experience. Yet surely we should find 
depths of political folly and ignorance of which we 
hardly contemplated the possibility, if we could enter 
into the minds of a people which was entirely ignorant 
of its history. The most elementary training is often 
the most important. If nothing were inferred from the 
study of history except that all politicians are not arrant 
knaves, or that those who make wonderful promises are 
not always to be trusted, the lessons to be derived from 
the careers of William Pitt and Jack Cade respectively 
would not be without value. 
Probably more importance attaches to the use which . 
may be made of historical knowledge afterwards than 
to inferences which are drawn at the time. Again it 
is the obvious that count for most. There are facts of 
which we hardly realize the importance through their 
very familiarity. It seems so obvious that a person 
understands the value of naval supremacy better if he 
has heard of the Battle of Trafalgar and the Spanish 
Armada than if he has not, that we are in danger of 
forgetting that it may be as important that five million 
more persons should know of these two facts as that 
five thousand more people should draw more advanced 
conclusions. If there is some elementary knowledge, 
there is something from which argument may start; 
otherwise newspapers and speakers can do nothing but 
give false promises or appeal to prejudices. In this 
respect, a return for our labours in teaching history will

accrue from the smallest amounts; it is not like a 
language in which the elementary work is only useful 
as a step to the later. 
The question is sometimes raised whether the matters 
which are most important in their bearing on current 
political events can be taught without bias. We need 
only look to existing practice, and the answer is that 
they can. Teachers have been accustomed as students 
to receive their own instruction in history from lecturers 
who avoid marked bias and textbooks which preserve 
the same rule of constraint; the whole tradition of 
higher places of learning is in the same direction; and 
thus a practice which might be hard to establish for the 
first time is easy when once the way to do it is handed 
down almost unconsciously.* 
As Mr. Keatinget puts it, “The professional spirit of 
the teacher will lead to severe pruning of crude views and 
unruly enthusiasms. Under its guidance he will give 
his pupils the most moderate expression of the opinions 
which finally he finds himself driven to uphold, and he 
will refrain from communicating to them those which 
arise from passing moods or temporary irritation. He 
will be an example to them of reticence and of balanced 
judgment, and will give them only of his best, the fruits 
of all the self-criticism of which he is capable.” 
The Americans go further and, under the name of 
“Civics,” give definite lessons on the constitution of 
* In Germany it is the Government and not the teachers 
which by regulation and syllabus attempts to use the teaching 
of history in schools as a means of upholding confidence in the 
existing régime and opposing the advance of the Social Demo- 
cratic party.

their country. The plan is adopted in some schools in 
Great Britain. There are, however, two objections to 
making “ Civics” a separate subject. The first is that, 
whereas America possesses a written constitution, the 
contents ‘of which can be taught apart from its origin, 
the “constitution” of Great Britain consists largely of 
tradition, that is, of the effects produced by historical 
facts on the minds of present-day statesmen. No state- 
‘ment of a constitutional position can be taught or 
understood without historical treatment. The second 
objection is that an abstract treatment is dull, lifeless, 
and ineffective. Thus the method of separate treatment 
stands condemned from the point of view both of the 
pupil and of the subject. 
The claims on history from this side are much greater 
than appears at first sight. Children have to learn 
what a government is, why it is needed, and why, if it 
is needed, it should assume such a strange form. It is 
hopeless to start from the twentieth century. A king 
who reigns but does’ not govern, a state of affairs in 
which a thing may be “ legal” but not “ constitutional,” 
and in which it is possible for the country to be divided 
into two nearly equal camps, each headed by an array 
not only of politicians but of writers on constitutional 
law on the question not of what should be but of what 
actually weve the constitutional relations of the two 
Houses of Parliament—such a state of things is mean- 
ingless till the way has been prepared by an exhibition 
of the simpler conditions out of which the complicated 
machinery of the present day arose, and of the 
atrophied parts of the constitution as they were when 
they really performed their functions: A child can 
understand an Alfred who made laws, led armies, tried

criminals, and ordered the foundation of schools, but 
it is only by tracing the gradual devolution of powers 
that he can understand a George the Fifth who. does 
none of these things but presides over a complicated 
machinery of officers of state, government departments, 
county, town, and parish councils, watch committees, 
education committees, and school managers. 
The instances of the bearing of history on present 
politics which occur most obviously are concerned with 
constitutional development or with foreign policy. In 
the near future, however, economic questions are likely 
to come more and more to the front. Nowhere is there 
a greater need of the historical point of view. Our 
modern economic system is a matter of very recent 
growth, and in this department of life even the experi- 
ence of antiquity fails us. A gigantic experiment is 
being worked out for the first time. Machinery is only 
a small part of the change. International trade fol- 
lowing in the wake of geographical discovery is another. 
At the back of all is organization; the massing of the 
capital of many persons for a common end, production 
on a big scale, the whole of the operations of banking 
and the stock exchange: without these international 
trade and the industrial system would have been impos- 
sible. We can sum up the results in a few words: com- 
mercial and industrial organization has enabled forty 
million to live in a country where four million lived 
before; but it has been little concerned with how they 
live. Statesmen have more and more to solve this 
problem. 
The serious defect in our past teaching of history 
is that not one in ten of this huge population has ever 
considered that its existence is in need of explanation ;
-P-A-G-E-27
  \ 
THE AIMS OF TEACHING HISTORY 17 
the remainder take it for granted and thus fail to see 
the social problem in its true perspective. This is 
equally true of those who assume that social evils are 
inevitable, and of those who do not see that the 
remedies for the evils of our intricate system must be 
carefully devised if they are not to destroy its advan- 
tages. The error in both cases is to take a static and 
not a dynamic view of society. The present is the 
result of the past, and is unintelligible without it. If 
we consider that every child in this country learns 
something of the cardinal points in our constitutional, 
colonial, naval and military development, the ignorance 
of our economic development becomes remarkable; and, 
if further we consider that every elector is forming views 
on social and economic questions, it becomes appalling. 
The reasons for this omission are various. One cause 
is that historians in the past neglected all but the 
political side of history. Another is that political 
economists attended to economic theory more than to 
economic history. Again, the difficult and to many 
persons repellent character of abstract economic theory 
has created a false impression that industrial history is 
equally dull and difficult. Finally, many of the facts 
are undoubtedly outside the everyday life of children. 
But this consideration, if logically pressed, would do 
away with the study of history altogether. Children 
are expected to understand something of strategy and 
tactics of a battle without being scientific soldiers or 
sailors; they are not presumed to be lawyers or theolo- 
gians; so likewise they need not be bankers or stock- 
brokers to understand the salient features of our 
economic development. If you start to study any 
development from its beginning, at that point it is 
2

simple. Complexity is an accompaniment of growth: 
and ahistorical treatment has always this advantage 
that each stage is well understood before some addition 
is presented. The learner is never conscious that he is 
facing a complex system: he has, so to speak, seen it 
grow.
-P-A-G-E-29
CHAPTER II 
SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 
I—PRINCIPLE OF FULLNESS 
THE last chapter has shown that history should give 
some definite knowledge of facts, but that it is still more 
necessary that it should leave “impressions.” It is 
desirable fo amplify our views concerning these 
“impressions.” 
We have “ impressions ” of our friends; we know how 
we should expect them to act in certain circumstances 
or what they are likely to think about certain matters. 
We unconsciously modify our behaviour to suit their 
tastes. We say that we know “by instinct” how a 
friend will act. We mean that it is not the result of 
deliberate reasoning. We do not say, “A acted in such 
and such a manner on a certain occasion and in such 
and such a manner on another occasion; therefore he is 
likely to do so and so now.” We should often be 
unable to justify our “instinct” to any third person; 
for we have forgotten the facts which led to its forma- 
tion. The two points to which we specially wish to call 
attention are (1) the value of forgotten experiences, and 
(2) the fact that much of the knowledge which is of 
most use in the practical conduct of life consists of 
“impressions” that have never been thrown into words 
or even explicitly formulated in our minds. 
19  
-P-A-G-E-30
    20 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Another instance may be taken from our recollections 
of our daily routine at'some past period. We cannot 
recollect the sequence of events on any single day. We 
could not say at what time we got up, what walk we 
took, whom we met, or what we talked about. Yet we 
have a clear general impression of what we usually did. 
The impression has been built up out of particular 
experiences, but they have, so to speak, fused, and left, 
not a series of particular memories of separate events, 
but a composite memory of the whole. 
This is exactly the impression which we derive from 
a novel. If we were asked to write out what we recol- 
lected of it, we might find it difficult to fill a sheet of 
foolscap with incidents which we could recall. Yet our 
state of mind would be very different from that of a 
friend who merely read our single sheet. We should 
feel that we knew the characters, not so intimately, but 
in the same way, as we knew our acquaintances. If the 
scene were laid in a foreign country or in a distant 
period we should feel that we were more or less at home 
in these new surroundings. We could say in a moment 
if some new incident were or were not “in keeping” 
with what had gone before. If by some magical stroke 
we could be transferred to the surroundings of the novel. 
and meet its characters, we should feel less strange. 
Our readers will see the application. The good his- 
torian gives us a similar impression of his characters and 
of their age. Gibbon or Macaulay did not expect us to 
remember all the incidents they record. But though 
we forget all but a small fraction of what we have read, 
it is by no means the same as if we had never read it. 
Our knowledge is quite different in kind from what it 
would be if we learned by heart from a synopsis what 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 21 
we actually remember of the historian. In the one case 
we seem to know the period and the characters, in the 
other to know only facts about them: in short, by the 
reading of the detailed writer we have gained an 
“impression,” from the synopsis we have not. 
And what is the difference in the result? The 
“impression ” will last us through life, whereas the facts 
will one by one slip from memory till nothing is left. 
If we returned to the topic again the “impression” 
would be at our command, and we should be able to 
assimilate what we read at once; the abstract would be 
no help, we should feel in a strange land as much as if 
we had never read it. But more important still, the 
impression helps our judgment, it is part of ourselves, it 
has had some effect in modifying our thoughts and 
moulding our character. 
All this has been gained from quantity. Can suffi- 
cient quantity be given to a class in an elementary 
school in any measure to effect the purpose? The 
question may be asked in regard both to the social 
conditions of periods and to the character of great men. 
Social conditions are the bedrock of history. They 
cover the happiness or misery, the knowledge or ignor- 
ance, the taste or lack of taste, the virtue or vice, the 
enthusiasm or torpor, of the time. Progress can only 
be recognized if the social conditions of an earlier are 
compared with those of a later period. But it needs to 
be more than recognized ; it needs to be valued and felt, 
and this can only be if the social conditions of the two 
periods are realized and felt. The pupil must feel that 
he has lived for a time in each period. 
I well remember how I was obliged to learn English 
history out of a book which at the end of every half- 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
dozen chapters of narrative gave a special chapter to 
social conditions. How I hated those chapters! Even the 
narrative portions gave very little of a living picture 
of any period, but nevertheless I rather enjoyed the 
narrative chapters, especially if several of the characters 
were hanged, drawn, and quartered. Of course I did 
not realize the meaning which this imposing trio of 
words would have for the unhappy victim. But I 
looked forward pages ahead to see if one of the dreary 
chapters on social conditions was looming ahead, and 
its headings of food, clothing, houses, and customs 
inspired me with disgust. 
This repugnance is not to be accounted for by the 
nature of the subject but by the abstract method of 
treatment. Most boy readers could pass an excellent 
examination in the matters covered by these four head- 
ings for the society, if we may so call it, consisting of 
Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, or of Fenimore 
Cooper’s Red Indians. 
Perhaps the best instance, however, to show the 
possibility of giving a close familiarity with a state of 
society very unlike our own is presented by the book of 
Genesis. The matter is full enough to give a very vivid 
impression, but the length is not too great for school 
purposes. Not a syllable is given for the purpose of 
teaching social conditions; everything is narrative. Yet 
an almost perfect picture of nomadic society is given 
incidentally. When it first occurred to the writer that 
the narratives of the Old Testament might form a model 
for historical lessons to lower standards, he wrote down 
all he could remember under various headings without 
consulting the narrative and without having ever read 
it from this point of view. Nothing has been added to 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 23 
the list, but the references have been looked up and 
' inserted. The list runs as follows :—Diet of milk and 
cheese, varied by occasional venison from the chase or 
flesh of domestic animals (xviii. 6-8, xxvii. 3-4, 9, 17), 
tents (xviii. 2, etc.) and migratory habits (xii. 10, xill. 9, 
XXL, XxVi. I, xxxvii. 17), the kindly but despotic rule 
of the chief (xiii. 6-8, xxiv. 2-12, xxxv. 2-4), his power 
of life and death (xxii.), courtesies of conversation 
(xxiii. 4-16, xxiv. 15-31), morality enjoining hospitality 
(xviii. 1-5, xxiv. 31-33) and regard for oaths (xxiv. 3-8, 
xxvi, 28-31, Xxxi. 44-53), yet condoning sharp dealing 
(XXV. 29-34, xxvii. 6-29, xxx. 31-43) and treachery to 
tribal enemies (xxxiv. 20-26), occasional outbursts of 
savage ferocity (xxvii. 41 compared with xxxili. 4, 
xlix. 5-7), polygamy (xvi. 2, xxix. 25-27), jealous atti- 
tude with regard to the right of succession (xxi. 9-10, 
Xxv. 29-34, xlviii. 14-18), exchange by weighing silver 
(xxiii. 16), and worship on the whole spiritual (xviii. 25) 
and stirred by the clear desert sky (xxiv. 65), but still 
allowing reverence for sacred spots (xii. 7, xxviii. 16-18), 
‘keeping of ancestral images (xxxi. 19), and sacrifice. 
It is not suggested that a child would infer anything 
like as much from the book of Genesis; our contention 
is, not that he could give a list of features in patriarchal 
life at all but that he would have an “impression” 
which would tell him in a moment what was and what 
was not consistent with that type of life. When here- 
after we speak of giving a full or detailed narrative to 
young children, the reader will understand both the 
amount and kind of fulness which we desire by think- 
ing not of Macaulay or Grote but of the book of Genesis. 
Unless a vivid impression of social conditions is 
created, the great characters of history cannot be appre-
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ciated. Their claim to greatness can only be under- 
stood by realizing the state of affairs that preceded and 
that which followed them. For what is greatness but 
foresight of what makes for progress and will to realize 
it? And how can it be proved except by showing what 
was the good thing previously lacking or the evil pre- 
viously present, which the great man’s work supplied 
or abolished? “ The true benbbaceed of mankind is he 
who makes two blades of grass grow where there was 
only one before.” We appreciate the work of any great 
character in history when we see how many blades of 
physical, moral, intellectual, or zsthetic grass he has 
made to grow. It does not matter in what sphere he 
worked, whether he directly raised the moral tone like 
St. Francis, or expanded the outlook of mankind like 
the founders of schools, or produced material conditions 
suitable to intercourse and leisure like the geographical 
discoverers, or suitable political conditions like the 
kings, statesmen, and warriors; the real test of greatness 
in all cases is how he found society and how he left it.* 
It is the more necessary to emphasize this fact because 
we all take many of our estimates on trust. How many 
of the millions who accept Shakespeare as the greatest 
English writer would have discovered the fact for them- 
selves if his works had appeared anonymously in their 
own lifetime? It is doubtful, however, whether a 
teacher can give a convincing air of reality to an his- 
* Of course greatness is not always to be judged by success; 
the forces against the greatest man may be too strong. But, 
in cases of failure, we can only feel sure of greatness by reason- 
ing from the analogy of successful cases—e.g., a Protestant 
counts Wycliffe a great man, because he holds that later Pro- 
testants, who carried out the same policy successfully, made for 
progress.  
-P-A-G-E-35
  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 25 
torical personage unless he appreciates the grounds on 
which he bases his belief in his greatness. It is these 
grounds which will guide him, consciously or uncon- 
sciously, in choosing the incidents in his career which 
he will narrate, and it will unconsciously determine 
many of the touches which suggest themselves only at 
the moment of narration. 
An instance will make this clearer. Columbus is by 
common consent a great character. But quite a number 
of considerations have to be reckoned before we can 
appreciate either the significance of the discovery or the 
qualities needed to effect it. We are not referring to 
the fact that the credit of the discovery is shared by 
preceding geographers, or to the fact that he died in the 
belief that he had found a new route to Asia. We 
mean that the work of Columbus is only brought home 
when we realize (1) the geographical ideas of the 
Middle Ages and of most of his contemporaries, (2) the 
revolution in thought, politics, and commerce produced 
by his discovery, (3) the difficulties of the enterprise 
and consequently the qualities required to accomplish 
it. The second impression can only be developed 
gradually by a comparison of “impressions” of the 
Middle Ages and of the succeeding periods; the first 
and third will come to anyone who reads or hears a full 
narrative of Columbus’s expeditions. We will deal 
shortly with these two headings. 
(1) The medizval conception of the world may best 
be realized from medieval maps. Its flatness was 
almost an article of religious belief; all the unknown 
parts were filled in with marvels not calculated to allay 
the fears of would-be voyagers. Wild beasts, half- 
human monsters, whirlpools, sandbanks, masses of
-P-A-G-E-36
26 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
seaweed in which vessels would stick fast, regions im- 
passable from heat, agencies animate and inanimate 
which would drag to sure destruction ships which had 
passed the lawful limit, had been gathered from the 
fables of antiquity and the imaginations of storm- 
driven mariners to show the folly, if not the wickedness, 
of those who would attempt the hitherto unattempted. 
The atmosphere, if it is to be appreciated, must be lived 
with. The narrative must be slowly drawn out. The 
daily course of events must be traced, we must gradually 
unweave the panic caused by simple occurrences, the 
alternation of trust in the commander and alarm at 
some new appearance, the feeling of terror rising to 
mutiny as the voyage appeared to be passing beyond 
the bounds of the world till the class alternately hope 
and fear with the sailors, and the atmosphere of a 
voyage into the unknown has become a kind of 
experience. 
(2) Secondly, we come to the man himself. It is 
through the interest aroused in the man that any under- 
standing can be produced of the event. The most 
marked feature in Columbus’s character is his indomit- 
able perseverance. The one thing which his expedition 
does xot show is reckless foolhardiness, though, if care 
is not taken, we may easily suggest that such was the 
case. Such a suggestion is a serious crime against the 
spirit of history. It would be deplorable if it produced 
a similar effect on the characters of children; but this 
is rarely the case. More often it causes them to regard 
the characters of history as living under a special dis- 
pensation which makes their careers incapable of imita- 
tion. It is important therefore to realize the care with 
which Columbus gathered all the information known
-P-A-G-E-37
    GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 27 
to ancient writers or to his contemporaries, and how he 
was convinced that it all told in favour of the hypothesis 
on which the success of his voyage depended. It is 
true that one part of this hypothesis—the distance from 
the west of Europe to the east of Asia—was mistaken, 
but the other elements, the rotundity of the earth and 
the imaginary character of the popular superstitions, 
were perfectly well-founded. Thus the enterprise was 
dangerous, it was hazarding his safety on a hypo- 
thesis, but on a hypothesis in which he had good 
grounds for believing. Had success been certain, the 
grandeur of the exploit would be cancelled ; had he been 
playing a gambler’s stake we should congratulate him 
on his good fortune rather than believe him to have 
been worthy of it. The right view on this matter will 
be conveyed to a class in the dramatic form loved by 
the ancient historians. Columbus appears at the court 
. of Spain and unfolds the arguments on which he bases 
his hopes of success. The King’s advisers are all 
against him and attempt to show why his failure is 
certain. But he gains a modified permission to sail, 
though accompanied by conditions which it is hoped 
will deter him. His resolve, however, is not easily 
shaken: the modified permission only serves to rouse 
his activity. His character has thus been shown as one 
which will endure delays of years, rebuffs in many 
attempts, and will yet cling tenaciously to its purpose 
from a quiet confidence in the rightness of his judgment. 
It now remains to show him using the same fixity of 
resolve in the active control of the wills of others. This 
is effected by the same description of the details of the 
voyage which brings out the state of mind of the sailors. 
The growing alarm, the sights which suggested to the
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
sailors the truth of their superstitions, the disappoint- 
ments of the earlier indications of land, the mutinous 
murmurings of the sailors, the account of these incidents 
gathered from a full narrative such as Washington 
Irving’s life not only makes an indelible impression, but 
an impression of the right kind, exhibiting the essentials 
of the situation, the impersonation of scientific know- 
ledge set over against the impersonations of medieval 
ignorance, the man in whom danger stiffens in contrast 
with the crowd whom it confounds. 
This illustration was introduced to make clearer the 
notion of an “impression” of a man or of a period as 
opposed to the knowledge of certain facts about them. 
It also illustrates several subsidiary principles. (1) It 
is important to realize in what sense “detail” is 
desirable. Old-fashioned textbooks gave a great many 
“facts,” but no detail or fulness. A long recital of 
“facts” may leave absolutely no general impression. 
The distinction comes out if we contrast the account 
of a campaign from a textbook and one of about equal 
length of a battle by a graphic reporter. The number 
of statements will be nearly the same in the two cases. 
But the record of marches and counter-marches, sieges 
and skirmishes, presents nothing that will combine into 
an impression. Each statement covers so much that 
nothing is truly realized. “Ten thousand men marched | 
for three days from X to Y”; “they settled down 
to the siege of Y”; “the siege lasted six weeks”; “a 
series of desperate sorties was made”; these so-called 
statements of “facts” are not the statement of one fact 
but of hundreds. The first statement represents a series 
of occurrences which no one could watch from a hill or 
even from an aeroplane. Hour after hour, up hill and
-P-A-G-E-39
     GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 29 
down, this company ard that company of the battalion 
before and the battalio1 after, halting and resuming the 
march, starting in fresh vigour at sunrise, hot at noon, 
tired out at night, ten thousand separate conscious 
beings move on. A “fact”! It is millions of facts. 
Our “statement of fact” proves to be merely a stage 
in an intellectual sequence of symbols. We are not 
thinking of the ten thousand men but of a game of chess 
going on in the generals’ minds, which will work out to 
a certain result whether the pieces are really moved or 
whether both sides wrote down conventional symbols 
(P to K4, etc.) on a piece of paper. Such “statements 
of fact” are not therefore details in our sense, they are 
a violation of our canon of fulness—necessary at a cer- 
tain stage, but not making up for the detail which we 
want. A detail, as we understand it, is something 
which the eye could see or the ear hear or the man feel 
at a single moment. A battle may be described in such 
detail. Probably no one actually saw the incidents in 
this way, but a man in an aeroplane might have done 
so, and the imagination can do so. Interest may rush 
from the thoughts of a general to the imaginary sight 
of the execution of the order, then to its effect on the 
mind of the opposing general; but the thoughts remain’ 
concrete, we are not dealing in mere symbols. You 
can see the mass of troops advancing up the hill, you 
can hear the sharp orders of the officers of the force at 
the top, you can hear the volley and see the advancing 
lines changed into a confused mass; you can then be in 
Wellington’s place as he sees that it is the moment of 
advance, and again you can assume the réle of spectator 
as the British force advances to make the victory of 
Waterloo complete.
-P-A-G-E-40

(2) The detail must be selec'ed with an object. In 
the lessons on Columbus we firsi make up our mind that 
perseverance is the mark of tte man, and we choose 
details which produce the right impression. Graphic 
detail is too powerful a weapon to be wasted or mis- 
used. In how many a lesson on Alfred has the one 
graphic touch of detail been the eleventh-century fiction 
of the cakes, with the result that the children are left 
without the least impression of Alfred as a wise man, a 
good man, or a great man, but associated for ever with 
an episode which is mere clowning when it has lost its 
only point, as it must lose it if Alfred is treated as a 
mere name on which to hang this incident, namely that 
the wisest king of England who ever lived might be 
treated as a fool by one of the most ignorant of his 
subjects. Every teacher must be somewhat of the 
novelist or dramatist: he must know what effect he 
intends to produce, and then produce it by that form 
of art which is exhibited through extreme simplicity. 
He just tells a story: but the story has been arranged 
to give a picture of some aspects of an age or the char- 
acter of a man, and the indirect impression is far more 
real than any verbal statement of the character of either 
the individual or of the age could possibly be. 
Three stages are generally recognized in the teaching 
of history, the first that of the elementary school and 
lower forms of the secondary school, the second of the 
middle forms of the secondary school, and the third of 
its upper forms and of the University. This book is 
concerned with the first stage. But it is essential to ° 
see that, whatever additional elements the later stages 
may introduce, it is not by getting rid of the principles 
underlying the elementary stage, but by developing 
them. The human mind grows but is not meta-
-P-A-G-E-41
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 31, 
. morphosed. At the highest of the three stages, history 
is studied out of historical classics written by contem- 
poraries, and thus the atmosphere of the time is breathed 
in a more natural way than is possible on any other 
system, and impressions are gained at first-hand.* In 
the middle stage the principle of fulness has been too 
little recognized; but modern reforms are in the direc- 
tion of getting away from the compendium towards 
something fuller. What will be the eventual result it 
is too early to say. At present only one method has 
been worked out in such a manner as to fulfil the 
demands of fulness. This is the method of using ex- 
tracts from original authors,t which enables a much 
longer period to be covered than can be the case in the 
reading of a single historian, yet secures fulness of treat- 
ment for the particular events and characters which are 
selected. 
II—PRINCIPLE OF ACTIVITY 
In the higher stages it is well recognized that an 
attitude of mere receptivity will give a poor training 
in history. The pupil’s mind must be active. This 
activity, at the highest or University stage, takes two 
forms. The student is partly engaged in discovering 
* In saying this, we are afraid we are speaking of an ideal. 
It is often untrue of the pass courses in Universities, and is 
true mainly of the classical sides of schools where Ancient His- 
tory is correlated with the reading of original authors. 
} This method is the subject of Studies in the Teaching of 
History by M. W. Keatinge (A. & C. Black, 1910, 4s. 6d.). Several 
series of such books of extracts have been published, of which 
we may mention the English History Illustrated from Original 
Sources series of Messrs. A. & C. Black, Ltd., and the extracts 
in Keatinge & Fraser’s History of England for Schools (A. 
& C. Black), which are also issued separately in 8d. parts 
(Documents of British History).

  32 ' THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the truth of facts by reading and comparing the author- | 
ities, judging their trustworthiness, and coming to his 
own conclusions; he is also occupied in setting a value 
on the facts, in tracing relations of cause and effect, 
following a movement through its successive stages, and 
estimating the importance of events and the character 
of persons. Of these two ways of exercising the critical 
judgment, the second has always found some place in 
the secondary school, and Mr. Keatinge’s extract 
method is an attempt to introduce the first. We have > 
therefore to ask ourselves the question, What form must 
the principle of activity assume at the elementary stage? 
It seems best to distinguish sharply between the more 
technical aim of training historians and the more 
general aim of training thoughtful men and women. 
Historical experts are naturally inclined to attend a 
little too much to the technique of their subject. It 
remains, however, true that the canons of historical 
evidence are in a large measure the same as the canons 
of all evidence in human affairs. Who is the witness? 
Was he in a position to know the facts? Was he-cap- 
able of observing them correctly? Was he impartial 
and likely to form a fair judgment upon them? Was 
he truthful? Had he any reason for misrepresenting 
them? When we consider that the untrained mind ‘is 
naturally inclined to accept anything which it hears, 
and especially which it sees in print, to give undue 
weight to the evidence for the conclusions which it 
wishes to see established, and to adopt extreme rather 
than moderate conclusions, the value of such a training 
cannot fail to be recognized. But these tendencies have 
a far wider field in the interpretation of facts than in 
the mere acceptance. In courts of justice the jurymen
-P-A-G-E-43

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 33 
are rarely troubled by questions of direct evidence but 
by those arising from circumstantial evidence. Indeed 
the difficulties in estimating direct evidence on the main 
point usually resolve themselves into questions of cir- 
cumstantial evidence as to the credibility of witnesses 
and other auxiliary points. Hence a training in esti- 
mating historical evidence pre-supposes a training of 
the more general kind, in seeing the relations of cause 
and effect, in judging character from acts, in estimating 
what was possible or probable in given circumstances. 
We would not exclude a beginning in estimating 
historical evidence on the lines of Mr. Keatinge’s book 
rom the higher standards. A few cases in which con- 
radictory accounts or estimates are given by different 
uthorities might be invaluable in awaking the critical 
ense. But we have to remember that children under 
fourteen are incapable of using the critical sense in any 
very logical fashion and, though it is of the first im- 
portance to discover how far this is merely a matter 
of training, we cannot be very hopeful of the result, and 
herefore such methods must be introduced slowly, 
autiously, and tentatively. It may well be that a few 
instances fully treated, would by mere force of novelty 
produce a striking i impression on the mind which would 
be remembered in later life and afford an example of 
the critical attitude, while a number would deaden the 
impression without training a power which still lay 
dormant. 
_ Mr. Keatinge himself seems to share this opinion. 
e regards twelve as the normal age for entering on the 
“extract” stage, though some pupils may enter it sooner. 
Now twelve is a usual age for the brighter pupils who 
are proceeding from the elementary schools to secondary 
3 
     
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
schools to enter the latter. Thus, the elementary school 
is not concerned beyond the age of twelve with the 
pupils who show a special aptitude for literary pursuits. 
It by no means follows that an attempt should not 
be made to secure historical judgments of the more 
general kind. There are many matters in history on 
which the judgment can be suitably exercised at every 
stage. In one sense it is impossible for a pupil not to 
form judgments. The first conscious passing of im- 
pressions into judgments is usually the expression of 
like or dislike for certain characters. This can be ex- 
tended by encouraging the pupils to give reasons for 
these feelings. Thus, in course of time, judgments on 
the character of acts glides into judgments of their 
consequences, which are an important factor in estimat- 
ing the facts themselves. Thus the sequence is quite 
gradual from the simple judgment that Richard the 
Third was a very bad man to the most philosophic 
tracing of cause and effect. 
This is specially the case where books of extracts 
are used to give atmosphere. An account by an eye- 
witness is often the very best means of giving the touch 
of realism to the story. Books containing such extracts 
suitable for children in the lower stage are now pub- 
lished, as well as books of a more advanced character. 
Such narratives of eye-witnesses will often prompt en- 
quiries spontaneously from the children. Without any 
forcing the teacher will find himself following a line 
of thought suggested by the class; and this is the very 
best introduction to such’ methods.* 
* We have often been struck by the natural intelligence of 
children when they are allowed to “think all round” a story, 
and are convinced that their power of rational enquiry is often 
seriously under-estimated.
-P-A-G-E-45
  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 35 
Thus, side by side with vivid presentation of the 
facts stands even at the earliest stage the encourage- 
ment of discussion by the children. 
_ ILL—PRINCIPLE OF SELECTION AND REJECTION 
This principle necessarily follows from that of full- 
ness. In a measure there always has been selection. 
Only a small part of the incidents recorded by the 
chroniclers, only the minutest fraction of the material 
available in state documents has ever found its way 
into schools. Our principle means much more than this. 
A teacher is under no obligation to tell his class every 
fact which he knows or every fact which is recorded in 
a textbook written for college students or for secondary 
school pupils. The more fully we give the circumstan- 
tial and vivifying details of the events which we select 
the fewer events can be selected. 
The greatest enemy is tradition. When once facts 
have held their place in the classroom for a single 
generation, they acquire a vested interest. The life of 
history as an obligatory subject is as yet only one 
generation, its life as an “ extra” only two generations. 
Experience therefore supplies us only with experimental 
attempts which should bear their natural fruit in amend- 
ments, not with an old-established method which has 
been justified by time. 
The advisers of the Board of Education with regard 
to secondary schools soon recognized, as anyone with a 
sense of historical perspective must recognize, the un- 
satisfactory character of this tradition. “The first con- 
dition of good work,” they wrote,* “is indeed the 
* Board of Education, Teaching of History in Secondary 
Schools, 1908. (Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1d., post free 13d.) 
     
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
recognition of the fact that an attempt to give an equal 
and uniform knowledge of the whole of English history 
must fail. What should be aimed at is:— 
“(a) A clear apprehension of the general chrono- 
logical sequence of the cardinal events ; 
“(6) A fairly detailed study of those parts or aspects 
of the history which are at each stage of the school 
course not beyond the comprehension of the pupils.” 
“ Tt will be desirable to pass over with the very briefest 
notice those periods the history of which is merely a 
record of bad government, as, eg. the reign of 
Edward II. or those which are occupied with compli- 
cated and often squalid intrigues.” “At each stage 
attention should be concentrated, not only on what is 
important, but on that the importance and interest of 
which can be made intelligible to the pupils. For this 
reason it will often be desirable to pass over almost 
without mention much of the internal history of the 
eighteenth century, much of the political history of 
Charles II.’s reign, the internal history of the Lancas- 
trian period, the civil war of Stephen’s reign, in order 
to secure more time for a fuller treatment of events such 
as the Crusades, the Civil War, the reign of Elizabeth, 
the great struggle for Colonial supremacy, the War of 
American Independence.” 
All this applies even more forcibly to elementary 
schools, and it represented a great advance when the 
Suggestions for elementary schools were recently re- 
written on the same lines.
-P-A-G-E-47
CHAPTER III 
CHOICE OF MATTER 
ALMOST all countries except our own teach not the his- 
tory of their own country, but general history. 
The reasons are worth considering. Foreign nations 
have seen that history is a unity, that the existing 
civilization of Western Europe and America is the 
result of causes which go far back into the past and 
involve many nations besides themselves. Agriculture, 
writing, towns, money, ships, trade, monarchy were handed 
down to us by ancient Babylonia and Egypt. Our 
religion comes from the Jews, our art, philosophy and 
science from the Greeks, our ideas of law and political 
organization largely from Rome. In the Middle Ages 
Christendom was one. Movements which originated in 
one country spread to every other. The Church 
dominated the thought of mankind from Sicily to Scan- 
dinavia, from Poland to Ireland. Universities, once 
started in Italy, rapidly spread to France and England. 
The friars went everywhere. All Europe took part in 
the crusades. Later, cannon, printing, the Renaissance, 
and the Reformation spread so far that events in any 
ountry of Europe are inexplicable without them. The 
inventions of modern times are even more obviously of 
niversal importance. The motive for teaching general 
istory is clearly to be found in this inter-connection. 
While history was regarded almost entirely as a 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
record of wars and of the doings of monarchs, the reason 
which led England to confine its attention to its own 
history was that, from this point of view, English his- 
tory was far more self-contained than that of any 
continental nation. But why did the difference con- 
tinue after the old view of history had passed away ? 
Largely, because of a difference in political develop- 
ment. Continental nations found little trace in their 
existing political conditions of a gradual evolution such 
as they recognized in many other departments of life. 
They therefore turned their attention away from the 
political side of history towards other aspects. British 
history, on the contrary, reveals a record of progressive 
political development which can be traced back to the 
earliest times. In a word, Great Britain has been the 
political laboratory of Europe. Since 1789 continental 
countries have turned their backs on their political past 
and shown a tendency to imitate the British Constitu- 
tion. It is thus arguable that, just as in Greek history, 
the main political setting is Athenian, so some future 
race will study general European history, especially 
after 1550, from an English setting, and that our choice 
is, after all, not merely an insular prejudice. 
The issue is now clearly defined. In the first chapter 
we concluded that history has a general value as giving 
a broader outlook on all aspects of life, and a particular 
value as making our pupils wiser and more patriotic 
members of the British State. If we treat the two aims 
as of equal importance, we are faced by the fact that 
general history appears to be more favourable to the 
one and English history to the other. 
The subject-matter of the political side needs no long 
discussion. No one could imagine English history
-P-A-G-E-49
  CHOICE OF MATTER 39 
taught without mention of the Charter, the Barons’ War, 
Edward I. the rule of the Tudors, the Civil War, the 
Revolution of 1688, and some of the changes of the 
nineteenth century. 
The essentials of general history need more considera- 
tion. We have not time in a school course to include 
-all the world’s greatest men. For instance, Alexander 
and Hannibal, Charles the Great and Barbarossa, 
Genghis and Timur excel most of the characters of 
British history in romantic interest; Buddha and 
Socrates are superior “for example of life and instruc- 
tion in manners”: yet we must not admit such char- 
acters into our scheme merely because they make a 
striking appeal to some side of human nature. Nor 
again must we include all the institutions which pre- 
sented striking marks of greatness in their own day, 
such as the Byzantine or Holy Roman Empires. These 
omissions we make with reluctance; but concentration is 
the only road to success. Our pupils must tread the 
great high-road of progress from a definite starting- 
point to a definite goal, stopping only at the greatest 
landmarks and not turning aside along avenues, how- 
ever broad and magnificent, which do not lead to the 
end of the journey. That end is the present day. But 
on our journey, we hope that there will be no depart- 
ment of human interest which will not have its repre- 
sentative character. If we do not take Charles the Great 
we shall tell of Alfred; if we leave out Socrates, we 
include Sir Thomas More; if we do not march with 
Alexander, we shall sail with Sir Francis Drake. We 
can limit our wanderings in time and space without 
narrowing our outlook on the varieties of human 
endeavour and aspiration,
-P-A-G-E-50
  40. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
But the highroad of history does not pass entirely 
over British soil; the Reformation sprang up in Ger- 
many, the expedition which discovered America set sail 
from Spain. Along much of its course, however, it is 
international, and during those parts it may be fol- 
lowed as well in England as in any other country. If 
a course based on English history, but not hesitating 
to step aside where necessary, can really introduce the 
main movements of medieval and modern history, there 
are two strong arguments for adopting this solution. 
The first is the political argument. If our history 
course consists of two main threads, one the general 
development of civilization and the other the growth of 
British institutions, it is best that these two threads 
should be as far as possible interwoven. The second 
argument is found in the need of the “clear apprehen- 
sion of the general chronological sequence of the car- 
dinal events” spoken of in the last chapter. A broad 
road has many advantages, but if it is so broad that 
we cannot read the signposts we may lose our way. 
To show that ‘British history may for the most part 
be taken as representative of the great movements of 
European history, we propose to go shortly through 
these leading movements. 
(a) Dark Ages—Modern history begins with the 
downfall of the Western Roman Empire. The first 
movement of modern history is therefore the series of 
Teutonic incursions which swept that empire away and 
reduced Europe to barbarism. British history chronicles 
one group of such incursions. Though the conquest 
was more merciless, more gradual and more complete, 
yet it is in a sense representative of what the Western 
Goths were doing in Spain, the Vandals in Northern
-P-A-G-E-51
  CHOICE OF MATTER 41 
Africa, the Eastern Goths and Lombards in Italy, the 
Franks and Burgundians in France. The general effect 
in all cases was that the old world passed away and 
civilization had to be reconstructed. 
Next there steps on the scene the protagonist of the 
medieval drama, the Roman Church. Nearly two 
centuries later this new Roman power achieved the 
reconquest of Britain, and this victory may stand as 
representative of those by which it had already won 
the Franks from heathendom and the Goths and Lom- 
bards from Arianism. Not only is this an instance of 
the representative character of British history: if we 
consider the part played in the revival by Irish 
Christianity, the influence of which spread in turn to 
Scotland, England and the Continent, the British Isles 
may claim a pre-eminence as regards the really spiritual 
side of the recovery. 
The Dark Ages exhibit few outstanding features. 
Accounts of barbarians cannot interest children for 
long. Unless, however, the barbarism is realized now, 
the progress will not be realized later. It would be a 
mistake therefore to turn away from the barbaric West 
to the civilization of Constantinople and the great 
struggle at the gate of Christendom between the 
European and the Saracen: this may be reserved till 
we reach the Crusades. But, in dealing with the bar- 
barian tribes, we should look for those features which 
show the approach of better things and contrast them 
with the surrounding darkness. Two such indications 
stand out with some clearness, (i.) Celtic learning and 
(ii.) the occasional appearance of a king who saw what 
kingship might do for a half-civilized race. 
(i.) The most inspiring feature of the age was the
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
movement marked by the names of Columba the apostle 
of Scotland, Aidan the apostle of Northern England, 
Bede the type of the workers who strove for piety and 
learning in the earlier monasteries,Winfrith (Boniface) 
the English missionary to the Germans, and Alcuin the 
Englishman who went’ at the request of Charles the 
Great to spread education on the continent. But the 
ecclesiastical light should be used to show up the secular 
darkness not to make our pupils forget it. 
Gi.) Of the kings who introduce an element of order 
into the chaos of this period, Charles the Great and 
Alfred stand out conspicuously. Through the 
biography of Alfred we may give children an idea of 
what government meant in its simplest form, when the 
welfare of every branch of national life depended on 
the King. Alfred, too, introduces the invasions of the 
Northmen, of which the consequences, immediate and 
remote, were of great importance in the development 
of Europe. In this period therefore England is par- 
ticularly representative. 
(6) Later Middle Ages—Throughout the more 
enlightened period of the Middle Ages two institutions 
determine the social conditions of Western Europe, 
Feudalism and the Church. nh 
The former regulated the life of the military class and 
of the agricultural masses. Traditional teaching has 
done full justice to its military side, and the life of 
knights and barons must be fairly familiar to all school- 
children. The reason is not far to seek. Military 
Feudalism left its monuments in ancient castles, was 
chronicled in contemporary literature and appealed to 
writers of succeeding ages. In striking contrast the life 
of the people, the true social condition of the age, has  
-P-A-G-E-53
  
CHOICE OF MATTER 43 
not received adequate treatment. Few children have 
even asked themselves how the land was tilled, where 
the corn was ground, how the cattle pastured, or what 
were the food, the dress and the houses of the bulk of 
the population. All that is covered by the term the 
“Manorial System” is generally a sealed book. 
As Feudalism regulated material life, so the Church 
controlled the inner life of thought and outlook. 
The Church naturally suggests the Papacy, monas- 
teries, cathedrals, the friars and Universities. But some 
effort should be made to show how it entered into the 
life of the ordinary villein. Two periods must be dis- 
criminated, the earlier in which the Church was sup- 
ported by the common people, as the defender of the 
oppressed, and the later, when its chief organs had 
become corrupt, when the Papacy had first become an 
instrument in the hands of the French king and after- 
wards a house divided against itself in the Great 
Schism, when monks and friars alike were regarded as 
self-seeking robbers of the laity, when bishops had 
become rich and arrogant politicians and the higher 
clergy unscrupulous pluralists, and only a residue of 
parish priests were respected as real spiritual advisers 
of the people. 
Of the other features of the Middle Ages, two deserve 
special mention. The one, the Holy Roman Empire, 
we mention only to put aside. The struggle between the 
Pope and Emperor is sufficiently paralleled in English 
history* and the dream of a universal Empire which 
would be in the civil world what the Papacy was in the 
* E.g., in the struggles between Henry I. and Anselm and 
between Henry II. and Becket.
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
religious world, remained unrealized. The other feature 
to which we referred is the life of the towns—the city- 
states of Italy, the Hanseatic League, and their English 
counterparts. Unlike the Empire, these formed a fruit- 
ful source of progress and deserve careful consideration. 
The institutions of the Middle Ages yielded but 
slowly to change. The age regarded fixity as a law. 
Individuals might pass away, but the same classes and 
institutions would ever remain. Men might strive for 
ideals of holiness, but they conceived of a perfect 
morality as a perfect working of the old machine, with- 
out breakdown, mismanagement, rusting or foreign 
bodies clogging the wheels; they did not think of 
improvements in the machine itself. And so with good 
government, social life and learning. Yet the Middle 
Ages were subject to change, like all other ages, 
and we have to describe such changes. We must 
include in our syllabus the spread of chivalry, the com- 
ing of the Friars, the Crusades, and the movements 
which herald the end of the Middle Ages, such as 
lollardry and peasant revolts. 
In the Middle Ages English history may on the 
whole be treated as representative. 
As regards the various features of Feudalism, includ- 
ing the Manorial system and chivalry, the material left 
from the Middle Ages in Domesday Book, feudal castles 
and the literature of chivalry is sufficient to show the 
representative character of British history. The 
Crusades fit in well with the framework of English his- 
tory, but we agree with the secondary school circular 
that they “should not be treated as an isolated incident 
in connection with the Third Crusade, but there should 
be a connected account of the First Crusade, with the
-P-A-G-E-55
  CHOICE OF MATTER 45 
establishment and fall of the Latin kingdom of Jeru- 
_salem.” Indeed we think that this is the place for 
giving an account of the life of Mohammed and of the 
earlier spread of the Saracens. Mohammedanism is an 
important fact to-day, one of those facts which throw 
light on the politics of the world. The significance of 
the Third Crusade is entirely lost if the pupils do not 
see that it was an attempt—and a feeble attempt—to 
regain what had once been won in the First Crusade 
and had since been lost. 
As regards the Church, the chief points in which 
English history is defective are that it contains no king 
who, like St. Louis of France, combines kingly qualities 
with the mediaval ideal of piety, and that the work 
of the friars cannot be adequately set forth unless we 
take St. Francis of Assisi to show what its spirit of 
devotion really meant. Anselm and Becket represent 
the conflicts between Church and State sufficiently well. 
Monasteries, Universities and church buildings present 
no difficulty. The reign of Henry III. illustrates the 
change of popular feeling towards the Church and its 
causes. Chaucer and Piers Plowman give ample 
material for describing the progress of its decadence, 
and Wycliffe provides a biography in which to incor- 
porate this material. Lastly, the career of Joan of Arc, 
who, like George Washington, has acquired a place as 
an adopted English heroine by beating the English, 
brings the earlier and purer enthusiasms of the 
mediaeval church into contrast with its later degeneracy. 
The life of towns, their commerce, handicrafts, gilds, 
and traditions of freedorn depend for their successful 
treatment largely on local interest. The subject does 
not lend itself easily to biographical treatment. More
-P-A-G-E-56
    46 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
interest will be aroused by the use of local material than 
by describing the city-states of Italy. 
Thus an English framework will enable us to deal 
with all the main aspects of the Middle Ages provided 
that we incorporate the First Crusade, St. Francis of 
Assisi and St. Louis of France. 
Side by side with these general movements we must 
recount events which determined the growth of the 
English Parliament. 
(c) Renaissance Period The Middle Ages were a 
relatively stable period: the period which follows is an 
age of rapid change. The chief alterations were the 
disappearance of feudalism and the substitution of 
highly centralized monarchies, the revival of classical 
learning and the disappearance of scholasticism, great 
geographical discoveries, a general refinement of life, 
and the Reformation. In Eastern Europe the fall of 
Constantinople must be mentioned, but no “ impres- 
sion” has to be created, since Mohammedanism has 
been already dealt with. 
The change in thought which accompanied the fall 
of scholasticism is obviously beyond the comprehension 
of children. They will only be able to understand the 
revival of learning to a very limited extent; perhaps the 
invention of printing is the one accompanying circum- 
stance which they will really appreciate. ' There is 
nevertheless an indescribable atmosphere about the best 
humanist attitude which reveals its charm even to those 
who cannot intellectually comprehend it. Sir Thomas 
More is the best individual example, the reign of Eliza- 
beth exhibits it best as a period. Indeed, the combina- 
tion of learning with nobility of character and refine- 
ment of manners is better exhibited in England than in
-P-A-G-E-57
CHOICE OF MATTER 47 
  any other country. As a rule the Italians united 
learning and refinement with a disregard of morals, 
and the Germans displayed much erudition without 
refinement. 
Owing to the number of new impressions that have to 
be created, the sixteenth century needs to be treated at 
considerable length. 
Two of its great movements can only be explained 
by reference to the Continent. (i.) The commercial and 
naval activity of the reign of Elizabeth was a direct 
result of the discovery of America, and a far more 
adequate impression of the importance of that event is 
created if we recount the voyages of the earlier 
explorers, ¢.g., the efforts of the Portuguese to find a 
way to the Indies round Africa, and continue the narra- 
tive of discovery in America beyond Columbus as far 
as Magellan’s voyage to the Indies and the Spanish 
conquest of Mexico and Peru. Even after interest has 
been concentrated on the contest between this country 
and Spain, its significance to Europe will be more fully 
brought out if we can find time to turn briefly to the 
struggle in the Netherlands and to its heroic figure of 
William the Silent. The development of the British 
Navy, and the change from the galley to the sailing 
ship, is of the first importance in connection with later 
history. (ii.) The English Reformation can only be 
understood in the light of the German. The issues in 
Germany were far clearer, and the story is moré easily 
concentrated, round an individual. The German 
Reformation means for our purpose the life of Luther. 
In England no single reformer can be put into a position 
of pre-eminence; indeed many of the instruments of 
reform cannot even be treated with respect. Behind 
the stage a real and deep-seated desire was operative 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
48 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
to remove corruptions which had been felt since the time 
of Edward III. but there is a danger that nothing 
should be visible to the audience but the egoism of 
Henry VIIL, the pagan virtuosity of Cromwell and the 
greed of Somerset and Northumberland. If, however, 
the emphasis is thrown on Luther and if Sir Thomas 
More is introduced to show the feelings of devout 
reforming Catholics, there will be enough personal 
interest to tide over the difficulties inherent in treating 
a somewhat sordid period. 
In this century therefore every movement has its 
English representatives, but foreign scenes have to.be 
added to the English acts to complete the drama. 
(d) Modern History—F¥rom 1600 to 1689 we find 
no great revolutions either of thought or of social condi- 
tions, but quiet progress in knowledge and comfort. 
This progress is distinguished by no great historical 
events. There was considerable scientific advance, but 
the discoveries were not such as could be applied to 
industrial life. The Thirty Years’ War left the position 
of the contending parties substantially unaltered, and 
the lack of any aim beyond territorial aggrandizement 
deprives the continental wars of interest. Thus there is 
little in the way of incident in those departments of life 
in which progress was international. In the political 
sphere, the seeds of freedom that were sown in the 
Middle Ages began to sprout in England while they 
were killed on the Continent. Thus the political inci- 
dents which specially interest us are confined to Great 
Britain and centre round the Civil War and the Revolu- 
tion. The enormous colonial and mercantile expansion 
that began from the time of James I. must. not be 
overlooked. ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  
‘CHOICE OF MATTER 49 
After 1689, however, this country enters on the period 
in which it definitely built up its existing position as a 
world-power. The struggle for naval and colonial 
supremacy lasted for over a century, and involved us in 
seven great wars. While we can afford to disregard 
most of the continental aspects of these wars, their naval 
side and their effect on England are of the first impor- 
tance. 
A new epoch in industrial history begins in the 
middle of the eighteenth century, the effects of which 
were, however, until 1815 largely confined to Great 
Britain. The agricultural revolution as yet receives 
inadequate recognition in popular history, though the 
industrial revolution is duly emphasized. 
As to the moral aspects of the period 1601-1815 three 
divisions can be marked. The first was an age of 
strenuous conviction. We shall certainly try tocreate an 
“impression” of Puritanism. It is more difficult to give 
a sympathetic appreciation of the quiet but cheerful 
serenity of the life of many a Royalist household in the 
times of Charles I. Its existence is chiefly revealed in 
literary sources, and is not associated with camps and 
parliaments. The Caroline divines, like the Caroline 
poets, cannot well be introduced into a school course. 
Charles I. himself: has to be its embodiment. The 
second division looked askance on large enthusiasms 
and rated material splendour too highly; Europe took 
its cue from the French monarchy. Owing to the pro- 
fligacy of the Court we generally think of the reign of 
Charles II. in this connection; but among the bulk of 
the people there was probably a steady decline from 
the Restoration till some date well within the 
Hanoverian period. In the third division a serious

view of life reappears. In England the motive power 
was religious and began with the Wesleyan revival; 
there also began in the time of the elder Pitt a purifying 
of politics aed does not seem to have originated with 
the Evangelical party, though the relations between 
Wilberforce and the younger Pitt show that the two 
movements co-operated. .

the modern period of English history from 1800, and 
that it could not be treated with sufficient clearness to 
make a series of real “impressions” since Oriental, 
Greek and Roman history all require separate groups 
of ideas. But we should undoubtedly recommend that 
an outline of the history of the great Oriental monarchies, 
Egypt, Babylonic, Assyria, and Persia, should be given 
in connection with the course in Old Testament history, 
as in this case the Bible has already given the “ impres- 
sion” and only the facts remain to be taught.
-P-A-G-E-65
  CHAPTER IV 
SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 
J.—SUITABILITY OF PERIODS TO YOUNGER AND 
OLDER CHILDREN 
IT is generally true that the periods before 1600 are 
more easily understood by younger children. This 
statement admits of exceptions; many aspects of the 
Renaissance are quite outside their comprehension, and 
the legislation of Henry II. or Edward I. outside their 
natural interests, while it is easy to quote later incidents 
such as Gunpowder Plot, Charles II’s concealment in 
the Oak, or the expedition of the Young Pretender, 
which undoubtedly interest the youngest children. But 
the instances themselves illustrate the truth of the state- 
ment. The incident of the Oak is, like the “ oak-apple” 
itself on its parent tree, a mere excrescence upon his- 
tory, which does not help the hearer to understand the 
life of the age: while “Prince Charlie” derives his 
interest from the fact that the Highlands were still in 
the Middle Ages long after England had reached the 
modern period. 
It is difficult to explain briefly the difference 
between the “romantic” and the “modern” but 
a few points are outstanding. In‘ the romantic age 
men are moved to action by their emotions and passions 
55 
®
-P-A-G-E-66
56 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
rather than by the conventions, good and bad, of civili- 
zation. Rights are more what a man can enforce, law 
what will be enforced on him. Morality is the order of 
a superior, crime consists in disobedience. Everything 
is concrete. The State is the King, or those who for 
the time are more powerful than the King. Power 
means military strength, and military strength means 
more than to-day a dexterous right arm. The more 
obvious qualities of character, not the finer touches, 
count for most; and men show their qualities with less 
reserve. There are more clearcut villains; there are also 
more reputed saints—for the road to the stake was 
easier. Words counted for less and actions for more. 
Now children’s minds are crude and understand only 
the crude. Acts that strike the eye and ear, qualities 
that meet with unmitigated approval or condemnation, 
are the only things which they can appreciate. If we 
add that the relations of society in the Middle Ages 
were simpler, that legislation is less prominent, and that 
warfare was much less scientific,* it is easily seen why 
young children understand and enjoy medieval his- 
tory. The reign of Elizabeth is both romantic and 
modern; Drake and Sir Richard Grenville belong to the 
Middle Ages, Cecil and Bacon to the modern period; 
probably it was the width of human experience that 
came of living in two worlds that gave Shakespeare his 
extraordinary knowledge of man. 
Are we then to make use of this love of the romantic ? 
The idea that, because children like a thing, it is good 
for them, will not bear universal application. It is 
doubtful if we should ever come to care for the modern 
period as much as for the medizval, unless we were at 
* The last is the only purely material element.
-P-A-G-E-67
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 57 
some time compelled to study it. While, however, we 
would not postpone recent history to that imaginary 
time when children would prefer it, yet we recognize 
that medieval history is necessary to its comprehension, 
and since it is necessary, let us use the natural instincts 
of the younger children and teach it first. 
In the earliest stage of history the King is the 
embodiment of law and justice and defends his people 
from wrong-doers at home and from invaders from 
abroad. The acts of such a King give the simplest 
notion of the function of government, viz., the protec- 
tion of life and property, and of its machinery, viz., the 
issing of orders, seeing that they are obeyed, and 
punishing those who do not obey. All these are com- 
bined in an Alfred. Such a stage of government in the 
State corresponds to the young child’s experience of 
government as administered by his parents and 
teachers. 
Later, two changes are found taking place: first, 
government grows more complex, and the King is 
unable in person to exercise all the powers necessary to 
achieve its ends; second, diversities of interests arise 
and with them a balance of power. In neither case is 
the new impression hard to create if the earlier impres- 
sion has been allowed time to develop. 
The story of Henry II. gives an opportunity of intro- 
ducing the first of these two ideas. He was a king 
who plainly intended to exercise the functions of king- 
ship, to protect his subjects from oppression and to see 
that those who did wrong should be punished.* The 
greatest wrong-doers were the robber barons, and _ his 
* Doubtless finance affords the key to much of his enthusiasm 
for good government. See page 155. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
58 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
first act was to demolish their castles, a decisive pro- 
ceeding which children can appreciate. His Court was 
open to all comers, and anyone who felt that he had a 
grievance could bring it before the King. Here is an 
opportunity of giving a personal setting to the 
grievances of the age and of throwing them into 
dialogue form. The King’s tours round the country 
provide further material for ingenuity. The class can 
accompany him and see any part of the administration 
_ of justice they wish—ordeal or wager of battle; they 
will soon come to realize that the task was beyond the 
, powers even of a King who was a wonder of physical 
strength, restlessness and power of work. In Becket 
they will see a great officer of state, in the days when 
officers of state were only the companions and friends 
of the King, who took a share of his work and advised 
him like a friend,* but exercised no independent power. 
They will thus come to understand the need of such 
delegations of power as the establishment of itinerant 
judges. t 
Diversities of interests are already foreshadowed in 
the quarrel between the King and Becket. Both thought 
they had a just cause, and the story should present 
both points of view. Conflicts between different powers 
in the state are more clearly seen in the reign of John, 
when a large body of persons is found enforcing a 
decision on the King himself. We are still, however, 
* The relations are shown by such stories as that of the King 
and Becket’s cloak. 
+ We entirely omit all attempt to present the constitutional 
arrangements of Saxon or Norman times. Councils have to be 
introduced just as in Homer, but Homer does not enter into 
a constitutional discussion as to their composition.
-P-A-G-E-69
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 59 
outside the constitutional sphere; the question is not 
what right the Church and Barons had to demand that 
John should set his seal to the Charter, but whether they 
had the power to compel him to do so. Simon de 
Montfort introduces a new stage; though physical 
\power is still the chief requisite to redress grievances, 
a constitutional machinery was invented to assist it. 
The children’s interest is not centred in this machinery, 
yet the teacher’s chief object in choosing the story may 
be to introduce it. Parliaments will henceforth enter 
incidentally into many episodes, as they do into Shake- 
speare’s historical plays, but in no case will they be 
introduced as the main point till the later period. Even 
Edward I’s Model Parliament may be omitted and 
the division into two chambers in Edward IIIs reign 
mentioned quite casually.* 
The chief political lesson of medizval history is to 
create an idea of the objects of government rather than 
of its machinery. The burden of constitutional teach- 
ing falls on the later period. This is shown merely by 
reciting the chief features of the modern .constitution 
which were unknown in earlier times—the supremacy of 
Parliament and in particular of the House of Commons, 
the Cabinet system, the separation of the judicature 
from politics, the extension of the Franchise and the 
organization of Local Government under popularly- 
elected bodies. 
II.—THE “ CONCENTRIC ” SYSTEM 
The previous section suggests that we cannot be far 
wrong in following a chronological order and in spend- 
* Local government in the Middle Ages will be introduced 
in connection with the local borough.
-P-A-G-E-70
60 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ing the bulk of og time in the lower standards in 
teaching the earlier history and in the upper standards 
in teaching the later period. At some stage in the 
middle of the school the earlier period would have to 
be revised, perhaps in Standard IV., but this will suffice. 
This conclusion is, however, in complete opposition to 
the plan which has prevailed for the last few years with 
the approval of the Board of Education, which is gener- 
ally known as the concentric system. The name “ con- 
centric” is used in a different sense in history and 
in geography. In history it is applied to a system of 
frequent repetition. The whole of English history is 
repeated in a number of successive standards, and it is 
supposed that new matter is introduced each time. 
This method, which no longer has the authority of the 
Board, seems to us to be a violation of every true prin- 
ciple of teaching history. The objections may be con- 
sidered under the following heads :— 
(1) It is a method of “bare bones,” not of fulness. 
(2) It introduces different periods so closely together 
that the ideas of the periods, are confused. 
(3) It makes a chronological framework impossible. . 
(4) It neglects the suitability of different periods for 
children of different ages. 
(5) It takes away the interest that comes from fresh- 
ness. In other words it is bad both from the point of 
view of understanding (1-4) and of interest (4 and 5), 
both as regards method (1) and curriculum (2-5), both 
as regards unconscious assimilation (1 and 2) and 
deliberate formulation (3). 
(1) If at the earliest stage five lessons on any topic 
are needed to leave any real and lasting impression, 
we should only be able to take about twelve topics
-P-A-G-E-71
  SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 61 
in the year. In the lower standards, the selection of a 
very few biographies might conceivably enable adequate 
time to be given to each; but higher in the school whole 
movements must, under the concentric system, be dealt 
with in single lessons. In fact, since the system has 
been in vogue, we believe that only one lesson has in 
most schools been given to each biography. Hence 
lasting impressions are impossible. 
(2) If the whole of English history has to be covered 
in a year’s work we are compelled in the course of a 
single term to deal with four such different sets of con- 
ditions as prevailed during the British period, the 
Roman Occupation, the Saxon Monarchy and the rule 
of the Normans. But, what is worse, after the children 
have passed through the Middle Ages, the period of 
discovery, the era of colonial expansion and the 
Napoleonic Wars, they are again thrust back into bar- 
barism, and the whole sequence of the twilight of civili- 
zation, the consolidation of order by the strong right 
arm and the age of chivalry is gone through once again. 
Experience shows that the result is too often complete 
confusion. Have we not all seen classes to whom his- 
tory is an interminable series of Edwards, Henries, 
Jameses and Charleses, of kings, chancellors, bishops 
and generals, of wars, rebellions, religious differences 
and legislation, to whom the differences between periods 
mean nothing? Hereward rebels, Perkin Warbeck 
rebels, Charles Edward rebels; Alfred fights, Drake 
fights, Wellington fights; Becket is put to death, More 
is/put to death, Monmouth is put to death; such is the 
impression in which all periods are merged. The only 
contrast is between this shadowy history and the real 
_ life of the present. Men do not rebel now, are not 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
ree ‘ 
62) EE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
beheaded now: the policeman, the postman, the lamp- 
lighter are not found in history, nor do the older boys 
find any mention of the factory, the shop and the foot- 
ball field. Such is the confusion that many children 
would not, we fully believe, be surprised if at the third 
time of repetition, amongst the “additional detail” 
which is then to be given, they heard of improvements 
in cannon made by Alfred, or of Becket’s treatment of 
Nonconformists, or of factory legislation passed by 
Edward I. 
(3) The idea of “before” and “after” in time only 
arises from hearing of events in succession. Where 
information is gained by reading, events are largely 
localized by the part of the book where one looks for 
them. In an endless circle they become incapable of 
localization. Children often become so vague in their 
chronology that they will tell you that some event 
occurred in the reign of King Henry or King Edward 
without any regard to the fact that eight kings bore 
the one name and seven. the latter! Possibly a rigid 
memorizing of the kings and queens such as that to 
which we were subjected in the old days might avoid 
this danger: at present we fear that few children taught 
on the concentric method would arrange in even an 
approximately correct order the thirty-nine reigning 
monarchs. 
(4) The method necessitates teaching even the 
youngest classes something about comparatively recent 
times, with the result that the later period becomes a 
mere patchwork of noble deeds. The time spent on a 
treatment of isolated incidents in the history of the 
last three centuries is taken away from that which might 
be devoted to the simpler periods.
-P-A-G-E-73
  
SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 63 
(5) But by far the greatest objection is the loss of 
that freshness which is essential to interest. The state 
of familiarity without knowledge which has been 
deséribed above makes the work of the teacher in the 
middle standards almost impossible. How great is the 
contrast. between this attitude and the love which chil- 
dren display for the stories of history when they are 
new and when they are made to last so long that the 
characters become real like the characters in a novel. 
If history is to regain life, if characters and periods 
are to mean anything to children, if the objects for 
which the subject is taught are not to be sacrificed 
to an unsuccessful attempt to get the dry bones remem- | 
bered, the concentric system must disappear. 
III—THE “ POLICEMAN ” THEORY OF TEACHING CIVICS 
We have strongly advocated the view that a real 
understanding of the functions of government can only 
be built up by presenting to the younger children only 
the simpler forms, allowing time for the assimilation of 
these, and then gradually leading them on to the more 
complex stages, so that in the highest standards they 
may have a large stock of well-digested knowledge 
which will enable them to grapple with the political 
developments of the last century. 
In opposition to this view we sometimes see put 
forward a most remarkable and perversely ingenious 
suggestion which has been described as the “ Police- 
man” theory, since its adherents usually urge us to 
begin with the policeman, as the agent of the govern- 
ment best known to children. We are then told to raise 
the question who appoints the policeman, and after
-P-A-G-E-74
64 ‘THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
that by a sequence on the lines of “The House that 
Jack built” we are to go through the whole hierarchy 
of the British Government. 
The obvious retort is, But who does appoint the 
policeman? The matter is regulated by 51 and 52 
Vict. c. 41. In counties he is appointed by the Standing 
Joint Committee of the Court of Quarter Sessions and 
the County Council; in county boroughs and larger 
non-county boroughs by the Watch Committee of the 
Town Council. To go back a stage further would 
exhaust our reader’s patience. Take any official you | 
please, and you will always find that he is appointed 
either by a government department or by an elective 
body, and in neither case have we any point of approach 
from which to secure the comprehension of children in 
the lower standards. 
The idea seems to be based on a curious interpreta- 
tion of the old dictum, “ Proceed from the known to the 
unknown,” and we may say in passing that there seems 
to be no pedagogic proceeding, however absurd, which 
cannot be defended by an ingenious perversion of these 
vaguely stated “maxims.” We presume that this par- 
ticular maxim is a proverbial way of expressing either 
(@.) the truth that new information is assimilated by 
means of what is already clearly understood, or (ii.) 
the fact that the recognition of something familiar in 
the midst of what appears strange often arouses interest 
in the whole complex. But new information is not 
assimilated by means of what is merely familiar, if it is 
not understood ; and though the child is familiar enough 
with the policeman, he no more understands his place in 
the social machine than most of us understand the 
familiar mechanism which winds up our watches. Nor
-P-A-G-E-75
SOME PROBLEMS OF ARRANGEMENT 65 
has familiarity any charm in itself; we could hardly say 
that our interest is greatly aroused by a coal-scuttle, 
though we use it every day. 
Experience soon decides the matter. Children are 
interested in King Alfred and they are not interested 
in the Watch Committee. The simple notion of king- 
ship is derived from the analogy of parent and child 
or teacher and pupil; this simple notion must be well 
understood and as personified in an Alfred must 
excite interest before the next step is taken, and 
similarly at each stage. Any method which tries to 
explain the nature of government in a lesson or a short 
course of lessons is foredoomed to failure. Such funda- 
mental ideas are not realized in a day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
CHAPTER V 
THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 
I 
THE facts needed in order to teach history on these 
lines will often be different from those which a student 
of history ordinarily considers of most importance. 
The teacher exercises the privilege of selection to a much 
greater extent than the student. The dominant move- 
ments, incidents, and characters are to him everything, 
minor movements, incidents, and characters nothing. 
Among the classes of facts which interest the teacher 
less than the student are constitutional matters. Their 
importance has been exaggerated by recent historians 
for two reasons; their point of view is that of the lawyer 
or politician, and the facts themselves are more subject 
to proof. Except where we are on the high road of 
constitutional development, teachers need concern them- 
selves little with such facts. Again, whole wars and 
campaigns which an historian would never think of 
omitting are immaterial to the teacher. Or again, facts 
which are open to dispute find particular favour with 
the historical student; they are a means of training or 
displaying his powers of judgment; but the teacher of 
children, though he loves to enlarge his impression of 
characters by seeing how they impressed men of various. 
66  
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 67 
points of view, both friends and enemies, has little place 
for the disputed fact, unless it is in itself of great im- 
portance. 
Such are the matters which we omit; in preference we 
include whatever serves to give us an impression of the 
times, or of particular characters. 
(@) An idea of an age is not confined to pictorial 
impressions. Food, clothes, houses, furniture, and travel 
are indeed included, but they are not the most important 
element. They have to be considered, partly because 
they determine more important elements, and partly 
because they give the flesh and blood without which 
the spirit of the time cannot reveal itself to children. 
They make the difference between a dramatic represen- 
tation and a declamation of the parts. 
Far more important than these stage accessories are 
the thoughts and feelings of the people, or rather of 
different classes; for baron and villein, Roundhead and 
Cavalier, monk and parish priest would think and feel 
differently. The impression of the time is built up out 
of the sum total of the impressions of these various 
divisions. , 
First come their religious beliefs. We cannot dispose 
of these with a label, nor can we be satisfied by knowing 
the significance of a creed to its official exponents. We 
must know how each class felt towards it, how far it 
influenced the conduct of each, and in what way. 
Superstitions, such as those connected with witchcraft, 
are as much a part of medieval belief as its nobler 
elements. The same creed may embrace a different set 
of motives at different times and with different classes. 
Secondly, did men regard their work as something 
settled by tradition? Were they eager for improve- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
ments in methods? Was there pride in skill? Did 
they look on existing classes as part of a necessary order 
and as sharply divided one from another ? 
Thirdly, we are interested in their attitude to other 
classes, the loyalty of clansman for chief, the care of 
chief for clansman, the racial animosity often observed 
in a subject community, relations of rich and poor,@the 
mutual feelings of countryman and townsman, the atti- 
tude of various lay classes to the clergy, and the desire 
of different classes for political power. 
Fourthly, we wish to know something of family rela- 
tions, how husband and wife, parent and child, master 
and servant treated one another and thought of one 
another. 
Lastly, it is not unimportant to know what were 
people’s interests outside their work. What were their 
intellectual interests, what were their amusements? 
What did they talk about? How much did they know 
of what was going on in the world? 
These social facts lie outside the sphere of State 
activities, viz., legislation, administration, justice, and 
fighting. Teachers require less knowledge of the latter 
and more of the former. We should view the State 
more as it appeared to the subject than to the states- 
man. How would an aggrieved individual have set 
about seeking justice? Would he have obtained it? 
What immediate superior did he fear? Did he feel his 
life and property secure? If the answers involve politi- 
cal issues, then these issues are important, otherwise 
they are too technical. Similarly some knowledge of 
military methods is necessary to make our descriptions 
living, but here again we need not be highly technical. 
Generalizations will not be given to a class. But they
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 69 
enable a teacher to shape the material which is ultim- 
ately presented in narratives and biographies. There 
are many ways of telling the same .tory, and the details 
will be related very differently according to the feature 
which the story is meant to illustrate. 
5) We next consider what knowledge the teacher 
needs of individual characters. To know a man is to 
know his temperament, habits, dominant motives and 
capacities. 
A man’s temperament decides whether he is quiet or 
energetic, grave or gay, impulsive or deliberate, self- 
assertive or retiring. It does not mean make him good 
or bad, but it may determine his special virtues if he is 
good, or his most conspicuous vices if he is bad. A 
man’s dominant motives form an essential part in his 
goodness or badness, though our thoughts are not always 
reflected in our actions. We ask, therefore, what were 
his aims and ideals, whether he set himself any tasks 
in life or merely drifted with circumstances. His habits 
show us how the tendencies of his temperament had 
developed, and how far his motives had come to in- 
fluence his conduct. With a man of weak character 
they show how he had been influenced by his surround- 
ings, though even the strongest are not free from such 
influences. Lastly come his cafacities; and, though 
many persons of small capacity have been brought into 
prominent positions by circumstances, yet history is 
primarily concerned with men and women of more than 
ordinary capacity. Some of these capacities are well 
recognized. Such are foresight, self-control, military 
skill, and the power of keeping a large mass of facts 
before the mind at the same moment. But there are 
other qualities which it is much easier to overlook,
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
especially those which go to make up “ force” ; qualities 
which largely explain the success or failure of historical 
characters. The power of undergoing strain is often 
a decisive factor in history. It is not a purely physical 
fact ; it is not identical with the capacity to perform long 
feats of physical endurance or to undergo hardship 
without detriment to health. It implies rather that the 
judgment, the will and the capacity for making a de- 
cision are little affected by physical and mental strain; 
that whatever energy is left is turned into nervous force, 
that the machine, even if it is being worn away, does 
not become erratic or break down altogether. Napoleon 
probably possessed this power in an exceptional degree. 
Closely allied is the power of turning emotion into 
motive. The lasting effect of impressions which have 
once stirred the feelings* marks those who have accom- 
plished great tasks as opposed to those in whom such 
impressions occasion a great temporary nervous dis- 
turbance, which confuses action rather than directs it, 
but produce little in the way of lasting consequences. 
It is largely on the presence or absence of these funda- 
mental qualities of the will that historical characters 
have depended for success or failure. 
Such analyses of character cannot be expected of 
children; but a very different lesson will be given by a 
teacher who has an insight into the character of his 
subject from that which will be given by the mere 
purveyor of facts. Is it any exaggeration to say that 
Henry II., Simon de Montfort, and Warwick the King- 
maker as represented in most lessons are colourless per- 
sonalities? There are characters of whom the same 
would not hold generally true; something of the knight- 
* Luther and Wesley may be quoted as examples.
-P-A-G-E-81
THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 71 
errant is usually brought out in the delineation of 
Richard I, the spirit of the Revenge and Westward 
Ho! may be noted in lessons on Drake; and Charles I. 
frequently receives a sympathetic treatment. A study 
of the characters of the former trio would reveal features 
which are capable of making any one of them of almost 
equal interest. 
I 
Now these facts which it is important for the teacher 
to know may be very different from those which he 
learned as a student. The ordinary teacher is not often 
an historical specialist, but he has studied the outlines 
of modern history, he is acquainted with its chief move- 
ments, he has followed the development of the modern 
constitutional state and the economic advances of recent 
times. He has in short been initiated into history as a 
science which has ceased to be a chronicle of kings and 
deals with causes and effects. But there is a danger in 
attaching excessive importance to a relation, even to the 
important relation of causality: in our zeal to find the 
proper relation we may forget the things related. It is 
quite easy not only to understand symbols and to write 
answers about them, but up to a point to reason with 
them correctly, without attaching more than the 
minimum of reality to them. Battles and campaigns 
can be thought out on paper. A student of history can 
detect the strength and weakness of a policy, can antici- 
pate the probable commercial effects of an economic 
change, without thinking of a single human being who 
was affected or feeling a single touch of human sym- 
pathy. It is almost a matter of chance whether success- 
ful students of this science of relations have behind the  
-P-A-G-E-82
72 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
symbols a picture of the realities. Original authorities 
are no safeguard; statutes and charters may drive us 
further into symbolism; extracts may be read, as data 
for a conclusion, like so much evidence in a court of 
justice; consecutive chronicles may be treated as text- 
books of facts. Letters can scarcely fail to be vivid, but 
even letters dip us'in reality only for a moment when 
we require to be soaked in it. The great Greek his- 
torians, unlike most modern historians, were almost eye- 
witnesses of the events: yet many a student, nay, many 
a commentator, has read Thucydides, intent on follow- 
ing the strategical and political reasons which deter- 
mined the course of the war, anxious to discover the 
place of each speech and incident in the dramatic con- 
ception, yet without a touch of the pity or awe for which 
a Greek drama was expected to provide an occasion. 
It is surprising, when one comes to think of it, how 
few historians other than biographers have reflected 
characters in the same way as dramatists and novelists 
have created them. Herodotus, though full of anima- 
tion, has not left us a single portrayal of character; 
Thucydides’ characters are sketches of the impressions 
they made on the public; we feel that Pericles never 
leaves the platform, and that we are listening to the 
gossip of the street corner about Alcibiades. And of 
how many: modern historians can we say that we feel 
sympathy when their characters meet difficulties, relief 
when they overcome them, pathos when they fail, the 
sense of tragedy when they go to their doom? There 
would have appeared to be some cardinal defect in the 
nature of history had it not been for the writer of fiction 
when he enters the same field either to write history or 
to utilize historical material in his novels. Mr. Andrew
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL = 73 
Lang’s Joan of Arc is full of tragedy; Mr. Rudyard 
Kipling’s defenders of the Great Wall* are as living as 
any of his modern soldiers; Mr. Hilaire Belloct puts us 
in the position of the bystander on the road to Runny- 
mede; Mr. Fletcher has recently introduced something 
of the same kind into true history. Though the sifter 
of evidence rarely delineates his characters with the 
artist’s touch, there seems to have arisen a school of 
middlemen who have the genius to feel and to paint 
what the researcher has seen, who can enter into the 
heart of the cave-dweller, the early Briton, the medieval 
villain, or the Elizabethan “ sea-dog,” and can make the 
dry bones of an ancient barrow, of Westminster Abbey, 
or of a country churchyard once more live. 
Til 
It must not be thought that we are advising teachers 
not to read historians; we are only trying to show that 
historians alone will not suffice. It is the researcher's 
work which has made the more imaginative presenta- 
tion of history possible. Before the age of scientific 
history some of the finest intellects in the world en- 
deavoured to portray their country’s past. Homer, 
4éschylus, Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Scott are but 
a few names out of many. Yet Shakespeare’s kings are 
all Renaissance princes; they are true to life, but to the 
life of the sixteenth century; they think and feel, but 
they think and feel as contemporaries of the poet would 
have thought and felt. Scott came later. The romantic 
revival was developing a sense of historical perspective.

74 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
His readers would have seen the anachronism of making 
a Crusader think like an elder of the kirk, as they would 
have refused to accept a portrait of Richard I. in a 
Hanoverian wig. Scott’s characters were no longer 
mere duplicates of those who were walking the pave- 
ments of Edinburgh or the glens of Perthshire, but they 
were largely the creation of his contemporaries’ imagina- 
tion. At best they were men and women of the Middle 
Ages on dress parade. Reality was hidden behind the 
trappings of idealism. Chronological accuracy in 
matters of thought and custom mattered as little as 
accuracy of detail.* é 
Now accuracy of detail is a pedantic requirement of 
an historical novelist; but a novelist is not historical 
unless he interprets truly as well as vividly the thought 
and feelings of a period. And, to succeed in this aim, 
he must use the results of the critical historian. The 
twentieth century can no more see history through the 
eyes of Scott than the nineteenth could see it through 
the eyes of Shakespeare. 
A few instances will show that it is not merely on 
matters of detail but on most essential points that our 
views may undergo modification. The claim of Magna 
Charta to be the “great charter of English liberties ” 
now rests only on consequences which were never in the 
mind of its authors or visible to contemporaries. The 
Reformation of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. instead 
of opening higher education to the poorer classes by the 
foundation of grammar schools, has been proved rather 
* In real history the age of chivalry is to be found in the 
fourteenth rather than in the twelfth century, and the feelings 
of Scott’s Saxon for his Norman master are those which his 
grandfather was more likely to have experienced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 75 
to have slammed in their face the door which was open 
in the Middle Ages. The “glorious Revolution,” which 
was to Macaulay the fountainhead of an ideal govern- 
ment, though a stimulus to reform a hundred years later, 
established for the next century, in the place of a 
monarchy sometimes good and sometimes bad, an 
oligarchy which was ‘incurably selfish and invariably 
corrupt. 
It is clearly useless to consider the means of giving 
an impression, whether of a man, of a period, or of a 
movement, till one has decided on the impression which 
one wishes to give. The selection of illustrative 
material must vary according as we wish to delineate 
the Cromwell of Clarendon or of Carlyle. We must 
decide whether we wish to represent the Crusades as 
inspired more by religious fervour, by love of fighting, 
or by the commercial interests of Italian cities. Accord- 
ing to our conclusions Peter the Hermit, Richard the 
Lion Heart, or the perpetrators of the Fourth Crusade 
will dominate our narrative. Or again, shall we repre- 
sent the Middle-Ages as a time when ignorance and 
oppression were more than compensated by chivalry - 
and religious zeal? Or do we hold that the thought of 
knights and of friars has led us to overlook the general 
sordidness? Our answer must be clear; otherwise, the 
romance of Scott’s novels or the regret of devotional 
spirits for the “ages of faith” may lead us to represent 
one aspect of the period as the whole. 
IV 
We have endeavoured to show that the strictest 
accuracy is compatible with complete lifelessness, and
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
that the most vivid description may be grossly inac- 
curate. Consequently a teacher must first relate himself 
to his facts in two ways. (i.) He must discover from 
critical historians the true significance of men and move- 
ments; (ii.) he must steep himself in the spirit of the 
age and know the chief actors as he knows the char- 
acters in a play or novel. Then he has to select typical 
characters and ingeniously to interweave his impres- 
sions of the age into their biographies, and this neces- 
sitates a more special study of their careers. Finally 
he sometimes feels it necessary to look up in a work 
some point of reference which cannot be omitted without 
loss of vividness. 
We assume that a teacher who is not a specialist is 
preparing a course on a period which he knows only 
from school study. It is easier to proceed on this 
assumption than to fix some higher standard and add 
notes for the benefit of those who have studied the 
particular period less fully. Each reader can easily see 
what processes can be curtailed in his own case. 
(a) First he needs to determine*the essential features 
of the period from an historical standpoint. In this 
preliminary study there is more danger of too detailed 
a perusal of the textbook than of inadequate reading. 
The object at this stage is not to amass facts which can 
be taught, but to realize the general trend of events 
which stamp the period as a stage in the development 
of the people. The power of rapidly reading a good 
book and imbibing from it a general impression is the 
fundamental requisite. Little need be committed to 
memory. The reader should use his judgment all the 
time. He should be particularly on the watch for 
estimates which strike him as novel. Thus anyone
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 77 
whose views have been gained either directly or through 
textbooks from historians of twenty years ago may 
find it particularly stimulating to read an exponent of 
quite recent views, such as Fletcher; though others who 
are unfamiliar with traditional views may run a risk 
of too readily accepting novelties if their novel quality 
be not adequately recognized. Though the recency of 
a view makes its truth more probable, it is far from 
insuring it. The most recent writer may be uncon- 
sciously biassed; and in history there is a peculiarly 
strong tendency to lay stress on the opposite standpoint 
from any which has in the previous decade been over- 
- emphasized. 
Apart from a consecutive history, some broad exposi- 
tion of a particular aspect of a period is often of great 
value. A striking instance is Seeley’s explanation of 
the wars of the seventeenth century as the struggle of 
Britain for naval and colonial supremacy. Such an 
interpretation affords a clue through the mazes of cam- 
paigns, tactics and diplomacy which otherwise appear 
meaningless. It enables us to distinguish between 
events of permanent and transient importance. The 
teacher will be well advised to plunge early into such 
interpretative writing. It is more stimulating; it shows 
what history really means; it sends the reader back to 
his store of facts with more interest, more understand- 
ing and more power of selection. Fortunately, a num- 
ber of volumes in the “Home University Library ” 
series, written by experts, deal with such aspects of 
periods. We may. mention the books on Mediaeval 
Europe and on Sea Power. 
One more suggestion is necessary. We said that 
historians are most interested in the political aspects of
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 THE TEACHING OF. HISTORY 
life. This is less the case than in the past. For in- 
stance, the industrial progress of the last century and a 
half is fully recognized. But the economic history of 
earlier periods is still inadequately treated; as an his- 
torian once put it to us, for every hundred peop!e who 
know the date of Waterloo, only one could tell that of 
the introduction of the turnip; the particular commercial 
needs which led to the Crusades and to the geographical 
discoveries of the fifteenth century are, in schools at 
least, not yet given the important place which they 
deserve; and the manorial system, town gilds and the 
history of the woollen industry are still too often treated 
as esoteric mysteries which are for some reason beyond 
the comprehension of children, though they are ex- 
pected to comprehend military strategy and legislative 
enactments. Townsend Warner’s Landmarks in 
English Industrial History will be found an invaluable 
introduction to this field.* c 
(6) From this general reading the teacher will know 
what were the important aspects of his period, its main 
movements, and the chief actors. No doubt some 
degree of vividness has been acquired incidentally, but 
the imaginative element is probably subordinated to 
the intellectual. A course of reading is now necessary 
which shall give a sense of familiarity with the period 
and with the actors. Here nothing avails but quantity. 
Fortunately the reading may be of a light kind, and 
there need be no conscious learning. Impressions are 
just allowed to soak in. Historical novels are now in 
place; the reader has the knowledge to reject incorrect 
impressions, and the impressions given by good his- 
* We can also recommend Burrow’s Industry and Trade and 
Lipson’s Economic History (A. & C. Black).
-P-A-G-E-89

THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 79 
torical novels always contain part of the truth. The 
spirit of chivalry which surrounds Scott’s novels may 
represent the feelings of only a few persons, and of'a 
later date; but, even if we have to transfer the impres- 
sion from the time of Richard I. to that of the Black 
Prince, yet Ivanhoe and The Talisman will create an 
atmosphere which strictly historical reading could not 
give. With historical novels must be classed modern 
historical poetry. 
Less likely to give misleading impressions are the 
writings of contemporaries. They may give the point 
of view of one class or party only, but such points of 
view are essential. Chaucer and the author of Piers 
Plowman give a different impression of contemporary 
England, but both impressions are necessary to our 
appreciation of their age. Friars may not have been 
so black as Piers Plowman paints them; but the fact 
that sincere laymen could so regard them is itself an 
important feature of the time. Criticism of the writings 
must be supplied by more strictly historical study; but 
criticism is one thing, reading to gain vivid impressions 
is another. < 
This illustrative reading will not entirely precede or 
entirely follow the selection of biographies for teaching. 
The teacher’s ideas have been unconsciously consolidat- 
ing, and no precise moment of selection can be fixed. 
A guess as to the biographies which he will choose will 
doubtless guide the choice of reading under this second 
heading. As the selection takes more definite shape, 
the reading will gradually limit itself to the matters 
selected. With this we enter on a new stage. 
(c) The teacher has now selected. the series of narra- 
tives for his term’s or year’s course on the period, has 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
80 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
    determined the aspects and movements of which he 
desires to create an impression, and the men round 
whom they may be grouped. He will not see forthwith 
precisely how all the details will work out; for instance, 
the significance of the Church to various classes in the 
Middle Ages will need to be brought out little by little 
in various biographies, and the apportionment will be- 
come clearer as the reading of material more directly 
bearing on those biographies proceeds. For this reason 
a teacher will probably modify his scheme considerably 
the second time he works through it; and, as he will 
continue to read new material each time he gives the 
course, modifications are continually to be expected. 
The teacher then has chosen a particular biography 
for one chief reason, has noted other impressions as 
suitable for incidental introduction, and has other im- 
pressions which ‘he wishes to introduce somewhere in 
the course though he has not yet determined in what 
particular story. The object of his reading is now to 
obtain material for the story which he is working into 
shape. 
This reading will consist of some or all of the follow- 
ing elements: (1) Parts of a larger history concerned 
with the hero,* (2) a modern popular biography, such 
as those in the Twelve English Statesmen and Men of 
Action series, (3) modern illustrative material, (4) selec- 
tions from contemporary writers, if these writers are 
published in a readily accessible form and have some 
individuality, (5) extracts from contemporary author- 
ities in such series as English History from Original 
Sources or the Illustrative Histories. This reading is

THE COLLECTION OF MATERIAL 81 
intended to supply information, ideas and vividness 
alike, though the vividness can only be insured in the 
case of books of extracts, where the task of selection has 
already been performed. 
By way of example we will assume that the Early 
English period is being studied, that the teacher has 
determined the outlines of his treatment on the lines 
suggested on pp. 119-122, and has divided it into four 
stories for teaching: (1) Coming of the English, (2) the 
Conversion of the Barbarian, (3) Alfred, (4) Harold. We 
can now give examples of the reading suggested at this ~ 
stage. 
(i.) General Textbooks already read at an Earlier 
Stage—The teacher now reads more carefully those 
portions which specifically help him in the preparation 
of his series of lessons. We will assume that the books 
are Oman* (the more scientific view), Hodgkint (a 
more picturesque treatment), Freeman’s Old English 
History for Children (for a general idea of the treatment 
suitable for children). 
(ii.) Modern Biographies.—The Dictionary of 
National Biography, if accessible, will be of great 
value. For Aidan, Bright’s Early English Church 
History and Hunt’s History of the English Church to 
1066 might be looked at. Bury’s Life of St. Patrick 
will be useful if he is included. For Boniface reference 
might be made to G. F. Brown’s Boniface of Crediton 
and his Companions. 
(iii.) Modern Illustrative Material—The Winged Hats 
in Puck of Pook’s Hill suggests how we can bring out 
the feelings of the representatives of civilization towards

the wave of barbarism and their forebodings that it 
would eventually prove too strong for them. The 
chapter in Belloc’s Eyewitness called “The Danish 
Boat” gives a graphic account of a Danish raid, told 
from the point of view of the raiders. 
(iv.) Contemporary Writers—The translation of 
Bede in Dent’s Everyman's Library, and of Asser’s Life 
of Alfred, edited by J. H. Giles (Bohn Library), may be 
skimmed. 
(v.) Extract Books—The volume in the English His- 
tory Illustrated from Original Sources series contains 
many useful extracts. The series of extracts in the 
Illustrative History, British and Old English Period* 
illustrates the departure of the Roman Legions, the 
coming of the Saxons, the saints and Alfred.t 
When the individual lesson is being prepared, the 
teacher may find himself in doubt as to details of cus- 
toms, dress, food, armour and other matters, for which

a convenient book of reference.

  CHAPTER VI 
CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 
To lay down general principles of method is always 
dangerous. No teaching device has any merit in itself : 
its value depends on time and circumstances. The age 
of the pupils, their previous training, their stock of ideas, 
their interests and capacities, the precise nature of the 
previous lessons may make a particular device either 
mental food or mental poison. Nor can the individuality 
of the teacher be ignored. An impromptu joke may 
impress a principle on a child’s mind for ever. There is 
probably no outstanding merit in the joke; its effect is 
due partly to the teacher’s relations with the child and 
partly to his exact intuition of the child’s state of mind. 
If this is true of a small incidental matter, it applies also 
to more fundamental devices. We can thus see why a 
method like Miss Findlay-Johnstone’s dramatic teaching 
of history may be a magnificent success when carried out 
by its author, and may completely fail in other hands. 
The author brought her personality to bear in an 
individual way on the pupils and worked out the details 
of her procedure from a sure intuition of the contents of 
their minds; in the case of the imitations, teacher, pupils 
and circumstances are all different. But methods which 
have once proved a success will always remain sugges- 
tive. There will be probably hundreds of cases where, 
given the necessary intuition to adapt the methods to 
83
-P-A-G-E-94
    84 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
the circumstances, the conditions are sufficiently similar 
to make the methods successful. 
J—AcTIVITYy v. RECEPTIVITY 
The great difficulty which besets the teaching of his- 
tory is that so much information has to be given. 
Modern teaching rightly insists on what the pupil does 
rather than on what he takes in. This principle is 
true in two senses. First of the final result of a study 
on the learner. Its value is to be estimated in terms of 
power or capacity. The power may be intellectual, 
moral, esthetic or practical; the study may have 
developed judgment, character, taste or skill. But 
knowledge which does not result in improvement in 
one of these directions has little value. Secondly, but 
in a different sense, it is true of the interests 
of the young child entering school. He is chiefly 
interested in what he can do with his hands. 
Knowledge appeals to him mainly in so far as he dis- 
covers that without it he cannot do something which he 
desires, whether it be a feat of bodily skill or the shaping 
of a concrete product. 
Purely oral teaching is defective from both points of 
view. The pupil’s attitude may degenerate into pas- 
sive receptivity, in which his only duty is to remember, 
and beyond the capacity to recall the narrative for a 
longer or shorter period, no lasting effect is produced. 
His interest may at the same time gradually die away 
as he finds that he has only to sit still and listen, and 
that no scope is given for initiative or bodily movement. 
_ The two factors, (1) absence of physical activity, and 
(2) failure to create intellectual power, are thus closely 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 85 
connected. They are, however, different ; and it is neces- 
sary when we use the term “activity,” to be clear how 
far we are speaking of intellectual and how far of 
physical activity. In teaching history, the cultivation of 
intellectual activity is our aim, and the use of physical 
activity is one—and one only—of our means. 
Both ends and means must be kept in view. The 
teacher who is too exclusively concerned with the pupil’s 
eventual attitude to the subject, will take up too intellec- 
tualist a position; he will forget that the young child’s 
interests are largely practical, will direct his attention 
too early to judgments and relations, and, will attempt 
to make him think historically before he is capable of 
doing so. On the other hand, the teacher who only 
“follows” the interests of the children, instead of using 
them for his own purpose, will let the means overshadow 
the aim; he will turn his history teaching into modelling 
and drawing lessons, impromptu dramatisations, visits 
and excursions, without taking care that each of these 
exercises has its share in fulfilling his object, which is to 
create historical ideas. 
In the upper standards we fear that the training of 
intellectual power is too little regarded. Let us there- 
fore consider what are the usual differences between a 
pupil of thirteen and one of eight which call for a change 
of procedure. 
(1) The older pupil in reading a book is not engrossed 
by the task of interpreting the symbols and is able to 
devote his attention to the sense. The main objections 
urged against the textbook, after this difficulty has 
been overcome, are (a) that pupils cannot read it intelli- 
gently, and (4) that we lose the adjustment of the matter 
to the pupil’s powers which comes from the direct con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
86 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
  tact of teacher and pupil. The latter consideration 
undoubtedly proves the need of oral teaching, but not 
of exclusively oral teaching. It is an argument which 
could be applied to the teaching of arithmetic or wood- 
work no less than to that of history. But the teacher’s 
guidance need not be exercised continuously in order 
to be continuously effective. Otherwise no place is 
allowed for the mental activity of the pupil. The former 
objection is really an argument on the other side. If 
the pupil cannot read a book with intelligence, it is 
surely necessary to train him to do so before he leaves 
school. It is true that he will not acquire this power by 
being set to learn a textbook without guidance; but 
this proves not that textbooks should be avoided but 
that guidance should be afforded in their use. 
(2) Writing is now available. Thus note-taking, 
making of abstracts, written answers to questions, and 
the construction of maps and diagrams have begun to 
be possible. 
(3) It may be hoped that the idea of time has been 
formed. There is of course a sense in which the idea 
of a century can never be fully grasped any more than 
the idea of the distance to the moon. What we mean 
is such an idea of time relations as will prevent the pupil 
from contemplating the meeting of people who lived in 
different centuries and will permit him to realize the 
sequence of the steps in a gradual development, such as 
that of the British Constitution. It largely depends on 
the teaching in the previous stages whether the pupil’s 
scheme of time relations is adequate. 
(4) A large stock of impressions has already been 
gained. We may now relax the elaborate care which 
we have hitherto taken to avoid the introduction of any-
-P-A-G-E-97

thing except in large quantities to ensure a lasting im- 
pression. We have no longer to create a background 
that is absolutely new. The teacher must, however, 
make sure of its presence and not act as if it were there 
when it is not. 
(5) Intellectual interest should already have been 
awakened and with it intellectual power. The pupil 
will anticipate more intelligently the lines of conduct of 
characters and will appreciate in a more historical spirit 
the probable consequences of actions. History will 
neither be a replica of the nursery nor a lawless dream- 
land. Children’s intellectual progress must not, how- 
ever, be exaggerated; the wisest statesmen make 
mistakes about the present, and it is equally hard to 
appreciate cause and effect in the past. It is only when 
a teacher can gauge a pupil’s appreciation of causality 
in a particular case that he can use that particular case 
to enlarge the power; and this implies experience, sym- 
pathy, thought, and an historical spirit; it constitutes 
the fine art of teaching history to an upper standard. 
It is clear therefore that more intellectual activity can 
be expected of older children and that more obvious 
scope is allowed for their intiative. Hence the problem 
of finding some manual outlet for activity is not so 
pressing. With children of eight, on the contrary, 
manual work is a necessary means of developing the 
merely instinctive love of stories into true intellectual 
activity. 
II.—PLOT AND CHARACTERIZATION 
The “Principle of Fullness” has its maximum of 
force in the case of younger pupils. At the end of the 
first lesson they have just become eager to hear more
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
about a person, he grows more and more living as the 
story develops during several periods, and by the end 
a lasting impression is created. 
We may derive many hints from the dramatist or the 
novelist. We need a plot, not a mere sequence of 
isolated events. The meaning of this can be illustrated 
from Shakespeare’s historical plays. King John, Richard 
the Second, Henry the Fifth and Richard the Third 
have a plot; the second and third parts of Henry the 
Sixth are a mere series of incidents. A plot implies that 
a situation is created which needs a solution and that 
we are not satisfied till we have heard it. When Alfred 
becomes an exile, we wish to know whether he recovered 
his crown or was captured by the Danes. When 
Henry II. and Becket quarrel, we wish to know whether 
the quarrel was adjusted, or, if not, which of the two 
accomplished his aim. This plot must work itself out 
in stages. There must be “acts” or “chapters.” One 
“act” is completed when Alfred hears of the Danish 
Invasion, another when he is in flight, another when 
he has gained his first victory. The lessons must be 
arranged to end at a marked point in the story. The 
old monthly serial was careful to leave the reader in 
suspense before the words “to be continued in our 
mest, 
Then there must be characterization. The hero must 
stand out clearest. But there will be need of a few 
clear characters besides; for it will be difficult for one 
"man to represent all the leading aspects of a period. 
But every minor character need not be clearly delineated ; 
even Shakespeare has his “second murderer” and “third 
messenger.” But real live country-folk are needed to 
convey the atmosphere of a period; how else can we
-P-A-G-E-99
  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 89 
bring out the attitude of the common people to Becket, 
the significance of Wat Tyler’s rebellion, or the devotion 
of the Highland clans to their chief ? 
Generalizations as to social conditions must be 
avoided. These conditions must be suggested either 
by the words and acts of the characters or by what we 
may call the “scenery” and “ dresses,” including under 
these headings descriptions, as well as pictures and 
drawings, of concrete things. The former method will 
be most used for conveying thoughts and feelings, the 
latter for depicting what was visible to the eye. 
In some cases evidence is available for reconstructing 
even conversations. This should be used, but free 
adaptation is permissible. We need not, however, be 
deterred by its absence, if we know enough of the time 
and circumstances to recognize what will be in accord 
with them. We may use the freedom of the historical 
dramatist or novelist and of those who arrange our his- 
torical pageants. The Old Testament always gives us 
a record of conversations in direct speech, never a digest 
of the arguments. Children and races in the childish 
stage of development always wish to hear the characters 
speak, and it is by this means that they come to feel 
at home with them. 
There must throughout be progress in the action. 
Descriptions must be rare. They cannot: altogether 
be avoided. In the first narrative which plunges the 
children back into barbarism, the amount that has to 
be eliminated from the present environment—streets, 
houses, fields, hedges, roads, railways—is so great that 
explicit description is indispensable. We cannot by 
merely incidental allusion eliminate all these familiar 
objects and supply in their place a background of moor,
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
forest and fen. On the rare occasions when the oral 
teaching becomes descriptive rather than narrative, we 
must resort to pictures and models to arouse an interest 
which pure description lacks. The nature of these 
stories can best be- understood from examples. We 
therefore append an outline of a course on Caradog,* 
Alfred,t+ and Becket, in the chapters dealing with their 
respective periods. 
With upper standards quantity is still desirable, but 
it necessitates less introduction of imaginative elements. 
Biographical treatment is still best, provided that the 
subject lends itself to it; Cromwell and Clive afford us 
biographies which may be told in “acts” and “ scenes,” 
but extracts from sources and from good historians will 
take the place of the more imaginative setting. But the 
history of the nineteenth century can hardly be told 
ftom the biographical standpoint; industrial progress, 
social reform, political change and the growth of colonies 
have gone steadily on, assisted by many minds, but 
controlled by none. 
II]—TEACHING OF LOWER STANDARDS 
Though the general plan of a series of lessons to 
Standard I. on Caradog and to Standard V. on Clive 
may be similar, the procedure will vary considerably. 
Information is given to Standard I. entirely by the 
teacher and in the form of narrative; in Standard V. the 
teacher will sometimes read extracts aloud and the class 
can read silently for themselves. A different kind of 
question will be needed to stimulate mental activity. 
The process of fixing the matter which has been learned 
* Page 112. + Page 125. ¢ Page 171,

  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON gl 
will be more systematic in the upper classes. Note- 
books and abstracts are beginning to be possible, short 
periods may be set aside for revising the facts which 
have been taken in class. This section will therefore be 
confined to the teaching in lower standards. 
Apart from an occasional visit or expedition, the 
teaching in these standards will practically always con- 
sist either of narrative or of handwork. The difficulty 
of sustaining interest during the narrative constitutes 
our main problem. Experience convinces us that young 
children find great difficulty in listening to an oral 
lesson for three-quarters of an hour. It convinces us 
equally that they have an instinctive love for stories. 
The most ardent exponents of children’s desire for 
activity are obliged to admit that they will sit listening 
to a fairy tale breathless and open-mouthed. The really 
good story-teller can produce the same effect with a 
story from history; we have seen it done too often to 
have any doubt of the fact. Some children can usually 
repeat the story almost from beginning to end. But 
even in these cases there is latent the same difficulty in 
listening to a narrative which, delivered by any but a 
first-rate story-teller, results in overt inattention.* The 
feeling is one of intense absorption, the child is keenly 
interested, but he fails to put the story together. He 
forgets the sequence of the earlier part before the end is 
reached. In “thinking round ” the last point which has 
been told he misses the next. With a small class who 
are allowed to interrupt freelyt the questions reveal

may be fixed on the teacher continuously and his thoughts 
.only spasmodically. 
+ These seem to be the only conditions under which the effect 
of narrative on children can be studied,

32 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
strange misunderstandings and temporary losses of the 
thread, which are not due to any fault of the narrator, 
as is shown by the eagerness of the other children to 
put the interrupter right. The result is, that while all 
the children enjoy the lesson, while all derive some 
impressions and therefore distinct benefit, and while a 
few assimilate all that is told them, yet the comprehen- 
sion of the majority is scrappy. 
These difficulties are in some degree inevitable. The 
most we can do is to reduce them to a minimum. We 
should reduce the amount of oral teaching in the cur- 
riculum as a whole* ; for it is the cumulative effect which 
accounts for much of the strain in each oral lesson. We 
should introduce a very fair share of manual illustration 
into the history lesson. But we can do much by a care- 
ful planning of pauses and recapitulations. 
Recapitulations should consist of a continuous re-tell- 
ing of the story by individual children, not of question 
and answer. The nursery must be our example. Chil- 
dren love to repeat the story which they have heard. 
The amount which a child can retell is the amount 
which should be narrated between each pause. The 
knowledge that the story will have to be retold itself 
gives an active purpose to the child in listening. There 
is something to be done, and his attention is directed 
during the narrative to such assimilation as will enable 
him to do it. True it is a low form of activity as it 
allows small scope for originality; and it is only while 
the feeling of power in being able to retell a story is 
novel that it is sufficient. As time proceeds something 
* For instance, Nature Study by its very title implies an 
observational and not an oral treatment.
-P-A-G-E-103
  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 93 
is needed which will give the pupil a greater sense of 
moulding his material for himself. 
In the past passive receptivity has been too prominent. 
For several generations a school of thought reigned 
supreme which taught us that a teacher’s main object 
was to “make his subject interesting,” that is, so 
enthralling that the pupils could not help listening. 
One fact was forgotten. Mere intensity in an external 
stimulus produces a continually diminishing effect. 
Once in a way a shout will win attention; constant 
shouting is useless. Children who have been accus- 
tomed to entertainments from infancy lose their capacity 
for enjoyment. Doctors who faint at the first sight of 
an operation cease to feel horror at the knife. Conse- 
quently larger and larger doses of the emotional stimu- 
lant are needed to produce any effect. The teacher who 
trusts entirely to exciting narratives will find that they 
need to be made more and more exciting. With the 
interest that arises from activity the case is entirely 
different. The joy that comes of successful performance 
creates a desire for more extended opportunities. 
“Tnteresting ” narratives therefore form a useful begin- 
ning, but, unless the pupil is soon induced to exercise 
power over the narratives, the instrument has been 
blunted. 
From the first, therefore, the pupil must be trained 
to deliberate thought. This is the purpose of questions. 
Questions are not merely a device for avoiding 
monotony. The habit of breaking the really vivid parts 
of a narrative by a question, merely because one has not 
been asked for the previous two minutes, is bad. Pro- 
vided that the continuity of the lesson is not broken 
questions have several values, which to some extent 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
justify the tradition that it is well for the teacher never 
to tell the class what he can get the class to tell him. 
They give the children a feeling that they are taking 
an active part.in the lesson which helps them really to 
do so. More important still, they keep the teacher in 
touch with his class. But their fundamental use is that 
they are almost the only way in which during an oral 
lesson the teacher can stimulate thought. What kind 
of thought is possible with younger children? With 
older pupils thought is largely concerned with causal 
relations. “What could be the motive for this action ?” 
“What would be the probable effect of that course of 
conduct?” Such questions as a rule imply that the 
pupil possesses previous historical knowledge; they are 
an appeal to reasoning by analogy. But the young 
child’s analogies are confined to his own narrow experi- 
ence of life and of childish motive. He soon acquires a 
stock of historical examples, but he will use them very 
wildly. His own experience may, for instance, suggest 
quite rightly that a certain line of conduct would rouse 
a king to anger; but his historical examples may sug- 
gest as a result that the king forthwith cuts off the 
offender’s head, and in this he may be quite wrong. He 
is misled through the narrowness of his knowledge of 
motives that lie outside his own experience. 
We may then ask a question in order, by our treat- 
ment of the answer, to enlarge his notion of the reasons 
which guided historical personages. The best ques- 
tions are those which evoke an answer which is on the 
right lines but is not the whole truth. Such questions 
make, the pupil put himself in the situation; if he has 
first thought what he would himself have done in the 
circumstances he is in a better position to appreciate
-P-A-G-E-105
CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 95 
what the historical character actually did. He is either 
satisfied or surprised. The problem is more real to 
him, and the difference between the suggested answer 
and the true answer may rouse a wish for an explana- 
tion. It is remarkable how interesting the most unex- 
pected problems may become to a pupil if once, through 
some turn in the lesson, he has come to be puzzled by 
them. A child of eight has suddenly for the nonce 
become, in his own childish way, a historical critic. 
To make younger pupils think, the problem must 
usually be personal. They cannot be expected to under- 
stand movements or tendencies. For instance, the 
principle that growth of trade leads to activity of 
thought is beyond their comprehension. This virtually 
means that the reasons for the difference between 
medieval England and Tudor England are outside 
their grasp. The consciousness of a difference between 
the two periods is possible long before the reasons for 
the differences can be appreciated. There will be things 
which we do not attempt to explain at the same time 
that we are seeking to arouse active thought in other 
directions. 
The integral function which drawing and colour work 
may play in the teaching of history has been much 
impressed on the writer’s mind by the Fielden Demon- 
stration School at Manchester. It is no longer an acces- 
sory, it is a very essential of the teaching. Such 
work solves the problem of the contents of note-books 
in the middle standards where the pupils are still too 
young to do much written work. Young children are 
far more likely to look through their book of sketches 
than through a written note-book and the representa- 
tions of people, buildings, armour, furniture and the
-P-A-G-E-106
96 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
like will be the nucleus round which their impressions 
gather. The chief difficulty is that the needs of the 
history lesson often require such drawing and colour 
work to be taken from copies; in this respect we are in 
a greater difficulty than the teacher of “ Nature-study.” 
With the youngest classes a systematic note-book is 
hardly possible. The media here may be most varied, 
not merely all forms of drawing but modelling in clay 
or cardboard being used if any opportunity is afforded. 
Imaginative drawing is sometimes in place. The chil- 
dren are often asked to draw any object or incident in 
the narrative which struck them most. Such exercises 
are said to encourage “self-expression.” This phrase 
always puzzles us. If it means‘no more than conveying 
to others what is in our own minds, it certainly often 
accomplishes its purpose to the teacher’s consternation ! 
Professor Adams quotes the case of a child who drew 
an excellent sketch of the Battle of Hastings, except 
that the funnel of a steamer betrayed an anachronism 
which is highly suggestive. Many modifications of the 
teaching might be suggested by such free drawings. 
But their educative value appears to us to consist, not in 
their expressing something which was already in the 
child’s mind, but in their compelling the child to evolve 
something which otherwise never would have existed in 
his mind. The information which has been given has 
to be worked up in a new form. He has to think about 
the subject-matter as much as the older pupil in writing 
an essay. 
The only other matter requiring consideration in this 
section is the use of the blackboard. Tradition has 
given it a certain sacrosanctity. An abstract of the 
lesson in “complete sentences” used to be the ultimate 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 97 
goal of the final recapitulation. Some modern critics 
regard the blackboard summary as an entire fad, 
belonging to the age when method was identical with 
mechanical procedure. We are prefectly prepared to 
admit that we have heard excellent teaching in which, 
though the blackboard was not used once, the class 
were able to recapitulate the whole story freely at the 
end. Yet, if the summary consists of headings, not of 
“complete sentences,” if it is well arranged in separate 
lines with the sub-divisions clearly differentiated from 
the main headings, and if these lines be written as the 
lesson proceeds and not at the end, we confess to retain- 
ing the belief that it serves the useful purpose of enabling 
the pupil to look at the board at any time and see the 
lesson in a nutshell. Certainly a lesson which cannot 
be so summarized is a rambling lesson. 
The “line of time” is a device which we have never 
seen attacked. It consists of a straight line drawn 
down the board and marked off into equal divisions for 
equal periods. It may be used either for a particular 
topic or for a whole course. If used for a whole course, 
a blackboard sheet should be kept, ie, a black sheet 
which rolls up like a wall map, on which we can write 
with chalk. This can be taken out for each history 
lesson. The line is best drawn down the middle so 
that events of different kinds can be put on each side, 
e.g, in a biography, events directly concerning the 
individual on one side and other events on the other, 
or in a course the kings on one side and events on the 
other. Its use as impressing lengths of time and 
sequence visually is obvious.*

  98 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
IV.—TEACHING OF UPPER STANDARDS 
The first question concerns the use of books, as the 
rest of our procedure is influenced by our decision on 
this point. 
The hybrid known as a “history reader” has no 
place in our scheme, either with upper or with lower 
standards. “History readers” are simply textbooks 
called by another name, and the choice of a textbook 
as a reading-book is fatal to the highest aim of the 
reading lesson, which is to encourage a love of reading. 
Attempts to kill two birds with one stone generally 
end in missing both. We have known a teacher’s oral 
lessons consist in nothing more than retailing in advance 
the subject-matter of such a “ reader”; and the contents 
of the book thus orally repeated were as thin, unreal 
and unlikely to create any impression as anything we 
could possibly imagine. 
On the other hand we can imagine an illustrative 
accompaniment of history lessons which entirely avoids 
the pitfall of attempting to give a consecutive narrative. 
It would consist of extracts from original authorities 
or adaptations if the originals were too difficult, of vivid 
narratives of striking scenes taken from good historians, 
or extracts from historical novels or dramas and of 
poetry bearing on the period. 
Two main types of procedure are possible. One is to 
use an actual textbook. In this case oral teaching 
impressed him on first seeing a line of time. The number of 
events chronicled in the latter period and the small number in 
the former tends to distort our ideas as to their respective 
lengths. i 3
-P-A-G-E-109
  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 99 
would both precede and follow its use. The develop- 
ment of the pupils’ thoughts on the subject by question 
and answer would form part of the previous teaching. 
The pupil would either be led to realize what parts 
were important beforehand, or else the preliminary dis- 
cussion would aim at enabling him to choose for him- 
self and the subsequent treatment would discover 
whether he had selected rightly and would discuss the 
reasons for his choice. Occasionally he might be set 
to make a précis in order that we might discuss the 
question of selection more definitely. 
Another device often recommended consists in setting 
certain questions to which the reading is more particu- 
larly to address itself, the answers being either given 
in writing or in the course of a subsequent oral discus- 
sion. These questions would be such as involved 
thought and selection and would not be concerned 
merely with matters of fact. The subsequent oral work 
would not be confined to discovering whether the pupils 
had “learned their lesson” but would be directed to 
showing them where they had missed the significance 
of the facts and in making such further systettatization 
as was impossible before the facts themselves were well 
known, 
The chief difficulty of the textbook method is that it 
may unduly cramp the teacher. Textbooks which make 
the necessary omissions and deal sufficiently fully with 
the topics selected are hard to find. In the case of the 
nineteenth century they are almost non-existent. 
The second mode of procedure would be to use illus- 
trative books such as we have described. In this case 
the teacher provides the framework of the story and uses 
the illustrative book in connection with particular 
LIBRARY

MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 | THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
problems, using the same procedure as in the case of 
the textbook. Extracts which were designed mainly 
to supply atmosphere would be read aloud in class. The 
teacher could no doubt execute this reading better than 
the pupils; but the pupils would prefer to do it them- 
selves. If the teacher elected to leave it to the pupils, 
he should only commit it to a good reader; indeed this 
privilege might be an inducement to members of the 
class to improve their oral reading. In case of dramatic 
selections, parts would naturally be assigned. 
An illustrative book might well be published with 
short appendices giving lines of time, genealogical 
tables, abstracts and other matter which is incidentally 
required. Abstracts, however, run the same risk of 
hampering the teacher’s individual treatment as do 
textbooks. These appendices would be intended to 
avoid waste of time in copying notes. 
This leads to the question of note-taking. The copy- 
ing of dictated notes has no educational value in itself, 
and occupies much time. Nevertheless, there is likely 
to be great scrappiness in the pupils’ minds if they have 
not available for reference either a printed book or a 
note-book containing headings of the oral teaching. In 
a secondary school the absence of both would never be 
contemplated even with pupils of the same age. If the 
pupils do not possess such a record in a printed form, 
dictated ‘abstracts of the type of blackboard summaries 
appear to be essential as pegs on which to hang the 
knowledge derived from the oral teaching; and maps, 
plans, diagrams, lines of time, genealogical tables and 
similar helps would find their place in the same book. 
But the note-book should not be confined to dictated 
matter. -Abstracts made by the pupils and occasional
-P-A-G-E-111
  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 101 
compositions should be included. Compositions lose 
most of their value if they are mere reproductions of the 
oral teaching. Questions should be set which involve 
a certain measure of thought, and the topic should be 
discussed afterwards in the light of the answers. The 
compositions of a few individuals might be read out and 
made the basis of the questioning : these should be care- 
fully selected to show the class how the general way of 
approaching the subject could be improved and to give 
other pupils an opportunity of pointing out weaknesses 
in the conclusions. 
Teachers will do well to consider the use of the school 
library for supplementary reading, the encouragement 
in a town school of borrowing volumes from the free 
public library, the taking notes of any such supple- 
mentary reading, and the offering of prizes for such 
extra work. The success with which Miss Findlay- 
Johnston encouraged such supplementary reading in 
school hours in a country school was one of the best 
proofs of the educational value of her method in her 
hands. 
Questions are now of the utmost importance. A far 
better impression can be gained of the success of his- 
torical teaching by observing how the class answers 
questions on a new topic than by testing their actual 
knowledge, even of causes and principles. It is as easy 
to teach generalizations and relations by heart as names 
and dates. But the benefit to the pupil consists not so 
much in being able to state principles as in the process 
by which he learned them. Whereas while facts have 
to be given—either by the teacher or by a book—the 
connections should always involve thought by the pupil. 
This is quite different from saying that he can evolve
-P-A-G-E-112
  
  102 | THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
history from his inner consciousness. History cannot 
be deduced as geometry can. The partially correct 
answer and the “good attempt” figure more than the 
answer which could not be improved. 
The reason why questioning is so important is that, 
every time a child tries to solve a new problem, he is 
using the knowledge which he has already acquired. 
All his historical thought is reasoning by analogy, con- 
scious or unconscious. The child expects that the new 
will be like the old. If he can correctly interpret a new 
situation, it means that he has generalized the know- 
ledge derived from previous lessons. If he can antici- 
pate a probable move of Wellington, it is because he 
has really understood some point in the strategy of 
Marlborough. This point is no longer packed away in 
some pigeon-hole of his mind with other facts about 
Marlborough never to be used in any other connection ; 
it has become part of his working stock of ideas. 
Whether his historical knowledge remains useless fact 
or is connected into useful ideas depends on the method 
of teaching, very largely on the prominence of the 
teacher or of the class in the lesson. And if facts 
learned in the history lesson are so little capable of 
being unpacked that they cannot be used in another 
history lesson, is it likely that they will be applied to 
problems of the present day ? 
The strategy of a campaign presents a simplest 
example. Given the objects of the war, the parties, 
and their forces, we have most of the determining con- 
ditions. The better the general, the more will he con- 
sider these objective conditions: the feelings, prejudices

movement hardly enter, Let us take the war of the

  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 103 
Spanish Succession, beginning after the conditions have 
been laid down. The first answer will very probably be 
that the fighting might be expected to take place in 
Spain. It is a partly correct answer. But it omits con- 
siderations. If one side massed all its troops in Spain, 
what should you do if you were General of the other 
side? When the situation has been fully grasped— 
and this may not be till after the countries have been 
pointed out on the map, and the children who suggested 
a Spanish campaign have arranged their troops on the 
blackboard—it suddenly becomes obvious that the side 
which has massed its troops in Spain has left its own 
country undefended. Next geographical considerations 
come in. Which is the easier, for the French to march 
on Vienna or on Madrid ? for the allies to invade France 
or Spain? It is much quicker for the teacher to Zell the 
reasons; but the question form produces an entirely 
different attitude of mind. A statement produces 
acceptance; a question followed by doubt, comparison, 
conclusion and answer produces conviction. 
Policies and movements are not so simple. Suppose 
that we are trying to bring out the causes of the Civil 
War. We are not now dealing with the objective and 
universal. Unwillingness to pay ship-money or to listen 
to a liturgical service are not fundamental facts of 
human nature at all times and in all places: We have 
to enter into the mind of the English squire or Scottish 
presbyterian of the seventeenth century before we can 
anticipate their acts. Here comes the use of the original 
authority. A letter, a speech, an incident narrated by 
a contemporary admits us to the minds of the actors. 
Questioning will therefore largely centre round such 
extracts and be directed to bringing out their signifi-  
-P-A-G-E-114
  104, THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
cance. Unless the active thought of the pupils is 
aroused by these extracts, they may be received as so 
many additional facts. The mere attempt to find out 
“What did the men feel who wrote or said this >” alters 
the whole attitude. The class are led on by the extracts 
from one stage of feeling to another, from discontent to 
protest, from protest to demand, from demand to action. 
V.—ILLUSTRATIVE ADJUNCTS 
The main illustrative adjuncts to the teaching of his- 
tory are pictures, models, relics, visits to museums and 
excursions to buildings and historical sites. These 
matters are particularly well treated in Professor Wel- 
ton’s Principles of Education. 
We must realize the difficulty of constructing a past 
scene from any of these adjuncts. Let anyone go into 
a building which is in course of construction, enter a 
room in which the floor has not yet been laid or the 
walls plastered, and try to imagine it fitted and fur- 
nished. Next let him visit a roofless abbey church or a 
ruined castle of which the walls are still entire; let him 
try to picture the church with stained glass windows, 
statuary, ornaments, a worshipping congregation and 
officiating clergy, or the castle with knights in armour, 
horses, footmen, archers, the moat full of water, the port- 
cullis drawn, the dining hall furnished, the joints ready. 
Next let him take up an A©gean vase or a neolithic 
flint head and try to picture—what? Then let him 
consider the use of archeological material for creating 
an historical sense in children. 
So convinced are we of the weakness of showing any 
article without its setting that we are disposed to insist
-P-A-G-E-115
  CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 105 
on imaginative pictures far more than most textbooks 
of method would allow. They are said to cramp the 
children’s imagination. We believe that without them 
the imagination will not work. Before a visit to a 
building, we should show a picture of the building (or 
of a similar building) in use, before a visit to a battle- 
field a picture of a battle of the time, before showing 
a piece of armour a picture of a man wearing it, before 
displaying an article of domestic use a picture of a room 
of the period in which it was used. 
Of course younger children need coloured and other 
imaginative pictures of action more than upper stan- 
dards.* Even upper standards, in our opinion, need 
pictures of reconstructed wholes as well as those of sur- 
viving parts. The zoologist reconstructs his ichthyosaurs 
and megatheria; the historian has far more to go on. 
The use of pictures will not, however, lead the teacher 
to neglect opportunities of drawing on the blackboard. 
Here he can make copies from books of reference, he 
can isolate particular elements in pictures to which he 
wishes to draw attention, and he can occasionally 
attempt imaginative drawings, especially for young 
children. Nor are semi-diagrammatic drawings always 
out of place; a kind of bird’s-eye view of a Norman 
manor with its manor house, demesne land, arable land, 
common pasture, wood, fishpond, cottages, etc, is 
perhaps the only way to give an idea of rural England 
in the eleventh century. He will, of course, whenever 
an opportunity offers obtain picture post-cards and 
other printed matter which is likely to be useful. 
In the case of visits and excursions, the necessary 
* We wish to call attention to Reid’s History Pictures (A. & 
C. Black).
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
precautions have often been stated in books of method. 
The teacher should have been over the ground before- 
hand and planned out his exact procedure. The object 
of the visit should have an exact place in the scheme. 
The lesson must be such as could be taken at that par- 
ticular part of the history course and not anywhere. 
Sights extraneous to the period must be ignored. The 
pupils must be prepared for what they are going to see 
and must, after the visit, receive a further lesson in 
which the knowledge which they have derived is 
worked up. 
We often hear of courses of local history. Usually 
“local history” means events in general history which 
happened locally. A historical pageant has in many ~ 
places gathered up such events. What should we be 
able to make of a pageant if we had not already a 
setting of general history? By all means lay special 
stress on incidents which happened locally, use the local 
borough to illustrate mediaval town life or the Domes- 
day record of the parish to illustrate country life, know 
the economic history of the district, build your account 
of church life on the local monastery, make more of the 
local hero than of others of the same importance, select 
local instances of general aspects of a period, and illus- 
trate by visits to local remains: but incorporate it all 
in the general history scheme. Detailed local history is 
an adult interest, the fine product of education, not its 
beginning. And let it be remembered that the parish 
pump is not so much in danger of being set up as an 
object of worship in Little Slowcombe-in-the-Marsh as 
in our old historical cities and most of all in the capital. 
Finally dramatization is now becoming a usual 
adjunct of history teaching. We do not propose to go   
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  
CONDUCT OF THE LESSON 107 
over the ground covered by Miss Findlay-Johnson as to 
dramatization in the proper sense of the term. But, 
short of this, there is a form of semi-dramatic procedure 
which is often useful. This consists in making various 
members of the class assume for the time the char- 
acters of certain persons, parties or sides and 
represent their point of view. The variations of this 
method are numerous. It may illustrate relations, as is 
the case if the Feudal System is explained by dividing 
the class into king, greater barons, lesser barons, etc., 
and going through the requisite forms of homage 
between the right persons. It may be made an interest- 
ing substitute for answering questions, as where one-half 
the class represents the upholders of a policy and the 
other its opponents and each argues its case. Similarly 
it can be used in suggesting the strategy of two armies. 
Or in dealing with a state trial, where the facts are 
already known, individual parts can be assigned, the 
intention being to produce a more thorough sifting of 
the arguments. Such devices may also be used ¢o 
encourage independent reading, especially of original 
authorities. In fact, it appears to be one of the finest 
ways yet discovered for promoting that activity of mind 
which it has been the foremost object of this chapter to 
advocate.

  PART II 
TEACHING OF PARTICULAR PERIODS 
CHAPTER VII 
BRITISH AND ROMAN PERIOD 
THE next seven chapters deal with each of the main 
periods. They include :— 
(i.) Notes on the general conditions of the period— 
social, economic, moral, etc—with special reference to 
recent modifications of view. 
Gi.) Notes on the chief movements, also with such 
reference. 
_ Gi.) Information as to books serving the various pur- 
poses enumerated on pp. 76-81. 
(iv.) A short discussion of the teaching of each main 
topic. In three cases only has an attempt been made 
to illustrate the framing of the individual lessons in a 
series—in the courses on Caradog, on Alfred, and on 
Becket, one being taken from each of the first three 
periods. 
Before dealing with the British Period we will just 
mention the period of prehistoric man, since some 
teachers may consider that the idea of progress will be 
best brought out if vivid impressions of the most primi- 
tive conditions are created at an early stage. The 
subject is presented in the form of children’s stories in 
108
-P-A-G-E-119
  BRITISH AND ROMAN PERIOD 109 
three admirable little books by Miss Katherine Dopp.* 
They will probably be found more useful as a basis for 
the teacher’s narratives than as reading-books. As a 
basis for the telling of stories, and as examples of 
stories prepared for narration to those whose powers of 
imagination are weak, these little books are admirable. 
I—BRITISH PERIOD 
Most “readers” deal in a sweeping fashion with the 
“ Ancient Briton.” Unfortunately the reconstruction of 
pre-Roman times involves numerous controversial issues, 
and the assertions of conflicting authorities must be 
accepted with caution. Even so, it may be confidently 
asserted that the popular idea of the Britons of ¢. A.D. 43 
does far less than justice to their general culture, 
specially in South-East Britain with which the Roman 
historians mainly deal,t About 40 B.C. the national 
civilization was confined to this division which was 
closely connected with Gaul. 
Our two ultimate authorities are Cesar and Tacitus. 
Cesar gives us but a glimpse; Tacitus’ account, which 
is more illuminating, is given in Lee, Leading Docu- 
* The Tree-dwellers, The Early Cave-men, The Later Cave- 
men (G. G. Harrap). 
+ This distinction between South-East and North-West is 
full of significance even before the Roman occupation. Britain 
is almost always invaded from the South-East, and the invaders 
drive the previous inhabitants towards the North and West. 
This was the case with the Goidelic, and afterwards with the 
Brythonic invasion. Thus, roughly corresponding with the 
geographical division, arose a distinction between the life of the 
Brythons and that of the Goidelico-aboriginal population forced 
into the highland district.
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY ~ 
ments of British History (Bell). But we advise the 
teacher to consult Traill’s Social England in order to 
give an accurate setting to the story which follows. 
With the younger classes the impression of the period 
will perhaps be best centred round the career of 
Caradog.* As this is the first biography presented 
to the children, we append a fuller outline of this course 
than we intend generally to attempt. 
Though more is known of Caradog than of any other 
Briton, it is very little. Tacitus, who is our authority, 
was confused in his geography ; his account of the battle 
is merely a generalized description of fighting between 
disciplined Romans and undisciplined barbarians; and 
Caradog is an idealized representation of the “ noble 
savage” meant as an example and a warning to the 
degenerate products of civilization. The teacher need 
not be perturbed by this lack of definite information. 
At the earlier stages of the course his task is rather to 
convey impressions of the time than to give a detailed 
account of campaigns. So long as the impression is 
correct, it is sufficient that nothing should be told which 
is impossible or which contradicts the known facts. 
Beyond that the teacher may use the licence of the 
historical novelist. 
The story has to give an idea of the Britons, the 
Romans, and the effects of the Roman Conquest on 
Britain. It must therefore spread over many lessons. 
The teacher has first to put himself in the child’s posi- 
tion and to realize how hard it is for him to think him- 
self back into barbarism when all the familiar objects 
* We have adopted the British form of the name. The 
traditional from Caractacus is incorrect, and the true form 
Caratacus sounds pedantic.
-P-A-G-E-121
BRITISH AND ROMAN PERIOD Il 
of the house, the town and the country-side were non- 
existent. The interest aroused by the discovery that 
there was a time when all these things were unknown 
will carry the class on till the story proper begins. 
This negation of all which the child can think of is a 
good starting-point. It prompts curiosity; as one by 
one the familiar objects depart, the child tries to think 
what there was, if these were not. It is good to let him 
puzzle a little. If the children know any moor or hill- 
top or wood, so much the better; it may be taken as a 
starting-point for building up a more positive idea. 
Pictures are of some help. Above all the teacher must 
himself have clearly pictured an England of moor, fen 
and forest. To enable a picture to grow in the child’s 
mind, this setting should be given first: then the ques- 
tion may be raised, where the people lived. The child’s 
attitude will doubtless be, How should I have liked to 
live then? The huts and settlements should therefore 
be described from the point of view of childish needs. 
Again the absence of the familiar comes first, then the 
wonder as to what took its place, then the positive 
information. Drawing and rough modelling are now in 
place. The hut itself, the fire round which all slept 
ith their feet turned towards it, the weapons hanging 
p, the rude household utensils are described. This is 
ittle Caradog’s home. By this time the children will 
ish to ask about his parents. “ What was his father >” 
hey may ask. The question should not be answered 
joo soon. What were people likely to do in such a 
‘ountry? More negatives follow. Yet they had to get 
heir food and clothes. They could not go to the 
utcher’s or draper’s; for there were no_ shops. 
radually the teacher and class work out together the 
     
             
     
     
      
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
possibilities which were left; hunting, fishing, tending 
stock, and a little corn-growing. 
We cannot lay down any rule how long all this takes. 
As a rule, the better it is done, the longer it lasts. If 
the Dopp stories have been already taken, many will be 
the references to them, and part of the work has been 
done already. The geography course may also have 
conveyed some of the ideas. Our teaching will admit 
of many differences in town and country, in wilder and 
more cultivated parts. 
We pass on to the story proper. Caradog has grown 
to be a man. We suggest some such lessons as the fol- 
lowing to interweave narrative with further description 
of life. (1) Caradog on a hunting expedition: news is 
brought of the Roman Invasion. He enquires who these 
Romans are; he receives a brief account from the mes- 
senger who has seen the ships and perhaps has travelled 
as a merchant. He wishes to see more. (2) He sets 
out to the sea, or, if this sounds too improbable, sends 
messengers. We get an account of travel down a river, 
and more is seen of the country. More news of the 
Romans comes in, especially from sailors. (3) At the 
sea; the Roman fleet and army. (4) We pass on till 
the Romans had conquered part of the country and 
Caradog takes up arms. He consults the Druids, and 
we get an account of British religion. (5) After defeat 
and flight, passed over rapidly, we come to the final 
stand. Caradog with his army. Again we have to 
begin with negations, no red or khaki, no drums, no 
marching in fours or drill. Again pictures and descrip- 
tion. We must carefully remember that, when the 
children realize what the single soldier was like, they 
cannot picture an army by merely multiplying him.
-P-A-G-E-123
BRITISH AND ROMAN PERIOD 113 
Pictures and description are strained to the uttermost 
to call up the idea of a barbaric host on a hill-side wait- 
ing impatiently for the Roman attack. At last they see 
the Romans advancing. Now we must be very careful 
that the desired: idea is conveyed, the contrast between 
undisciplined bravery and the cool advance of a dis- 
ciplined force. If we can give this impression the 
difference between Roman and Briton has been taught, 
the first fundamental idea of history has been given. 
But a few sentences of abstract talk will ruin everything. 
Not a word about discipline in general! The Roman 
army marching on, the words of command, the instan- 
taneous execution of the order—the class are watching 
it all, because the class are in spirit with Caradog, and 
seeing it through his eyes. The wild rush—“ Halt !” 
“Hurl javelins”; the Britons, many fallen, some stand- * 
ing still an instant, some rushing forward, all out of 
line: the Romans presenting an unbroken front. Does 
not this show what discipline means? The children’s 
hearts are with Caradog; and Caradog is just realizing 
what discipline means. (6) The triumph. Rome is 
seen through the eyes of Caradog: then he is led into a 
large building. We describe the two occupants of the 
central seats. Who are they? The children learn that 
they are the Roman Emperor and Empress, the greatest 
monarchs in the world. The story which follows may 
not be true, but surely we may be proud of the words 
put by his conquerors into the mouth of the first in- 
habitant of these isles who is to us more than a name. 
(7) We may tell the children how one account says that 
Caradog was allowed to return in his old age. If it 
was true, they shall hear what he saw. Thus we intro- 
duce the work of the Romans in Britain, their roads 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and bridges, villas and shops, camps and legionaries. 
Local antiquities, if any, will naturally be utilized. 
These lessons are meant only to be types. Many 
could be invented on the same lines, the battle and the 
triumph scene being the only narratives which in a sense 
are historical: perhaps it would be truer to say that in 
these two cases Tacitus has already exercised his 
imagination for us. 
II—ROMAN PERIOD 
This will probably be enough to tell the lowest 
standard of Roman Britain till we come to the departure 
of the legions. The Roman occupation left few traces : 
it was essentially alien, and it does not admit of bio- 
graphical treatment. The last stages. of the occupation 
may, however, be taken as the first act of the Saxon 
Invasion. We recommend the teacher to read Kipling’s 
account of the Great Wall* and the description of the 
departure of the legions in the Illustrative History,t+ 
and to model his lessons on them. 
For the benefit of those teachers who would wish to 
make more of the Roman Period in a subsequent treat- 
ment, we add a few notes. 
The line from York to Gloucester is still important. 
The Uplands of the West and North formed a tremen- 
dous obstacle to the advance of the invader. In South- 
Eastern Britain, on the contrary, even if the marshes 
and other obstacles which J. R. Green so liberally dis- 
tributed over the map had any real existence—and this 
some recent writers are inclined to doubt—they did not

-P-A-G-E-125
BRITISH AND ROMAN PERIOD 115 
hinder an army well equipped with engineering re- 
sources. Owing to this absence of strategic obstacles 
the conquest of the lowlands only occupied five years 
(43-48), while the reduction of such of the highland 
parts as the Romans penetrated took eight times as 
long (48-88). During the latter portion of this period 
while the Romans were conquering Wales and the 
North, occurred the administration of Agricola, a splen- 
did type of Imperial statesman. With his work our 
attention is turned to the effects of Roman rule in 
Britain, the building of the walls, the villas, towns, and 
roads. 
It is important to recognize the episodic and purely 
military character of the Roman rule. It was based on 
its military centres, Chester, Caerleon, and York. The 
Roman army consisted partly of Roman citizens and 
partly of non-citizens, mostly Germans from the Rhine, 
They ‘represented some sort of Roman culture, but had 
little effect on the general mass of the native population. 
Many of the veterans on retiring returned to their homes 
on the continent. Generally speaking, Roman civiliza- 
tion affected the Lowlands only, and not even all of 
that region. The Roman occupation did nothing for 
the political education of the Britons: further it took 
away their self-reliance, and their best fighting blood 
went to recruit the legions of the German border and 
of other parts of the Empire. Some attempt should in 
the higher stages be made to give an idea of the length 
of the Roman occupation by comparing it with the 
length of some other period of British history. 
In the second treatment of the period three characters 
serve to illustrate three stages in the Roman conquest. 
Caradog represents the fight against the newly arrived
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
invaders, Boadicea represents revolt against a power 
which is already partially established, Agricola will 
arouse interest as the teacher of a superior civilization. 
The account of his career should include imaginative 
descriptions of the building of towns and military 
stations, the great roads, the improvement of agriculture 
and of industry generally, Britain as the “Granary of 
the West,” the lead, tin, and iron mining, the draining 
of marshes and clearing of forests. The long period 
which extends from 85 to 410 presents no biography 
round which an illuminating impression of the period 
may be presented. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
CHAPTER VIII 
THE DARK AGES 
WITH the appearance of the Teutonic invaders our 
treatment of British history will form to as great a 
degree as’ possible a part of European history. The 
reader is referred to the table on p. 50. 
I 
The period may be described generally, regarding 
Europe as a whole, as covering (@) a gradual loss of the 
elements of civilization which survived the Western 
Roman Empire, continuing down to the darkest point 
somewhere in the eighth century, and (0) the gradual 
revival, which culminated in the tenth and eleventh 
centuries in the establishment of a strong central 
ecclesiastical power and a number of monarchies con- 
taining the germs of the chief European nationalities. 
In British history the dark period is represented by 
the Saxon invasion and conquest ; the signs of dawn are 
seen in the spread of Christianity and Celtic learning ; 
hopes of an organized monarchy first centre round 
Alfred, gradually fade with the weaker members of the 
Wessex line, die away under Canute, and are eventually 
only realized as the result of a foreign conquest; and 
the growing power of the Church as an ecclesiastical 
organization wielding definite weapons of control is 
117
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
foreshadowed by Dunstan and realized after the 
Norman Conquest. 
The past tendency has been to over-estimate the 
civilization of the Saxons, as it has been to under- 
estimate that of the Britons. It must be remembered 
that, unlike the tribes which conquered Italy, France 
and Spain, the Saxons had not come under the direct 
influence of Roman civilization, and transported to 
these islands the social conditions of Northern Ger- 
many. Though possessed of many of the best qualities 
of warlike peoples, their interests were confined origin- 
ally to roving, fighting, and drinking; and when their 
settlement and conversion ended the first and 
diminished the possibilities of the second of these 
occupations they sank into a dullwitted race of agricul- 
tural drudges, for whom the Norman Conquest was 
almost a necessity if an energetic nation was to be 
created. The most complete account which we have 
of them, contained in Tacitus’s Germania, written some 
centuries before their settlement in Britain, is unfor- 
tunately open to the suspicion of idealizing these bar- 
barians just as later writers idealized the Red Indian, 
as the contemporary type of the “noble savage.” For- 
tunately their legends and religious conceptions are 
fully known to us; Thor and Woden and their idea of 
Valhalla are sufficient indications of their ideal of 
manhood and their ideal of happiness. When we know 
these two things we know the most essential things 
about a race. 
Similarly, a school of thought which held the field a 
few years ago represented the line of Cerdic as the most 
consistently efficient line of kings which’ held sway in 
any European country during the dark ages. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE DARK AGES 119 
view does not commend itself to recent historians. 
Rather, it is probable that after Athelstan the same 
process of degeneration set in as reduced the de- 
scendants of Clovis and Charles the Great to ineffective- 
ness, and led after Ethelred the “ Unready ” to Conquest 
by the Danes and after Edward the Confessor by the 
Normans. 
The development of social and political institutions 
is 90 obscure, that with the youngest classes it is better 
to avoid the subject altogether till we come to Alfred. 
The second time the period is taken we can bring out 
that the temporary chief appointed to conduct a par- 
ticular expedition has blossomed out into a king for 
life, and that custom has sanctioned the election of his 
son or sometimes, if his son is a child, some grown-up 
relative as his successor, and that the manorial system, 
more familiar after the Norman Conquest, appears to 
be already in existence. With younger children it is 
probably better to introduce Alfred as the type of 
kingship without any attempt to explain its evolution 
and to leave the system of land tenure till after the 
Norman Conquest. 
The chief agent in welding together the nation as 
well as in raising its intellectual and moral tone was’ 
undoubtedly the Church; hence the somewhat large 
part which we have assigned it in our scheme. 
II 
We will now make a few remarks on each of the great 
movements. 
(1) Invasions and Settlement—The most disputable 
question here is the extent to which the invaders exter-  
-P-A-G-E-130
120 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
minated the British or only made them a subject 
population. The extreme slowness and thoroughness 
of the conquest must be noted; as also the importance 
of the division previously noticed between the South- 
East and the North-West. 
(2) Conversion—The separation of English from 
Irish, Scottish, and Welsh history has tended to obscure 
the important part played by the Irish Church in keep- 
ing alive learning and religion and handing them on to 
England and then to the Empire of Charles the Great. 
Rome organized after Ireland had inspired. Patrick, 
Columba, Aidan are necessary links in the chain of the 
migration of Christianity. 
Owing to the fact that the Celtic Church did not 
acknowledge the Roman supremacy, it has sometimes 
been pictured as a kind of sixth-century Protestantism. 
Such an anachronism is of course an impossible view 
to take. Less organized, simpler and more primitive 
in its life of poverty, and differing in a few trifling 
points of observance, it yet recognized and was recog- 
nized by the Roman Church as part of one body. 
The Synod of Whitby is best reserved for the second 
treatment. It paved the way for the introduction of 
Roman parochial organization and of the monastic 
system as reorganized by St. Benedict. 
The great social and economic effects of this system 
as well as the provision which it made for homes of 
piety and learning amid surroundings of ignorance, 
barbarism and a barbaric outlook on life and morals, 
mark it out for treatment. Bede may be made its 
representative. 
The biography of Alcuin illustrates another side of 
the activities of churchmen. In strong contrast to the
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE DARK AGES 121 
monastic seclusion of Bede is the career of this repre- 
sentative of the school of York, the great Northumbrian 
scholar who passed on the torch of learning to the 
domains of Charlemagne. If the teacher wishes to keep 
down the number of ecclesiastical biographies in the 
first treatment, Alcuin can well be taken in the second, 
and will afford an indirect means of making some slight 
mention of Charles the Great and his Empire. 
(3) Invasions of Northmen.—It is essential to bear 
in mind that the attacks on England were but part of 
a great Scandinavian movement which affected all 
North-Western Europe. Their raids wrecked the 
centralizing work of Charles the Great and accelerated 
the development of Feudalism. In France, while main- 
taining their true Scandinavian vigour, they were 
purified in the fire of Frankish culture; and the North- 
men, become Norman, at once invigorated and polished 
the uncouth, yet degenerate, Saxon. Even Southern 
Italy learned his stately prowess, and he took no humble 
part in the Crusades. The biography of Hereward 
introduces both Dane and Norman at the height of 
their power and in many different regions. 
Of the two great periods of attack on England, for 
which Alfred and Cnut stand as biographies, the first 
swept away the old divisions and substituted a dual 
division into the lands reconquered by Wessex and the 
three Danish kingdoms. But the task of unifying 
England was too great for the later and degenerate 
kings of Wessex. 
The second attack was an attempt to hold England 
as part of a great continental empire, and the failure 
to retain its hold over England was the great cause of 
Scandinavian decline. It continued for some time to

make spasmodic efforts to regain its power in these 
islands, which were ruthlessly stamped out by William 
the Conqueror in the North of England and ended in 
Scotland by the establishment of a firm monarchy 
under Malcolm Canmore. 
The policy of Cnut has sometimes been regarded as 
similar to the federal policy advocated by Dunstan. It 
is now agreed that it was diametrically opposed to it: 
his division of England into administrative districts 
under earls was meant to obliterate the old tribal divi- 
sions, and it was only the weakness of his successors 
which allowed these districts almost to develop into 
separate kingdoms and left to the strong hand of 
William the Conqueror to carry into permanent effect 
that union of the country which Cnut accomplished for 
his lifetime.

We will now show briefly how the main aspects and 
movements of the period can be cast into the form of 
narrative. 
(a) Invasion and Settlement—The details of no one 
invasion being known, the narrative will be largely a 
generalized picture ascribed to a particular invasion. 
With young children this is perfectly legitimate. The 
first picture will present a band of young adventurers 
from a German tribe uniting to set out on a raid, 
assembled for the last feast in their native land, encour- 
aged by the auguries of their wise men and by the 
stories of gods and past adventurers told by their poet, 
all expressing their desire to join the heroes in Valhalla 
or to emulate Valhalla on earth in the lands of the 
“Roman.” The second picture may be on the sea, after 
the manner of Belloc’s account of the Danish raid,* the 
warriors discuss the situation—let us say in Kent— 
which is directing them to those shores, passing hard 
comments on the fighting powers of the Romanized 
Britons and bringing out the ideal of a race to whom 
war was a glorious game and death an invitation to 
an unstinted banquet. ‘Then will come a battle, a siege, 
a massacre, an enslavement, told from the point of view 
of the conquered. Finally the children will hear that

124 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
thus the Saxons conquered all England, and thus their 
brethren were conquering Europe. 
(6) Church—Biographies of Patrick, Columba, and 
Aidan will show the kind of men whose power of spirit 
overcame the fierce warriors of the dark ages; nor will 
Gregory and the slave boys be omitted. Now, or the 
second time the period is taken, Bede will stand for 
learning and monasticism and Alcuin for British in- 
fluence on the Continent. At the second time the 
significance of the Synod of Whitby, the place taken by 
the Church in the union of Britain, and the social and 
economic effects of monasticism may be introduced ; and 
the Empire of Charles the Great may be introduced in 
connection with Alcuin. 
(¢) Danish Inyasions—A more complete account of 
the lessons on Alfred is appended. 
The career of Alfred will be the vehicle to convey the 
impression of the untamed savage in contrast with the 
tamed savage. The Danes of the ninth century were 
very similar to the Saxons of the sixth. The Saxons 
of the ninth century were the tamed wild beast. They 
had laid aside their fighting habits, but their outlook 
was not that of civilized man. To win a livelihood 
from the soil was the concern which occupied most of 
their lives. The few who were free from constant toil 
could think of no pleasure higher than mead. The 
Church had taught them respect for the Ten Command- 
ments; they had ideas of honesty, truth, and property ; 
miserable enough, they were content. They could not 
read and were without ideas, even that of improving 
their lot by a plundering raid. Such were the men 
whom Alfred set to work to organize for victory, to educate and to govern,
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE DARK AGES 125 
He himself was far removed from the type. When 
we speak of a half-civilized barbarian, the half of which 
we usually think is the skin; and the hybrid with the 
heart and mind of a barbarian and a skin veneered 
with the outer trappings of civilization has the vices of 
both conditions and the virtues of neither. In the case 
of Alfred the civilized half was the heart and mind, in 
externals he belonged to his age and country. He was 
the best product of an insular Christianity, with which 
high thinking was a matter of choice and plain living 
of necessity. Now that the authenticity of Asser’s Life 
is established, we feel that we have at last an historical 
person of real flesh and blood, and that we are not 
idealizing when we take him as our embodiment of the 
true functions of a king in such an age, as one who saw 
the lines on which his people should progress and tried 
to help them forward on those lines. 
Some such series as the following would illustrate the 
leading features in the man and his age. 
1. The story how he learned to read: Whatever we 
may think of the story of the cakes, this story charac- 
terizes the man. It was the wider outlook and aspira- 
tions of the “clerk” that marked Alfred off from the 
other kings and thegns of his time. The conversation 
must be made reminiscent of the stories contained in the 
previous series. The mother might ask the children 
what they would like to do when they grew up. The 
answers would mainly concern themselves with fighting, 
hunting, and such other occupations, the children 
setting up past heroes as their models. Then their 
mother would suggest something else. At the sound 
of the word “ read” one of the children would exclaim: 
“Why, mother, only monks read. We don’t want to  
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 THE TEACHING.OF HISTORY 
waste our time shut up in a little cell when we might 
be fighting.” . . . “And wear a dress in which you can’t 
run.” Then their mother tells them how the great men 
of Rome who conquered the world could all read, and 
shows them what the Churchmen who could read, al- 
though they could not fight, had done for England. 
Then she leads up to some such conclusion as, “ What 
. if you could read and fight as well?” She might quote 
David, who not only read but wrote, and made books 
and played the harp. In fact this conversation may 
gradually unravel Alfred’s ideal. 
2. A Danish Raid. It may begin on board a Danish 
vessel, on the lines of Mr. Belloc’s description. They 
discuss the point of attack and decide on an abbey. 
An old raider tells how on a former raid they had found 
gold cups and ornaments, and how by threatening an 
old monk with torture, they made him tell them where 
the coins were hidden. One burly fighter protests that, 
though the spoils are great, it is hardly a man’s task to 
fight with these strange Christian folk that dress like 
women. (We may well attribute a sportsmanlike touch | 
to our ancestors, for the response it will arouse in their | 
young descendants is better than any historical evidence 
that it was in them.) “ You will have fighting enough,” 
says another, “if you touch their priests, you will soon 
have the whole people out. To kill a sheep for its flesh 
or a monk for his gold is neither of them a noble task, 
but both must be done; and neither is a disgrace, if a 
man shows he can fight.” The abbey is sacked and 
burned. 
3. The front of Alfred’s dwelling. A messenger 
arrives bringing news of the raid.. Asked how long ago 
it was, he describes the number of days the journey 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE DARK AGES 127 
took, the difficulties, and where he stopped. Alfred 
laments the decay of the Roman roads. He then takes 
the necessary steps to summon the fyrd. The lesson 
may end with the summoning of a cottager in a remote 
village who has never heard of the sea and refuses to 
believe in the danger. His one thought is that the 
crops may spoil in his absence. In some such way the 
limitations of outlook as well as the external environ- 
ment of the ordinary man’s life can be brought out. 
4. Alfred’s defeat. As in the case of Caradog, the 
details will be worked out by the imagination from 
what is known of the fighting of the time. The main 
idea is the confident onslaught of seasoned warriors 
against a mixed body of inexperienced rustics, mostly im- 
properly armed. Alfred’s flight and hiding in Athelney. 
5. The story of his visit to the Danish camp. His 
victory. Capture of Oxford and London. Description 
of the latter as seen by the occupying army. The Peace 
of Wedmore. 
6. A sea-fight and English defeat. Alfred addresses 
a Witan and explains the need of ships, putting the 
arguments for the naval defence of an island in a con- 
crete shape. The building of ships described, with 
modelling. A victory. 
7. Peace. We go back to the first lesson and revise 
Alfred’s ideal. His schools, contrasting them with those 
of the children. His translations, revising the nature 
of books and the time taken in copying them. As 
regards legislation it should be noted that he was a 
reviser of the existing laws rather than a law-maker in 
the strict sense. 
The earlier lessons have been more fully summarized 
because it is in them that we need the freest manipula-
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
tion of the material. Concreate treatment is equally 
needed in the later lessons. The externals of common 
life appear in lesson 3, and of the life of the rulers in 
lesson 1, of the countryside in lesson 3, and of fighting 
in 4 and 5; various aspects of government figure in 3 
and 7. Taking the thought and feelings of the time, 
various aspects of religion come out in connection with 
Alfred’s ideal in 1 and 7 and in connection with monas- 
teries; the ignorant content with an unhappy lot is 
personified in the peasant of lesson 3, where we get the 
attitude to daily work and to other classes, the absence 
of outlook and the various aspects of the inner life of 
the times enumerated in Chapter V. suggested in the 
only way in which it is possible to suggest them to 
children. It is useless to drag them out of this vague 
atmosphere and to mention them explicitly; all that 
children could tell the teacher definitely after the series 
would be that people could not read, had no schools, 
and poor food, houses and furniture. Similarly, lessons 
1 and 7 give an impression of Alfred’s ideals and what 
he did for his people; his power and energy are em- 
bodied in his acts in lessons 3 and 6, his perseverance in 
4 and 5, his resource in 5. Thus the loftiness of his aims 
and the qualities of mind and will through which he 
was able to give effect to them—to adopt the analysis 
of character given in Chapter’ V—are all given their 
proper share of attention, but the children are not 
expected to analyze the character, only to admire the 
man. Finally, the functions of kingship, the protection 
of the people from enemies abroad and wrongdoers at 
home, and the more positive duties of which only now 
and again an enlightened ruler thought, all enter into 
the impression.
-P-A-G-E-139
THE DARK AGES 129 
Ships and their equipment, weapons, books, coins, 
ornaments, and wooden buildings from Alfred’s palace 
and the abbey to the neatherd’s cottage, are amongst 
the concrete objects to be represented or shown. The 
available resources in these directions will necessarily 
somewhat modify the suggested scheme of lessons, as 
the time taken for handwork may be embodied in the 
lessons. 
Teachers will probably differ whether the story of 
Cnut should be introduced during the earlier treatment. 
At the second treatment a short outline of the interval, 
showing the extent of the effective West-Saxon re- 
conquests, the temporary revival under the last strong 
king, Edmund Ironside, and the ruinous vacillation of 
that type of royal degeneracy, Ethelred the Unready 
(ae. “ devoid of council,” as refusing to take the advice 
of the Witan) will be told. 
(2) Norman Conquest. This story will form one of 
the most enthralling narratives in English history. The 
first part naturally takes Harold for its hero. His 
great ability is fully admitted even by those historians 
who regard him as a successful adventurer. The pre- 
cedent of Cnut’s election forbids him being called a 
usurper, and for the younger children at least the 
pathetic interest in the last struggle will justify us in 
raising no doubts as to his patriotism. 
From the beginning the shadow of the approaching 
conflict colours our treatment. The first lesson, up to 
his accession, will introduce the spread of Norman 
officials, Norman traders in towns, Norman bishops, and 
the Norman monastic rule under Edward, and the 
growth of Godwin, the supporter of English claims in 
State, and of the old secular canons in Church. Who 
9   
   
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
these Normans were has to be explained; then comes 
the episode of Harold’s shipwreck, now proved to be 
historical, introducing William I. and forecasting 
Harold’s possible accession and William’s aims and 
claims. The situation is now defined. 
The six months of Harold’s reign are one breathless 
series of incidents. The wind blowing from the North 
to bring Harold Hardrada, and then veering to the 
South to bring William, the forced march, the Heim- 
shringla account of the battle of Stamford Bridge, too 
true to probability to be omitted, though its details are 
doubted by modern historians, the anxious march south 
teeming in disappointment, the discovery that the 
nation could not act as a unit, that the men of Sussex 
had grown tired of waiting and gone home, the dis- 
heartening waiting for tardy commanders, the convic- 
tion of the breakdown of the fyrd as an organization 
to meet the professional fighting class of Norman 
knights, the desperate attempt of a consummate 
tactician to make up for these defects by genius in the 
actual battle, the rising hopes as William could not use 
his horsemen to effect against Harold’s well-chosen posi- 
tion on the ridge (the palisade is now abandoned), the 
feigned flight too cunning for Harold’s amateur army, 
born fighters but undrilled, and the final stand—these 
incidents will not only form two or three lessons of 
sustained interest but will point the contrast between 
the period of dull, dogged, undisciplined soldier-farmers 
that lies behind, and that of the intelligent, trained 
knights which is to come, the nation that had failed to 
realize itself matched against the military aristocracy 
which was to rule for the next four centuries.

THE LATER MIDDLE AGES* 
I—THE CHURCH 
| Its General Characteristics Throughout the Period 
(1) Its international character made it the chief means 
of spreading civilization. It gave all Western Europe 
a common literary language, Latin; from this arose a 
common learning, scholasticism, and a type of institu- 
tions for disseminating learning, universities ; it afforded 
a model of law and political organization; it strove to 
establish a uniform morality; it enabled many institu- 
tions to prevail over all Western Christendom, e¢.g., 
knighthood; it repressed other customs, e.g. trial by 
ordeal; it was the actual legislature in many depart- 
ments of life, e.g., in all that concerned marriages, wills, 
money-lending ; above all, it gave a sense of unity to 
Western Europe akin to the modern feeling of 
nationality. + 
It was this which made Erasmus lament the Reforma- 
tion: he dreamt of a development of this unity till all 
Western nations spoke Latin, till the same ideals pre-

132 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
vailed everywhere and war was impossible. The result 
was not to be: but who will say that a United States 
of Europe was not a worthy ideal? 
(2) Its organization made it efficient where the secular 
power was inefficient. Under the Pope were the Arch- 
bishops of provinces, then the Bishops of dioceses, and 
finally the rectors of parishes. Every single parishioner 
came into contact with his parish priest, not merely on 
the special occasions of life, such as baptisms, marriages 
and burials, but in the ordinary procedure of confes- 
sion by which the Church strove to regulate daily con- 
duct. Probably no Church or State has ever developed 
so efficient a machinery for reaching through its agents 
every one of its subjects and at the same time con- 
trolling those agents from headquarters. 
(3) Its independence of the State. In a democratic 
state where religion exercises its power through its hold 
over individual adherents, the relations of Church and 
State tend to become an academic question. But in 
days when State meant the Emperor or King, and 
Church meant the hierarchy, the issue was nothing less 
than which the masses should obey where they gave 
different orders. This concurrent jurisdiction led to a 
long struggle at the beginning of the period; but we 
can substantially define the normal relation. The 
Church enforced and interpreted the whole moral code, 
any attempt of the State to legislate in a counter sense 
was foredoomed to failure, but attempts of the Church 
to interfere with the executive actions of the State in 
the civil sphere generally failed. If an individual 
Churchman exceeded his powers, the King provided the 
remedy ; if an officer of state encroached on the powers 
of the Church, the Pope constituted the power in
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 133 
reserve. As a rule both sides hesitated to proceed to 
extremes; the King hesitated to risk his soul by using 
force against the Church, while the Church’s final 
weapons of excommunication and interdict rested on a 
moral sanction which was barely operative where they 
were used in a partisan spirit or for unreasonable ends. 
(4) Its authority came from above; it did not repre- 
sent the spontaneous ideas of the people’ but, so far as 
it could, imposed its own ideas upon them. For a long 
time this influence continued to raise the moral tone 
of the rude peoples over whom it was exercised. From 
the fourteenth century, however, the Church grew corrupt. 
(5) In spite of its autocracy, it was the most 
democratic institution of the time. It stood for the 
equality of all men in the sight of God. It was the 
one means by which men of humble birth could rise to 
power. The priest who was sprung from the people 
was on many points more likely to share their feelings 
than were the king and nobles. In days when the 
knowledge of books was practically confined to the 
clergy, opportunities for book-learning were open to 
the abler children of the people almost more than to 
the’ nobility. 
(6) The attitude of the masses to morality was that 
of submission to the commands of a superior. Love of 
right was confined to a very few, and those mostly 
monks or clergy. The rest of the population was 
frankly restrained by fear of consequences, in this life 
or the next. This does not mean that no virtues would 
have been voluntarily practised, but that the compul- 
sory code was far in advance of that which had any 
sanction in the hearts of the people. This is of course 
true of many persons in all ages; but in the Middle  
-P-A-G-E-144
ee eee ee 
134 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Ages the gulf between the spontaneous and the artificial 
morality was far wider, and few laymen were influenced 
by the higher motives. This fact rendered an auto- 
cratic Church almost essential. The work of the friars 
in the thirteenth century was the most powerful agency 
in leavening the masses with the true spirit of 
Christianity. : 
(7) Saintliness was thus a mark of a special class. 
There were in reality two moral codes, one for the mass 
of conforming Christians, the other for the truly 
spiritual-minded. The adoption of the higher standard 
did not annoy the ordinary man; both outwardly and 
inwardly it ensured his respect. The results were two- 
fold; on the good side, the number of persons really 
striving after perfection was probably greater than in 
times when the religious spirit has been more wide- 
spread; on the bad side, the ascetic ideal was far too 
strongly developed; righteousness tended to be identi- 
fied with fasting, scourging, abjuration of amusement 
and, strangest of all, personal uncleanliness. There 
was something amiss in a conception which regarded a 
life spent without washing or changing one’s under- 
linen as having attained the summit of sanctity, though 
in weightier matters it could not have been an ignoble 
ideal which produced St. Francis, Joan of Arc or St. 
Louis of France. 
(8) This separation between the “religious life” and 
the ordinary morality led to the existence of 
monasteries. 
Their influence must be kept in view by frequent 
references. The sack of a monastery by the Danes, 
Hereward’s relations with the monks of Ely, the enter- 
tainment of travellers by monks, the lesson on any

neighbouring monastery when we reach the date of its

ture, the series on Wycliffe when monasticism was in 
its decline with Chaucer’s account of the monks of his 
day, will be some of the opportunities. The teacher 
who wishes to obtain a vivid notion of monastic life 
might read parts of the Chronicle of Jocelyn de Bracke- 
lond, translated by L. C. Jane (Chatto and Windus,
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
1907), a contemporary account of the rule of Abbot 
Samson, of Bury St. Edmunds, which was used by Car- 
lyle for his idealized picture in Past and Present. The 
teacher may desire details of the Benedictine rule, 
though it is not intended that such a string of hard 
facts should be presented to a class. The buildings 
usually followed one type; the plan of Beaulieu (pro- 
nounced Bewley) Abbey is an example (see p. 135). They 
consisted of (i.) the Church, usually on the north side 
in this climate to shelter the rest of the buildings, on 
which most money was lavished to adorn it with plate, 
vestments, hangings, wall paintings and stained glass 
windows, (ii.) the cloisters, the dwelling-place of the 
monks, (iii.) the refectory or common room for meals, 
as far from the Church as possible, (iv.) the kitchen 
adjoining it, (v.) the chapter house for transacting the 
business of the monastery, (vi.) the dormitory or 
common sleeping apartment, (vii.) the infirmary for 
the sick, (viii.) the guest house for travellers, where all 
were entertained for two nights, (ix.) the almonry for 
the distribution of alms and (x.) the library. Besides 
the abbot and his deputies, the prior and sub-prior, 
the officers looked to the singing, the church fabric, the 
care of the refectory, control of thé cooks, charge of the 
sick, the distribution of alms, the entertaining of guests 
and the instruction of novices (new members of the 
order). The routine of daily life was as follows: the 
division of sleep into two parts and the number of 
services will be noticed :—12-2, service; 2.30-5, sleep ; 
6-7, prime and early mass; 7.30, breakfast—2 Ib. of 
bread and 4 pint of wine (not taken during Lent); 8.30, 
mass; 9.0, chapter; 10.0, high mass; 11.0, dinner; 12-5 
(winter) or 1-6 (summer), work in the garden or library; 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 137 
5.0 (winter) or 6.0 (summer), vespers, followed by supper 
(not taken between Advent and Easter) ; 6.30, collection 
(ae, evening reading) and compline (another service) ; 
7.30 (winter) or 8.30 (summer), bed. 
(9) Mingled with religious beliefs was a large amount 
of superstition, partly inherited from the old days of 
heathenism, partly from a perversion of Christian ideas 
in minds which still preserved the heathen attitude: 
fear of the supernatural in everyday life is characteristic 
of the lower religions. The devil was probably far 
more in the minds of most men outside Church than 
God or Christ or the saints. Monkish chronicles teem 
with his visible manifestations. Witchcraft accounted for 
most of the mishaps of life. It is hard for the modern 
man who passes his life in security to understand the 
physical terror of primitive man to whom the clutch of 
a wild beast was an event of daily possibility ; and it is 
equally hard for one\who regards the physical universe 
as regulated by law and the moral universe by powers 
that make for righteousness to understand the super- 
stitious terror of malignant powers’ in which the 
medieval man passed his days. 
Movements of the Period. 
(1) The first great movement was the struggle 
between the Church and the secular power in the eleventh 
and following centuries. The benefits accruing from 
the reform in the Papacy a little previously inspired the 
great Popes with the idea of reforming the world by 
concentrating power in the hands of the Church. In 
many things they succeeded. The control of the 
Papacy over distant Churches was tightened, e.g., over 
England at the Conquest (in Ireland it was barely
-P-A-G-E-148
138 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
recognized till the invasion under Henry II.); celibacy 
was enforced on the clergy, e.g, in England under 
Dunstan; monastic discipline was more strictly 
enforced ; new canons were made, ¢.g., in 1215 against 
trial by. ordeal and in favour of educational facilities ; 
and the Popes took the lead in stirring up the Crusades. 
But at one point they fell foul of the civil power, the 
right of appointment to benefices. Plainly the right 
of appointing its own agents was indispensable to a 
great reforming power; who could conceive General 
Booth allowing his preachers to be nominated by the 
local mayor? But equally clear was it that the higher 
clergy were tenants-in-chief of the crown, holding lands 
and enjoying political power in virtue of their position. 
The struggle between Henry IV. and Hildebrand and 
that between Henry I. and Anselm are well known. A 
new struggle followed between Henry IJ. and Becket 
partly concerned with the jurisdiction of the state 
courts over clergy, of which the strangest feature is that, 
though modern opinion is altogether on the side of the 
King, contemporary opinion was largely with the Arch- 
bishop. This is one of the cases where we need to 
work ourselves into the mind of the times by means of 
contemporary records.* We require, so to speak, to 
have a good talk with a man who could think it out- 
rageous to hang a murderer who happened to be a 
cleric. The papal claims reached their climax with 
Innocent IIL, who excommunicated the Emperor and 
the King of France and put England under an inter- 
dict. It is now generally agreed that he blunted his 
weapons by using them too freely, and that the papal 
* Most often, it should, however, be noted, monastic and sym- 
pathetic to the Church. 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 130 
power declined from that day forward. This section 
is well represented in English history. 
(2) Three revivals of learning have occurred in 
Europe. The first spread from these islands and is 
associated with the name of Alcuin. The third was 
the Italian Renaissance. The second took place at 
the end of the eleventh century; its special centre was 
Paris, and its best-known exponent Abelard. Its origin 
can be largely traced to the introduction of some know- 
ledge of ancient Greek philosophy by way of the Arabs 
to the Moors of Spain and thence partly by way of 
the Jews to the Christians of Europe. The Latin trans- 
lation of a Jewish translation of an Arabic digest of 
the Greek philosopher Aristotle was far from being a 
trustworthy guide to his views; but Europe took very 
seriously the task of reconciling what it believed to be 
Greek philosophy with Christian orthodoxy, moved 
thereto in part by the need of defending its creed 
against its Mohammedan rival. Hence came a tremen- 
dous stimulus to thought and learning, resulting in the 
growth of universities and their peculiar curriculum 
and method. A mixture of logic, philosophy and 
theology, constituted the subject-matter of Scholas- 
ticism; and controversies conducted in accordance with 
strict logical rules its method. It contributed little to 
knowledge; it often led men to follow a will o’ the 
wisp; but it produced writers unsurpassed for intellec- 
tual subtility, it led thousands to train their minds, and 
in the long run it produced an attitude of critical 
judgment and a sense of proof which rendered possible 
the spread of the very forces which swept it away, the 
Reformation and Natural Science. The small part of 
this development which is suitable to the understanding

of children we have placed in a special section on 
medieval education. 
(3) The Crusades. Perhaps no mediaeval movement 
has left a more lasting impression on literature. As a 
result they have come to be too closely linked with 
Richard the Lion Heart and the nobler side has been 
over-emphasized. When we say that a man entered 
on an enterprise “in a crusading spirit,” we are cer- 
tainly not thinking of the scum of Europe who went 
out to avoid the law or their creditors, in hope of gain, 
for mere love of adventure or to atone for a misspent 
life, nor have we in our minds~the iniquitous Fourth 
Crusade which never reached the Holy Land but estab- 
lished a gang of Frankish adventurers in the Christian 
city of Constantinople. The motives which inspired 
the first crusade were as mixed as those which gave 
rise to most wars. Recent opinion tends to emphasize 
the trade interests of Venice and other Italian city- 
states. We must be on our guard against supposing, 
however, that in such cases religious motives were 
deliberately exploited for commercial ends. The state 
of mind would be somewhat as follows: “A mass of 
infidels, the enemies of God and Christian men, are 
ill-using pilgrims and traders and enriching them- 
selves at the expense of the faithful; cannot all the 
fighting men in Christendom stop these wrongs, which 
are the result of leaving the cradle of our faith, and its 
sacred places to the enemies of that faith? Why not 
establish a Christian king, Christian priests, governors 
and traders in the place of Mohammedans?” The men 
who argued thus would not consciously discriminate 
between the religious, commercial and racial motives. 
Our teaching can easily put arguments in their mouths
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 141 
which embrace the whole gamut of motives. Modern 
historians consider that the importance of Peter the 
Hermit has been over-estimated. He was merely one 
of many preachers, who worked in a particular region, 
and whose activity happens to have been recorded. 
We can, however, devote as much time to him as ever, 
with the added knowledge that we are describing a 
type. The first crusade merits a full description; the 
third will naturally figure largely from its connection 
with Richard I.; that of St. Louis may be introduced 
if the teacher wishes to give a picture of the man who 
reached nearest to the medieval ideal of Christian 
chivalry, while Edward Is connection with the last 
crusade will be mentioned in his biography. The 
effects of the Crusades in extending knowledge of other 
countries, encouraging trade, ridding Europe of 
undesirables and promoting unity between the nations 
of Christendom are well known. 
(4) The Friars—As in earlier times the monasteries 
represent the element of church lite which affected the 
minds and consciences of the ordinary layman, so from 
their arrival in the reign of Henry III. the Friars stand 
for the most powerful influence, whether for good in 
their earlier days or for evil after their decline. 
Corruptio optimi pessima is the truth which we must 
always keep in mind when we think of the Friars. On 
the one side we may be so engrossed with the picture 
given by Chaucer and Piers Plowman as to forget how 
they began as the Salvation Army of medizval times, 
illustrating the gospel by their lives, working among 
the outcasts, and for the first time really bringing home 
to men that “ pure religion and undefiled” is “to visit 
the fatherless and widows in their affliction,” that
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Christian charity is an inward attitude which goes 
beyond justice, duty, law or obligation, which does not 
dole out a minimum of good deeds which shall guar- 
antee salvation but rejoices in the maximum of good 
which it can do for the bodies and souls of men. Piers 
Plowman understands what Christianity is, and attacks 
the Friars for not living up to its standards; but was 
it not the earlier Friars who had made it possible for 
him to know Christianity? Did the common man in 
the thirteenth century conceive of Christianity as a 
spirit, or only as an organization, a coercive jurisdiction, 
a system of external orders on which hung salvation or 
damnation ? 
On the other side their early grandeur may blind 
us to their sad decline. There must be some truth in 
the later accounts which represent them as impudent 
and idle vagabonds, impious, superstitious and greedy. 
Their sales of pardons and relics are no slanders. The 
very fact that they had won their way into the hearts 
of the people made their decline the more harmful. 
The medieval Church might have shaken off the 
secularism of the Bishops, the massing of wealth by the 
monasteries and the evils resulting from the under- 
payment of the parish clergy; these were all matters of 
organization; but the corruption of its best spring of 
spiritual life was fatal. 
Both sides must be represented in our teaching. St. 
Francis of Assisi—there is no typical Englishman— 
gives the ideal of the early Friar, the man who sought 
the lost, coarsely-dressed, barefoot and ill-fed, eating 
what was set before him, begging for the necessaries of 
life, never taking money, calling nothing his own, freely 
criticizing the ill-deeds of the rich and powerful because 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 143 
he had nothing to gain or lose, and helping beggars 
and lepers. The second picture may be introduced in 
the life of Wycliffe. When we have given the substance 
of such an address as he can be imagined to have given 
on them we may read a paraphrase of Chaucer’s and 
Langland’s accounts. The children will then learn of 
the “wanton and merry Friar” who “knew well the 
taverns in every town”; the pardoner who undersold 
the parish clergy and perverted the penances which 
were devised to keep men from sin into money pay- 
ments which were virtually a licence to sin; the relic- 
monger and his strange wares; they will hear how they 
built sumptuous priories with chapels like cathedrals, 
sculptured tombs and gorgeous ornaments, how on the 
one hand they became the confessors of lords and 
ladies and of kings, and how on the other hand they 
were the village pedlars and went about with their 
wallets, trading in needles and ointments, bringing 
knives, purses and pins, as well as spices, silks and 
furs for the women. 
We may describe the scene when a Friar arrives at 
a village. He brings the unknown and the extra- 
ordinary; the parish priest finds himself abandoned ; 
everyone runs to the newcomer. He lays down his 
staff and wallet and begins to talk; his language is 
that of the people, he talks not only of their eternal 
welfare, but also of their earthly concerns, for all the 
details of lay life are familiar to him, and he can give 
appropriate advice. He shows his relics, the piece of 
the sail of St. Peter’s boat, one of the angel Gabriel’s 
feathers, a vial of the sweat of St. Michael when he 
fought with the devil. Then privately he hears con- 
fessions and imposes light money payments.  
-P-A-G-E-154
144 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(5) The decline of the Papacy and of the Church 
generally. Two events ruined the prestige of the 
Papacy, its removal to Avignon where it became the 
tool of the King of France (1305-1377), and the Papal 
Schism in which rival Popes thundered declamations 
against one another (ends 1415). Incidental reference 
is all that can be given to these events in our teaching. 
But even earlier the financial demands of the Papacy 
had roused the national feelings of the English Church 
and people. The second time the period is taken, the © 
teacher will do well to devote attention to the reign of 
Henry III., when England first felt itself to be a nation. 
In Grosseteste, Hugh of Lincoln and others he will find 
the combination of true Christianity, loyalty to the 
medieval Church and a national spirit, as it cannot be 
found at any other period. The extracts in English 
History from Original Sources for this reign exhibit 
peculiarly well this phase of loyalty to the Church and 
hostility to the selfishness of the Pope: the combination 
can only properly be appreciated from first-hand 
sources. When we remember that these same years 
saw the development by the Friars of the Christian 
spirit among the masses and the awakening through 
the King’s love of foreigners of that national feeling 
which Edward I. skilfully centred round the monarchy, 
we see that this apparently dull period was peculiarly 
formative. By the reign of Edward III. it is no longer 
a question of the opposition of the people led by their 
Church authorities against the Papacy; Pope, Bishops, 
Monks and Friars are now regarded by the best thought 
of the time as degenerate self-seekers. Still the prevail- 
ing feeling was not that mediaeval Christianity was 
wrong, but that its exponents were untrue to it; Lol- 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 145 
lardry was much less common* than this feeling. Con- 
temporary literature is full of it; there is no lack of 
illustrative material for the time of Wycliffe. The main 
changes are the neglect of ecclesiastical for political work 
by the higher clergy, the amassing of land in clerical 
hands, the number of chantry-priests who had no other 
duty but saying masses for the souls of individual 
testators, the collection of livings by monasteries who 
annexed the tithes and doled out a pittance to the 
parish priest, the misuse of confession to raise money, 
and the hypocrisy, greed and immorality of many 
Friars. Monks were not popular landlords; and the 
use of excommunication to collect rent and tithes was 
particularly resented. The less men doubted the power 
of the Church to close the door of Heaven, the more 
unfair seemed its use to do the work of a county court. 
Money in short was the root of all the evil. Confes- 
sion had been made binding in 1215 to deter men from 
sin; it was being used to make money out of men’s sins. 
Instead of deterring, it encouraged. If money pay- 
ments could be substituted for personal penance, 
Heaven as well as earth seemed to recognize one law 
for the rich and another for the poor. The holding of 
state offices by the clergy probably benefited the 
administration, but it opened the path of promotion to 
men of business capacity and closed it to those who 
devoted themselves to parochial work. The clerk-in- 
holy-orders was becoming a clerk in the modern sense; 
he devoted his talents to the duties of a secretary,

steward or administrator, and success in such work 
was the usual preparation for a bishropric. 
EDUCATION 
This topic brings children into closer touch with 
medizval life than almost any other. It supplies an 
answer to the question, “What should I have been 
doing had I been living then?” The subject can be 
introduced most easily in connection with Becket, who 
studied at Paris and Bologna, the earliest and greatest 
of medieval universities, and with Wycliffe, who brings 
before us the University of Oxford towards the close of 
the period. 
Mr. Leach’s researches have rendered the accounts of 
all previous writers on medizval schools untrustworthy, 
and readers are warned against accepting statements 
on this subject even from the best-known historians. 
Schools were from the beginning associated with 
cathedrals and collegiate churches; during the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries some passed under the control 
of monasteries. There were usually two schools, a 
“song” school to teach reading and writing, and a 
“grammar” school to continue education till fourteen. 
Then the vocational element entered ; the further educa- 
tion of the future knight was as a page, of a future 
burgess as an apprentice, further schooling or the 
university really constituted the technical education of 
the “clerk” or priestly class. Yet there was one factor 
which made the system more democratic than after the 
Reformation, namely that the ranks of the clergy were 
recruited from all classes, though the consent of the lord 
of the manor had to be obtained in the case of villeins.   
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 147 
Needless to say, there was no general system of elemen- 
tary education. 
The whole curriculum. bore a clerical impress. Its 
nature can be understood if we remember that Latin 
was the language of Church services and of intercourse 
between priests of all nations, that not only was 
theological controversy acute between Christians, but 
that Christianity had to be maintained against Moham- 
medans, and that the administrators were drawn from 
the clerical class. Thus Latin was requisite for all 
priests; theology, power of argument and law for the 
higher ranks. 
_ Becket went to school at Merton Priory in Surrey; 
there he would learn to read and to write in Latin, and 
as soon as he was able would be allowed to speak 
nothing but Latin. A low dark room, benches and 
tables, quill pens and several birch rods would consti- 
tute the equipment. He was taken away early, and it 
was at the University he learned to argue, to make 
speeches in Latin, to sing the church services, and as 
much arithmetic as was possible when I, 2, 3, 4, were 
written i, ij, ilj, ii1j. 
The ablest “clerks” would proceed from the schools 
to the Universities after their rise in the second half 
of the eleventh century. Becket. went to Paris and 
thence to Bologna, there being as yet no University in 
England. For the reasons already given, theology, 
law and power of argument were the main needs of the 
igher clergy and the main features of medieval 
niversities, though a few in Italy specialized in medi- 
ine. Generally speaking, Italian universities taught 
ore law, and those of Northern Europe more theology 
nd argumentation.    
   
            
     
            
  
-P-A-G-E-158
148 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Universities grew up merely from the crowding 
together of learners to the lectures of distinguished 
wandering scholars in various towns. Thus Abelard 
in Paris had to lecture in the open air because no 
room could be found in the city large enough to hold 
his audience. Gradually organization was introduced, 
teachers and students being regarded as standing 
somewhat in the relation of mastercraftsmen and 
apprentices, degrees being the admission of the appren- 
tice to the full privileges of the master craftsmen. 
The supreme test of ability was power to conduct 
an argument on a theological or philsophical question 
in accordance with the very strict rules of such disputa- 
tion. Such tests exhibited at once knowledge of the 
subject-matter on which the argument was based, 
knowledge of the rules of the game, and ingenuity and 
presence of mind in meeting the opponent on the one 
hand or driving him into a corner on the other. On a 
series of victories in such disputations were the higher 
degrees awarded. 
It was only after the days of Wycliffe that the Col- 
lege system became general. The picture which we 
should draw of Oxford in Wycliffe’s time would be 
somewhat as follows. Crowds of students, mainly 
poor, lodging where they could find accommodation, 
all hoping to be priests and imbued with a strong caste 
feeling for the priestly order, trooping to the lectures of 
any distinguished scholar who had for the time settled 
in Oxford, delivered in some room hired or borrowed 
for the purpose, or even in a church, several com- 
munities of Monks or Friars engaged in the same work, 
now and again visiting disputations to watch those 
more expert than themselves in the art, prizing a book
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 149 
as a great treasure and having for the most part to 
copy their books at the lecturer’s dictation, staying for 
no definite time, some of them migrating to a foreign 
university in the hope of hearing some noted lecturer 
or having access to some book, occasionally bursting 
in youthful indiscretion into a dispute with the towns- 
folk among whom but not of whom they were and, 
after an outburst of physical violence, only remember- 
ing their clerical character when it came to calling on 
the eccleciastical arm to accomplish what cudgels and 
arrows had failed to effect—such in their youth were 
many of the clerical administrators, mitred abbots, 
writers and parish priests of the Middle Ages. 
Here then was one of the few democratic features of 
the time, the one and only ladder by which a youth 
could leave the class in which he was born, and might, 
as the result of brains and perseverance, attain a power 
equal to that of the feudal lord. Nor must we forget 
the extent to which the interchange of scholars helped 
the solidarity of Western Christendom. There was 
always a stream of young Englishmen in Paris and in 
Italy. And, finally, Wycliffe discovered that here, at 
a point where men came from all quarters and whence 
they returned home again, was the most favourable 
spot from which to spread new opinons. As it hap- 
pened, the hierarchy saw it too, and replied by establish- 
ing so tight a hold on Oxford that in England the 
spread of heresy became impossible; but in Germany 
a century later Luther at Wittenburg University suc- 
cessfully tried the same plan.

I].— FEUDALISM 
General Aspects 
(1) The Manorial System existed before the Conquest ; 
it is, however, par excellence the land system of this 
period and the Conquest is the natural time at which 
to introduce it. The system is described succinctly in 
Townsend Warner. The teacher will of course describe 
the villeins and their general position, the nature of the 
village society and the appearance of the country. 
This involves the negation of many pre-conceived ideas 
of the countryside which, if not eliminated, will exist 
in the child’s mind—well-divided fields, hedges and 
roads, brick or stone cottages, larger farmhouses. The 
idea of farmers and labourers as distinct classes has 
also to be eliminated. Probably a rough bird’s-eye 
view on the blackboard, exhibiting the common pasture, 
the woodland, the demesne land and the arable land 
of the villeins will help to clear the ideas of the class. 
The course of the villein’s life through the year should 
not be forgotten.* Without such a background of the 
real life of the mass of the population medieval history 
is apt to give mistaken ideas. 
(2) Political feudalism, based on the tenure of land 
and the relations of lord and vassal, had begun long 
before the Norman Conquest. This subject is so gen- 
erally known as to need no discussion. 
(3) Modes of fighting. In Europe generally knights 
in full armour remained the chief branch of the army 
throughout the period, but in England archers 
developed to a high point of efficiency in the fourteenth 
* See p. 159.
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 151 
century and enabled the English to be successful in 
the French Wars. We have traced the broad changes 
in war in a later chapter; but we ought here to notice 
the alternation of inventions in attack and defence. 
This period so strengthened castles that until artillery 
had been considerably developed they were practically 
impregnable. Nothing can be a substitute for a visit 
to a castle, but it should come after the class has formed 
some notions of its parts, its function and the life 
within its walls. The siege of Bedford Castle where 
a turbulent baron had lodged himself at the beginning 
of Henry III’s reign is a good instance of military 
operations against purely defensive tactics. The 
battles of Lewes and Evesham will probably serve best 
to describe fighting between forces of knights, as most 
of the wars before English archery was fully developed 
were fought by the feudal chivalry against people who 
had modes of fighting of their own. (Hastings, the 
Welsh campaigns.) 
(4) Relations between barons and people. Fortu- 
nately for England, she only had occasional experience 
of the unrestrained action of barons. The ante-dating 
of chivalrous ideas, which has been perpetuated by 
Ivanhoe and the Talisman, has concealed the terrible 
character of their proceedings when the Crown failed 
to exercise a check. The descendants of plundering 
chiefs, they were long in realizing in the case of their 
manors what the Kings of England soon realized in 
the case of their kingdom, that peace, order and just 
administration promote wealth, and that wealth is as 
beneficial to the lord as to his subjects. They remained 
fighters and hunters and did not become good land- 
lords or squires. The system of land tenure brought  
-P-A-G-E-162
eee 
152 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
them into no paternal relationship with their social 
inferiors; they were neither Tudor “governors” nor 
Celtic chiefs; their relation to the subject population 
was rather that of the Turk. They had a right to the 
labour of the villeins, but it is hard to see what benefit 
they gave in return, for their Courts cannot have been 
instruments for a very delicate administration of jus- 
tice. But it was not their lawful powers but the 
plunder and cruelty of their private wars which formed 
the worst feature of their rule, e.g., in Stephen’s reign 
throughout the country, and almost throughout the 
period on the Welsh border. Those who would fain 
believe the twelfth century to have been filled with 
noble deeds of knights should study the lives of Hugh 
the Wolf of Chester and Robert of Rhuddlan. 
(5) Chivalry.—The Church was wise enough to realize 
a cardinal principle of which all wise reformers have 
availed themselves, that most evil and most good 
spring from the same primal instincts, and that the 
result depends on the direction in which these instincts 
can be employed. In dealing with her own special 
children, the monks and priests, she tried to fight 
against human nature; in dealing with her adherents 
at large she directed it. The fighting instinct and 
pride in its exercise had commonly developed into 
brutality and arrogance: they were now to be sublimated 
into a struggle against evil and a sense of honour. 
The Crusades began the work; the presence of the 
Church at each stage, the vows, the vigil, the consecra- 
tion of the army in chivalry, turned it into a system. 
We are too apt to take the ideal for the actuality; the 
fighting instinct was no more universally dedicated to 
the service of God in the golden age of chivalry than
-P-A-G-E-163
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 153 
any other part of human nature in any age. But it 
was at least redeemed from the service of the devil as 
much as in any age any of man’s powers usually are. 
Certain ideals were then developed which have per- 
sisted, the attitude of respect for women, pride in truth- 
fulness, restraint towards the weak. If any ideas are 
universal in England they are that it is disgraceful . 
to hit a man when he is down, and that “you should 
fight your own match.” The great orders of chivalry 
came somewhat late and its golden age synchronized 
with the Italian Renaissance. Even at its close, war, 
though greatly humanized, was conducted on lines 
which shock our moral sense; restraint was exercised 
mainly in dealing with members of one’s own class; 
and respect for women had its circumscribed bounds. 
The career of the Black Prince illustrates the merits 
and limitations of chivalry: St. Louis of France was 
not a common type. 
Movements 
(1) Crown versus barons—The events of English 
history recorded in textbooks are largely acts in the 
story of the gradual consolidation of the power of the 
Crown, aided by the towns and commercial classes, 
over the feudal baronage. William I, Henry I, 
Henry II, Edward I, Edward III, and finally 
Henry VII. all play their part; the careers of John, 
Simon de Montfort and Warwick the King-maker are 
episodes in the same story. 
The King did not assume the réle of father of his 
country in the first instance because he loved his people. 
Henry II, who did as much as any king to give 
England good government, was a foreigner who never
-P-A-G-E-164
    154 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
regarded England otherwise than as the greatest 
province of an Angevin empire. Love of power, love 
of the good things of life and love of money as an aid 
to obtaining both were far more powerful motives. 
But the statesman kings realized that a wealthy, pros- 
perous and contented people was a source of strength 
and provided a supply of money. Hence it was the 
consistent policy of strong monarchs to keep the barons 
under control and to encourage the towns, the homes 
first of commerce and then of industry, partly as a 
source of wealth, partly as a rival power to the barons. 
Parliaments were in origin anything but rival 
powers to the king. The fact that money beyond the 
ordinary dues could not be collected without the con- 
sent of the barons was of course a limitation of the 
king’s power; but it must be remembered that, to speak 
paradoxically, the limitations were there first and the 
power grew up later. But the idea in Norman times 
of calling the barons together at certain intervals for 
advice was far more that the king wished to have 
them under his eye where he could control them than 
that they came together to control him. This at least 
is an idea which a class of children can understand 
from their personal experience of the relations of 
governor and governed! The extension of . member- 
ship to include representatives of the lesser baronage 
and of the towns commended itself to the Edwards, 
as it enabled them to get money more easily. Parlia- 
ments only exercised their powers when the Crown 
was very weak, e.g. during the last years of 
Edward III, and the minority of Richard II. When 
Feudalism was conquered, King and Parliament 
worked in harmony through Tudor times,
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 155 
With these preliminary remarks on the general char- 
acter of the struggle, we can now pass on to consider 
its separate stages. 
The policy of William I. prevented the baronage 
from obtaining at the start any such power that a 
strong king would be unable to deal with them. Thus 
England through being conquered by a single capable 
leader set out with an initial advantage which no other 
country of Europe possessed. 
Henry I. realized the value of trade and towns and 
began the policy which Henry IL, Edward I. and 
others followed. 
The disorders of Stephen’s reign were so powerful 
an object-lesson of the evils of baronial rule that 
Henry II. set himself to crush it. His main aim was 
to increase the wealth of the crown: the substitution 
of money payments for military service, the suppression 
of private war and the extension of a system of royal 
justice which brought money to the King’s Court and 
the encouragement of towns all formed part of this 
policy. An efficient system of justice and an efficient 
exchequer—the chief end and the chief means of govern- 
ment—were his main legacies to England. 
The significance of Magna Charta has in recent times 
been reinterpreted. Till recently Magna Charta was 
regarded as a restriction on the royal power in the 
interest of the whole people. Valuable as the Great 
Charter was, the barons were in reality fighting for a 
selfish interest, for the restoration of their own freedom 
from control by the Crown. John had undoubtedly 
abused the great powers given to the King by the 
administrative and judicial reforms of Henry II. 
Crown and people were usually united against the   
 
-P-A-G-E-166
rite 8 eee 
156° THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
barons; but the heavy taxation of Richard Is reign 
and the misdeeds of John destroyed the old alliance. 
The Crown had become for a time the chief lawbreaker ; 
and the Church and humble freemen appear for the 
moment in league with the barons against it. Magna 
Charta has derived much of its importance from the 
use which was made of it in after ages, e.g. in the 
struggle between Parliament and the Stuarts. When 
John was out of the way the regents for Henry III. 
had no difficulty in uniting all the best elements in the 
country and re-establishing the royal power. 
Simon de Montfort’s career may seem to present a 
puzzle in this line of interpretation. The explanation 
is not far to seek. The king, by his support of 
foreigners, his poverty and his weak foreign policy 
had produced universal discontent. The old baronial 
party attempted to establish anew the baronial power, 
but the advent of Simon, a foreigner and an idealist, 
disclosed a leader of great strength of character whose 
motives were pure. De Montfort’s plan in contradis- 
tinction to that of the barons was to associate all 
classes in the government, and his Parliament formed 
the basis upon which Edward I. built his greater 
structure. The Crown brought in its old allies, the 
Commons, and the country obtained a stable govern- 
ment in which “what concerned all,” it has been 
cynically but truthfully remarked, “should not merely 
be approved by all but paid for by all.” 
When next the barons appear as a disturbing factor, 
a large number of estates are found to have collected 
in the hands of a few houses. Even when Parliament 
had been divided into two houses and the aristocracy 
had begun to hold the high ecclesiastical posts which 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 157 
gave seats in the Upper House, it was no united 
peerage which caused the trouble in Richard II.’s reign 
and afterwards, but a clique or group of cliques com- 
' posed of a few men like John of Gaunt. The problem 
was whether a few individuals could by a temporary 
alliance prove more powerful than the king. Hotspur 
failed against Henry IV.; Warwick succeeded against 
Henry VI., and eventually failed against Edward IV. 
The great houses were practically exterminated in the 
Wars of the Roses. 
(2) Fall of the Manorial System—The breakdown 
of the Feudal system of land-tenure has been tradition- 
ally associated with the Black Death. It is now agreed, 
however, that this event only hastened a change which 
had become inevitable. The system was only possible 
in an age when coin was almost unknown. It had 
become uneconomic and a fruitful source of friction. 
Unwilling and unpaid work is always bad work. Pay- 
ment by servicé meant that the villein had to neglect 
his own crops to do his lord’s work just at the time 
when his labour was most required on them. Again, 
the whole system rested on the assumption that each 
manor was self-supporting. The demand for English 
wool for Flemish manufacture upset the system. Some 
of the lords found that enclosing the land for sheep- 
pasture was more profitable than using it for arable 
purposes. For this purpose they could do without the 
villeins’ labour and employ a small number of hired 
labourers. Everything contributed to their accepting 
payment in lieu of service and spending the receipts 
on hired labour. When the villein has come to hold 
land on a money payment, whether as a commutation
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
for service or not, he has virtually become a tenant 
paying rent. 
The troubles which followed the Black Death were 
therefore in reality the troubles of a new system, the 
first attempt to diminish rent and increase wages in 
accordance with the law of supply and demand. But 
the lords knew nothing of these laws and were looking 
at the case from the old point of view, by which the 
relations between them and their villeins were a matter 
of convention, as legally and in origin they were, not 
as a matter of contract, as by force of circumstances 
they were tending to become.

THE LATER MIDDLE AGES (Continued) 
III—TRADE AND INDUSTRY: TOWNS 
WE have here our most difficult problem in teaching 
the Middle Ages: so difficult that it is often completely 
neglected. But it brings to our notice a new class, the 
inhabitants of the towns; a class, small it is true, but 
destined to grow and become a mainstay of the coun- 
‘try. Nor is the picture of the life of the great body of 
the population complete without it. Finally, trade 
proved the greatest stimulus to progress in an age when 
fixity was regarded as a law of nature. 
As regards ordinary rural life, we. know little of its 
manufacturers, buying and selling. They had no coin, 
no village shops. For food they were dependent on 
their own productions. Their corn was ground at the 
manorial mill; they had little meat. Their clothing was 
entirely of wool, and the raw material was their own. 
So with regard to leather. But not every household 
had its own loom. The usual custom was to take your 
own raw material and have it manufactured into a gar- 
ment or pair of boots. The manor-house was a general 
manufactory for its own needs; but the villeins must 
have gone to the skilled artisans of the towns, when 
they were near, or where the skill of more well-to-do 
craftsmen among their fellow-villeins did not suffice.

160 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Luxuries were reserved for the lords of the manor. The 
pedlar friar at the end of the period supplied a need 
which, before it could be supplied, was not even felt. 
These facts form part of our’ “impression” of the 
manorial system. 
Just as the rural areas required few imports, so at 
first they produced few exports. The first great 
change occurred in the twelfth century, when the 
Cistercian monks began to utilize the great wastes as 
enormous sheep-runs, thus producing a surplus supply 
of wool, which was sent abroad to Flanders for manu- 
facture. England now comes into relation with the 
great development of town life on the Continent which 
had set in with the eleventh century.* 
Little can be said about the continental towns in — 
teaching. That little may consist in a clear statement, 
when we come to the local borough, that these English 
boroughs were imperfect copies of far larger towns then 
existing in Italy, Germany, and some other countries— 
we must even in the early stages be very careful to pre- 
vent the children thinking that England was then in 
the front ranks of civilization—in a description of the 
Flemish towns introductory. to the Hundred Years’ 
War; in the colouring which we give to the Crusades; 
and in the account of the activity of thought which 
forms the prelude to the invention of printing. 
The teaching of the English towns, unlike the pre- 
vious topics, is not associated with any date, event, or 
* Warner’s Landmarks of Industrial History is extremely 
useful in conection with the topics treated in this section; the 
reader is particularly advised to trace the history of the woollen 
industry, though it cannot be taught apart from the setting of 
particular events.
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 161 
person. It therefore runs the greatest risk of abstract 
treatment. The difficulty may be obviated in two ways. 
First, the teaching should be concentrated on some 
neighbouring town well known, at least by name, to 
the children. Secondly, a great additional lever of 
interest will be obtained if the handwork course follows 
the general lines recommended by Professor Dewey* or 
Miss Katherine Dopp,t and includes practice in the ele- 
mentary methods of spinning, weaving, and other simple 
industrial processes. 
The possibility is greater than at first sight appears; 
for the list of medizval boroughs in Gross’s Gild 
Merchant reveals the fact that there can be hardly a 
village in the country situated more than fifteen miles 
from one such borough. Further, though in some cases 
very little is recorded, the habit of “affiliation,” by 
which a new borough modelled its institutions on one 
of the larger pre-existing boroughs enables us to apply 
what is known of the large borough to its smaller 
imitator. The teacher would naturally consult the 
Victoria County History in any county for which such 
has been published; otherwise the sources of informa- 
tion can generally be ascertained from the Cambridge 
County Geography or from some local publication; 
finally, if nothing else is known, he will discover the 
affiliation from Gross, and then find out the institutions 
of the parent borough. London, York, Bristol, Here- 
ford, and Northampton were the chief types. 
We will try to give a generalized picture of a 
mediaeval borough, from which the reader may pick 
what is applicable to his particular instance. At the

-P-A-G-E-172
  162 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Conquest almost all the “towns” of England, except 
London, York, Winchester, Bristol, NGuCH and Lin- 
coln were merely large agricultural villages: the forma- 
tion of boroughs began in the twelfth century, and was 
greatly encouraged by the more statesmanlike kings. 
First, as to external appearance. Many were walled 
and adjoined a castle. Few were large. In the earlier . 
days the houses were of one story and made of wood 
or thatch; a delinquent was once sentenced to have his 
house carried outside the walls and burned! The first 
buildings to be constructed of stone would be the church 
and the castle. Boroughs like Oxford had a number 
of churches, the smaller borough but one, which served 
for all common purposes, secular as well as religious. 
From the tower the defenders shot arrows at an attack- 
ing force; the bell summoned them to arms; the building 
itself was the place for meetings; records were kept 
there. Usually there was a market-place in the town; 
but the large fairs were often held outside, frequently 
near the river, which was almost the sole means of 
transport in days when the roads were mere impassable 
rights of way,* e.g., Stourbridge fair at Cambridge, 
about two miles from the town. The streets were ex- 
tremely narrow, and all who followed the same trade 
tended to congregate together. If the local borough 
was a later foundation, some of these features must be 
modified; there would probably be a stone or brick 
Guildhall, and the houses of the wealthier citizens would 
be of the same material. 
We next pass to the inhabitants. In the earlier days 
* Road traffic was carried on horseback; rarely could a 
medizval smith make a wheel round enough to serve its 
function.
-P-A-G-E-173
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 163 
selling rather than making goods predominated. 
Manufacture was little practised ; the new feature intro- 
duced into English life by the growth of towns was the 
importation of foreign wares. The merchant-tradesman 
was therefore the economic basis of town life. The rest 
of the population consisted of agriculturists dwelling 
within the walls and labourers dependent on the 
merchant-tradesmen. Destitution was not unknown; in 
the country everyone had his place in the social fabric 
and could not escape from it: but it is a mere imagina- 
tion of modern idealizers that in the towns there was 
work for everyone, and that the wealthy regarded them- 
selves are trustees for their fellow-men. The work of the 
Friars was largely among the destitute of the towns. 
Among occasional visitors, as time went on, one might 
have seen in the streets of large boroughs rich foreign 
merchants, foreign workmen, itinerant companies of 
tilers and masons, sailors, Jews, foreign ecclesiastics, 
friars, papal merchants, and collectors. 
Before manufactures arose, the merchant gild was one 
of the most important features of many towns. These 
gilds existed for the protection of the merchants’ trade 
as well in the sense in which protection is opposed to 
free trade as in the common use of the term. Medieval 
towns were wonderfully exclusive; town hated town; 
and ‘the corporations regarded it as the obvious course 
to give themselves special privileges over the other in- 
habitants. Rights in the Middle Ages meant the claim 
to something which other people had not got. Pro- 
hibitive tolls were laid on non-gildsmen. When a ship 
arrived, the gildsmen had the right to buy the goods 
before they were offered to others; all gildsmen had an 
equal right to share; and they could sell the goods at 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
164 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
enormous profits to the other inhabitants. The latter 
had no remedy; if the merchants departed, trade was 
at an end; they were the only class in the country (if 
we include the Jews) who had any large amount of coin 
or of the precious metals—even the King and barons 
possessed their wealth in kind—and trade without a 
medium of exchange is well-nigh impossible. In course 
of time the merchant gild built fine gildhalls, held 
monthly feasts, and formed the basis of a leisured class. 
Though only those few of the inhabitants enjoyed 
the citizenship who were wealthy enough to undertake 
the duties, yet the citizens were a wider body than the 
gildsmen. Citizens must be resident; not so gildsmen. 
The duties which citizens had to undertake (in person 
or by deputy) were the defence of the town, the func- 
tions of police; preservation of the boundaries; protec- 
tion of commons; defence of the town property—e.g., 
| fisheries and warrens; the upkeep of highways; and 
contributions to gaieties, e.g. minstrels, players, and 
mistery plays. The importance of the first duty may 
be understood when we realize the darker side of 
medieval trade which was never far removed from 
piracy. Ina seaside port like Sandwich the bell would 
often ring at the approach of pirates, and what men they 
were appears from Chaucer’s shipman of Dartmouth, 
who “sent his prisoners home by sea to every land,” 
ze. made them “walk the plank.” There being no pro- 
fessional police every citizen had to be prepared to take 
up the “hue and cry” when the magistrate wished to 
arrest an offender and to keep “watch and ward” in 
town at night, as well as to keep dagger and knife for 
the “King’s muster.” The citizens elected the mayor 
and other officials, who, in addition to the prevention
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 165 
of violence, had perhaps the harder task of enforcing 
commercial morality: for the “assizes of bread, beer,” 
etc, were constantly bringing to light fraudulent 
weights and other devices for swindling which romantic 
enthusiasts believe to be the special invention of the 
last century. 
It will not be amiss to trace the reason for the 
growth of the local borough on the particular site which 
it occupied. Usually it arose out of a pre-existent 
agricultural village, often because of some special 
facilities for trade. In addition, or perhaps instead of 
this advantage, it may have owed its growth to the 
proximity of a castle or monastery. Some towns were 
deliberately planted for a political purpose, as many 
of the Welsh boroughs. 
A later time came when manual crafts arose in the 
towns, after the technical skill of foreign craftsmen had 
been introduced into England. Sonietimes the foreign 
craftsmen were themselves brought over, e.g. Henry I. 
introduced Flemish weavers into Pembrokeshire and the 
Gower Peninsula. From this time arose the craft gilds 
—quite a different institutionfrom theold merchant-gild ; 
for each craft had its own gild, and, with the multiplica- 
tion of crafts came a multiplication of gilds. Beginning 
in the thirteenth century they reached their zenith in the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. They gradually ousted 
the merchant gilds which survived only as religious or 
festive organizations. The gilds were trades unions of 
master workmen for mutual “ protection,” amongst other 
duties seeing that goods were of the proper quality ; but 
in time they tended to become agencies in the creation 
of a monopoly by limiting the number of apprentices, 
increasing the time before they could become masters,
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and otherwise striving to limit the number in the 
craft. 
In the case of older towns two sets of lessons might 
well be. given, describing them at an earlier and at a 
later period. In the towns themselves visits may be 
paid to old buildings. The reading of documents— 
even recording ordinary trade transactions—gives a 
touch of life which nothing else can. Any kind of 
handwork is good which enables the children to imitate 
the craft of the time; the reader is recommended 
strongly to read the Manchester Demonstration School 
Record, Vol. IL, pp. 85-92. 
The Jews. 
The Jews played an important part in the life of the 
Middle Ages by their control of finance. An abstract 
lesson will produce little effect, and there is no single 
outstanding incident with which they are associated. 
We are therefore left to the method of iteration, that is 
of introducing them into so many incidents that the 
children come to expect their influence as a matter of 
course. Whenever a great enterprise is in hand, the 
thoughts turn to the raising of money, and the answer 
is always the same—the Jews. The reader who wishes 
to fix the impression in his own mind is recomimended 
to read The Treasure and the Law, the last of the 
extracts in Puck of Pook’s Hill. 
The facts are briefly as follows. They came to 
England at the Conquest and were expelled by 
Edward I. Not being members of the Church, they 
were also outside the State. As their influence in- 
creased the Church became more rigorous in its policy 
of civil exclusion. They were therefore regarded as 
existing by suffrance of the King and as his special
-P-A-G-E-177
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 167 
chattels. His right to exact money from them was un- 
limited by law; in fact, however, he realized that to 
take away all their wealth was like destroying capital. 
Money in a Jew’s hands multiplied a hundredfold, and 
the King might benefit to the extent of fifty-fold with- 
out killing the goose that laid the golden eggs. 
Christians might not by canon law lend on usury; so 
all money-lending was in the hands of the Jews, and 
King, monasteries and barons were their assiduous 
clients. Wars and buildings depended on their finan- 
cial support. The King, though he could not lend a 
penny, could confiscate the earnings of usury and remain 
a good Christian! In the twelfth century, of a total 
royal income of £35,000 no less than £3,000 was derived 
from this source. The irony reached its climax in the 
fact that the King confiscated the whole money of a 
Jew on his conversion! His utility had gone and his 
soul was valueless in the eyes of the “ King by the grace 
of God.” 
A few occasions when these facts may be brought in 
may be mentioned. The Conquest introduces the Jews 
to England; they lend money to Strongbow for the 
Irish expedition; a massacre occurred just before 
Richard I’s Crusade; John’s methods with them are 
well known; they may be represented as financing the 
construction of the local monastery and as plying their 
trade in the local borough if it reaches sufficient anti- 
quity ; and finally they were expelled by Edward I.

V.—INDIVIDUAL TOPICS 
(1) William I—We have already considered the 
teaching of the Conquest up to Hastings. The series 
may well be continued with Hereward the Wake, rather 
as part of Saxon than of Norman times; his earlier 
career introduces the children to the Scandinavian 
Empire outside Britain. He has been made the subject 
of a child’s romance by Kingsley. We then return to 
the Conqueror, whose biography will introduce the 
feudal and manorial system. These are the most 
abstract topics which we have as yet had to face; but, 
if we trust to action as much as to words, there need be 
no extreme difficulty. One of the stories in Puck of 
Pook’s Hill describes a Norman taking possession of 
the estate which fell to his share. The system of knight 
tenure becomes clear and leaves a lasting impression if 
we make the children act the procedure of homage. As 
regards the manorial system, Domesday Book is of the 
utmost help for over half of the country, we can in many 
cases actually tell the children what their own parish 
was like, how much of the land was arable, wood and 
pasture, how much was demesne land, and even the num- 
ber of sheep and cattle! The whole system then becomes 
intensely concrete. A plan, or perhaps better a kind 
of bird’s-eye view is needed to act as a summary. We 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
170 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY | 
shall mention castles at this stage, but it may be better 
to keep the fuller treatment, including a visit, modelling, 
and drawing till some event connected with a neigh- 
bouring castle’ We thus avoid giving the impression 
that castles had already attained the elaborate structure 
which they exhibit in the reign of Edward I. Dramatic 
methods are very useful to acquaint the children with 
the dress of knights, priests, monks, and other classes. 
(2) Baronial Misrule——Before Henry’s greatness can 
be understood, some picture of baronial misrule appears 
necessary. No real interest can be aroused by 
Stephen’s reign; the only form in which the account of 
disorder, cruelty, plunder, and murder can legitimately 
be introduced is in the narrative of a hero who has to 
fight against these things and overcome them. In 
North Wales Gruffydd ap Cynan, driven out countless 
times and as often restored, romantically rescued from 
his imprisonment in Chester, and living to execute 
vengeance on his oppressor, Robert of Rhuddlan, serves 
our purpose admirably, but it is difficult to suggest for 
most parts of the country anything but an isolated 
lesson on Henry II’s boyhood. The reigns of William 
II. and Henry I. hardly present any biographies which 
can be taken at the first treatment, but we think the 
names of all the kings should be learned and a time- 
chart constructed. The second treatment will be more 
consecutive; Lanfranc and Anselm in particular need 
to be taught. 
(3) Henry II. and Becket—This is one of the three 
illustrations which we promised to give of the bio- 
graphical method. We have mentioned several features 
of the Middle Ages which can be introduced in this 
connection. Henry II. represents a stage at which dele-
-P-A-G-E-181
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 171 
gation of royal functions and organization in adminis- 
tration become marked. His reign stands for the 
triumph of the Crown over the barons, and thereby of 
good government over disorder. The better adminis- 
tration of justice is the point on which we shall fasten 
in teaching the lowest standards. Becket introduces 
the medieval Church. His quarrel with the King 
shows the Church’s claims; there are many opportunities 
of bringing out the attitude of the people to the clergy ; 
the weapons of the Church are seen in use; Becket’s 
education introduces monasteries and universities; he 
is the first important Englishman who lived in a town; 
a description of travel and of the methods of adminis- 
tering justice arise naturally out of our narrative. The 
fuller treatment of monasteries and towns will, wherever 
possible, be taken with a local instance; but the children 
may well be told to expect these lessons. 
(@) Becket’s boyhood. London as it then was. His 
education in a monastery. A medieval school, and 
what he learned there. 
(6) His journey to Paris University. Travel by sea 
and land. His return and introduction to the arch- 
bishop. (We favour describing the dress and appear- 
ance of a fresh character first, thus rousing the children’s 
interest as to what he was, rather than first telling them 
who he was and describing his appearance afterwards.) 
(c) He goes to the palace. We describe the King, 
his Court open to all comers, himself sitting on the floor 
knitting and jesting with his courtiers; we introduce 
complainants with typical grievances, prophets appealing 
to the King’s marked superstition, and any other 
typical figures of the time. A résumé of what the King 
had already done for England may be introduced.
-P-A-G-E-182

| i73 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
(d) Becket becomes chancellor.* He accompanies 
| the King in a tour round the country. Modes of travel 
come in again. The travellers see whatever we wish 
them to see in the life of the country. A trial by ordeal 
and by wager of battle may introduce Henry’s judicial 
reforms; other complainants may present their petitions 
to the King; if we like, they may visit a borough or 
even give it a charter. 
(e) Becket becomes Archbishop. His change of atti- 
tude is described. His hospitality to the poor may be 
used to give an idea of the attitude of the common 
\ people to the Church. A murder is committed by a 
clerk; he is merely warned by the Bishop, and Henry 
desires to hang the man. The story now develops on 
historical lines up to the meeting at Clarendon. The 
speeches at the meeting and at the street-corner will 
present all points of view. An image of the meeting 
should be given to the mind’s eye. 
(f) The struggle till Becket’s murder. (The atti- 
tude of the people to excommunication comes in here.) 
(g) The belief in Becket’s sanctity, pilgrimages to his 
tomb and Henry’s penance. The superstition of the 
time and the system of confession and penance are 
brought out. As much account of the King’s later life 
follows as the children appear to wish. 
(4) Monasteries—This series may well come next 
unless local considerations suggest a more suitable time, 
as the Chronicle of Jocelin de Brackelond falls in the 
reigns of Henry II. and Richard I. In the middle 
standards drawing will be utilized. Photographs and 
* We have frequently heard teachers call him Chancellor of 
the Exchequer. Of course his office was that now known as 
Lord Chancellor, though its functions were different.

  THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 173 
prints of buildings, representations of monkish manu- 
scripts, and other illustrative material will be of much 
use. 
(5) The Crusades —Popular narratives such as that 
in the Stories of the Nations series are common. The 
first crusade will for reasons already stated be narrated 
with some fullness. The events are quite straight- 
forward. The reasons will be thrown into the form of 
speeches by the Pope and Peter the Hermit. They will 
include some reference to trade, showing the articles 
which came from the East through the Mediterranean 
ports and how they were brought. Before the subject 
proper is begun an account of Mohammed and a slight 
sketch of the spread of Mohammedanism will be neces- 
sary. Experience suggests that teachers find a diffi- 
culty in steering between the extremes of representing 
Mohammed as an imposter or as a true prophet. We 
must be careful to impress on the children that the 
people to whom he preached were heathens, and 
idolaters, but that Mohammed was not a Christian; 
otherwise succeeding events will be unintelligible. 
Ample material exists for the Third Crusade. 
(6) Towns —The earlier after this point that towns 
can be introduced the better. Both Henry II. and the 
Crusades lead to the topic. But we are constrained by 
the local records. We are also about to enter on the 
epoch when Simon de Montfort gives them parliamen- 
tary representation, and the wool trade determined our 
relations with France. The main work will necessarily 
be done in the middle standards. 
(7) John and the Charter—Magna Charta was but an 
incident in John’s career, and, especially with the lowest 
standard, should not overshadow the rest of the story.
-P-A-G-E-184

174 THE TEACHING OF aves 
The lines of Shakespeare’s play may well suggest the 
treatment for Standard II. The loss of Normandy, the 
attempt of the Pope to become suzerain of England, and 
the existence of forces in the state which could restrain 
an unpopular King are the main points of which we 
should not lose sight. 
(8) The Church under Henry Ill. and the Friars —Iin 
the middle standards the period prior to Simon de 
Montfort should be dealt with, bringing out the rise of 
national and anti-papal feeling and the fine types of 
Churchmen, Edmund Rich and Grosseteste. The life 
of St. Francis and the coming of the Friars to England 
come in at this point. The decadence of the Friars 
should not be touched on till Wycliffe’s time, otherwise 
it may overshadow their work. At this point also comes 
St. Louis of France. The Exglsh Histories from 
Original Sources come to our help from the accession of 
Henry III. onwards. 
(Q) Simon de Montjort—Here we can take an atti- 
tude of unstinted admiration. We have contemporary 
accounts from both supporters and opponents, also 
accounts of his battles told from different points of 
view. Belloc has worked up a graphic account of the 
battle of Lewes. 
(10) Edward I. and Wales——We must be careful by 
the words which we put into the mouths of the two 
leaders to state the case of each. Neither party was 
altogether to blame; the conflict of aims was a legacy 
from the past. Edward. needed a guarantee against 
such interference in the troubles of his kingdom as had 
been occasioned by Llywelyn’s support of Simon de 
Montfort; Llywelyn stood for the hereditary independ- 
ence of the men of Gwynedd. -Both had a lofty but  
-P-A-G-E-185
THE LATER MIDDLE AGES 175 
aggressive policy; Edward I. was striving to unite 
Great Britain into a single kingdom, Llywelyn repre- 
sented his grandfather’s policy of uniting the prifci- 
palities of Wales under the rule of Gwynedd. Both 
policies could be justified on grounds of feudal right. 
Edward’s success was due to his seeing that the food- 
supplies of Anglesey were the key to the situation; for 
the first time he used the navy in a Welsh war, held the 
Menai Straits and starved Llywelyn out. The English 
teacher must not suppose that this campaign ‘began the 
subjugation of Wales, a process which had been going 
on since the Norman Conquest. 
(11) Edward I. and Scotland —Here again we must 
endeavour to be impartial. Traditional English history 
has been too chivalrously written from the standpoint 
of our opponents. In the case of the French wars this 
is fully justified ; but facts do not warrant the treatment 
of Edward I. as an unscrupulous adventurer. If the 
deposition of Baliol was justified, then from Edward's 
point of view as feudal overlord—the point of view, be 
it remembered, which, held by a succession of strong 
kings, saved England from the turmoils of baroniai 
licence—Wallace and Bruce were mere disturbers of the 
peace. In the middle standards the children may well 
be encouraged to argue such points of view. A detailed 
account of all the battles would be out of place, but 
Bannockburn deserves treatment as an engagement in 
which both knights and archers play a part. The 
children are too young to interpret the battle in the light 
of contradictory accounts; the teacher had better adopt 
his theory and stick to it. The writer confesses that, 
having seen the site of the battle, he cannot understand 
the accounts at all.

(12) The expulsion of the Jews.—This may well with 
the middle standards be made the basis of an explana- 
tion of their part in medieval life, in which previous 
references to them are collected. In some places the 
lessons on towns and trade will be taken at this point. 
(13) The Black Prince is our type of chivalry. His 
career will illustrate tournaments, the military orders 
and the training of the knight. We must not ignore the 
fact that chivalry did nothing to discourage fighting as 
a sport, that some of the causes for which this paragon 
of chivalry fought were discreditable, and that little 
pity was felt for the sufferings inflicted on the peasant 
population. Chivalry was, in short, politeness between 
equals. But the courtesies of war were a great advance. 
Especially with the middle standards, the woollen trade 
must receive its due share of notice as a cause of the 
war. 
(14) The Age of Wycliffe—This series embraces the 
rise of Lollardry, the decline of the manorial system, 
the Black Death and the Peasants’ Revolt. Though, 
the period can only be understood by consulting a full 
account such as Trevelyan’s, selection of incidents is 
very necessary. First comes an attempt to depict 
Medieval Oxford (see p. 148). With the lowest 
standard a free paraphrase, with the middle standards 
a more literal paraphrase, of portions of Chaucer and 
Piers Plowman will bring out the general attitude 
towards Monks, Friars, and pardoners; Chaucer’s ac- 
count of the zealous parish priest gives the reverse 
picture. Wycliffe’s sermons and trials will introduce 
his complaints in the first person. Similarly the 
grievances of the peasants will be put into the mouth 
of Jack Straw and Wat Tyler. Our previous device of  
-P-A-G-E-187

making different children lords of the manor, villeins, 
and hired labourers will make concrete the substitution 
of rent for labour. With a class which was well in 
hand, the demand of villeins to pay less and of the hired 
labourers to receive more, their flight to towns, etc. 
might be acted in pantomime, if the class were after- 
wards made to state clearly what they had acted and 
the conclusions were driven home. We do not believe in 
introducing fooling frequently, but it may serve a useful 
purpose in the lessons on the rise and fall of feudalism. 
The deposition of Richard II. will be briefly told as an 
appendix to this series. 
(15) Henry V. and Joan of Arc—Shakespeare re- 
moves all difficulties as regards the first half of this 
series, and unless the teacher attempts unnecessary 
explanations of the supernatural side of Joan’s mission, 
her story is quite straightforward. 
(160) Wars of the Roses—The children are too young 
to be interested in the military side of these compli- 
cated campaigns. They disturbed ordinary life but 
little. They must be regarded as a series of operations 
by the few great nobles into whose hands a large por- 
tion of the estates had been collected; a biographical 
treatment centred round Warwick the Kingmaker seems 
therefore suitable. London was of the greatest assist- 
ance to the Yorkists; but here the parallel to the Civil 
War of Charles I.’s time ceases; these wars were not a 
unity with a definite plan. The career of Richard III. 
will close the Middle Ages. 
In the middle standards architecture will be followed 
throughout the period by means of illustrations and 
drawings.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE TUDOR PERIOD 
I—GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS 
In this period was accomplished the transition from 
medizvalism to the life and thought of the modern 
world. All which marks off modern Europe from the 
half civilizations of China, India or Islam, has its roots 
here. The different attitude of an Englishman to 
Egypt in the twelfth and twentieth centuries will illus- 
trate our meaning. 
It is hard to give a succinct account of the change, 
harder still to convey it to children. It began not with 
material but with intellectual advances. It was not till 
the seventeenth century that natural science was ex- 
tensively studied, and only at the end of the eighteenth 
was it applied in new and striking manners to the pro- 
cesses of industry. Western Europe became civilized 
long before it knew of steam-power, factories, railways, 
telegraphs, modern medicine, or airships. These were 
results of its civilization and additions thereto. In 
what then before this addition did this unique civiliza- 
tion consist ? 
In reply we should principally point to the rise (1) 
of effective governments and (2) of men who thought 
about their conduct and could enjoy sources of pleasure 
outside the demands of food, drink, sleep, and the 
other bodily appetites. We grant that this mental 
178
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE TUDOR PERIOD 179 
advance was confined in some cases to the more leisured 
class, in others even to outstanding spirits, that intel- 
lectual vigour and esthetic feeling did not always 
exclude sordidness, and that there co-existed much 
ignorance, narrowness and even moral turpitude. But 
the advance was enormous: could we visit Tudor 
England we should feel that we were in our own civiliza- 
tion, while the England of the Middle Ages would ap- 
pear no higher than would Morocco or Abyssinia to-day. 
We said that men thought about conduct. Such 
thought was not always directed to the attainment of 
the highest moral ideals. Macchiavelli’s Prince deals 
entirely with conduct: but it represents a standard in 
accordance with which Richard III. must have directed 
his actions. Success, power, and fame are the goals 
towards which is directed a careful calculation of 
means, honourable if such will succeed, unscrupulous if 
these will succeed better. In cold-blooded logical para- 
graphs the author sets forth, with the air of one proving 
a proposition in geometry, the occasions which call for 
breaking faith or for keeping faith, for the encourage- 
ment of art or the development of commerce, for making 
war or for assassination. We have here a species of 
thought on conduct which is devoid of morality, devoid 
of anything we should call honour, yet is striving to 
realize a model outlined by heart and brain, the un- 
translatable Italian vi7td—efficiency, greatness, desert. 
By this canon Thomas Cromwell acted; so in their 
foreign policy did Henry VII. Wolsey, even Elizabeth 
and her ministers. 
Let us look at another ideal, that of the courtier. 
This is not, like the last, inhumanly unemotional in its 
egoism. Its roots lie in the old chivalric sense of
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
honour, which in the later Middle Ages had ceased. to 
consist purely in a reputation for courage, but had 
become tinged with pride in certain showy forms of 
disinterested action which would win reputation and 
induce poets and historians to sing or write the praises 
of the knight errant. This feeling the Renaissance 
takes and analyzes, and the analyzed product is the 
courtly ideal. The Italian Castiglione makes the char- 
acters in his dialogue discuss from every point of view 
the lines of conduct appropriate to the courtier; we feel 
in reading it that here is the theory of which Sidney and 
Raleigh give us the practice. At first we are struck by 
the odd mixture of high idealism which dictates that 
a courtier should attach only himself to an honourable 
prince and of naive advertising which recommends him 
to perform his bravest feats only under his prince’s 
eyes; but, after we have overcome our first surprise, we 
begin to ask whether that surprise is due to our 
superiority in act or to our reluctance to confess our 
mixed motives in words? Do not even our best states- 
men combine a scrupulous regard for their country’s 
welfare with a keen eye to the effect of their speeches on 
to-morrow’s elections? On the whole the higher 
standard of the courtier and not the more cynical 
standard of the prince prevailed in our own country; 
and so Sidney and not Thomas Cromwell was handed 
down as the type for the ruling classes to follow, and 
not even the sordid decline which followed the Restora- 
tion has blotted out the impression. 
Perhaps the most English, however, of all Renais- 
sance ideals is given us in Elyot’s Gouvernour, the 
Tudor judge or administrator, a descendant of the 
courtier, but less military and less medieval. If the
-P-A-G-E-191
THE TUDOR PERIOD 181 
agents of an absolute monarchy had all lived up to this 
ideal, absolutism might have endured to the present 
day. Its existence—truly government for the people, 
though not by the people—explains the popularity of 
the Tudor administration and the loyalty which a 
majority of the nation retained under the Stuarts. Of 
course honesty in administration is not attained at 
once; but the leaven is seen working in the conviction 
of Bacon for receiving bribes. 
We have devoted so large a space to these sixteenth 
century ideals of conduct because they enable us to 
recognize the typical character of its most distinguished 
men, its high-souled servants of the crown, civil and 
military—More, Raleigh, Sidney; its astute statesmen, 
some with loftier some with more self-seeking aims,’ but 
all in their foreign policy wielding weapons which we 
do not publicly avow and probably seek to avoid— 
Henry VII. Wolsey, Cromwell, Elizabeth, Cecil. All 
realized, whether intent on their own interest or the 
people’s, that economic and social welfare, a firm and 
even-handed administration of justice, and a competent 
and paternal administration conduced to the prosperity 
of people and government alike. Thus it came to pass 
that the age which developed the most subservient 
respect for the majesty of an “anointed king” was the 
age in which the people began to feel that government 
was a blessing. The monarchy which had in the 
Middle Ages fitfully succeeded in checking the worst 
abuses of feudal misgovernment had now trampled down 
its foe. The King stood out as “the Lord’s Anointed,” 
God’s agent as a “terror to evil-doers and a defence of 
those that do well”; and we must not read back into 
Tudor times the feelings of the Stuart period for Kings
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
who retained the fashion of kingship te had lost the 
power thereof. 
The change in the character of the rulers might have 
come even without that great burst of literary en- 
thusiasm for the Greek and Latin writers which we 
call the Renaissance; but we cannot be sure that its 
effects would have been so intense and lasting, its en- 
thusiasms so high, its ideals at once so attractive and 
so sane. This at least we know, that every sentiment 
which expressed a loftier aim in life was set forth on 
the authority of some classical writer, was embodied in 
the hero of some classical story, and won its way to the 
heart accompanied by the solemn strains of Virgilian 
verse or the loftier grace of Platonic prose; that, 
wherever classical literature spread, it was followed by 
a burst of energy which gave rise to a native literature; 
that for the first time modern governments reflected the 
stability and efficiency of Roman administration (in 
view of the rarity of these qualities in the history of the 
world surely not a coincidence!), and that Europe felt 
once more that originality, that joyful abandonment to 
the pleasures of intellectual play, that yearning after 
beauty as something at once to be revered and enjoyed, 
which had been revealed to no other nation but the 
Greeks. Men of letters and men of action, scholars, 
soldiers, and statesmen thought the thoughts, spoke 
after the manner and imitated the deeds of ancient 
Greeks and Romans. 
The moving intellectual forces and the new political 
conditions came from above; but the mass of the people 
were considerably affected. The two most noticeable 
results were the rise of a national spirit and an advance 
in social conditions.
-P-A-G-E-193
THE TUDOR PERIOD 183 
It is hard to realize how little medizval man felt him- 
self the member of a nation. Perhaps the constant feuds 
amongst the Highlanders even up to the eighteenth 
century will enable us to realize the possibility of this 
entire unconsciousness of the patriotic motive. The 
appeal to a King of France to dethrone King John, the 
help rendered by the Dukes of Burgundy to the English 
in the Hundred Years’ War, and the constant assistance 
of English invaders by Welsh princes are instances of 
a universal attitude. The speeches attributed by 
Shakespeare to John of Gaunt and Henry V. are pure 
anachronisms, permeated by the Elizabethan spirit, 
impossible in the age to which they are attributed. 
In the economic and social sphere the greatest change 
is the rise of the middle class from which the Tudor 
Kings obtained support. Though class distinctions still 
remained strong, the new nobility of the Tudors was 
recruited from the merchant class, and owed its pro- 
motion entirely to royal favour; while merchants and 
lawyers generally found it easier to join the ranks of 
the gentry. The change is reflected in domestic archi- 
tecture; the feudal castle, built for defence, gave way to 
the Tudor manor house, the abode of the magistrate 
and “governor,” to whom his civil duties as executive 
and judicial representative of the crown, the manage- 
ment of his estates, sports, and sometimes intellectual 
interests meant as much or more than war.

(a) The Reformation—So long as the rival divisions 
which the Reformation created remain, there will be no 
agreement in the interpretation of its history. Indivi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-194

184 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
dual facts may be conceded on either side, but their 
significance will be different. However, no accredited 
historian would now write as Protestants were accus- 
tomed’ to write fifty years ago, regarding the driving 
forces behind Protestantism as with a few exceptions 
moral and spiritual, and its success as due to the use 
of similar weapons. Much less was the main motive 
power doctrinal. Among the more legitimate motives 
were national sentiment which disliked foreign domina- 
tion in any sphere, and a dislike to monetary exactions 
which produced no adequate return in the form of 
spiritual work. Among the less legitimate were the 
greed of princes and nobles for ecclesiastical revenues, 
and the dislike of princes for any rival power. Among 
the religious motives, indignation in the better minds, 
contempt in the more worldly, for the moral attitude 
of the Church, and a feeling that confession was so used 
as to make the way easy for sin, did more to determine 
the general attitude than more abstruse points of 
doctrine. And these are just the points which are 
clearer to children. 
When once, however, the breach had taken place, 
doctrinal differences played a most important part in 
splitting up the Protestant camp. The whole training 
of the Medieval Universities had been directed to de- 
veloping skill in theological dialectic, and a change of 
doctrine only served to give zest to this tendency. 
Princes may have adopted some particular branch of 
Lutheranism or Calvinism without much regard to in- 
tellectual grounds, but the doctrines were the warcry of 
the various parties, reiterated by preachers, defined by 
synods, authorized by legislation; and this could not 
go on for several generations without finally permeating
-P-A-G-E-195
THE TUDOR PERIOD 185 
minds sufficiently educated to follow them—that is, the 
middle classes who could at least read. We cannot 
weary children with such disputes, but we have to facé 
them when we come to the struggles of Puritan times. 
We are now too far from those days to be partisans in 
their disputes; we can see what harm they did to 
spiritual religion, how alien they were to the simplicity 
of the gospel and to the mind of the apostles, and how 
they gave rise to a system of Pharisaic bans “ Thou 
shalt not ” instead of that spirit of reverence and charity 
which strives to fulfil the two great commandments to 
which the Founder of Christianity reduced the whole 
moral law. 
A few points call for special notice. One is that the 
bulk of the people could neither read nor write. Hence 
the majority followed rather than led. A democratic 
church organization was impossible. We cannot trans- 
fer to the sixteenth century the idea of the twentieth 
that Protestantism appeals to the working’ classes. 
Calvin’s system of church government won its supporters 
among the tradesmen of the Netherlands, of Bordeaux 
and other French cities, and the yeoman farmers of 
East Anglia; the agricultural masses followed the 
innate force of conservatism or the lead of the govern- 
ment, as the case might be. The next point is that to 
the masses change in the form of service and the 
system of Church discipline meant more than changes in 
official doctrine. We must bear this in mind in trying 
to reconstruct how the various changes of Edward VI.’s 
time must have appealed. The economic effects of the 
destruction of the monasteries will be discussed later. 
As regards differences of opinion on matters of fact, 
the justifiability of the charges against the monasteries
-P-A-G-E-196
186 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
is the matter on which competent authorities most differ. 
There can be no doubt that Henry VIII. wished for an 
excuse for confiscation, and that from the time of 
Edward III. there had been general alarm at seeing the 
land more and more gathered into the hands of 
ecclesiastics who were often harder landlords, and always 
poorer taxpayers, and of no use for military service. 
Economically the Monks had outlived their usefulness 
and were becoming in many cases the drones of society. 
But the ground chosen for attack was less that of broad 
public policy than particular charges of immorality. 
The conclusions can only be based on minute examina- 
tion of a large quantity of evidence from visitations, 
even where the issues are the general existence of pecula- 
tion and the excessive frequency of serious crime—e.g., 
murders, which are now almost unknown among the 
clergy ; and in one particular matter, the alleged preval- 
ence of offences against chastity and leniency in treating 
them, the evidence is quite unsuitable for children. The 
treatment which we have recommended in dealing with 
Wycliffe will have familiarized the children with such 
aspects of the degeneracy of the clergy as can fittingly 
be brought to their notice; the services which monas- 
teries had rendered can be reviewed ; they can be shown 
to be no longer rendering these services; and the 
opinion of the time can be noted* that criminous clerks 
were too numerous, that land-grabbing was general, 
and that a love of money and of the pleasures of the 
table prevailed, which was quite out of keeping with 
the vows which they professed. 
* We are here resorting, not to the detailed evidence of 
visitations, but to the opinions of fairminded contemporaries 
such as Erasmus, Colet and Foxe, Bishop of Winchester.
-P-A-G-E-197
THE TUDOR PERIOD 187 
(6) Geographical Expansion—The work of prepara- 
tion had been slowly proceeding for a century when the 
world was startled by the addition of two new con- 
tinents in the West, and by the discovery of a new sea 
route to the East which enabled Europeans to’ trade 
with half the population of the globe without the inter- 
vention of the alien Moslem civilization. The work of 
this century had been carried on without suggesting to 
contemporaries that therein and not in the military 
struggles of France with Spain and Austria or of 
Europe with the Turk lay the germ of the future. Then 
suddenly came the change. Men’s outlook was enlarged 
from a world of 3,000 by 2,000 miles to a globe of 
nearly 25,000 miles in circumference. Its centre had 
shifted from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, from 
Venice and Genoa to Spain, France, Great Britain and 
the Netherlands. Nowhere was the effect more marked 
than in this country. From lying on the furthest 
bounds of the civilized world, to which new ideas, new 
inventions, new modes of life trickled through sparsely 
and tardily from the real centres of thought and inven- 
tion, we were now in the centre of the land hemisphere, 
on the ocean which has ever since been the great high- 
way of the world’s commerce. Again, whereas ambitious 
monarchs had learned by experience that the sacrifice 
of countless men and treasure on land campaigns could 
only gain the precarious tenure of a few provinces, across 
the sea a Cortes or a Pizarro could add an empire far 
larger than the home country in a single campaign. 
But the opportunity depended on command of the sea. 
Hence naval and not military supremacy was the key 
to empire. Serious rivalry to Spanish maritime supre- 
macy was delayed for three quarters of a century ; then, 
 
-P-A-G-E-198

(

188 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
as for two centuries later, Hagleal was scarcely con- 
scious of a policy which she nevertheless steadily pur- 
sued, but long before 1600 she had entered on the path 
which led to naval and colonial supremacy. But naval 
supremacy is based on ships as well as on men and 
money ; and the course of the struggle was immediately 
determined largely by changes in naval construction. 
It is the more necessary to emphasize this factor as 
historians have failed to give it sufficient prominence. 
Our topic falls, therefore, into three divisions, (1) dis- 
covery, beginning much earlier than the sixteenth cen- 
tury, and attaining its zenith during the years from 
Columbus to Magellan, 1492-1520, (2) the foundation 
of the Spanish colonial empire, 1519-1532, (3) the naval 
struggle, involving the changes in naval design and 
tactics, with its climax in the defeat of the Armada. 
The first heading is peculiarly fascinating for 
children, and deserves a much larger place than it com- 
monly receives. The first act takes us back to the first 
revelation of the Far Eastern World with Marco Polo’s 
visit to China. Without beginning here we risk not 
impressing our pupils with the narrowness of the 
medieval world and the importance of civilizations 
which were unknown to it. The Crusades have indi- 
cated how trade went on with this distant world through 
Saracen intermediaries, but here we have a glimpse into 
that world itself. The second act reveals the slow edu- 
cation of the Portuguese mariners, who step by step 
accustomed themselves to sail unknown seas in their 
gradual exploration of the coast of Africa in search of 
/ a southern route to the Indies, after the’ old Levantine 
trade had been interrupted through the rise of the 
Ottoman. _Here knowledge of seamanship, of geo-
-P-A-G-E-199
THE TUDOR PERIOD 189 
graphy, of astronomy, and of ship construction was 
being built up, and, equally important, a tradition of 
confidence and of venturing on the untried. Then, 
thirdly, comes the climax, the voyage of Columbus,* and 
immediately subsequent discovery of the Cape route by 
Vasco da Gama. The story must be carried further 
with the attempts to discover a way through the sup- 
posed archipelago to the mainland of Asia—believed to 
be quite close—Cabot’s discovery of the more northerly 
land (1497), Vespucci’s proof of the extent of the new 
continent of South America (1501), Bilbao’s sighting of 
the Pacific (1513), and Magellan’s crossing of that ocean 
(1520-21), which finally proved the real nature of the 
previous discoveries, two new continents but not a nearer 
way to India. 
The story of the Spanish conquests, that of Mexico by 
Cortes (1519) and of Peru by Pizarro (1531), has been 
immortalized by Prescott. The results are well known; 
Europe was flooded with the precious metals, Spain was 
raised to a position of undoubted supremacy in material 
resources, and the English sea-dogs were slowly inspired 
with a realization that only by tapping this source of 
her supremacy could the future of England and the 
preservation of Protestantism be maintained. These 
aims did not suffer in their eyes by combination with 
their own enrichment and the gratification of a piratical 
love of adventure, though to some extent they toned 
down the rougher elements in their buccaneering 
natures. We need only add that we must keep clear 
before our pupils’ minds the pre-British period when the 
Caribbean (“the Spanish Main”) was a Spanish lake, 
* The treatment of Columbus is discussed on pp. 25-28. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  190 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and the Pacific a Spanish preserve ald the entrance to 
the silver-mines of the New World. | 
In regard to the third topic, the struggle for naval 
supremacy, the outstanding features of development on 
the side of naval tactics and construction are much less 
generally understood. The cardinal fact is that there 
are two great factors in naval warfare, (1) mobility, or 
the rapid power of moving the vessel in actual fighting, 
which will decide the victory in a given engagement 
provided that the two parties.enter the battle with fairly 
equal numbers and with men and ships in good condi- 
tion; (2) sea endurance, that is to say, the capacity of 
the vessel to maintain itself and its men in good condi- 
tion for a considerable time. So long as naval warfare 
was confined to struggles between neighbours in their 
own waters and not far from shore mobility was of far 
greater importance than sea endurance. With the trans- 
fer of the scene of operations to any part of the Atlantic 
or to the Pacific, sea endurance becomes the superior 
factor ; for the side which is inferior in this respect never 
can enter on a battle with its men and ships in good 
condition and full numbers. Next, it must be realized 
that greater mobility is possessed by the rowed galley, 
which, being independent of the wind, can move in any 
direction, but the greater sea endurance belongs to the 
sailing-vessel, which can raise its sides high above the 
water and above its own decks,* and which requiring 
a smaller crew needs fewer provisions. Consequently 
with the transfer of operations from the Mediterranean 
to the Atlantic comes the change from the galley, with 
which all sea-fights had been fought down to Lepanto 
(1571), the great battle in which the Spaniards checked 
* Rowers can only sit slightly above the water.
-P-A-G-E-201
‘ THE TUDOR PERIOD : 191 
the sequence of Turkish conquests, to the “great ship” 
or sailing vessel, with which all sea-fights were won from 
the Spanish Armada to Trafalgar. Lastly, the change 
accommodated itself to the application of gunpowder. 
In the old days naval fighting had been all at close 
quarters. One ship tried to ram the other; or one crew 
tried to board a vessel of the other side, and a kind of 
land fight occurred. When cannon were introduced 
into galleys they could only be so placed as to fire for- 
ward, for the presence of rowers and oars necessitated 
their absence from the sides of the vessel, but no such 
limitation applied to the “ great ship.”* In other words 
artillery could become the main weapon on which the 
sailing vessel trusted for victory, which was impossible 
with the oared ship. 
England really took the lead in the new development 
as early as the reign of Henry VIII, producing the 
galleon, the typical vessel of the transition period.t+ 
Galleons have come to be popularly associated with 
Spain, but Spain was really the last naval power by half 
a century to adopt them. 
The old idea that the result of the Armada was an 
unexpected event, due to a combination of good for- 
tune and “instinctive and untutored national energy,” 
must be abandoned. English ships and tactics were in- 
finitely superior. Numbers had indeed gone down; but 
in 1571, the year of Lepanto, there was the equivalent of 
a Navy League agitation, in 1578 the navy consisted of

+ A modification of the ‘round ship,” the merchant vessel 
of medieval times, so called in contra-distinction to the “ long 
ship ”’ (galley, or fighting vessel).

25 ships and 7,000 hands, while against the Armada 100 
ships, 69 of which were galleons or “great ships,’ and 
10,000 hands were produced. The result was really a 
foregone conclusion—the result of years of patient 
effort.* 
(c) Social and Economic Questions —The dissolution 
of the monasteries and other religious foundations 
affected both education and relief of the poor. 
Education was adversely affected chiefly by the 
Chantry legislation of the end of Henry VIII’s reign © 
and of that of Edward VI. The false credit given to 
these two monarchs as founders of schools has been en- 
tirely destroyed by the work of Mr. Leach. So far from 
founding new schools they practically exterminated the 
provision for elementary teaching, narrow as it was, and 
only intended for boys who had some aspirations after 
a clerical life,t and they reduced the numbers of the 
grammar schools by a half. It was the reign of Eliza- 
beth which really restored the facilities for secondary 
education to its former amount. The “Edward VI. 
schools” are merely schools which his ministers de- 
stroyed and then refounded, and for which they 
claimed the credit ! 
Medieval charity had been undiscriminating. Mercy 
is twice blessed ; but when the giver is thinking mainly of 
the blessing to himself, the benefit to the recipient may 
be more immediate than lasting. Beggars were a neces- 
sary commodity to enable medizval seekers of salvation 
to acquire spiritual merit. Sound policy aims at doing 
away with beggars rather than merely relieving them. 
* The English were, however, still only thinking of defence 
in home waters, not of command of the sea, 
t See p. 146.
-P-A-G-E-203
THE TUDOR PERIOD 193 
The monasteries did the latter; when they were 
abolished no one did either. Elizabethan legislation 
assumed that all beggars were such because they wished 
it and tried to limit the attractiveness of the trade by 
branding, whipping, forced work and the pillory. 
This might have succeeded but for the great economic 
change brought about by “enclosures,” both for arable 
and pasture farming, with consequent evictions. Al- 
though: an exaggerated picture of the misery thereby 
caused is given by Sir Thomas More, and although the 
total area affected was small, yet the evil was great and 
increasing. Acts against enclosure were futile where 
the greed for gain by the wool trade was intense and 
when the administration of the acts was of necessity the 
duty of the enclosers themselves. The towns and an in- 
cipient factory system were beginning to attract people 
from the land.* The enclosures, the Elizabethan poor 
law, and the growth of new town industries may all well 
be taught in schools. 
Finally, at the end of the period, comes the develop- 
ment by the great trading companies of merchant 
adventurers of a legitimate commerce in the place of the 
semi-piratical adventure of the earlier years of Eliza- 
beth. The East India Company received its charter in 
1600. These companies continue the history of com- 
mercial organizations which we left with the trade gilds; 
and one of their objects was to guard against the in- 
security of the seas. Medizeval piracy has already been 
alluded to; and, so long as the New World and its 
legitimate commerce were mainly in the hands of 
Spaniards and Portuguese, English trade was tainted 
with the same piratical brand as was that of the Dutch

“Beggars of the Sea” and the French Huguenots, who 
all found Protestantism not incompatible with profit. 
But the work of the new companies largely falls within 
the next period. 
III—Booxks 
The latest political histories are those by Fisher and 
Pollard in Longman’s Series, the Political History of 
England, covering the period 1485-1603, and the volume 
by A. D. Innes in Methuen’s series. The great work of 
Froude may be had in Dent’s Everyman Series (10 
vols.), but in reading Froude attention should be paid 
to the criticisms of more modern writers on his work. 
There are several interesting sections, especially the first 
chapter on social conditions in the sixteenth century and 
the account of English maritime activity in the second 
volume on Elizabeth. Social England, Vol. IL, will 
be found invaluable. Hallam’s Constitutional History 
of England (Dent, Everyman, 3 vols.) contains much 
detail on this period, and goes down to George II. 
Bell’s Source Books of English History, (1) 1485-1547, 
(2) 1547-1603 (1s. each), will be found useful. Machia- 
velli’s Prince, Elyot’s Governour, and More’s U‘opia 
may be had in the Everyman Series. 
For the Renaissance and Reformation—Seebohm’s 
Era of the Protestant Revolution (2s. 6d.) and Hausser’s 
History of the Reformation give a concise outline. See- 
bohm’s Oxford Reformers (Everyman, Is.) gives lives 
of Colet, More, and Erasmus. Kostlin’s Life of Luther 
(Longmans, 3s. 6d.) is the most accessible. Sidney 
Lee’s Great Englishmen of the Sixteenth Century 
(Nelson, Is.) gives useful short biographies. Motley’s 
Rise of the Dutch Republic (Everyman, 3 vols.).
-P-A-G-E-205
THE TUDOR PERIOD 195 
William the Silent, by F. Harrison (Macmillan, 2s. 6d.) 
is a good biography. 
For Geographical Discovery and Maritime Activity 
see Jacob’s Story of Geographical Discovery (Newnes, 
1s.), Hakluyt’s Voyages (Everyman, 8 vols.), Hannay’s 
Navy and Sea Power (Home Univ. Lib.,, ts.), Prescott’s 
Conquest of Mexico and Peru (Everyman, 3 vols.), 
Guillemard’s Ferdinand Magellan (Philip, 4s. 6d.), 
Marco Polo’s Travels (Everyman, Is.). J. S. Corbett’s 
Drake and the Tudor Navy is the great authoritative 
work on its subject. Blackie’s Exglish Texts (6d. each) 
include Drake’s The World Encompassed, Hawkins’ 
Voyage to the South Seas, Raleigh’s Discovery of 
Guiana, Irving’s Companions of Columbus, Prescott’s 
Conquests of Peru and Montezuma, Capture of Mexico, 
Motley’s William the Silent. 
The Economic side of the Period may be read up in 
Townsend Warner’s Landmarks, and with great detail 
in Cunningham’s Growth of English Industry and Com- 
merce. There are many novels dealing with the period, 
of which by far the most celebrated is Kingsley’s Wes¢- 
ward Ho! 
IV.—TEACHING OF PARTICULAR TOPICS 
The period being one of rapid change and great 
movements, we are not under the same necessity as in 
the Middle Ages of considering carefully how the per- 
manent features of the time are to be introduced into 
the biographies of great men. The events largely create 
their own impression. 
(1) Geographical Discovery—tin the first treatment 
Marco Polo may be introduced here or in the last period 
nearer his real date. The Portuguese, Colombus, Vasco 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY: 
da Gama, and the course of exploration up to Magellan 
will be taken. In the second treatment the narratives 
will be much condensed, the impression having already 
been created ; the main aim will be to set out an orderly 
scheme of the stages of discovery and to give an idea 
of the results. 
(2) Printing—We may direct attention to the manual 
work in the Fielden School described in the Demonstra- 
tion School Record, No. II. In this connection we 
introduce the spread of Greek and the visits of English- 
men to Italy. Even younger children can see some of 
the consequences of the spread of printed books; most 
aspects of the Renaissance lie outside their scope. 
(3) Wolsey—To the mature historian Wolsey has 
two interests; one as a type of the clerical administrator, 
common in England from Edward IIIs reign, and soon 
to be superseded by laymen; the second as the minister 
most responsible for foreign policy at a period when all 
the Powers of Europe were beginning to be entangled 
in a scheme of wel¢politik unknown in the Middle Ages, 
a system of alliances to maintain the balance of power. 
The second interest takes us too far away from the 
broad lines of historical development, and we naturally 
concentrate interest on the first. If Wolsey is the last 
clerical statesman, he is also in this country the first 
great minister of a Renaissance king. His closing 
words show what that meant—a loyalty which stopped 
at nothing, preferring the interests of the monarch to all 
scruples, but rewarded by no like return, the faithful 
servant being discarded and disgraced when his dis- 
grace helped his master better than his service. Shake- 
speare is now describing the atmosphere of his own 
times, and the impressions derived from Wolsey’s
-P-A-G-E-207
THE TUDOR PERIOD 197 
speech is in every way true. This, we venture to think, 
gives the clue to our treatment. 
(4) The Reformation will begin with a life of Luther ; 
English Reformation will probably ‘be told mainly as a 
life of Cranmer. Sir Thomas More will, however, intro- 
duce the reforming Catholic party and give an impres- 
sion of the best spirit of humanism. No attempt will be 
made to gloss over the unscrupulous aims of Edward 
VI/s ministers; and the land-grabbing lords who seized _ . 
the church lands will also provide an opportunity for 
introducing the land enclosures against which the 
Church protested in its prayer for the repentance of 
those “that add field to field.”* 
(5) Mary Queen of Scots—Save that teachers will 
differ in the amount of time given to this biography, no 
particular question arises) The unhappy Queen has 
been the subject of historical literature and fiction to an 
extent paralleled by few characters in history. 
(6) The Struggle with Spain—The treatment has 
been discussed in Section II. 
(7) With the middle standards the economic results 
of the dissolution of the monasteries and the land en- 
closures, the Elizabethan poor law, and the advance in 
manufactures should be gathered up before the period 
is left.

  CHAPTER XII 
THE STUART PERIOD. 
I. AND II—ASPECTS AND MOVEMENTS 
WE now enter definitely on the modern stage of his- 
tory, of which the broader aspects are capable of being 
understood only by the older pupils in an elementary 
school, 
The seventeenth century, though it was a marked 
period in the increase of knowledge and the growth 
of national prosperity, though at home it determined 
the path along which later political reformers would 
tread, and abroad it saw England developing into a 
colonial power with a world trade, is nevertheless a 
period on which it does not appear to us advisable to 
dwell long. In striking contrast to the following cen- 
tury, English history from 1601 to 1689 stands apart 
from the main currents of continental politics; the 
Thirty Years’ War affected us little, and during 
Charles II.’s time we played the inglorious réle of pas- 
sive accomplice of Louis XIV.’s aggressions. At home 
the struggle between Roundhead and _ Cavalier 
monopolises the stage; the interest of the domestic 
politics of the first two reigns is confined to the indica- 
tions of the gathering storm, while those of Charles IIs 
reign are so devoid of broad significance as to justify 
their exclusion. 
198
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE STUART PERIOD 199 
As we may assume that the century is already to our 
readers the age of Puritan and Cavalier, it may be 
well to consider briefly its social and economic aspects 
in order to have a more complete general impression 
before facing the question how to present it to children. 
With the defeat of Spain, England enters the domain 
of world politics both in East and West. The East 
India Company marks the beginnings of a great over- 
sea trade with distant parts. The effect on the home 
country was great: wealth increased; the merchant 
classes began to exercise a steady influence on politics; 
London became a great city with world-wide interests; 
banking became an essential part of economic organiza- 
tion; new articles of consumption came into demand; 
an importance was given to certain manufactures such 
as cotton (still mixed with wool) and silk; the growth 
of London made prominent the domestic use of coal, 
paving the way for its use a century later in manufac- 
tures; and the wealthier classes in the capital adopted 
changes in domestic habits, such as the use of coffee 
and tea, which were destined. eventually to affect the 
whole people. 
In the West England began to colonize the portions 
of America which had not been occupied by the 
Spaniards; adventurers bent on gain settled along the 
coast south of Chesapeake Bay from the time of 
Raleigh (Virginia 1608, Carolina 1630, Georgia 1732) 
and developed the cotton and tobacco states; further 
north arrived hardy agricultural refugees, the Pilgrim 
Fathers in New England 1620, Roman Catholics in 
Maryland 1632, and Quakers in Pennsylvania in 1682, 
the line of colonies being completed by the cession of . 
New York by the Dutch in 1674, thus giving the 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
a 
200 . THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
English a continuous belt between the Alleghanies and 
the Coast. West Indian colonization began with the 
permanent settlement of Barbadoes (1625); Jamaica 
was won by Cromwell (1655); and in the next century 
scarcely a war was fought with France and Spain 
without the addition of new islands to the Empire. 
Thus sugar-growing was established, the West African 
slave trade developed along with more legitimate 
traffic, tobacco and the potato were introduced into 
England—though the value of the latter, like the use 
of tea and coffee, was slow in being recognized—and 
Bristol increased in importance. 
This commercial expansion was the chief cause of our 
rivalry with the Dutch, who followed us in forming an 
East India Company and suddenly stepped into the 
position of the great carrying power of the world. 
The Dutch wars seem to be one of the natural centres 
round which to gather an account of our commercial, 
colonial and naval expansion. The life of Captain 
John Smith will serve to focus interest on North 
America ; it presents one of the few rays of romance in 
a matter of fact period, and one can be read in Blackie’s 
English Texts. The account of London which accom- 
panies the story of the plague and fire will bring before 
the children the changes in the capital at the time 
when it was becoming a great business town maintain- 
ing a world trade. In the same connection we must 
hope to introduce the changes in social life, such as 
the coffee-houses, and Pepys will be found invaluable.* 
It will also give an opportunity of showing the children 
* Coffee was introduced in Charles II.’s reign. The coffee- 
houses became centres of society, gossip and political or theolo- 
gical discussions. Catherine of Braganza popularized tea, 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
  THE STUART PERIOD 201 
examples of classic architecture. It is probably best to 
anticipate features which we generally associate with 
the reign of Queen Anne, as there is no particular event 
in her reign round which to gather facts concerning 
social life. The improvements in the roads which sub- 
stituted coaches for horses in travelling and waggons 
for pack-horses in the conveyance of goods, and the 
rise of the postal system under the Commonwealth are 
facts in which children would be interested. 
Ordinary life outside London may best be intro- 
duced into the accounts of Cavaliers and Puritans. 
The Puritan party took the ascetic ideal, which in the 
form of monasticism appealed to the Middle Ages as 
the best way of living, and with an unyielding logic 
concluded that all Christians alike should seek the 
best way; for Protestantism recognized no differences 
between the duties of “secular” and “religious,” of 
priest and layman. The religious Cavaliers took the 
noble ideals of the Renaissance, compounded of the 
best side of chivalry and the best thought of the 
ancients, imbued them with Christianity, tinged them 
with poetic sentiment, and produced Jeremy Taylor 
and Lovelace. Naturally the irreligious took the 
Cavalier side; for they saw only that the Cavaliers did 
not forbid harmless amusement. Naturally, too, 
Puritanism exercised a far more uniform influence over 
its adherents; it was a cruder thing, a system of pro- 
hibitions which anyone could understand, a rule of life 
which seemed natural when life had been ruled for cen- 
turies by literal commands enforced by the confessional. 
It was hardly possible within a century that men 
should realize that “where the Spirit of Christ is, there 
is liberty,” and at the same time have the idealism not
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
“to use that liberty for an occasion to the flesh.” In 
comparing the two sides, it seems to us that the best 
men on the one side saw more clearly what should be 
the true spring of human action but that they were not 
numerous enough to leaven the mass of their adherents, 
while the other side, with their Old rather than New 
Testament outlook, had something which the age could 
grip. Had James I. been an idealist rather than a 
narrow theologian, had Charles I. been a wiser 
politician, all might have been well; as it was, things 
went from bad to worse. Political obstinacy led to 
persecution, persecution pushed to the front the worse 
elements in the persecuting party and turned narrow- 
minded opponents into fanatics, victorious fanaticism 
produced a reaction against all the bonds of morality. 
At the crisis Charles II. the most selfish and cynical 
of modern English rulers, appeared as representative 
of the reaction, the state religion became a political 
machine, dependent for its maintenance on its left wing 
of debauchees, and the whole tone of the nation kept 
sinking for a century, till its very corruption produced 
a reaction. 
We have given our estimate, not because we expect 
all our readers to accept it, but as an example of the 
way in which we can avoid becoming partisans in past 
controversies. We try on the one hand to look at 
them as natural outcomes of certain causes, on the 
other to lift ourselves on to a higher plane, which, if 
progress has been real, ought to be possible. On the 
political side, we shall all be inclined to recognize that 
the Roundheads succeeded; Charles II. never dared to 
assume the autocratic power which the Tudor monarchs 
had enjoyed without question: and Parliament gained
-P-A-G-E-213
THE STUART PERIOD 203 
its position as a lawful critic of the executive, out of 
which its claim to appoint the executive later 
developed. But we must not assume too hastily that 
Parliament had all the rights of the quarrel on its side. 
James and Charles were claiming to do no more than 
the Tudors had done with popular approval. A poll 
of the people, had such a thing been possible in the 
seventeenth century, might possibly have given Charles 
a majority, even after his worst mistakes. The classes 
which now thrust themselves into power, the merchants, 
craftsmen, shopkeepers and yeomen, had to justify 
their new claims by showing their capacity to win 
them. The power of organization which the crisis 
produced proved their capacity for ever. But we must 
not be too severe on the-partisans of monarchy for not | 
foreseeing that the yeomen class could produce a Crom- 
well. 
In describing Puritanism the life and writings of 
John Bunyan (though involving an anticipation in 
point of time) will convey much of the necessary atmos- 
phere. The Cavalier spirit must be worked into the 
life of Charles I. Can we but give an impression of 
the different sides of his character which made him 
the “traitor” he appeared to his judges and the 
“martyr” he was called by his admirers, we have 
enabled our pupils to see into the heart both of the 
political and of the religious side of the struggle. 
Putting his claims so high that, by nature honourable, 
he did not shrink in public from breaking his promises 
and giving promises which he never meant to keep, 
that, by nature considerate, the let his allies go to the 
scaffold; he was yet, as his last hours showed, a brave 
and devout man, a tender father, a faithful and loving
-P-A-G-E-214

204 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
husband, thoughtful, temperate, dignified, a man who, 
with the ideas of a constitutional monarch, would have 
made monarchy loved and been universally accepted as 
a perfect type of the “gentleman and Christian.” 
In thinking of Charles we must to some extent escape 
from the influence of J. R. Green and the Victorian 
tradition which in rehabilitating Puritanism, failed to 
see the obverse of the picture. In thinking of Crom- 
well it is well to follow the picture: we wish to look at 
events from each standpoint in turn. Laud as a real 
living man is almost beyond our scope. The devout 
man who cannot dissociate his religious beliefs and 
feelings from the forms of worship round which his own 
experience has gathered them, is a common enough 
type; but children, though narrow in their childish 
way, are not narrow in quite this fashion, nor are they 
broad enough at once to understand such narrowness. 
The account of Charles’s Court and of the features 
in popular life to which the Puritans objected will 
incidentally introduce many traits of the social life of 
the times, the playhouses, music, the amusements of the 
capital, the maypole, bull-baiting, bear-baiting and cock- 
fighting of the rustics, the drinking habits of too many 
of all classes, the quiet home life of many of the ladies 
in many a country-house and the homely merits of the 
Roger de Coverley type of country gentleman. Milton’s 
LP Allegro is a wonderful key to the countryside 
Cavalier life; for Milton was a genius whose nature 
transcended party, though his life was spent in party 
actions.

and F. C. Montague’s volume in Longman’s Series 
(7s. 6d.). The best biography of Cromwell is that by 
C. H.-Firth (Heroes of Nations, 5s.). Gardiner’s First 
Two Stuarts and the Puritan Revolution is published 
in Longman’s Epochs Series (2s. 6d.), also Airy’s 
English Restoration and Louis XIV. The volume of 
Social England covering this period should be con- 
sulted. Biographical works are numerous and easily 
accessible. Carlyle’s Letters and Speeches of Crom- 
well may be had in the Everyman Series (3 vols.) with 
a good introduction. Carlyle’s view of Cromwell has 
now to be greatly modified. In the same series are the 
Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson, which throw light on 
the way the Civil War influenced family fortunes. 
Part of Clarendon’s History is issued in Blackie’s 
English Texts (6d.) under the title Cavalier. and 
Roundhead. The same series contains chapters from 
Macaulay, including the famous 3rd chapter describing 
the England of 1685, also Roe’s Embassy to the Great 
Mogul (1915-1618). Pepy’s and Evelyn Diaries are 
published in the Everyman Series. Thomas Elwood’s 
Autobiography (Routledge, 1s.), Bunyan’s Pilgrim's 
Progress and Grace Abounding (Cassell, 6d.) should 
be read. Of these the first and third illustrate the suf- 
ferings of Quakers and Nonconformists. S¢uart Tracts, 
edited by C. H. Frith (Constable, 4s.), and Social 
England Illustrated (ed. A. Lang) illustrate the Civil 
War and political conflicts. 
For Military history The British Army, vol. i.

activity comes under the next chapter.

Earl of Monmouth (King’s Classics, 1s. 6d.), form a

before the Civil War. Milton’s Prose Tracts may be 
had in the Scott Library (1s.). 
IV.—TEACHING OF SEPARATE TOPICS 
We assume that this period is being taken in the 
upper half of the school. The. treatment cannot be 
consistently biographical, though much of it is virtually 
covered by the lives of Charles I. and Cromwell. 
In the earlier years of the century, after the Union 
of the Crowns and Gunpowder Plot, events will be 
chosen to show the formation of the attitude which 
culminated in the Civil War. It. will largely centre 
round contemporary documents; considerable selection 
must take place to avoid overloading the narrative; 
and on such occasions as the trial of Strafford, the 
class should take parts and argue the case as they 
conceive it would have been stated. This exercise can 
be preceded by reading of extracts; happy is the school 
which is well enough provided with books to encourage 
the children to read anything which bears on such work 
in the silent reading hour. Many teachers will prob- 
ably be surprised at the extent to which children will 
read outside if only the history teaching is so arranged 
as to provide an immediate goal for their efforts. 
In the Civil War the teacher’s first aim should be to 
understand the main scheme of movements. London 
and the South-East support the Parliament, the North- 
West the King; but the Parliament holds certain posi- 
tions, e.g., Gloucester and Worcester, in the royal zone.
-P-A-G-E-217
  
  THE STUART PERIOD 207 
The King takes the offensive with London as his 
objective. His original idea is to unite his central 
force, the Yorkshire army and the West Country army. 
This he fails to do through the detention of the 
Northern force by fear of the Scots. Meanwhile, Crom- 
well works up a parliamentary army in the Eastern 
Counties and occupies Lincolnshire. A pause occurs, 
during which neither side seems able to take the offen- 
sive. Then Cromwell fashions the New Model with 
cavalry equal to Rupert’s. The interest is the chess- 
player’s interest. To feel this interest you must play. 
Hence at each stage the children must suggest the 
moves; the teacher wilh find that this exercise keeps 
him in close touch with their thoughts, he knows how 
far their powers of appreciating the subject extend. 
Reasonable answers, even if wrong, are as useful as 
right answers. Experienced teachers know how to use 
wrong answers; the direct negative or “That’s not 
what I want” are marks of the beginner. It-is almost 
unnecessary to say that the map is indispensable and 
its use needed at almost every sentence. Clear recapitu- 
lation is no less necessary, and some form of notes 
would appear to be the only way of securing remem- 
brance. 
Children will be almost sure to take sides in the 
struggle, and we should for our own part not discour- 
age it. Being children, if they are interested, they are 
almost bound to do so. The very word “indifference ” 
has come to stand for lack of interest: it originally 
meant strict neutrality. People do not need to be 
taught fairness in matters about which they are 
indifferent; recognition of the merits of opponents is 
the true virtue. A stage may come when the learner  
-P-A-G-E-218
208 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
will wish to know most of the facts before he feels 
inclined to take a side; but a child cannot help at an_ 
early stage feeling an attraction one way or the other. 
Let us seize on this interest and make him try to justify 
it by reasons. Arguments between children are quite 
good exercises as long as the teacher acts as moderator 
and shows that neither side should claim all the merits 
to its own champion or deny the merits of its opponent. 
After the execution of the King, we should hope that 
the rest of Cromwell’s career would be approached: by 
the children with a keeness to form a verdict on a 
man of whom contemporaries could give such different 
accounts. Two of the most opposite verdicts might be 
read as a starting point. 
The internal politics of Charles II’s reign will be 
largely omitted. The Plague and Fire of London will 
introduce an account of the city’s commercial activities, 
with which will be linked the growth of colonial trade. 
The teacher will find it easier to know what to teach 
under this heading if he has a clear idea how he will 
proceed in the next period; we have therefore post- 
poned the discussion on banks and companies to the 
- next chapter. 
James II’s reign and the Revolution will naturally 
“be taken with some fullness; once again, as in 
Charles I’s reign, contemporary documents are the only 
means of showing the state of mind which produced 
the Revolution and letting us see its growth.   
V.—THE ARMY 
Though it is difficult to condense an account of 
methods of fighting at various periods, we feel that a 
teacher must grasp the main outlines of -tactics and

  THE STUART PERIOD 209 
strategy as conditioned by the weapons of the leading 
periods unless he is to give very misleading impres- 
sions. Many pupils think of war as divided into two 
absolutely well-marked periods separated by the dis- 
covery of gunpowder, in the one of which “bows and 
arrows, spears and swords” were used, in the other 
modern cannon and rifles. Textbooks often work out 
elaborate plans of the movements of troops in par- 
ticular battles which are rendered meaningless by the 
absence of the requisite knowledge of the weapons. 
Thus, the distance which muskets would carry at a 
particular period and the extent to which infantry could 
stand up to cavalry must necessarily determine the use 
of both arms. 
The logical order in which to consider an army is 
as follows :—(1) How it was raised, i.e. whether it was 
a general assembly of untrained civilians, a professional 
force of trained mercenaries or a trained conscript force 
of all the citizens. This determines its numbers, 
morale, and the length of time it could be kept in the 
field. Along with this goes the question whether it 
was furnished with equipment and commissariat. (2) 
The weapons. Coats of mail, the bow, and the various 
improvements in firearms represent the chief develop- 
ments. (3) Strategy, ze, the movements of troops to 
bring about a battle at a convenient time and place, 
and tactics, ze, the manipulation of troops during the 
battle, are conditioned by the kind of men and weapons 
and by the nature of the country. 
(1) Saxon Period 
(a) The army consisted of the mass of free land- 
owners between the ages of 15 and 50 (the “fyrd ”), the 
ia:
-P-A-G-E-220
  210 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
country being divided into military districts, every five 
hides providing an armed man at the king’s summons, 
together with his keep and pay. Service was limited 
to two months in the year. Thus a force could not be 
kept for a long campaign, nor could it be drilled or 
uniformly armed : it was essentially a “ scratch-team ”— 
Cnut brought in the royal bodyguard (“house carles”), 
a more regular force. 
(6) Those who could afford the price wore chain- 
mail and swung the great Danish axe; those who could 
not had spear and shield only. Thus it was entirely 
an infantry force, sharply divided into heavy-armed 
and light-armed. 
(c) The favourite formation of a wedge or line of 
wedges was devised to put the best armed in front to 
bear the brunt of an attack. At Hastings, where the 
enemy had cavalry, a trench and slanting stakes were 
used for defence. The choice of ground was~-impor- 
tant; tactics consisted of exhausting the attack till it 
was so weak that a counterblow could be delivered. 
(2) Middle Ages 
(a) The national militia was continued, but the land 
had been given to knights who could render far more 
efficient service as heavy-armed cavalry. During the 
Middle Ages two changes took place; first, scutage 
enabled Henry II. to hire mercenaries; secondly, under 
Edward III. the system of contracts came in, the king 
arranging with noblemen to serve him with a fixed 
force for definite wages for a given time. 
(6) In the early days the knight in full armour was 
irresistible. Then the English kings learned the use 
of the long bow in their Welsh wars, and superiority in  
-P-A-G-E-221
  THE STUART PERIOD 211 
archers carried the English through their French wars. 
Continental knights often refused to fight side by side 
with other arms; the English always had an advantage 
in the complete unanimity of their troops. 
(c) We have few pitched battles in English history 
till. the use of archers was developed. The Scottish 
and French wars give abundant examples after their 
introduction. In all these battles the English were 
striving to use their superiority in this arm. The 
archers were protected by stakes. The common tactics 
consisted in letting the enemies’ cavalry take the offen- 
sive till they were thrown into confusion by the arrows, 
and then delivering a blow with the feudal cavalry. 
To prepare for these tactics the cavalry at the beginning 
of an engagement was drawn up in three lines, in the 
rear and the flanks of the archers, to deliver the attack 
in succession.*

Stakes. 
(3) Renaissance Period 
(a) Out of the “ contract system ” above mentioned (2) 
arose the condottieri or professional mercenaries. This 
enabled the art of war to make great strides, but these 
* English men-at-arms always dismounted to fight and 
formed a shock infantry. When the enemy had been thrown 
into confusion they mounted for the pursuit.

developments by Swiss, German “lindsknechts,” and 
Spaniards in turn were not shared by England, where 
foreigners had to be introduced to put down the risings 
of Edward VI’s time. The Tudors concentrated on the 
navy. 
(6) Artillery, at first used solely against walls, was 
made into a mancuvrable arm in the Hussite Wars; 
and the use of hand-guns by infantry, the guns, how- 
ever, needing a stand, was introduced into England 
by Burgundian mercenaries during the Wars of the 
Roses. Gunpowder, however, spread more slowly here 
than elsewhere; Flodden may be considered the last 
medieval and Pinkie the first modern battle in English 
history. The pike became the main weapon for 
infantry. 
(c) Professional mercenaries could be drilled far 
better than a militia; thus the tactician could trust his 
troops to carry out more elaborate tactics. The united 
action of all three arms was now well thought out. The 
single line with the cavalry on the wings became the 
prevalent formation. The changes of this period 
affected England little. 
(4) Stuart Period 
(a) Professional armies continued. England was at 
last obliged in the Civil War to organize an efficient 
force—the “New Model.” The press-gang was then 
first resorted to. Dislike of military rule led at the 
Restoration to an almost complete disbandment, a few 
regiments of “Guards” constituting the standing army 
for a time. But scarlet uniform, payment of wages, 
state provision of clothing, horses and equipment and 
life in barracks had all come to stay. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
THE STUART PERIOD 213 
(6) During the Thirty Years’ War the gun lost its 
cumbrous rest, and was fired from the shoulder, 
enabling the first line to kneel, and so allowing ‘a forma- 
tion in three ranks, the musketeers standing shoulder 
to shoulder. Gustavus Adolphus saw that missile 
action would be the vital thing in the future, and intro- 
duced the system of firing by volleys of platoons. The 
platoons fired alternately and thus allowed those who 
had fired to reload and keep up a continuous fire 
along the line. This system was found so effective that 
it held ground until the advent of breechloaders. Scots 
and English in the Swedish service learnt the drill and 
tactics of Gustavus and brought them over to this 
country, and they were found useful in the Civil War. 
The new musketry and the pikes prevented successful 
frontal attacks by cavalry. Later the invention of the 
bayonet combined the shock and missile infantry into 
a single body.

XII 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
  No period appears at first sight so complicated as the 
eighteenth century, yet there is none through which the 
way is so easily found when once we possess the clue. 
The clue has been revealed to us by Seeley,* whose 
views may with slight modifications still be accepted. 
The period derives its interest mainly from its foreign 
and colonial policy. Between 1689 to 1815 seven con- 
siderable wars were fought with France. The meaning 
of the period therefore depends on the answers to the 
questions, What were the causes and what were the re- 
sults of these wars? To answer these questions we 
must first consider the position and aims of France, 
then the relation of Great Britain thereto. 
The great Powers of Europe at the time fall into two 
classes, (1) those bordering the Atlantic and thereby 
attracted to naval and colonial enterprise, (2) those 
situated in the central land-mass and thereby attracted 
to a policy of territorial expansion in Europe. France 
falls into both classes. She had therefore two policies 
open to her, and could either pursue both or choose one. 
(1) The Land Policy—The lines of absolute 
monarchs which began with the Renaissance each 
wished from a mere love of glory to gain new territory. 
After the Reformation their struggles were complicated 
* Expansion of England (Macmillan). 
214
-P-A-G-E-225
  EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 215 
by the religious wars; but, once these were over (1648), 
the purely dynastic struggles began again. Outside 
Western Europe no feeling of nationality had arisen to 
oppose itself to these territorial ambitions. Louis XIV. 
initiated a policy of pushing forward his conquests to- 
wards the Rhine; his successors followed his example. 
The rival powers were Austria and the newly-develop- 
ing state of Prussia, which reached its high-water mark 
under Frederick the Great (1740-1786); further East NG was Russia, raised to the rank of a great power by Peter 
the Great (1689-1725). 
(2) The Sea Policy—After the death of William III. 
Holland falls into the rear, and the three Atlantic 
Powers are Great Britain, France, and Spain. Each 
possessed colonies in America, and each used them as 
preserves for its own trade, trying its best to exclude its 
rivals. England and France were rivals for trade in 
India, which was still under native rule. 
It was open therefore to France to devote itself to 
European expansion, which necessitated the mainten- 
ance of a large army; to prefer an extension of its 
colonies ; or, if its pecuniary resources were sufficient, to 
pursue both policies at once. The central government, 
influenced by the old traditions of prestige, thought 
more of the former end and pursued it steadily, while 
the efforts at colonial expansion were spasmodic and 
inspired more by the “men on the spot” than by the 
central government. 
Two great attempts were made to build up a colonial 
empire and both failed. (i.) In America the French 
who already possessed Canada up to the Great Lakes 
on the one side and Louisiana at the mouth of the 
Mississippi on the other, were sending explorers and
-P-A-G-E-226

216 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Jesuit missionaries into the heart of the Continent, and 
ultimately formed the plan of uniting these colonies, 
hemming the English settlers between the Alleghanies 
and the Atlantic, and making the rest of the Continent 
French. This aroused the fears of the English, who 
retaliated by taking Quebec and driving the French 
altogether out of America. (ii.) Dupleix conceived the 
design of building up a great French empire in India; 
this again aroused the English, and led to Clive’s vic- 
tories, thus a great European Empire was actually built 
in India, but British, not French. 
The effect of the European position on the foreign 
policy of Great Britain can best be summarized in a 
number of propositions, each arising out of the pre- 
ceding. 
(1) The wealth of England was coming more and 
more to depend on over-sea trade. The growth of 
banking and joint-stock companies—of which more later 
—at once created influential interests able to command 
the attention of the government, and brought large 
masses of small capitalists into accord with them. The 
South Sea Bubble has thus a claim to the place it has 
acquired in history syllabuses,as a symptom of this 
development. 
(2) The maxim that “Trade follows the flag” was 
true then, whatever it may be now. Colonists were 
compelled to trade with the mother country on its own 
terms. A colony was primarily a market for home 
goods. After that it might be a place for producing 
tropical commodities by slave labour for home con- 
sumption. Hence trade was dependent on territory. 
(3) But territory could only be got and kept by a 
superior navy. Even where the stronger naval power 
   
-P-A-G-E-227
  EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 217 
did not deprive the weaker of its territory it prevented 
him maintaining it as a monopoly by encouraging 
smuggling, as Spain found in the “War of Jenkins’s 
Ear.” Great Britain must therefore possess a navy 
stronger than that of any rival. 
(4) Great Britain possessed two rivals, France and 
Spain. Their union was her greatest fear; next, any- 
thing which would increase the wealth of either, as this 
wealth might be used for ship-building. To prevent 
the former danger England engaged in the long War 
of the Spanish Succession, while the latter produced an 
attitude which was liable to lead to war whenever other 
circumstances were favourable. 
(5) A superior navy is only a defensive weapon; a 
superior army is needed for offence.* Hence the 
superior land power may drag on the war indefinitely 
in the hope that accident will enable it to defeat its 
enemy by sea. And a single naval defeat is usually 
fatal to a power with an inferior army. England was 
therefore obliged to support such non-maritime land 
powers as might prove superior to France on land. 
Hence she is generally in alliance with Austria or 
Prussia, and the same war has two aspects—(a) by land 
France engages Prussia or Austria, (4) by sea France, 
generally supported by Spain, engages Great Britain. 
(6) To be effective naval supremacy implies superior- 
ity at all times at any point where the enemy’s fleet 
attempts an attack. Hence opportunities for attack 
must be reduced toa minimum. The longer the enemy’s 
coastline facing our own, the greater danger is there 
of such attack. The most dangerous point to Great 
* Naval superiority enables a country to transport an army 
which may be superior to that of its rivals in oversea countries.
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Britain is Antwerp, just opposite London. Hence one 
of our chief objects was to prevent Antwerp falling into 
the hands of the French; and this could be effected 
most easily by getting it into the hands of her military 
rival, Austria.* 
If these considerations are introduced gradually as 
the situations lead to them, if they are not told to the 
class but developed by the children’s own suggestions, 
which are freely criticized under the guidance of the 
teacher, without too much leading on his part, they will 
be found quite within the grasp of Standard V. But 
it is fatal to miss opportunities of introducing the earlier 
propositions and afterwards attempt to introduce them 
all at one time. At every struggle between the two 
countries, the same kind of developing discussion is 
needed: it will then be found that the earlier prin- 
ciples have by the end become axioms which are taken 
as the basis for further reasoning. 
It is far more important to develop in the children a 
sense of the policy lying behind these struggles than to 
work out their military aspects in detail. Owing to the 
very mass of material we doubt if many teachers would 
care to go beyond (i.) the main strategic aspects of the 
War of the Spanish Succession and the later stage of 
the Napoleonic Wars, (ii.) the tactics of such con- 
spicuous battles as Blenheim and Waterloo. A teacher 
would be much more justified in expanding the naval 
side with the aid of Mahan. The results on our colonial 
empire and the extent to which each war effected its 
purpose are, on the other hand, of the utmost im- 
portance. 
* Belgium being separated from Austria, this would not lead 
to the development of Austria as a sea-power. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 219 
A few words on the treatment of the separate wars 
will make the last paragraph clearer. 
(1) William IIIs War—The policy of preventing 
France securing the mouth of the Rhine as a point of 
attack and annexing the Dutch navy and trade is im- 
portant. Strategically it introduces only one point, the 
difficulty of taking fortresses—i.e., the advantage lying 
with the defending party. Hence the war ends by sheer 
exhaustion. 
(2) War of Spanish Succession—The causes involve 
most of the principles stated above. Strategically we 
may divide it into three parts. 
(a) The struggle in Spain itself, of little consequence ; 
we must develop with the class the theme “If France is 
at war with Austria about Spain, which would decide 
the matter most easily, fighting in Spain or fighting in 
one another’s territory?” The true answer would seem 
to favour the knock-out blow. 
(6) The French attempt at such a blow with Vienna 
as its objective, frustrated by Marlborough’s dash across 
Europe and success at Blenheim, so masterly a move 
that both the strategy and tactics justify being chosen 
out of the mass of military material as subjects of de- 
tailed study. 
(c) A repetition of the stale-mate proceedings in the 
Netherlands, sufficiently dealt with by the consideration 
that no general dare leave untaken fortresses in his 
rear. 
(3) The “War of Jenkins’s Ear” is the least important 
of these struggles. 
(4) The War of the Austrian Succession—The temp- 
tation to deal with continental campaigns should be 
avoided. The significance of the Jacobite rebellion of
-P-A-G-E-230
220 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
1745 as an attempt of the French King to strike a blow 
at this country which he could not directly invade 
should be discussed with the class. They should be 
encouraged to quote parallels and to consider whether 
more support could have been given by France in par- 
ticular cases. Prince Charlie's march, defeat, and 
escape, one of the few romantic episodes of the century, 
needs to be given atmosphere by full narrative or read- 
ing contemporary accounts. The story of the founda- 
tion of our Indian Empire should be preceded by a 
collection of previous threads—medieval trade, the 
Portuguese attempts to round the Cape, Vasco da 
Gama’s success, the ousting of the Portuguese by the 
Dutch, the formation of the various European East 
India Companies; accounts of the Mogul Empire at its 
zenith should be read; then we come to the narrative 
proper, the decline of the Mogul Empire, Dupleix’s con- 
ception of building a French empire on its ruins, and its 
frustration. Clive presents one of the few biographies 
in this period which give us the entire history of a par- 
ticular development. 
(5) The Seven Years’ War—Here again the circum- 
stances giving rise to it should be treated, but the con- 
tinental campaigns omitted. Discussions with the class 
should have been sufficiently frequent by this stage to 
secure an intelligent forecast of the right policy for this 
country; they will then see that Pitt concentrated on 
the right point more, scattered his resources over side- 
issues less, and turned the war to better account than 
preceding governments. In other words they will see 
why he was a great statesman before they are told at 
the close that he was. The taking of Quebec should be 
preceded by a résumé of the history of our American
-P-A-G-E-231
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 221 
colonies of the same kind as that of Indian discovery 
in the last section. 
(6) War of American Independence—Like the 
English Civil War, the chief difficulty is to see the 
general strategy and the steps by which the success of 
the insurgents was determined. The method of teach- 
ing should be much the same. Recent researches show 
that discontent was far less widespread than used to be 
thought, that the revolt was rather carried through by 
the determination of a small minority, that the com- - 
manders were constantly hindered by the lack of en- 
thusiasm of the main body of their adherents, and that 
it would have stood no chance of success had the British 
Government risen to the occasion at the outset. 
(7) Napoleonic Wars—tThe French Revolution is one 
of the fundamental facts in the history of the world; 
for historical events are generally to be estimated by the 
way in which men think of them and reflect their 
thought in action. From 1815 onwards the effect of 
the Revolution was felt in the struggles of every 
European country for more constitutional and demo- 
cratic government. The story, though outside English 
history, should be told in some fulness; and, fortunately, 
there is no lack of books. The teacher will not of 
course accept Carlyle’s epic as sober historical fact; but 
it reveals the nature of the influence which the event 
exerted. 
The early war to the Peace of Amiens (1802) should 
be taken briefly in order to concentrate on the more 
decisive movements. As usual, the general plan should 
be discussed, the children first suggesting the lines 
which they would expect England to adopt from the 
analogy of preceding wars. They should then be told how
-P-A-G-E-232
eer er nee ee 
222 THE TEACHING OF ‘iiuagad 
Pitt’s idea was to compel France to submit by seizing 
her colonies and destroying her commerce, but that the 
strength of England was frittered away in useless 
expeditions, of which one of two instances must be sup- 
plied. Napoleon’s moves, whether successful or not, 
never compel us to find our way through a maze of 
minor and apparently purposeless movements; his great 
counter-blow against England in the attempt to seize 
Egypt and thereby India, and its defeat through the 
naval supremacy of England, is therefore the great 
incident in this part of the war. 
Special attention should be paid to the year 1803, in 
_which Napoleon devised the plans which, if successful, 
would have ended the war. Trafalgar of course will 
be fully treated; and its synchronism with Austerlitz 
must be mentioned. The Peninsular War must be 
treated sufficiently to show its general character; but 
it must be remembered that though it permanently im- 
peded Napoleon from concentrating in other directions, 
it could by itself do nothing towards a final blow. The 
effects of English command of the sea on French trade, 
Napoleon’s counter-move in prohibiting continental 
nations from trading with Britain, the discontent 
thereby caused, the Russian expedition and the battle 
of Leipsig form the main thread to be followed. 
Waterloo will naturally be treated in detail as regards 
both strategy and tactics. 
In connection with the colonial wars, it is necessary to 
give an impression of the enormous difficulties which 
attended military operations over wide continents, the 
long ocean passages from England, the trackless forests 
of new and undeveloped country in America, the small- 
ness of the British armies, the difficulties of transport
-P-A-G-E-233
  \ 
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 223 
and commissariat, the immense distances to be 
traversed, the unhealthiness of the climate of many 
countries where we had to fight; only by giving an idea 
of these often insuperable obstacles can any impression 
be conveyed of the dash, the heroism, and the resource 
which were needed to overcome them. 
Apart from the great wars the development of our 
second colonial empire will be treated in the voyages of 
Captain Cook and in our further advances in India. 
The abolition of the slave trade indicates a change in 
our attitude towards our colonial possessions. 
We now pass to domestic history. The important 
political events are almost all important through their 
relation to the main theme of naval, colonial, and mer- 
cantile expansion. Walpole’s policy was peace for the 
sake of trade and the elder Pitt’s was war for the sake 
of colonies. If we ask why in the early eighteenth 
century our chief statesman needed to be a great finan- 
cier, the answer is that the use of capital was just being 
discovered. With the seventeenth century we pass from 
the single merchant to the companies of merchant ad- 
venturers trading with their own capital; with the 
eighteenth to the company trading with borrowed capi- 
tal. Without a conception of this change modern 
economic conditions are unintelligible. To recognize 
how the conditions developed is neither to approve 
them nor to deny that they might have developed in 
some other way under the influence of other ideals. 
The most ardent moralist who sees in the history of the 
last three centuries a determination of the course of 
events by the love of money, the root of all evil, the most 
convinced Socialist who regards capital as the annexa- 
tion by the few of the results of the labour of the many,  
-P-A-G-E-234
224 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
must, if pressed, admit that the more paradoxical a 
system appears to be the more it needs for its under- 
standing and for attempts to remedy it, a study of its 
origins and development. Admit the value of history 
and you must admit that the facts which are most. 
fundamental for good or evil are those which history 
should study most. But, it may be said, this class of 
facts is incomprehensible to children, it is outside the 
range of their experience and ideas, it is uninteresting 
and repulsive. We reply that these statements are 
partly untrue, partly irrelevant. Experience cannot be 
said to prove it; for have the facts been presented in 
the right way, by teachers who realized their signi- 
ficance and believed them to be interesting? ‘Great is 
the force of suggestion; and hitherto we have ap- 
proached these topics with an unconscious suggestion 
that they were dull, outside the main current of history 
and to be hurried over as quickly as possible. 
The remedies appear to be these. (1) The teacher 
should read some clear but simple account of the rise 
of banks and companies—e.g., in Warner. The present 
writer was as obsessed as anyone with the idea that 
Economics was the dreary science, but yielded to this 
treatment. (2) The way. should be prepared by the 
treatment of trade in earlier periods, the medieval 
wandering merchant, the pirate-shipman, the sea-dogs, 
the merchant adventurer; and by an interest in the 
parts of the world where the trade took place, the 
voyages of Captain Smith, the fur-traders, India. (3) 
The account should be concrete—i.e., not a statement 
what @ company is but what tke South Sea Bubble was. 
Human interest is thus kept up. (4) Questions should 
be asked which lead the class to think out the condi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-235
    EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 225 
tions for themselves. The children start in the precise 
medieval position: lending money suggests that 
someone is in a tight corner, exacting interest is 
taking advantage of his difficulties. They can be 
led out of the medieval position by the same 
route, and only by the same route, as were the 
people themselves, viz. by seeing how needs changed, 
how the lender wanted something to do with his money, 
and the borrower wanted the use of his money. One 
child, Jack, must think of himself as a trader who knows 
his way about America, what the Indian wants to buy, 
and where to take it to him; but he cannot trade be- 
cause he has not enough money to buy all the goods he 
can sell. Another must imagine that he has the money 
but wants to stay at home. On what terms would they 
settle a partnership? Now, if no one child has enough 
money, but all could give a little. The class now be- 
comes a company and Jack the director.* Banks can 
be explained on the same lines. 
Perhaps the only political events other than those 
concerned with trade and foreign affairs which deserve 
notice are the unions with Scotland and Ireland. The 
corruption in politics which showed itself in the love of 
the Whig nobles for giving sinecures to relatives will 
be noticed in connection with the improvement of morals 
in the middle of the century, when the Wesleyan Re- 
vival will be treated and some general account of the 
deterioration of character given as an introduction.

226 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
agrarian revolutions, though we consider it better to 
teach them as an introduction to the recent period. 
The Industrial Revolution roughly covers the period 
1770-1840. Up to the middle of the eighteenth century 
manufacture was carried on in the ancient manner. 
Machinery, factories, and the division of labour were 
practically unknown, while the means of communication 
were execrable. About 1760 came the great inventions 
which revolutionized the cotton trade—Arkwright’s 
water frame, Hargreave’s spinning jenny, Crompton’s 
mule, Watt’s steam engine, Cartwright’s power loom. 
Some of these inventions were also modified to suit 
the woollen manufacture. The northern districts of 
England became populous, rich and powerful, and 
a comparison of the industrial map of England at the 
beginning and the end of the eighteenth century will 
show best of all the effect of the revolution. The growth 
of the iron trade, the inventions which enabled coal to 
be used in smelting, the rise of the pottery and other 
manufactures, all form part of the subject. Along with 
the improvement in machinery and organization came 
the advance of the means of communication—canals, 
roads, and, lastly, railways. The old domestic system 
gave way to the modern factory system with all its far- 
reaching effects, both good and evil. 
Contemporaneously with the Industrial Revolution - 
occurred the Agrarian Revolution. The new centres of 
population demanded food, and partly as the result of 
this demand came the great change which extinguished 
the remains of the common-field system of agriculture. 
The country gentlemen led the way: Tull introduced 
turnips, Weston introduced clover, Lord Townshend and 
Allen introduced marling. The wasteful system of
-P-A-G-E-237
  EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 227 
fallows disappeared with the advent of the new crops; 
farming became scientific, and large scale cultivation 
became general. Sheep and cattle breeding received 
attention; animals were bred for meat rather than for 
wool and ‘skins. Bakewell, of Dishley, produced the 
Leicestershire breed of sheep and the “ Dishley ” breed 
of cattle, the Collings raised the shorthorn or “ Dur- 
ham” breed. After 1760 came the long series of En- 
closure Acts which reduced the old common of pasture, 
and the arable common fields dwindled almost to 
nothing. The new enclosures were seized by the great 
landlords to the great detriment of the poor. Although 
agriculture improved, the export of corn ceased owing 
to the strength of the home demand. Attention should 
now be directed to the Corn Laws and its object. The 
agrarian, like the industrial, revolution produced the. 
great employer with workers dependent upon him. The 
factory system and the new agriculture extinguished the 
old yeomanry, once the pride of England. Pauperism 
became once more a great and pressing problem. The 
social revolution made the old arrangements hopelessly 
inadequate; the enormous growth of the towns, the 
fluctuations of trade due to war and speculation, pro- 
duced great distress; the shameful system of exploiting 
child labour began. The outbreak of the revolutionary 
war and the consequent distress led to the suicidal sys- 
tem of using the rates to supplement inadequate wages. 
The result was the reckless increase of a degraded popu- 
lation and the chaos and misery which were at length 
arrested by the New Poor Law of 1834.

228 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Books 
In addition to the general textbooks the teacher will 
find useful as wider works of reference, C. Grant Robert- 
son’s England Under the Hanoverians, and vols. viii., 
ix, x, and xi. in Longman’s Political History of 
England. Macaulay’s History of England, 1685-1702, 
may be had in the Everyman Series. The latest bio- 
graphy of William Pitt is that by Basil Williams (Long- 
man’s, 2 vols.). Smaller biographical works are Traill’s 
William III., Morley’s Walpole, Rosebery’s Pitt, Mor- 
ley’s Chatham (Macmillan, Twelve English Statesmen 
Series, 2s. 6d. each), Macaulay’s Clive and Warren 
Hastings, Trotter’s Life of Warren Hastings (Everyman, 
1s.), Hooper’s Wellington (English Men of Action, 
2s. 6d.), H. A. L. Fisher’s Napoleon (Home University 
Library, 1s.), Trevelyan’s Charles James Fox (Nelson, 
Is.). J. W. Fortescue’s British Statesmen of the Great 
War is brilliantly written with original views. 
For the military history of the period the great work 
of J. W. Fortescue, The British Army, should be con- 
sulted where possible. By the same author, Miltary 
History (Cambridge Manuals, 1s.) will be found of 
great interest and full of suggestive matter, especially 
on Indian and Colonial warfare. Extremely valuable 
are Hilaire Belloc’s studies on Blenheim and Waterloo 
in his series, Britzsh Battles (Stephen Swift, 1s. each); 
Hooper’s Waterloo (Bohn, 1s.) is full of details on the 
campaign. See also Redway, Wellington and Waterloo 
(Jack, 6d.); H. B. George, Battles of English History 
(Methuen, 3s. 6d.) will be found useful. Napier’s 
English Battles and Sieges in the Peninsula (Murray, 
1s.) will be found valuable for the Peninsular War.
-P-A-G-E-239
    
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 229 > 
Novels dealing with the military side of the eighteenth 
century are numerous. 
For naval history, The Royal Navy, edited by Laird 
Clowes, will be found in large libraries, also Mahan’s 
Influence of Sea Power on History (1660-1783) and his 
Influence of Sea Power on the French Revolution and 
Empire. Langton’s Life of Nelson (Macmillan, 2s. 6d.), 
Hannay’s Navy and Sea Power (Home University 
Library, 1s.), Leyland’s The Royal Navy (Cambridge 
Manuals, ts.) will be found to contain useful informa- 
tion, while Marryat’s novels will describe the period of 
the French Wars in the time of Nelson. Smollett’s 
Roderick Random will be useful for naval life in the 
earlier eighteenth century. 
For colonial history the best general introduction is 
Egerton’s Short History of British Colonial Policy 
(Methuen, tos. 6d.). Seeley’s Expansion of England 
gives the events of the eighteenth century in a luminous 
manner. Ludlow’s War of American Independence 
(Longman, 2s. 6d.) gives a comprehensive sketch of the 
rise and development of the English colonies in North 
America. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin 
(Everyman, Is.) gives a picture of life in the colonies. 
Lecky’s History of England in the Eighteenth Century, 
vol. ii. (Longman, 2s. 6d.) gives an account of the 
American Revolution. For Canada, the great works of 
Parkman (some in Everyman Series) give the history 
of French rule. Canada, by A. G. Bradley (Home 
University Library, 1s.), includes an historical sketch. 
The best introduction to the history of the West Indies 
is vol. ii. of C. P. Lucas’s Historical Geography of the 
British Colonies. See also J. A. Froude’s The English 
in the West Indies (Longman, 2s. 6d.). Note also the
-P-A-G-E-240
   
230 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
suggestive chapter in Forescue’s Military History (Cam- 
bridge Manuals, 1s.). This work also contains a valu- 
able section on the campaigns in India. Biographical 
material for Indian history will be found in the Rulers 
of India Series (Clarendon Press, 2s. 6d. each). A com- 
plete history is A. D. Innes’ History of the British in 
India (Methuen, 6s.). For the early history of Euro- 
pean activity in India Sir W. W. Hunter’s British 
India (ends 1708) should be consulted if possible 
for its brilliant account of the trade routes to the 
East and the exploits of the Portuguese and the Dutch 
in the East Indies. Adam Smith’s chapter on Colonies 
should be read (Wealth of Nations, 2 vols. World’s 
Classics, ts. each. Book iv., chapter vii.). See also 
Burke’s Speeches on American Taxation. 
For the Industrial and Agricultural Revolutions the 
best book is Toynbee’s Industrial Revolution (Long- 
man, 2s. 6d.). Warner's Landmarks of English Indus- 
trial History contains chapters on this subject. Thorold 
Roger’s Lectures (The Industrial and Commercial His- 
tory of England, Fisher Unwin, 2s. 6d.) also provide 
material. Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations provides 
copious information on the conditions of life and in- 
dustry in eighteenth-century England. Mention should 
also be made of the introduction to Leslie Stephen’s 
English Utilitarians, vol. i. (Duckworth, 3 vols, 5s. 
each).

CHAPTER XIV 
THE RECENT PERIOD 
§ 1. Up to recent times history has ended in 1815. 
If history is to have any vital connection with the 
problems of the present day, this gap must be bridged. 
Intelligent reading of the newspapers is impossible 
without some knowledge of the last century. Contrast 
our present environment with the impression which a 
history ending with the Napoleonic wars must leave. 
In the history lesson our pupils have been accustomed 
to a perpetual maritime struggle with France and 
Spain: the great land powers (Russia, Prussia and 
Austria) stand in a hazy background. In the news- 
papers they read of a huge struggle with Germany and 
Austria and find us allied with our old rival France, 
a new power Italy, and the hitherto distant Russia. 
Outside Europe, history has introduced only India and 
an English-speaking fringe of North America. To-day 
there is a world power in the United States, and a 
strong civilized Japan. In the eighteenth century 
colonies consisted in tropical possessions worked by 
slave labour, or in empty lands on which Captain Cook 
had raised the British flag. To-day they embrace 
great English-speaking states. In 1815 the map of 
Africa consisted mainly of “regions unexplored”; the 
continent is now partitioned among the various Euro- 
pean states.

232 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
At home the difference is no less great. Ordinary 
history does indeed refer to the industrial revolution; 
the agricultural revolution it practically ignores. The 
children have heard of the introduction of railways and 
telegraphs, but they have little idea what their absence 
meant. History perhaps refers to the problems raised 
by the change from agricultural to industrial condi- 
tions, but the steps already taken towards their solu- 
tion are largely left out. In short, the last picture pre- 
sented in the history lesson is an England in which 
canals, mechanical appliances for spinning and the use 
of steam had just been discovered ; over against this the 
children set their own picture of the present day. The 
intermediate step—the squalor and misery of both 
industrial and agricultural poor, the evils of child 
labour, the discontent that found vent in riot and 
arson, the absence of schools and constant presence of 
the hangman, the world of Charles Kingsley or even of 
Dickens—is the least-known part of English history. 
Save to those unfortunate children who still live in 
what unhappily remains of that world in the worst 
slums, it is as though it had never been. Political 
questions are approached as if the Universe had been 
created at the previous general election and as if the 
immediate cry of the hour could be separated from all 
that has come before and from all that is to come 
after. : 
§ 2. In this period it is harder than in any other to 
disentangle what is really significant; we are too near 
the period to see it in its true perspective. We ven- 
ture to suggest the following scheme of relations for 
British history :— 
(1) The spreading effect of the mechanical inventions
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE RECENT PERIOD 233 
of the preceding century and the constant stream of 
additions, resulting— 
(a) Economically, in the conversion of Great 
Britain from an agricultural into an industrial 
country ; 
(6) Socially, in the growth of a town population 
which at first lay outside.all religious, educational 
and civilizing influences and under the worst con- 
ditions as regards food, housing and sanitation; 
(c) In social, religious, philanthropic, literary, 
educational and political attempts to meet these 
social conditions ; : 
(d) In a demand for various reforms which 
ely concentrated round the attempt to secure 
or the working classes a share in the political 
power. 
(2) The invention of rapid modes of communication, 
ie. railways, steamships, the telegraph and the penny 
post, resulting— 
(a) Economically, in the world becoming an 
economic whole, the products of any one region 
being transferable to any other, with a consequent 
cheapening of commodities; 
(4) Socially, in a rise in the standard of living, 
and in the creation of a ‘greater margin to be spent 
on intellectual and esthetic purposes and on 
amusements ; 
(c) Intellectually, in the awakening that comes 
of greater intercourse both between individuals and 
between nations; 
(d) Politically (i.) in British political interests 
becoming world-wide and in the opening up of 
new regions, (ii.) in emigration, resulting in the 
settlement of Canada, Australia, South Africa and 
New Zealand, (iii) in the removal of taxes on 
imports. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
234 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
This review of British history takes as its standpoint 
the causes operative at the beginning of the period and 
traces their effects immediate and remote. The imme- 
diate effects, however, have passed away. The worst 
of the resulting social evils have been remedied. 
Democratic government has been established, universal 
compulsory education has been provided by the State. 
Had it not been for the Irish question constitutional 
questions would have disappeared soon after 1885. 
The modern reader may therefore wish to view the 
events of the century not as the effects of causes operat- 
ing at the beginning but as steps in a development 
whichis still to come. For instance, the social legis- 
lation of the early part of the period appeared to its 
authors as a medical treatment of the body politic, the 
healing of a festering sore which would kill if left 
uncured ; to many persons at the present day it appears 
as a preliminary step to what we may call a hygienic 
treatment, a regulation by the State of the ordinary 
working of the social and economic organism. 
Let us say at once that this difference between the 
historical tracing of actual causes and effects and the 
attempt to find in recent events indications pointing to 
what we believe should be the goal of the future seems 
to us to constitute the difference between the historical 
and the political attitude, between what is for the 
teacher the safe and the unsafe way of dealing with 
controversial matters. History is studied mainly for 
its applications, but each person must make them for 
himself. By substituting his own applications for 
those which the pupil will some day make, the teacher 
is undoing the good which he has done by teaching 
history. A selection of facts in view of what we regard
-P-A-G-E-245
THE RECENT PERIOD 235 
as their ultimate significance is necessary; but, when 
we have set forth the originating causes and traced 
their results to the present day, we are debarred by 
our position from stating to what developments we 
think they ought to give rise. We may trace various 
factors in nineteenth-century history till they result in 
the great clash between the Democratic Entente and 
Germany, but we have no right to lay down our own 
views as to the future necessity of compulsory service 
or of working for an international agreement for 
general disarmament. Similarly in home affairs we 
may trace from the original causes the progress of 
social legislation, but we may not indicate whether in 
our opinion the next step should be towards greater 
State regulation of private industries or towards the 
direct assumption of the State of the functions of 
employer. To trace history impartially puts our pupils 
in a position in which they can intelligently weigh the 
arguments of politicians; to interpret history from a 
political standpoint endangers the independence of the 
teaching profession. 
For Europe a chronological framework may be found 
advisable : — 
(1) 1815-1848, the Liberal Movement, or struggle to 
reform constitutions on the model of Great Britain. 
This was largely the effect of the French Revolution. 
The revolutionary symptoms of the movement mostly 
ceased after 1848, though the actual changes often did 
not take place till later. The movement frequently 
merged in the national revivals of the next period. In 
Russia it was delayed. 
(2) 1848-1872, the influence of nationality, resulting 
in the unification of Germany and of Italy, and the
-P-A-G-E-246
236 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
independence of Hungary. In Greece and Belgium 
the nationalist rising came earlier, and in the Balkan 
States later. 
(3) 1872 to the present day, the influence of the same 
economic changes as operated in Great Britain at an 
earlier period. Other countries largely avoided the 
social upheaval, as Great Britain had already served as 
the social laboratory of Europe. Among the effects 
were attempts at colonial expansion, based on the prin- 
ciple that “Trade follows the flag,” the institution of 
rival tariffs and the development of navies, culminating 
in the German struggle for “world-power or ruin,’ 
which has provoked the Great War. 
The influence of the first two movements on Great 
Britain was not vital. Our liberal movement preserved 
its insular character, and Palmerston’s interest in 
oppressed nationalities ended in words. The third 
movement on the contrary has affected us closely. It 
has produced commercial rivals in spheres of industry 
where Great Britain once had a monopoly; it led to 
the demarcation of spheres of colonial interest in the 
eighties, then to the threatening of our naval supremacy 
by Germany, and finally to the present clash of arms. 
The United States and Japan share in the second 
and third movements. The American Civil War was 
fought as much to preserve a united America as to 
put down slavery, and the adoption by Japan of Euro- 
pean modes of government and warfare was the result 
of a determination to preserve the national independ- 
ence. In the third period both have become great 
industrial and political powers, and they appear to 
be on the eve of a naval competition like that between 
Great Britain and Germany.
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE RECENT PERIOD 237 
§3. The preceding analysis of the tendencies which 
run through the century does not provide us with a 
scheme of lessons. We can hardly trace the whole his- 
tory of each particular question from 1815 to the pre- 
sent day and then return to 1815 to take up a new 
question. 
The possibilities of biographical treatment are very 
limited. The greater statesmen and generals do not 
stand for one particular struggle: the careers of each 
man are concerned with many questions, and each ques- 
tion introduces. many men. The individuals whose 
names are always thought of in one particular connec- 
tion, such as Rowland Hill or Shaftesbury, are not 
usually of the front rank. The great changes in 
industry and the social conditions to which they gave 
rise are hardly concerned with individuals at all. In 
seeking biographies we are confined to an occasional 
explorer like Livingstone or to single-lesson biographies 
like that on Shaftesbury. But the age of the children 
and the nearness of the events render the more abstract 
treatment less difficult. 
Our period begins at 1815, not at the accession of 
Queen Victoria. The leading questions of any given 
time are no longer determined by the person of the 
existing monarch. The industrial and agricultural 
revolutions are but taken along with this period rather 
than in their proper chronological place. 
In discussing the selection of subject-matter to 
exemplify the tendencies mentioned in the last section, 
we will take four main headings. 
(1) The Economic Revolutions and Their Results — 
More abstract treatment than was used in the lower 
standards can hardly be avoided. It should, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  | ‘ 
.238 . THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
be borne in mind that sympathy is rarely roused by the 
sufferings of masses, which often have a paralysing 
effect. Social reformers have often produced their 
greatest appeals when they have painted the evils of 
a system in its effect on a solitary individual. Dickens, 
Kingsley, Disraeli and the author of Uncle Tom's 
Cabin all used this means of reaching the heart of their 
readers. Rowland Hill and Barnardo were set on 
their life's work by individual instances. The moral 
seems to be that considerable use should be made of 
Victorian literature in connection with the social aspects 
of the period. 
The lessons on social evils and their remedies will 
not form a consecutive series. Such a treatment would 
suggest that they formed a temporary and isolated 
question which was quickly settled: the occurrence of 
lessons on these matters at intervals will suggest, what 
was nearer the truth, that they were never far off and 
that, whatever wars or political issues might come and 
go, the underlying misery of the masses remained a 
constant problem. At the beginning of the period the 
nature and cause of the problems must be clearly stated 
and, when an intellectual comprehension has been 
secured, subsequent lessons and still more subsequent 
reading will gradually make the impression vivid. 
The depths of moral degradation that resulted from 
the physical squalor cannot be fully grasped, and we 
do not desire that they should be grasped. In a matter 
of physical evil we may enter into the mind of the 
sufferer, especially of the child sufferer: but moral evil 
is a thing to look at from afar and shudder. A more 
insidious danger than the difficulty of avoiding the 
morally degrading is that the teacher should fall under
-P-A-G-E-249
  
\ 
THE RECENT PERIOD +. 280, 
the spell of that spirit of pessimism which pervades 
the twentieth century descriptive literature of the slum. 
Dickens is a far better guide. He never fails to give 
us a picture either of squalor or of iniquity—especially 
of cruelty, and that in a way which rouses our indigna- 
tion—but the dominant note is struck by the beauty 
of the self-sacrifice which such conditions have often 
inspired. Faith in human nature and faith in the pos- 
sibility of sweeping away the evils which he described 
are the main aspects in his optimism. In our teaching 
of special evils, as distinct from the general introduc- 
tory account of the social effects of the Industrial Revo- 
lution, it is well quickly to follow up the account of 
the disease by the account of the efforts for its remedy. 
The chief distinct evils were bad housing and bad 
sanitation, excessive hours of work, often under dan- 
gerous and unhealthy conditions, child labour and lack 
of education. Low wages and the dearness of food 
are less definitely the evils of a particular period. Of 
these conditions, child labour appeals most closely to 
children, and is capable of most definite treatment, 
as the acts dealing with it are mainly associated with 
one man, Lord Shaftesbury. The treatment of such 
questions will be modified according to local condi- 
tions. Obviously the same lessons would not be suit- 
able in a garden-city and in the Potteries. It should 
be remembered that the most valuable legislation on 
housing dates from the latter half of the century rather 
than from the earlier. A comparison of the quarters 
of a town which have been built within the last thirty 
years and the older parts is most instructive. The 
account of old-fashioned schools is best given when 
we come to the Education Act of 1870; no one would
-P-A-G-E-250
  Hi 
240 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
dream of teaching all the details of educational con- 
troversy and legislation. 
It is perhaps entering on dangerous ground to con- 
sider whether a teacher is justified in introducing the. 
idea that many cheap products, especially in dress, 
are the result of sweated labour. Such an idea at least 
does not belong to the sphere of party politics. A 
teacher would use ordinary discretion in his treatment 
of this subject. To us it seems absurd to throw all 
the blame on the manufacturer of such goods and to 
hold the buyer entirely free. If the reader takes this 
view, he will see that it is quite possible for working 
men and women to be partly responsible for sweated 
labour, as they probably buy more of its products than 
do their wealthier neighbours. Hence the idea is quite 
as suitable for the children of the poor as for the 
children of the rich. 
(2) Rapid means of communication are so much a 
part of our lives that it is hard for children to realize 
a time when they did not exist. Our lessons on these 
subjects must therefore deal with the old more than 
with the new. In teaching the introduction of rail- 
ways, it is the description of the old coaching days 
which will need our greatest effort, though we shall not 
forget the slowness of the early trains, the roofless car- 
riages and the opposition of certain towns. So with 
the penny post, the chief task is to make the children 
realize what it meant to people of the early nineteenth 
century to be without letters. Wilberforce’s girl who 
returned the letter unopened has given a living touch 
to the teaching of this subject. Teachers must not 
forget that, in connection with railways and steamers, 
children will always think first of the passenger service,
-P-A-G-E-251
THE RECENT PERIOD 241 
and instances are needed to show that the goods ser- 
vice has been of even more importance. Our food, 
clothes and the use of all other commodities have been 
affected ; articles formerly unknown have been brought 
to our markets and the prices of articles previously 
known have been cheapened. In some cases foreign 
goods are brought direct to the consumer, as Canadian 
wheat or New Zealand mutton, in others raw material 
is imported for British manufacture, as Australian wool. 
Exploration interests children greatly. The nine- 
teenth century stands next to the sixteenth in the extent 
of its geographical discoveries, principally in Africa. 
The early records of European relations with backward 
races were a disgrace to civilization. The Spaniards 
exceeded other races in their infamies because they were 
first on the scene. But Great Britain fully partook in 
the horrors of the slave trade and in its profits. In 
the nineteenth century, though there were doubtless 
many dark episodes, British rule has a tolerably clean 
record, the traditions of the Civil Service are the highest 
in the world, the nation at large would not tolerate 
any approach to the Congo or Putumayo atrocities, 
and the tradition that Britain must always take the 
leading share in suppressing the slave trade should on 
no account be lost. Intercourse with backward races 
is inevitable and, as we cannot stand in the same rela- 
tions to them as towards organized political communi- 
ties, the only alternatives are just rule or unjust rule. 
Thus a right national attitude towards these races 
becomes necessary; and teachers of history and geo- 
graphy can do much to foster it. Such biographies as 
that of Livingstone should, therefore, certainly be intro- 
duced into our course.

-P-A-G-E-252
242. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
The growth of the English-speaking dominions 
beyond the seas comes wholly within this period. Ten- 
dencies are often found both to over-rate and to under- 
rate their importance. On the one hand, if we consider 
their growth along with the expansion of the United 
States we find ourselves dealing with a phenomenon 
unparalleled in history, though similar migrations may 
have occurred in prehistoric times. Two continents 
have been occupied by a race sprung from another con- 
tinent. The very silence and slowness of the process 
tend to blind us to its significance. A trek of a mil- 
lion men in a given year would be an outstanding 
event in history. On the other hand, compared with 
the 100,000,000 inhabitants of the United States or the 
45,000,000 persons left behind in the British Isles, the 
15,000,000 white inhabitants of all the dominions taken 
together present a small figure. Inhabitants are more 
important than square miles. We must, however, look 
to the future as well as to the present. It is too soon 
to foretell whether these new countries will make their 
own contribution to civilization, especially whether they 
will furnish a virile rustic stock while the Old Country 
is tending to become one vast city or whether, as in 
Australia, we shall see the evils of town life at home 
reproduced thousands of miles away. 
The teaching of colonial expansion is by no means 
easy. Separate lessons on the growth of Canada, Aus- 
tralia, South Africa and New Zealand may easily 
degenerate into a series of dates—the foundation of 
each colony, the grant of representative and of respon- 
sible government, and the federation of various colonies 
in one Dominion or Commonwealth. | In The Teaching 
of Geography, we recommend that the teaching of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
THE RECENT PERIOD 243 
geography of newly-opened lands should be taken on 
historical lines, and we believe this to be the true solu- 
tion. If so, the history lessons would be largely 
recapitulatory of what had already been taught in the 
geography course, centred round some outstanding 
incident in the history of each dominion, such as the 
Federation of Canada or the Australian gold-rush. 
They would be mainly concerned with the economic 
development of the area; in Canada for instance, apart 
from the Rebellion and grant of responsible govern- 
ment to. the two older provinces, the outstanding 
features would be the spread of wheat cultivation’ in 
Manitoba, the construction of the Canadian Pacific 
Railway, the development of British Columbia, the 
recent extension of agriculture to Saskatchewan and the 
opening of the Canadian Northern line. In Australia 
the convict system, the discovery of the Murray-Darling 
River, the gold rush and the development of the pro- 
duction of wool would be the chief features. In South 
Africa, after the Great Trek, we would pass on to 
Majuba, as the intervening mistakes of various British 
governments in their treatment or lack of treatment of 
South African questions are neither generally known 
nor, except to the professional statesman, instructive. 
(3) Home Politics—Textbooks generally use home 
politics as the skeleton of their narrative, recounting 
events under the different ministries as at an earlier 
period under different reigns. The ordinary Briton 
loves party politics and a politician has described his- 
tory as “past politics.” This interest in politics is one 
of the greatest securities for good government; it is 
the elector who is not a keen politician who causes 
candidates to “nurse their constituencies” or to make  
-P-A-G-E-254
    244 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
reckless promises on the eve of an election. But it has 
its dangers when we are reviewing a century of his- 
tory. Some indeed of the measures, which were made 
the leading issues at elections and were keenly debated 
in Parliament, were measures of the first importance. 
But it has by no means always been the case. There 
is no reason why reforms of so urgent a character that 
670 members unanimously recognize their necessity 
should be normally less important than changes in 
regard to which 385 members are convinced of their 
usefulness, while 285 regard them as undesirable. 
Legislation on factories, sanitation and housing has 
never caused the fall of Governments, but the acts deal- 
ing with these subjects constitute some of the most 
valuable additions to the statute-book. 
No attempt need, therefore, be made to trace the rise 
and fall of successive ministries. Two only stand out 
as having passed a number of really important con- 
troversial measures. One was the Grey-Melbourne 
ministry, which passed the Reform Act of 1832, the act 
abolishing slavery in the colonies, the Reform of the 
Poor Law and the act establishing elective municipal 
councils. The other was the first Gladstone ministry, 
which was responsible for the Disestablishment of the 
Irish Church, the Ballot Act, the establishment of 
universal elementary education and other educational 
and military reforms. 
Biographies are least interesting in the case of 
modern statesmen. Alfred is more comprehensible to 
a child of eight than is Gladstone to a boy or girl of 
thirteen. Their private life introduces no new environ- 
ment; their public life consists in making speeches. 
Their characters can only be inferred by a detailed
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE RECENT PERIOD 245 
study of their political records combined with much 
reading of letters in which their friends reproduce their 
impression. The difficulty seems greater in the case of 
English statesmen than of their foreign contemporaries. 
Bismark, Cavour and President Lincoln for the time 
monopolise the history of their respective countries and 
stand for a single cause and policy. The iron deter- 
mination of Bismarck, dogged, unscrupulous, more con- 
fident of rectitude than any medieval ecclesiastic, 
blends with our view of his work so that one seems 
incomplete without the other. But is British Im- 
perialism—the spirit that dictates honest spade-work 
on the borders of the Empire, sane but unimaginative, 
scrupulously fair, disdainful of show, unconscious of 
merit—symbolized by Disraeli, a Semitic genius, bril- 
liant, imaginative, self-conscious, a lover of the pomp 
of Empire and not without a medieval capacity for 
clever intrigue? Is English middle-class Philistinism— 
slow to recognize an evil till it lies straight before its 
eyes and then remedying it with an inevitable growl of 
dissatisfaction, over-cautious, suspicious of ideas, elevat- 
ing consistency into a vice—symbolized by Gladstone, 
a master of words, consumed by eagerness, ever looking 
for new ideas, susceptible to all the esthetic charms of 
antiquity but plunging impetuously into the untried ? 
We fear that the legislation of the century must trust 
to its intrinsic interest as affecting the life and institu- 
tions of to-day and not to the interest lent to it by the 
personality of its authors. 
The most important issues outside social legislation 
are:—{i.) the transformation of the oligarchy of the 
eighteenth century into the democracy of the twentieth, 
accomplished mainly by the Reform Acts of 1832, 1868
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
and 1885; (ii.) the establishment of municipal institu- 
tions, for which all citizens are responsible, by the 
Municipal Councils Act of 1835, the Poor Law Reform 
of 1834, and the County Councils Act of 1888; (iii.) 
the more efficient suppression of crime by the new 
Police Force of Sir Robert Peel, together with the 
amelioration of the barbarous criminal code by the 
labours of Romily, Mackintosh and Peel; (iv.) the 
recognition of the principle of religious toleration which 
began with the Roman Catholic Relief Act, and (v.) the 
gradual abolition of taxes on articles of general use by 
Peel and Gladstone and the substitution of direct taxa- 
tion. Round the first and second headings we gather 
our explanation of the existing constitution, and we 
may particularly point out that lack of interest in 
municipal affairs leads to waste of public money and 
the failure of localities to carry out much social reform 
of which the administration is left in their hands. The 
third heading constitutes the chief negative function of 
government, as social legislation constitutes its more 
positive function. In the fourth we show the State dis- 
carding the occupation which had distracted its atten- 
tion for four centuries, that of forcing its religious views 
on all its subjects. And, in regard to taxation, we 
fear that most citizens dimly regard the State as pos- 
sessing a bottomless well of money from which we can 
draw illimitable supplies and which never needs to be 
refilled. 
Of the other matters which have chiefly engaged the 
attention of Parliament, the Irish Question in its 
various forms—Daniel O’Connell, the Fenian Move- 
ment, the Famine, Disestablishment, the Land Ques- 
tion and Home Rule—has occupied by far the most 
   
-P-A-G-E-257
  
THE RECENT PERIOD 247 
time and attention. While it is impossible to pass it 
by without mention, it lies outside the direct lines of 
development of Great Britain and the world. Its 
existence is explicable far more by the events of earlier 
periods than by anything which has happened in the 
nineteenth century and it is best treated as a legacy of 
past mistakes, a difficulty which with the best will pos- 
sible no one can solve in a really satisfactory way. 
Home affairs may be divided into the following 
periods :— 
(1) 1815-1832, during which the evils of the Indus- 
trial Revolution showed themselves most acutely, and 
discontent was at its height. This period, however, 
saw the reform of the criminal law and the establish- 
ment of the principle of religious toleration, the remain- 
ing steps of which can be mentioned as an appendix to 
the Roman Catholic Relief Act.* Otherwise social 
phenomena will occupy most attention. No ministry 
need be mentioned. 
(2) 1832-1837, when home politics are the chief 
centres of interest. It is here that we try to explain 
the process of legislation and to give an idea of the 
Constitution. 
(3) 1837-1845, in which Peel is the chief figure and 
political attention is turned mainly to social questions. 
Railways, the Penny Post, Factory Legislation and the 
Repeal of the Corn Laws are the chief centres of 
interest. As an appendix to the last-mentioned, we 
explain the further remissions of duties by Gladstone 
and try to explain the necessity of taxation, the ways 
* The teacher should be careful to avoid laying down any 
disputed principle, and to keep quite clear of the question of 
disestablishment.
-P-A-G-E-258
248 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
in which it is raised and the purposes for which it is 
spent. We do not think that Tariff Reform need 
hamper the teacher in his treatment of these changes. 
It is generally admitted that Great Britain, owing to 
the long start it had’ gained as a manufacturing coun- 
try, was in little danger of foreign competition during 
this period. The Tariff Reform Question is the result 
of the development of foreign countries, especially Ger- 
many and the United States, during the last forty 
years.* 
- (4) 1845-1865, the era of Palmerston, who, though 
conspicuous in his day, may be entirely passed over. 
Attention during this period is directed mainly over- 
seas. The opening up of Africa, the development of 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the Indian 
Mutiny take us entirely outside British politics. 
Abroad we can carry on the period to 1872 and include 
all the national movements. The dominant note of | 
the period, symbolized by steamships and the telegraph, 
is that the world becomes one. 
(5) 1865-1885, the heroic age of Parliament with 
Gladstone and Disraeli as the protagonists. The task 
of explaining the Constitution is completed, as we can 
by anticipation include the County Councils Act of 
1888. The Reform Acts of 1868 and 1885 and the 
Ballot Act established the parliamentary machinery as 
we know it. Non-controversial social legislation can 
be centred round sanitation, housing and healthy con- 
ditions of work. 
* It may be added that the aspect of the question which 
appealed most strongly to Mr. Chamberlain, the ideal of self- 
sufficing Empire, was impossible before the period of colonial 
expansion,
-P-A-G-E-259
  
  THE RECENT PERIOD 249 
(6) 1885-1902. Parliamentary attention was switched 
off to the Irish Home Rule Question. Lord Salisbury 
was Prime Minister most of the time and was con- 
fronted with the colonial activities of a number of 
powers. The main interest is thus once more turned 
beyond the seas. Majuba and Egypt are best kept 
from the previous period and dealt with here. 
The renewed interest in home politics, centring 
round the questions of Tariff Reform, the second cham- 
ber and organized labour, and the new foreign situa- 
tion created by German rivalry are all unsettled issues. 
The most that can be done is to state them in a final 
lesson as the issues of the present day and to show that 
they arose out of causes which have been considered in 
earlier lessons. Such an attitude should certainly 
impress the children. “You see that, as the result of 
what has been going on during the last hundred years, 
certain issues were bound to arise. People think 
differently on them; you may some day have to make 
up your minds.” We shall have done much if we can 
make children see that politics contain real issues, and 
that to say “I’m a Liberal” or “I’m a Conservative” 
as they say “I’m Oxford” or “I’m Cambridge” on 
boat-race day is making a game of patriotism. 
§ 4. Foreign Affairs—tn the earlier periods we have 
refrained from dealing with contemporary foreign 
affairs unless they helped us to trace the broad move- 
ments of history better than instances selected from 
our own country, or unless Great Britain was brought 
into direct relation with some foreign country. In the 
recent period, on the contrary, the daily newspapers 
and the comprehension of our foreign policy require 
that we should understand the aims of each of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
250 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
great powers. This does not involve a continuous his- 
tory of each country, but only a short treatment of the 
most important disturbances in the balance of power, 
round which the processes of gradual development may 
be grouped. 
We need to make some reference to the continental 
struggle for parliamentary government and to the | 
series of revolutions in 1848, which found a pale reflec. 
tion in our own Chartist movement. But the decade 
ending in 1872 is most important in foreign history, as 
it contains the unification of Italy, the Prusso-Austrian 
and Franco-Prussian Wars, the unification of Germany, 
the American Civil War and the revolution in Japan. 
If we add the resolution of Austria into a dual 
monarchy by the establishment of parliamentary 
government in Hungary, we have traced the rise to 
their present position of four of the European powers— 
Germany, France, Austria-Hungary and Italy—as well 
as that of the United States. Their industrial and 
colonial advance may be considered in the period 
1880-1902. The Far Eastern Question, that is to say, 
the Chino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and 
the revolution in China, will also be taught in the 
latter period. 
Russia comes into our scheme at various points. The 
Crimean War and the war which ended with the 
Treaty of Berlin introduce the question of the Near 
East, but must also be considered in connection with 
our fear of Russian designs on India. At some point 
when we are dealing with Russia the emancipation of 
the serfs and the rise of nihilism may be introduced in 
order to show the semi-Oriental and semi-Western 
character of the Empire. The Russo-Japanese War   
   
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE RECENT PERIOD 251 
and the events leading thereto, including the construc- 
tion of the trans-Siberian Railway, connect with the 
Far Eastern Question. The institution of the Duma 
is a sequel. The Turkish revolution and the Balkan 
Wars carry the Near Eastern Question up to the point 
when it became the nominal pretext of the great Euro- 
pean conflagration. 
The preceding paragraphs were written before the 
outbreak of the war, and save for a few words they 
have been deliberately left unaltered, in the hope that 
the reader will see all the better that, if the real essen- 
tials are chosen, such an event as the war, so far from 
altering our selection, only serves to confirm it. Almost 
all the lines which have been traced converge in the 
Great War. In one aspect it is the struggle of the liberal 
ideas of the first period against a force which would 
crush them; in another it is the last act, as we hope, 
in the struggle for nationality which marked the second 
period ; in another it is a struggle of Germany for sea- 
power, colonies, commerce, and an outlet for her indus- 
tries. The sketch which we have suggested of the 
main episodes in the recent history of Germany, Aus- 
tria, Russia and Italy are necessary for its comprehen- 
sion. The account of the Balkans is indispensable. 
Even the liberation of Belgium and Greece and the 
rise of Japan come in. Above all, we believe that 
teaching on the lines of the whole chapter leaves an 
impression of the more ideal causes that are at stake. 
The pupil can only realize what democracy, liberty, 
humanity and the feeling of nationality are by watch- 
ing them grow. The fight is to consolidate the posi- 
tion which progress has won since 1815. Perhaps we 
thought that the acts of previous generations had so  
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
cleared the path of advance that we could progress at 
our ease, and that this stage of the journey of humanity 
would not be marked by the graves of heroes and 
martyrs. And then we wake to find that our own 
generation is the most heroic of them all, and that the 
youth of the three great nations which gave birth to the 
aspirations of Western Europe—Italy, France and 
Britain—are one and all for the sake of those aspira- 
tions ready to grasp the crown of martyrdom. 
Of foreign events during the century in which our 
own country has had no concern, the American Civil 
War will probably interest a class most. It is one of 
the few modern wars before the present fought for a 
cause which appeals to humanitarian. sentiment and in 
which our sympathies can be strongly enlisted on one 
side. The aims and character of President Lincoln 
make him one of the few nineteenth-century characters 
round which we can cluster the events of his time and 
country. 
It is difficult to see much advantage in mentioning 
all our numerous small wars. A few might be taken 
as types. Of the greater wars, the Crimean, though it 
is now generally recognized to have been a mistake, is 
too closely connected with well-known achievements to 
be passed over. The Indian Mutiny is really impor- 
tant. The heroic side should not be disregarded, and 
Tennyson should be introduced to give it an atmos- 
phere. An attempt should be made to follow up the 
story by an impression of our rule in India. The Boer 
War should be preceded by an account of the Great 
Trek and of Majuba, and partizanship should be 
avoided. Majuba and the Jameson Raid were not the 
first blunders made in South Africa, though earlier
-P-A-G-E-263
THE RECENT PERIOD 253 
  Governments might blunder there to their hearts’ con- 
tent without anyone in England taking the least notice. 
With this record, we need not seek to find in President 
Kruger a scapegoat on whom to lay all the blame: he 
is not the only politician who has identified his own 
advancement with the cause of his country and of 
righteousness. Nor, of course, will the magnificent 
reconciliation of the two rivals, who respected one 
another even in their hostility, be forgotten. 
It does not seem to be necessary to show how we 
came possessed of all our minor possessions; they can 
be sufficiently dealt with in the geography course. 
Apart from India and the self-governing dominions, 
Egypt stands out on a more important footing. The 
construction of the Suez Canal, the campaign of 1882, 
the death of Gordon, and the recovery of the Soudan 
by Lord Kitchener would naturally be included, and an 
attempt made to show what we had done for the people. 
Lord Cromer’s book would be the main source of our 
information on our administration. If the work of 
explorers had been taken, the partition of Africa among 
the powers would cause no difficulty. 
Books 
The only very recent consecutive history dealing with 
the period beginning with 1815 is the Political History 
of England (Longman), vol. xi. 1801-1837, vol. xii. 
1837-1901. Chap. viii. of vol. xi. deals with the period 
of repression, chaps. xiv., xv., xvi. with the Prelude of 
Reform, the Reform and the Fruits of Reform. An excel- 
lent survey of this period is given in vol. i. (Jeremy 
Bentham) of Leslie Stephen’s The English Utilitarians : 
it deals with political conditions, industrialism and
-P-A-G-E-264
  254 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
social problems, e.g., pauperism, police, education, slave 
trade, French Revolution and individualism. For its 
economic side see Toynbee’s Industrial Revolution 
(Longman, 2s. 6d.). A short sketch of recent views 
on the Industrial Revolution is given in Nelson’s 
Encyclopedia of Industrialism (1s.). From the acces- 
sion of Victoria, consecutive histories are J. Frank 
Bright’s History of England, periods iy. and v., and 
Justin M’Carthy’s History of Our Own Times and 
Short History of Our Own Times. They are written 
somewhat too much from the interest of home politics 
and supply fact rather than an estimate of tendencies : 
for these other works should be consulted such as 
A. V. Dicey’s Law and O pinion in England, which deals 
with the effect of the permanent currents of opinion as 
expressed in legislative enactments. L. T. Hobhouse’s 
Democracy and Reaction surveys political thought in 
the late nineteenth century from the Liberal standpoint 
(Unwin Sociology Series, 1s.). These two last books 
are mentioned as examples of the kind of book in which 
this suplementary information should be sought. For 
general history during the period 1885—1911, G. P. 
Gooch’s History of Our Time (Home Univ. Library) 
provides a good sketch. 
The best impressions of social conditions are gained 
from novels. To attempt a list would be to catalogue 
the standard novels of the time.* Thackeray will 
always be a mine for the habits of “Society,” George 
Eliot for the life of countryfolk, and Dickens for con- 
temporary London; but it is chiefly a general impres- 
sion that is provided and not anything definite which 
* See such a book as Saintsbury’s Nineteenth Century 
Literature.
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE RECENT PERIOD 255 
the teacher can reproduce. The class should, however, 
have read at least one of Dickens’ typical works, 
Nicholas Nickleby, Little Dorrit, or David Copperfield, 
Kingsley’s Alton Locke is far more definitely concerned 
with social conditions. The children in the younger 
standards may well have read Water Babies and come 
to sympathize with the little sweep. Disraeli’s novels 
show the impression produced by the conditions of the 
age on a future statesman. 
A biography of Shaftesbury is the most human docu- 
ment dealing with the reform of social conditions. Of 
books and pamphlets dealing with social legislation 
there is an absolute plethora; some are meant for social 
workers, administrators and other persons who need 
full legal details. Except as reference books, they are 
too little human to be readable, and merely to get a 
summary of facts the teacher had better consult an 
encyclopeedia under such headings as “Factory Legis- 
lation,” “ Housing,” etc. 
Impressions of coaching can be gleaned from novels, 
e.g. the panegyric on travel by coach in Tom Brown's 
Schooldays could be read to the children. Pickwick 
is full of coaching associations: to mention one or two 
others, Cuthbert Bede’s Verdant Green and Stanley 
Weyman’s Chippinge, which gives also a picture of the 
days of the struggle for parliamentary reform. See 
also the section in Morris and Jordan’s Local History 
and Antiquities. 
Original books concerned with any explorers can 
easily be found in a Free Library. H..M. Stanley’s 
Through Darkest Africa is perhaps the best known. 
Dent’s Everyman Library contains Speke’s Discovery 
of the Sources of the Nile, Travels of Mungo Park, and
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Burton’s First Footsteps in East Africa. Henry 
Kingsley’s Geoffrey Hamelyn takes the reader to Aus- 
tralia in the earliest days of colonization. A good 
general account of the movements and tendencies which 
include what may be termed the expansion of Europe 
is to be found in chap. i. of vol. xii. of the Cambridge 
Modern History. Vols. x. and xi. of this work may 
also be consulted with profit. Other books dealing 
more directly with the Imperial Expansion of England 
are The Growth of the Empire by Jose, and Payne’s 
European Colonies, whose scope is sufficiently indicated 
by their titles. A good general work on India, includ- 
ing the Mutiny, is a Short History of the British in 
India, by A. D. Innes. Kinglake will be consulted 
when graphic descriptions are needed of scenes in the 
Crimean War. The class will ‘probably learn Tenny- 
son’s Charge of the Light Brigade and the Relief of 
Lucknow. 
A volume on Peel in the Great Statesmen Series 
covers home politics up to 1846. Later statesmen are 
only represented by detailed biographies, usually 
written by admirers. Many teachers will be led by 
their own interest to read such a book as Morley’s Life 
of Gladstone, but if they are not interested, its perusal 
will be of little value. The same holds good of such 
contemporary authorities as Queen Victoria’s Letters; 
but Sir Sidney Lee’s Life of Queen Victoria is recom- 
mended. Morley’s Life of Cobden, which gives the 
history of the Free Trade movement is published in 
Nelson’s 1s. Library, as is O’Brien’s Life of C. S. 
Parnell, which gives the best account of the Home Rule 
agitation. In the same series is Trevelyan’s Life and 
Letters of Lord Macaulay. Biographical material with  
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE RECENT PERIOD 257 
regard to India and the Mutiny is also represented in 
the Life of John Nicholson, by L. J. Trotter (Nelson, 
Is.). The biography of Disraeli is not yet complete; 
what there is of it is more enlightening as to the man 
than most of the biographies written by admirers 
shortly after the death of their subject. 
Volumes in the Stories of the Nations Series deal 
with the greater Colonies. Lord Cromer’s book on 
Egypt has already been mentioned. The work of Lord 
Kitchener and the Omdurman Campaign is dealt with 
in graphic style by G. W. Steevens in With Kitchener 
to Khartum (Nelson, 1s.). In the Home University 
Library A. G. Bradley has a volume on Canada, and 
Sir T. W. Holderness on India. A. Conan Doyle’s 
‘Fhe Great Boer War (Nelson, 1s.) might be read for a 
subject which is rapidly receding from memory. 
To produce a sense of nearness bound volumes of 
the Times which are to be found in most libraries may 
occasionally be looked at. Bound volumes of Punch 
will unite amusement with historical instruction. 
Of works for children Jack’s Children’s Heroes Series 
contains biographies of the following persons who lived 
in this century: Abraham Lincoln, General Gordon, 
Livingstone, Lord Roberts, Bishop Patteson and 
Chalmers of New Guinea.

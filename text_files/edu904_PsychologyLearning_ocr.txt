PREFACE, 
In this book I have tried to state every thing that is 
known about Jearning. All the experimental work that 
throws any light on the nature of learning has been 
earefully examined, and in the light of the experimental 
results I have endeavored to give the present impartial 
verdict of educational psychology. Throughout, I have 
tried to keep within the facts. When the evidence does 
not warrant a definite conclusion, I say so. The few 
cases of theory and speculation are plainly labeled as 
such. The practical significance to the teacher of the 
facts discussed is pointed out. 
The successful use of this book will depend upon two 
things: first, experimentation ; and second, application. 
Educational psychology is an experimental science. All 
its facts come from experimentation and careful obser- 
vation. These facts, whenever possible, should be dem- 
onstrated or illustrated by class room demonstrations 
and experiments, or by experiments and observations 
outside the class room. Directions for demonstrations 
will be found throughout the book, but the teacher must 
use his own ingenuity in adapting the experiments to 
his needs and in devising others. And always, the facts 
must be carried over to their practical application. The 
students must see the source of the facts and the use of 
the facts in teaching. The book contains many tables 
and figures. The mastery of the book will depend upon 
an understanding of the meaning and significance of 
the tables and graphs.

CHAPTER I. 
THE NATURE OF LEARNING 
What is learning? What are its results? After we 
have learned, in what way are we different from what 
we were before? After a child has been in school for a 
few years, he can read, write, spell, and perform vari- | 
ous other acts. He also knows that Columbus discov- 
ered America, that George Washington was our first 
president; he knows the name of his country, of his 
state, and of our nation; he knows many other facts in 
geography, history, arithmetic, and the other branches 
of study, and many hundreds of other facts that he has 
not learned at school and that may not be in any organ- 
ised branch of study. The difference in the child that 
has come from learning, then, is that he ean do things 
and knows things that he could not do and did not know 
before. He has knowledge and habits that he did not 
possess before. ‘ The results of learning, therefore, are 
knowledge and habits. And from the point of view of 
its results, learning may be defined as the process of 
forming habits and acquiring knowledge. This, how- 
ever, is but a superficial statement of the facts. We 
must know the nature of knowledge and of habits before 
we can understand the nature of learning. ¥ 
Habits.—A habit is an act following with more or 
less regularity upon the presentation of a definite 
stimulus, to which it has become coupled through 
experience. Writing, reading, and spelling are such_

   acts. In writing, the stimulus.is the idea of the word: 
_ tobe written. The movements of the arm and hand in 
d constitute.the response.. In readi 
the. stimulus is the perception of the printed or writ 
characters. The response, in oral reading, is. the mov: 
ment of the various organs-of speech. In spelling, the | 
stimulus is the idea of the word to be spelled. The.! 
“responsé is thé “movements..of the hand and arm i 
writing the. word,.or_in oral spelling, the movem 
of the organs of speech as.in reading. In all habits, 
“fhe stimulus is either a perception or an idea. The 
reapanse 1 Muscular movement. When we say the | 
‘stimulus-is-@ perception or idea, we mean the cortical . 
excitation which is the physiological correlate of the 
idea or perception. Throughout this book we shall ] 
speak of ideas in this way without committing out- | 
selves to the doubtful theory of interactionism. We. 
believe that in a scientific psychology mental processes 
must not be used as elements in a causal series. When 
we so use them it is for simplicity of statement, and 
with the understanding that the cause indicated is the 
brain action and not the mental process. q 
Knowledge.—Knowledge..is. also a special form of 
_organised experience. Suppose, for examplé, Tam sit 
ting at my desk writing and become cold. The idea 
comes to me that coal should be put into the furnace. 
I know that if coal is put into the furnace and the draft; 
of the furnace is opened, the room will become warm; 
and I will become warm. This knowledge is the result: 
of experience. Just as in the case of habit, a definite: 
response—action—follows upon a definite stimulus, S' 
also in the case of knowledge, an idea follows upon 
another idea or upon a perception. In both cases, the

THE NATURE OF LEARNING 3 
definite sequence is due to experience, and usually to 
repeated experience. At any rate, the repetition of the 
experience makes the sequence more probable. We 
may now define learning as the process of coupling 
responses with stimuli, and ideas with ideas or per- 
ceptions. It is the establishing of definite sequences in 
the passage of stimuli into responses, or in the passage 
of perceptions or ideas to other ideas. 
An Objective Consideration.—A_ strictly objective 
consideration reduces both forms of learning to one. 
If we study another person to ascertain the results of 
learning, we find only definite forms of behavior follow- 
ing upon definite situations. For example: if we ask 
a child to take pencil and paper and write the word 
America, he takes his pencil and makes the proper 
letters in the proper sequence. If we ask him to tell 
us the name of the largest city in the United States, 
he says the proper word. In answer to our questions, 
we get from the child always some form of action, as 
movement of the hand in writing, or of the tongue 
and mouth in speaking, or merely a nod or shake of 
the head in assent or dissent. Briefly, we learn in an 
objective study only about behavior. If we study our- 
selves, however, we can see a difference in the results 
of learning. We may sit perfectly still in our chair and 
have the idea Napoleon followed by the idea General 
of the French Revolution. There need be no move- 
ment of any muscle of the body involved in the sequence. 
It may be that the idea General of the French Revolu- 
tion is followed sooner or later by muscular move- 
ments, but such movements, even granting that they 
take place, have nothing to do with the above mentioned 
sequence. The only important thing to me who has

these ideas is, that they are coupled together. hi 
movements that may follow are not necessary to th 
sequence itself. The essential thing in knowledge ij 
idea. The essential thing in habit is movement. 
It may of course be said that J know nothing of 
another’s ideas except through his movements. True 
enough, but he does. It may also be said that ideas 
are worth nothing to the world except as they issue iti 
movement. This is also true. But my ideas may ba 
worth something to me and not issue in movement. 
They may give quite as much pleasure and satisfaction] 
as any that issue in movement. Neither the fact that; 
the objective value of ideas depends upon their issuing 
in movement, nor the fact that we can not_know 
another’s ideas except through this other person’ sj 
movements has anything to do with the existence o¥ 
the ideas themselves and the connections or sequences 
that are organised among them. Each of us knows for 
himself that he has habits and organised ideas of 
knowledge. This distinction between the two aspect 
of the results of learning—objective and subjective 
is clear, and it is a helpful one to make in our study 
of the psychology of learning. ag 
Physiological Considerations.—It is evident that a 
learning is connecting stimulus with response, idey 
with idea. We have now to enquire concerning thi 
nature of this connection. We have spoken of it abov 
as a sequence, but have not explained the cause of thi 
sequence. The sequence itself is evident, in the cas 
of habit to objective observation; in the case of know! 
‘edge to internal observation. But why the sequencé 
What underlies it? Of course it may heysaid, af

THE NATURE OF LEARNING 5 
truly, that the sequence is determined by repetition of 
experience. This is the cause of the sequence as one 
sees it on the outside by objective observation of 
behavior. But what has happened on the inside, in 
our bodies, to determine the sequence? Now a stimulus, 
in the simplest cases, is due to the excitation of some 
sense organ, and a response is a muscular contraction. 
The excitation passes over a neurone or series of neu- 
rones to a muscle or group of muscles and brings about 
a contraction. The process of learning, in habit forma- 
tion, consists in doing something that insures, with 
more or less certainty, that the stimulus shall go to a 
certain muscle rather than to some other. This doing 
something consists in reducing the resistance along 
the nervous route that leads to the proper muscle or 
group of muscles: Stimulation or excitation passing 
through the nervous system is guided and directed by 
nothing other than the various resistances offered by 
the parts of this system. And learning consists, physi- 
ologically, in building up and establishing preferential. 
routes in the nervous system. A preferential route 
depends upon the fact that this route offers less resist- 
ance to the particular form of excitation than do other 
routes. This smaller resistance is due in most part to 
previous passages of the same kind of excitation along 
the same route. 
It must be pointed out that preferential routes are 
not fixed and static things, nor absolute and perma- 
nently definite. We can never be quite certain as to 
what route any stimulus will take. It is always merely 
a matter of probability, for the reason that nervous 
resistance is subject to great variation, is influenced 
by many factors, such as fatigue, temporary blood sup-

“tion takes this course rather than some other, and] 6 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
      
        
   
    
    
   
   
     
    
   
      
    
   
     
     
  ply in the parts involved, immediately preceding stimu-j 
lation, other concurrent stimulation, the feeling accom-§ 
paniments, etc. In the light of these facts, we should 
say that learning, in habit-formation, consists inj 
increasing the probability, other factors being equal,j 
that a given stimulus will take a certain course. Learn- 
ing can probably never insure that a given stimulusi 
will, in spite of all other factors, go over into a certai 
“response. As well as we know our own name, there 
come times when we can not immediately say it upo 
being asked. As well as we know to say “eighty one’ 
for the stimulus nine times nine, there come times when 
we can not immediately do it. 
The physiological basis of knowledge is precisely th¢ 
same as that of habit. Knowledge is a matter of oné 
idea following another idea. Now the reason that 4 
certain idea, as x, follows idea a, is that the cerebra 
excitation underlying the idea a passes over and cause 
the excitation underlying the idea x. That the excita: 
- brings about the idea « rather than some other idea, 
as y or z, is due, as in habit, to preferential routes inj 
the central nervous system. From the point of view! 
of the nervous system, there is no difference whatever! 
between habit and knowledge. From this point of 
view, all learning is the establishing of differentialg 
resistances in the central nervous system. The paths} 
of smaller resistance have been called “bonds,” becauses 
in a sense, they bind together stimulus and response) 
or idea with idea. 
Securing the Initial Connection.—Learning is con- 
necting, but we must now ask how the connection is; 
Arst secured. In the case of habit, how does the persot}

THE NATURE OF LEARNING q. 
who is forming the habit get the stimulus to pass over 
to the desired response in the first place? Suppose we 
wish to couple the stimulus “five times five” with the 
response “25,” we have only to tell the child to say 
that five times five equals twenty-five, and he says it. 
He is able to say twenty-five when he wishes, and he 
can couple it to any stimulus of his own volition. He 
has long since mastered this response. But suppose 
it is a very young.child and we ask him to make the 
letter a. We can show him the letter and tell him to 
make one like it. The perception of the letter may'be | ° 
considered the stimulus. But the child can not imme- 
diately make the letter. This is a response which he 
has not yet mastered. How does he master it? With © 
pencil in hand he continues to make marks on the paper. 
The results of the first trials may have no resemblance 
to the letter a. The stimulus being maintained, the 
efforts continue. Each time the response is somewhat 
different. Slowly the marks begin to resemble the eopy- 
This form of learning has been named the trial and 
error method. It is the only method in habit-forming 
when the movement involved has not already been 
mastered and coupled with the idea of the movement 
as its stimulus. 
During the early years of infancy the child, by the 
trial and error method, is learning to make movements 
with all the muscles of his body. Especially is he get~ 
ting control of legs and arms and hands and feet and 
of the vocal organs. In these early years he learns to 
make nearly all possible movements with his hands 
and vocal organs, and these movements are organised 
with the cortical substrate of their corresponding ideas 
as their adequate stimuli. This learning is so. far.

   advanced when the child enters school, that he ca 
make with some degree of precision, any kind of mark 
he is shown or told to make. He can also make any 
sounds he hears or is told to make. These last two 
statements are not wholly true, for there will be some 
movements and sounds not wholly mastered. But mosi 
of the movements and vocal responses have been mas 
tered, so that little trial and error learning is Jeft to 
be done. Many of the child’s responses will be crudd 
and will have to be perfected through practice. The 
method of perfecting them is the trial and error method 
The fact is, that when a child enters schoo! much Jearn4 
ing has already taken place. He has partially mastered 
most of the responses that will ever be required of him 
What remains is to couple these responses to theit 
appropriate stimuli, and this is done by what may bé 
called the ideational method. This method is possiblé 
only after the movement involved has been attained byj 
the trial and error method and connected with its idea 
as its adequate stimulus. As previously explained, 
when we speak of an idea as a stimulus, we mean the} 
“gortical activity which is the neural correlate of the 
In the case of knowledge, the initial connection bey tween the ideas is secured by simultaneous experience.; 
If we wish two ideas to be joined together in our minds,] 80 that when one of the two ideas comes, the other fol- lows, we must experience these two ideas together. And \ : ‘the oftener the ideas are experienced together, the more | surely will one arouse the other.

THE NATURE OF LEARNING 9 
thing becomes associated with the name through 
simultaneous experience. I then point out the different 
floral organs, the calyx, corolla, stamens and pistil. As 
the child looks at each organ, I pronounce the name of 
the organ upon which his attention is fixed. In this 
manner the things and their names become coupled 
together. Then in a similar manner we couple the 
names of the parts with the functions of the parts. In 
knowledge-getting in all its various fields, our only 
method of connecting ideas together is by experiencing 
those ideas together in a state of attention. Since an idea can enter into any number of such connections, 
all of our knowledge becomes connected or related, so that we are able to go from any idea to any other idea 
through intermediary ideas. For example, horse is 
connected with buggy through simultaneous experience, 
similarly buggy with city, city with Athens, Athens with Homer, Homer with the Iliad, Iliad with school, 
school with a certain classmate, this classmate with 
death, death with heaven. Similarly all the items of 
our experience are united so that we can go either 
directly or indirectly trom any bit of experience to any 
other, although the only method of uniting these bits 
of experience is through simultaneous experience. 
The above account of the method by which stimuli 
are first connected with their responses and ideas with 
other ideas is objective and to some extent superficial. 
We have described merely what is seen on the outside. 
What goes on inside is not entirely clear. Why two 
cortical processes which underlie two ideas simultane- 
ously experienced should be so related that when later 
one of these processes is revived it should revive the 
other, is not known. Probably two simultaneous brain

  processes are to some extent one process, and flow inf 
one another, so that they become more or less a unitj 
If such is the case, then later when one of the py 
cesses is revived it revives the other because it is reall 
a part of the other, or rather they both constitute bu 
one process. 
In the case of habit, it may well be asked why, whq 
a child tries for the first time to make the letter 
whatever the first response, does he not continue ff 
make the same marks over and over again instead @ 
making somewhat different marks at each trial? It @ 
possible that the stimulus changes somewhat with eaq 
trial. The child sees that the first result is not tl 
result desired, this very fact makes the stimulus ff 
the second attempt a somewhat different stimulu 
Moreover, the resistances along the various possibi 
routes are doubtless not very different so that tH 
slightest change in resistance makes the stimulus tal 
a somewhat different route producing a different resull 
Probably the fatigue toxins are sufficient to change thg 
resistance temporarily. Possibly also the physiologic 
correlates of the feeling element involved have thel 
effects in varying the resistances and shifting the direq 
tion of the excitation. These suggestions are entire 
theoretical, and we must confess that we are ignoral 
of the nature of the neurological processes which col 
stitute the causes which we are seeking. For the pre 
ent we must be content with the objective statement @ 
facts given above. Fortunately this objective stat@ 
ment is sufficient for our practical purposes. 1 
Function of Habits.—Habit is the basis_of. efficiency 
It insures, as much as anything can insure, that th 
right response follows upon the appropriate stimulus
-P-A-G-E-16
THE NATURE OF LEARNING 11 
Habit enables us to perform an act with greater accu- 
racy, greater speed, less waste of energy, and conse- 
quently with less fatigue. Motor efficiency is impossi- 
ble except through habit.. In whatever field our work 
may be, whether in carpentry, masonry, farming, 
blacksmithing, engineering, or cooking, we become effi- 
cient only through habituating the processes. There 
is no. other way. Jt is true that habituation resists 
change. Through habit we become set and fixed, but — 
this is the price that we must pay for efficiency. 
If we consider the function of habit from the mental 
side, the subjective side, we find that habit removes _ 
actions to the control of lower cortical levels, relieving 
the higher levels which are thereby freed for other 
processes which may go on simultaneously. In other 
words, habit removes an act from the state of focal 
attention, leaving the higher attention levels for other 
Processes. For example, when we are learning to run™~ 
a typewriter, the operation of the machine demands 
all of our attention. After we have become expert in 
rumiing the machine, the mere mechanical work 
demands little or no attention. : 
Function of Knowledge. — The chief_ function of 
knowledge is to put meaning into the world. The get- 
ting of knowledge consists in learning the names of 
things and the functions of things. It is only the fact 
that we live a social life and need to communicate with 
one another that makes it necessary to learn the names 
of things. If we lived an individual, solitary life, we 
should not need to know the names of things, therefore 
the essential thing in knowledge is the coupling of the 
thing with its functions. Now all things in the world 
are related, and through experience we learn the fune- ~ ¥.
-P-A-G-E-17
12 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
tions of things, or in other words, their characteris' 
what they do, what-we can do with them. The 
has unity and order in it. Through our experi 
we get this unity, this order; we learn the several 
to which the various things in our environment can| 
put. For example, we have experience with a subs 
which we name iron. We learn that it is hard, tot 
heavy, that it gets red when heated, white and mall 
when heated still more. We learn that we can hamy 
it till it has a sharp edge and then we can cut with 
that we can mould it into various shapes and m: 
into a multitude of useful instruments and implem 
In a similar way we learn of all the substances 
organisms of our environment. We come to know 
world as it is. This knowledge of the world gives 
control of the world. The function of knowledge: 
then, to put meaning into the world, and through 
meaning to give us control of the world. We build 
inner, thought world, which corresponds to 
outer world. The closeness of the correspoj 
ence between our inner world and the olf 
world indicates our approach to the truth. : 
the correspondence is not fairly complete and acc' 
we are in error, we can not use the outer world. 
can not use it because we do not really know it. We 
not have its true meaning. 
Plasticity—By plasticity as used here, wi we mean 
ease with which we can be changed, more particul 
the ease with which new bonds can be established 
our central nervous system. As we grow old wel 
plasticity chiefly for the reason that in our ear 
years definite responses are established for most of 
situations of life. The passage of the same excitati 
over the same set of neurones, time after time, prod    
    
    
        
   
    
   
    
     
                
      
-P-A-G-E-18
THE NATURE OF LEARNING 18 
ing the same action sets up a path which resists change. 
By the time we have reached middle life, most of the 
situations of life have occurred repeatedly; forms of 
response more or less definite have been established 
for all of them. Therefore, in familiar situations we 
become more set with each succeeding year. However, 
we do not lose plasticity in unfamiliar situations, as far 
as is known, until the decadence of the latter part of 
life sets in. But after we reach middle life there are 
not many unfamiliar fields. There are then very few 
situations which we do not approach with some bias 
or prejudice. Apart from the resistance of bonds 
already formed our ability to form new bonds increases 
up to maturity, and probably does not decrease till after 
‘Middle age. This statement is based on a comparison 
of the learning capacity of men and women in their 
forties with that of children of high school age and 
younger. In fields wherein men and women are not 
Icapacitated and hindered by virtue of prejudicial 
bonds already formed they learn as readily as do boys 
and girls, much more readily than young girls and boys. 
_ wan as the Result of His Learning.—Let us now con- 
sider the importance to our lives of habits and knowl- 
edge. Thorndike has truthfully said that the most 
important thing about human nature is that it can be 
changed. Let us couple with this statement another 
Common saying, namely, that a man is the sum of his 
tendencies, A careful consideration of these two facts 
gives us an idea of the importance of education. What 
we are at maturity depends upon the habits and knowl- 
edge that we have. Acquiring these habits and get- 
ting this knowledge constitute our education. Whether

18 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING — 
In figures 1 and 2, increasing efficiency is shown by ‘ 
a rise in the curves. The curves indicate the amounts 
of work done in successive equal periods of time. An- 
other method of constructing the curve is to show the. _ 
amount of time required to do successive equal amounts 
of work. By this method, increasing efficiency is shown 
  by a fall in the curve. It may be illustrated by the same | 
card-sorting data used in constructing the graphs in « 
figures 1 and 2. In the card-sorting experiment from | 
which this data was obtained, seventy-five cards were — 
sorted into fifteen pigeon holes or card. trays. Each 
tray was numbered, and the cards were numbered cor- ; 
respondingly, five to each tray. At each practice, all 
the seventy-five cards were distributed. With each | 
practice the time required for sorting the cards became 
less and less. This is shown in Fig. 3. To convert the § 
data into the form used in figures 1 and 2, the number 
of cards sorted per minute in each practice was com-

puted. Therefore figures 1 and 2 show the increasing 
number of cards sorted per minute in the successive 
practices, while figure 8 shows the decreasing amount 
of time required to sort the seventy-five cards in the 
successive practices. In the discussion of learning 
curves which follows, we shall have in mind the types 
of curve shown in figures 1 and 2, in which efficiency is 
shown by a rise in the curve. 
The Rise of the Curve-—Why does the curve rise? 
To what is the increased efficiency due? Increase in 
efficiency from practice is due in general to three 
causes: (1) The establishing of the bond between stimu- 
lus and response. This bond, in physiological terms, is 
the shortest possible route between stimulus and re- * Sponse. (2) The second factor is decreased resistance in the established neural bond or route. (8) The third factor is the adaptation of the muscles to the special Movements required. In the present discussion, we are considering learning of the habit-forming type, and not ideational learning in which the motor element is un- 
important. 
We shall now illustrate the various learning factors from the card-sorting experiment. We sit down to the experiment for the first time. We take the pack of . cards in our left hand and remove a card with the right hand. Let us suppose the card is number seventeen. We look over the box numbers until we find number Seventeen, and then deposit the card into this box. We € another card. Suppose it is number 20. We must Search for box number 20, and so proceed until all the *eventy-five cards are distributed. When we have fin- ished, we have put five cards into each box. The first card sorted was number 17. After a few seconds we a .
-P-A-G-E-25
20 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
came to another card numbered 17. We may have 
remembered the location of this box, more likely we did 
not. But before the first experiment was over we did 
learn the location of some of the boxes and did not have 
to search for them. With each successive sorting, we 
remembered more and more of the boxes, until finally 
we knew the location of all of them and did not have to 
search for any of them. However, it must be pointed 
out that all learning is a matter of degree. I have said 
that we come to know where all the boxes are. We do, 
but at first we know it poorly. The associations com? 
slowly. While we do not have to hunt for the boxes 
the kinaesthetic or visual idea of their location comes 
to us slowly, and the movements therefore follow slowly. 
With more practice, the movemients follow their stimuli 
more quickly, more definitely, more surely. The asso 
ciative processes run their course faster and faster. 
In the early stages of practice, after we have learned 
the location of all the boxes, we may at any time le 
temporarily unable to recall the location of a box whic 
we remembered on a former trial. This is because tht 
bonds are only poorly established, and at any momett 
may break down and fail us. With increasing practic 
this failure of a particular association to run its prope 
course happens less and less, and the certainty that a 
the associations will take place quickly becomes greatel| 
and greater. But, as pointed out in Chapter J, this oa 
tainty is never absolute. 
In the early practices, while the neuro-muscular o 
ordinations are weakly established, the hand oftal 
starts the wrong way, but before it reaches the bo% 
we recall the right place and have to make a seco 
movement. With increasing practice, these false mo’

ments become fewer and fewer. With every day of 
practice, it becomes more and more certain that when 
we take a card from the pack, the hand will go uner- 
ringly and with no loss of time or waste of motion, to 
the appropriate box. 
It is surprising to one unacquainted with work in the 
psychology of learning to discover how much improve 
ment is possible after one has learned the location of all 
the boxes. In a few days one knows the boxes so that 
he does not have to hunt for them, but improvement 
will continue for months. This fact is illustrated in 
Fig. 4. Under the author’s direction, Miss Rose Am 
Howe sorted cards for several months. In her exper! 
ment, she sorted 150 cards into thirty boxes, five cards 
to the box. After a few days she knew the location of 
_ all the boxes, nevertheless improvement continued for 
several months. This fact is even better illustrated by 
the substitution experiment, performed by the sa 
subject. In this substitution experiment, letters weft 
stibstituted for the nine digits. There were but nil 
_ bonds to form. After two or three five-minute pret 
tices, these nine bonds are established. However, int 
provement continues for twenty days, as'shown in Fit 
5. The experiment consisted in transcribing colum™ 
of numbers into letters according to a key furnishe) 
the subject. Practice was continued for twenty-fivé 
minutes at a sitting each day. The key was learnél 
during the first day’s practice. On the second day t 
average score was 280 substitutions in five minutes. 08 
the twentieth day the score was 720 substitutions 
five minutes. Now since the key was known on the 
ond day, why the greater score on the twentieth

of the curve comes from establishing the proper bonds, 
eliminating the wrong or useless bonds, strengthening 
the established bonds through use, and the adapting 
of the muscles involved to the movements required in 
the habit. 
We shall now give a further illustration of the whok 
procedure by the process of learning to add. Let w 
take a problem of four numbers, three digits each: 
987 
7389 
654 
456 suppose we know merely how to count. We talt 
six, count four more and have ten. We then count nit 
more and have nineteen, then seven more and have 
twenty-six. With practice we come to know that si 
and four are ten and then do not have to count, we lod 
at six and four, and say “six and four are ten,” the 
having learned the other combinations, say “ten atl 
nine are nineteen, nineteen and seven are twenty-s& 
Later we shorten the process and say merely “te 
nineteen, twenty-six.” Later still, the six and four 
come a unity and mean ten as definitely and di 
as one figure by itself means “six” and the other “fouh, 
So the nine and seven come to mean “sixteen,” then! 
addition becomes “ten and sixteen are twenty-six 
In the early stages, we get the sums of the set 
and third columns by the slow process of counting, 
the process of carrying from the first to the sect 
and from the second to the third must be learned. W) 
practice, however, we can add two columns at once! 
fast as formerly we could add one column. We cal 4 
learn to add three columns at once with great sm 
and accuracy. 3     
     
   
    
      
    
   
-P-A-G-E-30
THE LEARNING CURVE 25 
In adding we first learn all the possible combinations 
of the nine digits. These are the primary bonds, the 
basis of all later schemes of adding. Through practice - 
we come to eliminate all useless bonds, as in saying 
“six plus four are ten.” We simply look at the six and 
four and say “ten.” With the ten in mind, we look at 
the nine and say “nineteen.” With the nineteen in 
mind, we look at the seven and say “twenty-six.” 
After we have learned all the primary combinations, 
practically unlimited improvement is still possible, 
through strengthening the primary bonds, and com-

bining into unitary processes what are at first complex 
processes. As shown above, after we have practiced 
a while, 6-14 are not two things but one thing and 
mean “ten,” directly and immediately. With further 
practice, larger and larger groups of digits coalesce, be 
come a unitary process, and mean their sum. 
All habit-formation of the motor type is essentially 
the same. In general, the same factors are involved. 
The illustrations given above are typical of the processes 
in all complex habits. : 
The Limit of Improvement.—In a simple habit the 
limit is soon reached. What this limit is, is determine! 
by the subject’s reaction time. Suppose that, instead of 
sorting cards, we take a pack and put all of them into 
the same box as quickly as possible. The neural 
is soon established and we reach a limit determined bY 
the time required for the nervous impulse to travd 
along the necessary route. Such a curve is shown i 
Fig. 6. In general, the more bonds involved in tht 
habit, the longer it takes to perfect them. If the bonds 
required are many, say those involved in sorting Q 
into one hundred boxes, improvement would contin 
for many months. | 
In such a process as addition, improvement is pr 
tically unlimited, for higher and higher orders or habit 
can be formed indefinitely. In such a case, improv, 
ment comes not merely from perfecting habits, 
from developing more and more efficient habits. ¥ 
in all cases in which the habit is definite and can ™ 
be supplanted by a more efficient habit, there is a It 
which may be called the physiological limit. This 
varies with different individuals, and, as above stall 
depends upon their reaction times. In the card-sorll 
      
    
        
      
    
   
-P-A-G-E-32
THE LEARNING CURVE 27 
experiment, the correlation between reaction time and 
efficiency becomes higher and higher with succeeding 
practices. 
Practical Limits.—As pointed out by Thorndike*, few 
people in the ordinary pursuits of life, come anywhere 
near their possible limits. In typing, stenography, ac- 
counting, telegraphy, and the various other perform- 
ances of the business and industrial world, workers 
reach a proficiency that enables them to do their work 
reasonably well and hold their jobs. They are not 
willing to put forth the effort that would carry them 
to a higher plane of efficiency. Most of the workers 
are working on an efficiency plane much below what is 
Possible for them. One in a hundred, perhaps, puts 
forth such effort and passes up to a higher plane of 
berformance. One in a thousand, having great ability 
and great ambition, puts forth the effort that places 
him among the leaders in his trade or profession. / 
It is well that the young know this important fact, 
for not only do laborers and clerks work on a level far 
below their possible limit, but students, as a rule, are 
content to continue on a level that just barely enables 
’ them to “pass.” In language they only poorly know the declensions, the paradigms, the conjugations, and 
the vocabularies, In mathematics, the tables, the 
formulas, the rules and fundamental principles are not 
\Sufficiently mastered. The case is similar in science. 
The student should have pointed out to him that the 
elements can be so mastered as to enable him to pro- 
Ceed to a higher level of achievement. Means of prac- 
tice and drill should be devised to enable the student —_. .

to pags to a higher level. There is no short-cut; there 
is no easy way; there is no substitute for drill, prac- 
‘tice, repetition. Easy, confident, and efficient perform. 
ance in any field comes only from complete habituation 
of the elementary processes. 
Different Forms of Curve—The form of the learning 
curve depends upon the nature of what is learned. Usu- 
ally, the initial rise is rapid, with slower increments 
later. This gives a curve convex on its upper side as in 
Fig. 5. If learning is slow at first and faster later, the 
resulting learning curve is concave on its upper side as 
in Fig. 7. Whatever the form of the curve at first, it 
eventually becomes level or nearly so. As we approach

our limit in any particular habit, any improvement is 
at the cost of much greater effort than was the case 
in an earlier stage of habituation. 
In the psychological literature there has been much 
discussion of “spurts.” By a spurt is meant increased 
efficiency as shown by an abrupt rise of the curve. With 
some subjects and some work there is an initial spurt. 
Sometimes there is a final spurt, particularly if the 
subject knows that the end of the work period is near. 
At any time during a work period a spurt may appear, 
due to a combination of favorable cireumstances. The 
relative amounts of work done at different parts of a 
work-period depend upon several factors, particularly 
upon the stage of habituation and how fatiguing the 
work is, In the early stages of habituation, there are 
Considerable practice effects during the work period 
Which make the later records of the period high. If 
We are near the limits of practice, the practice effects 
during a work period will be slight. In the latter case 
any difference in the amounts of work done at different 
Parts of the period will be due to the effects of fatigue 
and of warming up. In complicated motor perform- 
ances, such as type-writing, the best record is not made {- 
at the first part of a work-period. Only after a little 
Practice can we do our best. 
Ih Miss Howe’s card-sorting experiment, cited above, 
for the 18th, 19th, and 20th days, the average efficien- 
les for each of the ten sortings made at a sitting were: 
775, 802, 804, 824, 802, 808, 796, 802, 805, 780. Maxi- 
mum efficiency was not reached till the fourth sorting, 
when the speed was 6.8 per cent. better than it was 
the first sorting. The record for the first sorting was 
the lowest of the ten.

On the 9th, 10th and 11th days, while improvement 
was still marked, the records for the ten practices at 
a sitting were 685, 702, 721, 709, 728, 725, 718, 741, 
725, 720. The highest record was made on the 8th 
sorting, when the speed was about 8 per cent. higher 
than on the first. These facts are shown graphically 
in figure 8. 
Smoothing the Learning Curve.—Ordinarily there 
are fluctuations in the rise of a learning curve. It rises 
fast, then perhaps more slowly; it may even fall, for 
just as a combination of favorable factors makes it 
nse, so a combination of unfavorable circumstances 
may make it fall. There are always many independ- 
ently variable factors that combine to produce a learn- 
Ing record. These factors are variously combined at 
different moments of our procedure and produce a 
curve of fluctuating rises and falls. The general ten- 
dency of the curve is better shown if, instead of show- 
ing the actual records, we construct a smoothed curve. 
There are various ways of doing this. We can do it 
roughly by indicating the actual records on our co- 
ordinate paper by dots and then drawing a curve that throws as many of the dots on one side as on the other. 
The dots show the actual records, the curve shows the 
general tendency of the records. Another method is 
to eliminate the temporary fluctuations of the curve 
VY averaging each record with the adjacent records 
above and helow. The first and final records are doubled 
and combined with the one adjacent record, and the 
Sum divided by three. 
1 Learning Plateaus.—A plateau or level place in the 
one curve indicates a period of no progress in 
‘arning. Such plateaus nearly always appear in the
-P-A-G-E-37
32 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
actual work of learning, in school work as well as it 
laboratory experiments. Various explanations for the 
appearance of the plateau have been given. Bryan, it 
his early work on learning, suggested that plateaus. 
were due to the fixing of lower order habits. Progress 
due to higher order habits could not come till the lowet 
order habits were fixed. But this can not be the expla 
nation, for fixing of the lower order habits would itself 
give more efficiency, and should give a continuous rise 
of the curve. Book’s suggestion that the plateau 5 
due to a flagging of interest, a letting up of effort, 8 
doubtless nearer the truth for the plateau may appeat 
in simple experiments involving a single definite habit 
The fact seems to be that the plateau is not a necessity 
in learning, theoretically, although in practice it usually 
appears. As long as a learner maintains a high degre 
of attention and puts forth maximum effort, he col 
_ tinues to improve till he reaches his limit. But mait 
taining a high state of attention and putting forth 
maximum effort are impossible over long periods * 
time. The ordinary learner usually does his best fot 
a time, then because of fatigue, or lack of attention, © 
loss of interest, he relaxes and works at a lower poitl; 
of efficiency. For a time, the records may actually £4! 
below previous records. This phenomenon may app 
during the experiment of a single sitting and be a ma, 
ter of minutes. It may appear in a long series of ef 
periments and be a matter of days. 3 
The plateau has much significance to education. Whe 
it is due to loss of interest and lack of attention, pra 
tice is not then profitable. At such a time, practi 
should stop or means be found to renew attention 
effort. Children lose interest very quickly, and $s

cease to put forth effort in continued work of the same 
kind. Pauses in habit-formation are valuable not only 
because they lead to a renewed interest and effort when 
the work is taken up again, but according to some 
writers, they lead to a weakening of inhibitions which 
had interfered with the habit. Moreover, in habit- 
formation, time is an element which can not be ignored. 
Some sort of fixation goes on in the nervous system; 
this fixation requires time and can not be unduly hur- 
ried. As shown in a later chapter, practice beyond a 
certain amount at one sitting is valueless. And in prac- 
tice extending over many days, only a certain amount .. 
of improvement is possible, no matter how hard we 
work. 
EXPERIMENTS AND EXERCISES. 
All the principles discussed in this chapter should, 
as far as possible, be illustrated by experiments. Any 
learning experiment will suffice, but for economy of 
time, an experiment should be selected that will show 
rapid improvement. Several experiments are described 
below. The instructor can select those suited to his 
needs, or devise others. an 
1. Class experiment. Material, Pyle’s Digit-symbol 
Substitution test blanks. Method: Distribute about six- 
teen test sheets to each student, placing them face down 
before the student. Explain to the students that they 
are to substitute letters for the nine digits, in accord- 
ance with the key shown at the top of the test sheet, 
and that they are to work as fast as possible. Work in 
five-minute periods, and let the score be the number of 
substitutions correctly made in five minutes. Eight 
such scores ean probably be made in a one-hour period. 
The scoring should be left till the experiment is finished.

2. From the data obtained in experiment 1, construct 
individual learning curves similar to figures 1 and 2. 
8. Construct a smoothed curve as described in the 
chapter. 
4, Construct a learning curve from the class averages 
for each five-minute period. Note that it is smoother 
than the individual learning curves. Why? 
5. Laboratory experiment. Card-sorting. Material, 
ordinary playing cards. Method: Shuffle the cards, then 
sort them into four piles according to suit, 7. ¢., hearts 
together, spades together, clubs together, and diamonds 
together. Determine the time for each sorting. Cor- 
struct a curve similar to figure 3. 
6. Laboratory experiment. Material, card-sorting 
box and cards. Method: Use only one row of boxes 
five cards to each box, and determine the time required 
for each sorting. The cards must be thoroughly shuffled 
before each sorting. Shuffling is facilitated if the cards 
are taken up after sorting, promiscuously, one at a time. 
Ten sortings can be finished in an hour. Construct 
individual learning curves similar to figure 8. By com 
puting the number of cards sorted in a minute, curves 
can be made similar to figures 1 and 2. 
7. Laboratory experiment. Material, mirror-writing 
apparatus. Method: The hand of the writer is to be 
covered from view. He is to see his hand ag reflect 
in the mirror, which is vertical before him. The sub 
ject is to write in script in such a way that the letters 
appear in the mirror as they would on a sheet of pape 
held vertically before him. Let the subjects copy thé

ECONOMICAL LEARNING. 
LENGTH AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRACTICE PERIODS. 
Learning is connecting. After the initial connectiov 
is secured, we must strengthen and perpetuate it 
through repetition or practice. The first important 
problem in the economy of learning is concerning the 
proper length and distribution of practice periods. BY 
proper length and distribution, we mean that length 
and distribution which gives the most return in eff 
ciency for the amount of time spent in practice. Our 
problem, then, is to find what length and what distri 
bution of practice periods will give the best returns 
Or, to state the problem in still a different way: after 
we have secured the passage of a stimulus over into its 
appropriate response, how many times should this pa 
sage be repeated before we rest? And how long 
interval should elapse before the processes are 
peated? We turn to the experimental evidence. a

tage of short periods of practice distributed over a lous . 
‘time as compared to longer periods of preatice distri ‘ 
uted over shorter lengths of time. All the experiments _ 
that have since been performed in this field have i {| 
general confirmed the earlier work and have made it 
clear that for every kind of learning there is a proper

length of practice period, and for the different stages 
of habituation, there is also the proper distribution of 
practice periods. 
Jost, comparing ten repetitions a day for three days 
with thirty repetitions in one day, found a saving of 
fifteen per cent., from the shorter periods. From the 
first it has been evident there is a certain advantage in 
spreading practices out, temporally, rather than in con- 
centrating them. There is an aspect of learning that 
requires time, an aspect that resembles growth. Growth 
is a process that can be hastened only to a limited ex- 
tent. Such seems to be the case with habit-formation. 
A certain amount of practice at one time is efficient in 
fixing a habit, more practice at the same time, without 
intermission, does no good, is time wasted as far as 
fixing the habit is concerned. , 
More recently Perkins has continued the study with 
honsense syllables. She states her problem as follows: 
“My own experiments were designed to ascertain how 
much further in the distribution of readings one might 
go than Jost had gone before a limit would be reached 
in learning nonsense syllables. The best arrangement 
of Yeadings involves two questions,—how many repe- 
titions should be used at each period, and, for each 
number of repetitions per period, what interval bé-*' ¢ 
tween periods is best?” In her experiments, she used 
Seven-paired series of nonsense syllables. They were 
Presented visually at the rate of one in three seconds 
with three seconds interval between. She compared 
one repetition a day with two, four, and eight repeti- 
tions a day. She tested learning by a retention test 
given two weeks after the last presentation of a series, 
and stated her results in-terms of the per cent. correct... 
s.    
   
-P-A-G-E-43
38 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
The average per cent. correct for all the series given, : 
for one, two, four, and eight repetitions a day, were, | 
respectively, 75.25, 57.75, 42, 18.25. It is seen that one. 
repetition a day was most effective, two repetitions 
next in value, four next and eight least effective. In 
Perkins’ experiments, each series was presented six- 
teen times. The learning was therefore spread out over 
a period varying from two to sixteen days. 
It is evident from Perkins’ experiments, and this 
point has been confirmed by extensive experiments in 
the author’s laboratory, that when a series of nonsense 
syllables has been presented to a subject once, further 
presentations at the same sitting have less value than 
the first presentation. After one presentation, to ge 
the most value from another, time must elapse. 
The Substitution Experiments.—In the solution of 
the problem under consideration, three experimenters, 
Dearborn, Starch, and Pyle, used some form of substi- 
tution experiment. 
In some class experiments, Dearborn found ten min- 
utes practice a day better than five minutes twice 4 
day. Starch compared four different methods of using 
120 minutes: 10 minutes twice a day for six days, 20 
minutes once a day for six days, 40 minutes every other 
day for six days, and 120 minutes at one sitting. Five 
minute records were kept. The results are shown in 
Fig. 10. The ten and twenty-minute practices were 
best. There was little difference between ten am 
twenty minute practices. The average speed of the 
ten-minute practices was best, but the final speed of 
the twenty-minute practices was best. Forty-minute © 
practices are not so good as ten and twenty, and one 
hundred and twenty minutes at a sitting gave the | 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
ECONOMICAL LEARNING 39 
poorest results. The experiment is inconclusive, how- 
ever, because Starch did not measure the learning capa- 
city of his different groups, and part of the difference 
shown by the curves of Starch’s four groups is doubt- 
‘Jess due to differences in the learning capacity of the 
different groups. For the first two five-minute records, 
the ten-minute and forty-minute groups are better, in- 
dicating better learning capacity. The twenty-minute 
  
    Se ea a eee 
Pree 0, euow Stance, showing the effects of practice periods of 
Stoup makes a lower record, showing smaller learning 
‘apacity. In spite of this fact, the twenty-minute group 
Makes the best record for the last five or six periods. 
The forty-minute group starts high. Forty minutes is 
evidently too long a period for best results. The fact 
that the 120-minute group is lower for the first. two 
five-minute periods shows the. group to be the poorest 
learners, but the very poor scores made in the latter 
half of the experiment are doubtless chiefly due to 
|
-P-A-G-E-45
40 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
method. The legitimate inferences from Starch’s ex- 
periments are: a twenty-minute practice period is best, 
a ten-minute period is nearly as good, forty-minute 
period not so good, and a hundred-and-twenty-minute 
period is poorest of all. Starch did not use a thirty- - 
minute period, which, in the author’s experiments, has 
proven better than longer or shorter periods. 
In the author’s attempt to solve this problem, a group 
of students was required first to spend sixteen days in 
a check experiment, in which all used the same length 
of practice period and the same distribution of prat- 
tices. The subjects then used different lengths of prac 
tice periods, and their learning curves were compared 
with those made when all used the same method of 
procedure. Fifteen, thirty, forty-five, and sixty minute 
periods were compared. The results are shown in tables 
1 and 2.

Tn table 1 the comparison is made on the basis of the 
average speed of the whole experiment. In table 2 the 
Comparison is based on the final speed attained. By the latter method of comparison, the forty-five-minute 
Practice proves a little better than the thirty-minute 
Practice, and an hour gives almost the same return as a 
half hour. In both tables 1 and 2, the subjects are com- 
Pared on the basis of the same number of practices, but 
the extreme difference in the total amount of time put 
M Is as one to four. It is clear that very little return 
comes after the first thirty minutes of practice. The 
fatigue of the latter part of an hour’s practice makes 
the record show up poorer than that of a forty-five 
Minute period, and but a trifle better than that of 
thirty minutes. oe : 
In tables 3 and 4 we compare the four different meth 
ods on the basis of the same actual amount of time, and 
of course, different numbers of practice periods. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
42 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
study of these tables shows that thirty minutes is the 
best length of practice period. The second fifteen min- 
utes of practice continues to give a good return, but 
the third fifteen minutes shows a decreasing retum. 
Fifteen minutes is too short a period in the kind of 
work done in the experiment to give the best return, 
and forty-five minutes makes too long a period. The 
hour period shows up poorly partly because the fatigue 
of the latter part of the hour cuts down the score and 
obscures the effect of the work in the early part of the 
hour. Of course it is possible that the poor work dur 
ing the latter part of the hour actually decreases the 
effect of the work of the first part of the hour. 
Experiments in Archery.—Murphy’s experiments in 
javelin throwing were chiefly concerned with the im 
terval between practices. He did, however, compare 
ten throws once a day with five throws twice a day and 
: )/found ten throws once a day better. Murphy does not 
compare ten throws at one practice with more than te! . 
throws at one practice, or fewer than ten throws. 
_Experiments in Adding—Kirby, Hahn, and Thott 
dike have compared various lengths of periods in lear 
ing to add. Kirby and Hahn worked with children 
Thorndike with university students. Kirby and Hahn 
. compared very short working periods. 
Kirby gave a fifteen-minute initial and a fifteen-mit" 
ute final test and forty-five minutes intervening prac 
tice. These forty-five minutes were divided up into 
practices of 2214, 15, 6, and 2 minutes. The media® 
gain per cent. for these groups in order were 45, 4% 
42, and 56. As between the three longer groups ther? 
is very little difference, with the advantage in favor 
of the longer period. The two-minute period gives 4. \e 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
ECONOMICAL LEARNING 43 
better return than either of the longer periods. The 
practice with the 2214-minute group covered a period of 
only two days, while practice with the two-minute 
group covered a period ten times as long, and in the 
latter case, the regular school work and the work out- 
side of school could have a much greater effect on the 
score than in the longer periods. 
Hahn does not find greater value in the short periods. 
Nor does Thorndike. His experiments consisted in 
practical adding by means of a table. There were 80 
operations on a sheet. Eight sheets at a sitting proved 
more valuable than two sheets at a sitting. He reports 
that he finds “little or no advantage in very short 
Periods of learning.” 
Distribution of Practice.—After we have practiced at 
one time as long as practice is profitable, how soon can 
We practice again with profit? In general, the experi. 
ments have shown that the best practice interval is one 
day, but twice-a-day practice and alternate-day prac- 
tice ig nearly as profitable as daily practice. However, 
Much depends upon the nature of the learning and the 
tage of habituation. We shall very briefly give th; 
rSults of the most important experiments. 
Murphy compared the results of throwing ten javelins 
at a time daily with throwing five at a time twice 
daily, and found the once daily method best. As for 
the other forms of distributing the practices he reports 
that “learning periods can be distributed, by’ giving 
alternate days practice, and even weekly practice with- 
out any loss in learning.” 
In a typewriting experiment covering a period of 
ninety half-hour practices, the author compared two 
half-hours a day with ten-half-hours a day. In the 
       
     
     
 
-P-A-G-E-49
44 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
former case, the half-hours were one in the forenoon 
and the other in the afternoon. In the latter case, the 
ten practices had half-hour intervals of rest between 
The results of the experiment may be brieflly stated as 
follows: Concentrated effort is efficient for about five 
practices, but the speed improved very little on the 
first day after the fifth practice. The effect of the 
early practices is evidently much greater if soon re 
peated. From the fifth practice to the fortieth, the 
- group’ practicing twice a day steadily gained on the 
: other group. | From the fortieth to the sixtieth prat 
“tice, the difference between the groups dimit 
"at the end of nine d; “ished. To summarise: 
| writing, distributed practice is best, but cot in such work as typed 
coptrated Practice brings in good returns, and 
one is in a hurry to acquire skill, the diminished returns from concentrated i sue tee practice need not be com . ‘Sidered prohibitive. In the above comparisons we havé imomind the same number of hours of practice lue of one-hour-a-day practice as com urs a day, is shown graphically in figure | ler merely the number of days spent it regard the total number of hours actt” ractice, we can say that ten half-hou!s han two half-hours a day. The grou? --e ~~~ times a day has a much faster spe 
. ays than di .

: But if we i f time actually spent consider the amount © { 
in practice, we get more return for each hour of practice if the practices are spread out over 45 days. The middle line in the figure represents 
the results of ten half-hour practices a day for nine 
days. The lower curve shows the results of nine days
-P-A-G-E-50
ECONOMICAL LEARNING 45 
of practice, two practices a day. The upper curve 
shows the results of the same amount of practice as 
shown by the middle curve, but spread out over 45 
days instead of nine days. Five hours a day with in- 
tervals between the practice periods are more effective 
in fixing the typewriting habits than one hour a day. 
Just where decreasing returns begin, in repeating prac- 
tices on the same day, can not be determined from the 
experiments. In the early part of the experiment it 
is at the end of the fifth practice. Later in the experi- 
ment it is probably earlier, perhaps at the end of two 
or three practices. 
  Fisuan 11, B shows the effects of practicing ten half-hours a day ‘or nine days. C shows the effects of practicing two half-hours a 
lay for nine days. A shows the effects of the same amount of 
Practice as B, but at the rate of two half-hours a day for 45 days. 
in A and B the graphs are constructed from the averages of suc- 
cessive practices in groups of 10. -In B the 10 practices were done in one day; in A, they were done in five days.
-P-A-G-E-51
46 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
In the author’s substitution experiments, three differ- 
ent forms of distribution were compared, twice-a-day, 
daily, and alternate days. If our basis of comparison 
is the total number of hours of practice, the most eco- 
nomical procedure is found to be daily practice. A sec-” 
ond practice on the afternoon of the same day gives 
nearly as much return as the morning practice, and in 
the later stages of habituation, alternate days practice 
is probably as effective as daily. As between daily and 
twice-a-day practice, the latter is much more effective 
if we consider the time elapsing since practice began. 
But, of course, there are twice as many actual hours of 
practice. 
In the case of concentrated practice, the question may 
well be raised whether the later practices on the same 
day, even though no higher score is made, are not 
effective in fixing the habit. This point the author 
tested in the following way. A group of four subjects 
began in the morning to work all day at a substitution 
experiment. At the end of the fourth practice period 
one of the subjects stopped, the others continuing all 
day. Two and three days later the effects of the prac 
tice were determined. The subject who had worked 
only four periods showed up as well in the retention 
tests as those who had worked all day. It is clear that 
beyond a certain point further practice on the same 
/day is profitless, not only in raising the score but in 
fixing the habit. 
‘In Fig. 12 are shown the results of an all-day substi- 
tution experiment performed by the author. The e* 
periment was as follows: Using a symbol alphabet, ! 
practiced transcribing for fourteen half-hour periods 
with half-hour rests between, continuously throughout

the day from eight in the morning till ten at night. The’ 
results are compared with fourteen daily practices of . 
a subject of the same learning capacity as the author. 
In the concentrated practice in this experiment there 
is no improvement after the third practice. In the dis- 
tributed practice, improvement continues throughout.

Figure 12, The lower graph shows the results of 14 half-hour prac- 
tices on the same day in a letter-symbol substitution experiment. 
The upper graph shows the results of the same number of practices, 
one a day for fourteen days. 
We need not report in detail the work of other experi- 
menters bearing on the distribution of practices. In 
general the experiments of Murphy, Perkins, Chapman, 
Strong and others confirm the results as stated above. 
Three facts seem to be fairly certain: (1) In estab- 
lishing a complicated set of habits as in typewriting, 
frequently repeated practices at the start are profitable, 
Perhaps’as many as three or four half-hour periods a 
day separated by rests of a half-hour. (2) after habitu-

  ation has proceeded further, frequent practices seem 
not to advance habit-fixation faster, or at least not 
much faster, than less frequent practices. (8) In. 
processes involving complex motor co-ordination as in 
javelin-throwing and ball-tossing long intervals seem 
more profitable. Perhaps different laws are involved 
in situations in which the goal desired is perfecting a 
series of complicated muscular movements through the 
trial and error method. In such work as card sorting, 
the problem is not to get the hand to make a certain 
kind of movement. The hand can make all the move 
ments easily enough. The problem is to remember 
what movement the hand is to make for each numbet 
of card. In such an experiment as ball-tossing, thé 
problem is to secure the proper co-ordinated movement. 
' We know what we are to do, we are not able alwayi 
to do it. 
As far as it is possible to judge from the experiments 
brief practices with relatively long intervals are mort 
profitable in cases involving the securing and master 
ing of unperfected motor movements. More concer 
trated practice seems profitable in cases where the 
actual movement can easily be made, and where the 
problem is the connecting this movement with a. pal 
ticular stimulus. 
What practical advice should be given to teachels 
who must determine and direct the practice of children? 
The practice periods of children should be short, and 
in most cases, once or twice a day. After habituation 
has proceeded to a considerable degree of fixation, th 
practices may be less frequent. By “short,” we meal. 
. five, ten, fifteen minutes, depending upon the natu 
of the learning and how fatiguing it is. In generdl.
-P-A-G-E-54
ECONOMICAL LEARNING 4900 
practice gives reasonable returns until fatigue has set 
in. Even though shorter periods and longer intervals 
would, in some cases, give better returns, it is not 
usually expedient to use them, because in most cases 
we want efficiency at the earliest possible moment, and — 
can afford to accept a decreasing return for longer prac- 
tices and more frequent intervals. Even if a second 
practice on the same day with the typewriter does not. .. 
give me quite so much return as if I should wait till 
the next day for the next practice, I should take the. 
’ second period on the same day if I have the time and 
am in a hurry to acquire speed on the machine. On 
the other hand, if I am in no hurry for the speed, and I can use my time profitably otherwise, it would be 
wise to delay practice till the following day. But if I 
am in a hurry to acquire the speed, and have nothing 
else to do with ‘my time, 1 should practice for about 
five half-hours a day, at least for a while. In deter- 
Mining the length and number of practice periods, 2 
teacher should consider all the factors. In school, usu- 
ally there is no special hurry, and there are many 
things demanding attention, therefore economy of time 
Should have full consideration. This means that one 
or two vigorous practices a day, daily, js best. The 
child may, in most cases, continue practice at one time 
as long as he shows a high degree of efficiency, or in 
other words, till fatigue effects begin to show them- 
selves. It is certain that in such processes as the ele- 
mentary operations of arithmetic, practice periods of a 
very few minutes daily give very high returns. With 
young children no kind of practice period should be 
long. For children decreasing returns set in very 
early,

EXPERIMENTS 
The comparison of different lengths of intervals isa 
work too difficult and extended for a class experiment, 
but a comparison of different lengths of practice periods 
‘may well be undertaken as a demonstration experiment. 
Two experiments will be described: 
1, Card-sorting. Material, card-sorting box and cards 
for one row of boxes for the check experiment and 
cards for a different row of boxes for the second experi- 
ment. 
Method: Have all the members of the class sort cards 
into one row of boxes for ten times at one sitting. 00 
the basis of the records, divide the class into four groups 
having equal learning ability, then take a different row 
of boxes for the second experiment. Have one grou? 
sort twice a day for ten days, another group sort five 
times a day for four days, another group sort te 
times a day for two days, and the other group sort 
twenty times at one sitting. With the same scale and 
on the same base, plot learning curves for each of the 
four groups. 
2. Substitution experiment. Material, the same asi? 
experiment 1, ChapterII, andanadditionalkey. Method: 
On the basis of experiment 1 in Chapter II, divide the 
class into four groups of approximately equal learning 
ability. Use the same digit-symbol test sheets, but 
prepare a different key by taking different letters of 
the alphabet. This key can be supplied to the students, 
or they can copy it from the blackboard. Work in five 
minute periods. One group can work ten minutes? 
day for six days; another, twenty minutes a day fot 
three days; another, thirty minutes a day for two days:
-P-A-G-E-56
ECONOMICAL LEARNING 51 
and the other group, sixty minutes at one sitting. In 
all cases, keep the individual records for each five-min- 
ute period. Plot the learning curves for the different 
groups as in experiment 1 above. 
8. One or the other of the above experiments is per- 
haps all that can be undertaken in an ordinary lecture 
course, but if time and opportunity permit, an experi- 
ment showing the poor results of extended practice on 
_ the same day would be very instructive and impressive 
tothe students. Any sort of learning experiment would 
suffice. An experiment with the same material as in 
1 or 2 above is recommended. To illustrate the pro- 
cedure, we shall take the card-sorting experiment. Use 
three rows of boxes that have not been used in an 
experiment before. Make five sortings at a sitting, 
with half-hour rests between sittings. The class can 
be divided into four groups of equal ability as deter- 
mined by previous experiment. One group can sort all 
day; another group, three-fourths of a day; another, 
one-half of a day; and the other group, one-fourth of 
aday. The division of work might very well be two 
sittings, four sittings, six sittings, and eight sittings. 
The results of the experiment should be tested a day or 
two later, by having all the subjects sort the cards 
twice, and taking the average of the two sortings as 
an indication of the efficiency attained.

GENERA, FACTORS. 
_Attention and Learning,—In the preceding chapter . 
we have discussed repetitions as if their value were a 
constant thing. In all the experiments on which our 
discussions and conclusions have been based, we have 
assumed that the work was done under favorable psy- 
chological and physiological conditions. But the fact 1 
is that repetitions are not of equal value, and it is 
now our problem to enquire into the general ‘factors 
that affect their value. ‘The first and most important 
of these factors is attention. It will be necessary for 
us to explain the precise sense in which the term atten- 
tion is here used. Defined in terms of consciousness, 
attention means sensory clearness. To say that we 
are attending to a process is to say that the process Is 
clear in consciousness. It stands out from the other 
simultaneous processes; it is focal. Physiologically, 
attentive processes are those that usurp or monopolise 
the cerebral activity at the time. As a result of evolu- 
tion, our central nervous systems are so constituted 
that there is always a synthesis or unification of the 
various stimulations of the moment for the initiation of 
action, This synthesis or unification, physiologically, 
is attention. It is as if we had not one brain but many; 
but to control action, one of these many brains must

momentarily usurp the function of initiating movement, 
We ‘iave many sense organs. Their constant stimuly 
tions are in eternal conflict for the control of action 
Now, in learning, the processes which we wish to couple 
together must be among those processes that for the 
time are monopolising the cortical energy or, in other

the focus of attention. 
It is not so much a matter of definite experiment # 
a matter of general observation in learning experimen’ 
~ and in life in general that enables us to say that if we 
wish to learn, we must attend. The processes which 
we wish to unite through learning must be process 
that for the time are monopolising the available ce 
bral energy. The primary, fundamental law of 28% 
ciation is that ideas to be bound together must bt 
experienced together in a state of attention. In 
sphere of habit-formation, the law seems to have!

ECONOMICAL LEARNING-——GENERAL FACTORS 55 
In inattentive learning, which is also ineffectual 
learning, the learning processes have successful dom- 
petitors; they do not usurp the organism’s central 
neural activities. In such case, the practice or repeti- 
tions are largely ineffectual in strengthening the neural 
bonds between stimuli and responses. t 
In the card-sorting experiments, the fast learners 
gave themselves over completely to the work. Forithe 
time being the world was to them a card-sorting world; 
nothing else existed; nothing else was for the time of 
any consequence. The card-sorting completely occu- 
Pied the central neural activities. Their bodies were 
nigid and tense, they leaned forward to their tasks, 
they whispered to themselves the numbers of the cards. 
With the slow or poor learners, all was different. 
Their bodies were relaxed, and many other activities shared the central field of neural activity with the card- 
sorting performance. They often gazed about the | 
Toom, listened to the various noises, and watched their “associates in the laboratory. i 
When the fast learner found a box, he deposited the 
ae and then dwelt upon the location of the box. He full the idea of the location of the box to come into 
por md focal consciousness, and have a noticeable tem- / mi a i stence, He might use some device to aid. He 
ere for example, say “Now I must remember num- iden a is there near the corner just under 19”. The 
in 9 location would thereby have more than a fleet- 
& existence, and would also likely acquire some 
elpful associations, i 
i the poor learner finds a box the card is droppe 
it and before there is time for the idea of location 
develop and helpful associative ideas to form, the
-P-A-G-E-61
    56 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
subject passes on to the next card, and the whole ex- 
perience with the card just deposited becomes almost 
as if it had not been. And when he, a little later, comes 
to a‘card of the same number, he must hunt for the box 
again. 
In the early stages of learning to sort cards, sensa 
dional and ideational disturbances are fatal. The set- 
sational, perceptual disturbers are such as others sort- 
ing cards in the same room, the noise of their perform 
ance, their whispering to themselves, the noise of an 
opening door. Any sensational disturbance tends to 
prevent the formation of the bonds. Any sensational 
competitor for focal consciousness, driving out the 
. box-location idea, obliterates the bond between stiml- 
_lus’and response. . 
Ideational disturbances are equally effective 1 
obliterating or obstructing the bonds which we 4 
g to form and strengthen. With proper care 
précaution we can guard against most of the sens* 
tional disturbances but we are powerless to prevel 
ideptional ones. Any ideas foreign to the learnits 
process will disturb, For example, if a subject # 
doing well, and the idea comes, “now I am doing finé 
this idea interferes, he forgets the box-locations 
the score is lowered. | 
Sensational disturbers or distractions can lose thel 
force. We can become adapted to them. As @ rile 
constant environmental factors become as if they . 
not exist. It is therefore necessary in a comparati? 
learning experiment to keep all external conditions co 
stant. We must have the same persons sit in the sal” 
places, and all persons and things in the room ™ 
maintain the same relative positions in successive &.
-P-A-G-E-62
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS 57 
periments. If a person is used to working with a 
group, then not to have the group present is a distrac- 
tion. On the other hand, if a subject is used to working 
alone, the group will disturb. Great importance often 
attaches to apparently insignificant factors. We can 
not ignore the details of time and place, the method of 
starting the experiment, the arrangement of the 
apparatus, the place in the room or about the table 
where the person works. Even the general attitude of 
the experimenter and his tone of voice are important 
factors and must be kept constant. : 
In Geissler’s important attention experiments it was 
found that the best adding records were made under 
conditions of distraction. This seems paradoxical, but _ 
18 Yeally in harmony with the principles laid down 
above. The subjects in Geissler’s experiments had dis- traction series and no-distraction series. In a no- 
distraction series, the subject said, “Oh, this is easy, I 
can take my time’. He would consequently relax and 
leisurely perform the adding, making only a moderately 
fast record. But if it was a distraction series, the sub- 
Ject took a different attitude. He said, “Now, this is 
difficult; this will take all there is of me.” He became 
Tigid, tense, used every known device to give the adding 
Processes the right-of-way and keep the distracting 
stimuli out. As a rule, he was successful. The dis- 
‘tracters did not really distract; they were not able to 
me focal; they beat in vain at the gates of central 
neural activity. 
Attitude and Learning.—The relation of attention to 
learning is fundamental. Several other factors that 
affect the rate of learning, probably produce this effect, 
in most cases at-least, through tHeir effect on attention::-  
-P-A-G-E-63
58 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
One such factor is attitude. The subject’s attitude 
toward the work of a learning experiment is one of the 
most important factors determining progress. If for 
any reason the subject dislikes the work, progress is 
‘slow; little effort is put forth; the subject works ina 
poor state of attention to the work. There is no ambi- 
tion to do well. The subject is content to make poor 
records, for in his opinion the work is of no consequents, 
and it therefore is no disgrace to do poorly in it. I, 
often happens that poor records at the beginning are 
the cause of the dislike. The dislike in turn becomes 
the cause of more poor records. Poor work and bai 
attitude reinforce and perpetuate each other. 
A bad attitude retards learning, but just as surely 4 
favorable attitude accelerates learning. The subject 
who likes the work seems able to give himself ove 
more fully and completely to the work than one wh0 
dislikes it. Good records at the beginning of an expel 
ment often are the cause of a favorable attitude. Th 
person does well in the work and therefore likes the 
work. The favorable attitude caused by good record 
becomes itself the cause of more good records. 
therefore turns out that the good become better and 
poor become worse. In learning we have an exalt 
of the law that “To him that hath, shall be given # 
from him that hath not shall be taken even that whl 
he hath”, , 
Peterson reports a class experiment which shows 
the effect of attitude. A list of words was put of 
blackboard and then copied by the students of the clas 
An immediate reproduction was called for and also § 
delayed reproduction. The experiment was repeatél 
in the same way except that the students were toll 
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-64
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS 59 
that a reproduction would be called for. In the ex- 
periments in which the students knew that a re- 
production would be called for, the immediate 
reproduction was 14.8% better for one section of 
students and 30% better for the other section. The 
delayed reproduction was 48.4% better for one section 
and 51% better for the other. The difference in atti- 
tude made a very great difference in the results. When 
the students knew that a reproduction would be called 
for, they paid more attention to the words, kept them 
in the focus of attention longer, said them over to 
themselves. When one knows what is to be expected 
of him, he directs and controls his attention and obser- 
vation accordingly. 
A somewhat similar result is shown by the experi- 
ments of Ordahl. Her experiments showed that if ob- 
jects appeared in the field of vision but were not at- 
tended to, they were no more easily learned later than 
if they had never been seen. It is evident that in idea- 
tional learning, objects must be in the focus of atten- 
tion, Attitude has much to do in determining whether 
® process shall be focal or not. We usually see what 
Welook for. In learning experiments I have often read 
€ same passage over and over again to different sub- 
jects, The subjects, one after another, would learn the 
Passage, while I would not, although I had read it to 
Many subjects in succession, each of whom had learned - 
It. The reason I had not learned it was because of atti- 
tude, 1 had not tried to learn it. . 
The importance of the attitude of school children is 
Certainly very great. If they are to learn effectively, 
they should be fayorably_disposed toward the teacher, 
toward the school, toward the various school subjects
-P-A-G-E-65
60 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
and toward the specific task or lesson. If the child likes 
the school, the teacher, and the particular work, fast 
progress is assured if other factors are favorable. Dis- 
like of the school, the teacher or the task works against 
progress. When a favorable attitude on the part of 
the pupil is secured toward the various aspects of schoo 
life, successful learning is assured, as far as the pupil 
has ability to learn. On the other hand a pupil thet 
has a dislike to the school, the teacher, or the particu 
lar work, proceeds under a very great handicap. A 
year of school is wasted for many a child because of 
such dislike. One of the teacher’s greatest problems 
and duties is to secure a favorable attitude on the pat 
of those to be taught. 
Life Bents or Dispositions—Attitudes may be tet porary. or permanent. In the latter case they may l# 
called life bents or dispositions. We can become favor 
ably disposed toward a certain study as history, 4 & tain principle as evolution or democracy, a certall 
method as that of analysis. These favorable dispost 
tions foster their own growth and perpetuate thet 
selves, becoming permanent dispositions. They

child because of having a poor teacher, because of 
ting started in a wrong way, because of starting ton 
early, or for some other reason, may have a dislike fe 
arithmetic. Because of this dislike, he studies it # 
little as possible, putting his time on studies that #* 
liked. He therefore makes little progress, and WF 
makes mastery ever more difficult and increases ™      
 
-P-A-G-E-66
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS 61 
dislike. Progress in arithmetic continues to be slow 
because of the unfavorable attitude and because 
of the poor work done in it before. In a similar 
way a pupil may acquire an unfavorable attitude toward 
any of the school studies. These facts make clear the 
importance of beginnings, the first day in school, the 
first experience with the teacher, the first lesson in any 
subject. School work is hard at best and should not 
be made harder by means of unfavorable experiences. 
The learning of lessons or any other assigned tasks 
should never be used as forms of punishment. Chil- 
dren should never be kept after school as a form of 
Punishment, The reason that such practices are wrong 
is because such procedures create dislike for things 
that should be liked. They create unfavorable dispo- 
sitions and attitudes that make learning difficult. 
Failure to take account of these simple principles is 
the cause of many a failure in the school-room, and the 
cause of many a wasted life. 
Incentives to Practice.—Attention is the fundamental 
Condition necessary to learning, and attitude may be 
Considered a permanent state of attention, or readiness 
to attend to a certain type of process. The practical 
Problem is how to secure attention and permanent dis- 
Positions. There are various factors or elements which 
We may discuss under the head of incentives. 
(1) Knowledge of the End Sought.—If the learner 
Can he made to see the end sought by practice, learning 
is usually facilitated. This facilitation comes through a 
better attention and more favorable disposition, Few 
People are willing to work blindly. Exactly what is to 
be gained by a habit and exactly what the habit is, 
Should be made clear to the learner. In addition, for
-P-A-G-E-67
  62 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
example, the immediate end sought is to be able to pro 
nounce the sum immediately upon seeing the numbers, 
The skill when attained enables us to add the scores in 
a game, our money, our account, etc. 
(2) Knowledge of the Score-—Knowledge of one's 
record is a material factor in progress. Ifa learnet 
keeps a close and accurate record of his progress, it 
incites him to practice at the highest efficiency. With 
out a knowledge of results, one usually practices on 4 
level much below the maximum. Teachers should find 
accurate means of measuring the progress of the pupils 
The improvement from day to day and from month 
to month should be shown to the children. They should be taught to make and interpret learning curves, 
should plot their own curves. . 
Arps furnishes some experimental evidence of 
effects of a knowledge of the results of practice. Usité 
the Bergstrom ergograph, he took series of records? 
which the subjects were shown their records. He 
other records and gave the subjects no knowledge 
their records. In the case of work with knowleds 
the results were 18 per cent. better than in work wi 
out knowledge. 
Wright, also working with the ergograph, used 
an incentive the ambition to reach a certain stat! 
of work. The students were shown their records. Mo* 
work was accomplished with the incentive than with 
it. If an impossible limit were set, the total am 
of work was decreased. Fatigue was found to be ies 
when the subject worked with the incentive. : 
In ordinary school work, the pupils work on bli di 
not knowing—or earing—what they are aiming at, 0 
what it will be when attained; they do not know 
      
               
   
     
    
   
-P-A-G-E-68
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS .63 
progress they are making; they do not know what 
progress is possible nor what attainment is finally pos- 
sible. When they go on the playground to play, the 
situation is entirely changed. There is something defi- 
nite to be attained. They engage in running or jump- 
ing matches, let us say. They know how fast they 
can run and how far they can jump. As a rule they 
know it very accurately. They know who among them 
is best and how much he is best. They know the estab- 
lished records in the various sports. They know how 
much they themselves have improved since the year 
before. The performances are definite, the methods are 
definite, the results are definite and definitely known. 
Inside the school-room, everything is vague and indefi- 
nite. Everything is imposed from without. There is 
little inward impulsion or desire as there is on the 
Playground. Definite knowledge of progress made by 
the pupils is one means of improving the work inside 
the school-room. 
(3) Knowledge of Errors.—Not only should children 
and all learners know the results attained, they should 
also have definite knowledge concerning their mistakes. 
In that type of learning in which errors are possible, 
unless one knows his errors he may practice on indefi- 
nitely with little or no improvement. Experiments have 
shown that in such tasks as mirror writing and pris- 
matic writing, knowledge of the erroneous movements - 
are necessary to progress. In spoken and written lan- 
guage, as Thorndike has pointed out, one may go on 
Practicing indefinitely without improvement. : 
(4) Knowledge of When the Material Learned Is to 
Be Reproduced.—If one knows when learning, that the 
Matter learned is to be reproduced, immediately or
-P-A-G-E-69
64 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
later, he proceeds differently in his learning. He takes 
a different attitude, and the learning is more efficient, 
These four points may be summarised as follows: 
Learning can be improved by giving the learner a def- 
nite idea of the nature of the habit or the end sought 
by learning and the advantage that is to come to him 
from possessing the knowledge or habit, by a definite 
knowledge of the progress made and of the mistakes, 
and by a knowledge of the use—immediate or delayed— 
that is to be made of the results of learning. 
Definiteness of the Bond.—In some kinds of learning 
it is difficult to use the principles set forth above be 
cause of the indefiniteness of the nature of the bond to 
be formed. Progress is always easier when the nature 
of this bond can be definitely and clearly known. J 
mathematics, for example, the nature of the bond 8 
always clear. ‘In all the fundamental operations ° 
arithmetic,the bonds can be definitely known: 9-+8=1i 
6X7—42; V81=9; (18)2—169. All this is definite and 
practice can be to the point. The end sought is knows 
it is definite; mistakes can be accurately pointed out, 
there is never any doubt about the matter; progres 
can be accurately and definitely measured. But it ¥ 
not so in writing, drawing, or English composition. 
writing, it is true, a copy can be set, and the child 
know what sort of result is expected, but just what be 
is to do to achieve that result, he does not know j 
no one can tell him. All he can do is to keep on tryité 
If his product is not like the copy, it is often diffi 
to say what the difference is. Sometimes, we can 
at it approximately. We can say a letter is too high, © | 
too low, or too narrow, or too wide. In drawing # 
have precisely the same difficulties, so also in lear     
   
-P-A-G-E-70
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS 65°" 
ing to write good English, When a pupil” 
writes an English composition, it is difficult .- 
for the teacher to point out exactly what its’.: 
defects are. But progress by the pupil is pos- 
sible only to the extent that the defects can be pointed 
out. To illustrate: A particular sentence may not be 
clear, it may be ambiguous. Such defeets can be pointed 
out, and just why the sentence is not clear must be 
shown, just wherein it is ambiguous must be pointed 
out. 
In all subjects in which the nature of the bonds to 
be formed is more or less indefinite, teaching is likely 
to be loose and vague, and the results uncertain. When 
we can not know exactly what we are seeking, it is im- 
Possible to measure our approach to the thing sought. 
When an English theme is handed in we cannot indi- - 
cate either its excellencies or its deficiencies as we can 
when the solution to a problem in mathematics. is 
handed in. In English, therefore, and in all subjects 
in which the same situation exists, teaching can never 
have the definiteness that it does in science and mathe- 
matics. English teaching is vague still in another sense. 
Different teachers have different ideas as to what is to 
be attained and put different estimates on the value of 
a literary product. There can be little difference of 
opinion as to whether a problem is solved correctly. 
There can be much difference of opinion as to the merit 
of a composition. . 
. Franklin gave us two good examples of definiteness 
In practice. One was in the field of ethics and the other 
in the field of English. His clear insight and farsighted- 
hess enabled him to see that one must go about im- 
provement in any field in a definite, systematic and 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
66 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
methodic way. He knew that character was dependent 
upon habits. He knew that he could not merely resolve 
to be good and immediately make improvement in all 
aspects of his character. So he made a list of the 
desirable virtues and practiced on one for a time, then 
added another, then another, and so on till he had in- 
cluded all the virtues. Then he went all over the whole 
scheme again. To improve his English, he memorised 
certain material in the Spectator. After he had for- 
gotten the words, he wrote out the thought in his own 
words. He then compared his expression of the thought 
with the expression in the Spectator. Here was some 
thing definite. On the one hand, he had his own ex 
pression of a thought; on the other, he had the expres 
sion of the same thought by one of the best writers of 
the time. He could compare them. He could se 
wherein his writing was poor. . 
By being more definite and specific there is poss 
bility of improvement in our teaching, whatever we may 
be teaching. We should make careful analysis of the 
material which we are teaching, and come to a cleat 
understanding of it ourselves and then make it clear 
to those taught. We must have a definite goal, a det 
nite route to travel to reach it, and a definite means % 
knowing when we have arrived. Learning must ceas? 
to be a travelling by an unknown route to an unknow? 
place. . 
Feeling and Learning.—The relation of feeling to 
learning may be discussed from two points of view 
Feeling is important in securing practice, and in mak 
ing practice effective through attention. Feeling 4% 
attention are different aspects of the same thing. Wh! 
processes are pleasant, we wish to experience them.

tice more profitable because it insures a higher degree - 
of attention. From the point of view of securing — 
effective practice we must take great pains to make 
conditions such that practice will be pleasurable. 
Thorndike claims that pleasure has still another re- 
‘ation to learning, namely, that it stamps in the process. 
If the passage of a stimulus over to its response is ac- 
companied or followed by pleasure, this pleasure has an 
effect upon the nervous path which results in strength- 
ening the bond,—so the argument runs. The recent 
work of Kline gives some warrant for the contention. 
Kline found that the pleasure accompanying movements 
helped to fix the bonds. 
Snoddy, however, in a recent “Experimental analysis 
of a case of trial and error learning in the human sub-
-P-A-G-E-73
68 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
ject,” claims that the pleasure resulting from a move 
ment has nothing to do with stamping it in, but he 
gives no conclusive evidence. He points out that in his 
experiment—the mirror tracing of a star—improve 
ment followed a recess or rest period. “From such ev 
dence,” he says, “it is readily seen that no selecting 
agent, such as ‘satisfyingness of a response’ is operative 
to ‘select out’ the successful responses made in a series 
of random movements—the basis of Thorndike’s view, 
since the successful responses did not occur in the | 
tracings before recess [rest] period.” But Thorndike 
never claimed that pleasure could stamp the bond # 
before its formation. After the rest periods, successtil 
movements or tracings were made. 'Thorndike’s vie¥ 
is that the pleasure resulting from the success! 
tracings is a causal element in fixing these movem 
for the future. And Snoddy gives no evidence to prov 
that satisfaction had nothing to do with stampilé 
them in. ‘ 
The fact is that the experimental evidence available 
does not enable us to say whether the physioleg! 
correlate of pleasantness is a causal element in fixio’ 
a bond once secured. It certainly does not enable 
to say that it is not, and the physiological facts 
present known—facts concerning the nature of P 
antless and unpleasantness—rather support the 
dike view that pleasure is causally effective. 
Recent psychological and physiological investigation 
_ into the nature of feeling and emotion make it am 
that pleasantness and unpleasantness have far-re 
and fundamental effects upon the body which must 
foundly affect learning, in ways other than a 1 cast     
  Uéaring attention or stamping in the process.
-P-A-G-E-74
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—GENERAL FACTORS 69 
ness has important positive relations to general. well- 
being, and specifically to digestion and nutrition, alsc 
to cardiac activity and to neural activity. Unpleasant-. 
ness produces in general the opposite effects.  Pleas- 
antness heightens and facilitates all positive, health- 
ful, life-giving functions of the body. Unpleasantness 
is negative. It retards, inhibits, constricts. Pleasant- 
ness makes for more of life; unpleasantness makes for 
less of life. It is therefore clear that pleasantness is 
a necessary condition of learning, and that unpleasant- 
hess retards learning. : 
It will be wise for teachers to bear these facts in 
mind, and use all available means to make the learning 
Processes pleasant. The age-old practice of rewarding 
the child when it does what we think it ought, and of 
punishing it when it does what we think it ought not, 
has sound scientific justification. The Montessori prin- 
ple of using great care to prevent unpleasantness from 
becoming attached to learning, is also sound. So im- 
Portant is the matter of attitude and feeling in learning 
that we may say that attention, favorable attitude and 
Pleasantness are the absolute essentials of economical 
learning. 
But while pleasantness facilitates learning, any in- 
tense emotion of whatever kind is unfavorable to learn- 
Ing. This statement is based upon general observation 
of the effects of intensive emotions on a learning sub- 
Ject and also upon the results of physiological studies. 
Cannon says: “Any high degree of excitement in the 
central nervous system, whether felt as anger, terror, 
Pain, anxiety, joy, grief or deep disgust, is likely to 
break over the threshold of the sympathetic division 
and disturb the functions of all the organs which that 
division innervates.”
-P-A-G-E-75
70 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Violent emotions prepare the body for intensive mus. 
cular activity. To quote Cannon again: “Muscular 
action is made more efficient because of emotional dis- 
turbances of the viscera. The cessation of processes 
in the alimentary canal; the shifting of blood from the 
abdominal organs; the increased vigor of contraction 
of the heart; the quick abolition of the effects of mus 
cular fatigue; the mobilizing of energy-giving sugar it 
the circulation—every one of these visceral changes 8 
directly serviceable in making the organism more 
effective in the violent display of energy which fear of 
rage or pain may involve.” The violent emotions pre 
pare'us for violent muscular activity but not for lear 
ing. The conscious processes accompanying the ‘various 
physiological changes listed by Cannon would always 
be focal in consciousness to the exclusion of learning 
processes,

and that he is to write down the words after the ten 
have been exposed. Expose the cards very quickly, 
giving just time for the words to be clearly seen. 
After the exposure, ask the subject to reproduce the 
colors and numbers instead of the words, and compare 
the results with the reproduction of the colors and 
numbers when the attention is directed to them. This 
experiment can be given only to subjects who are un- 
acquainted with its purpose. 
8. Further experiments on the effects of attitude can 
be devised by the instructor or students. For example: 
Select a short poem and read it aloud to a learning sub- 
ject. Determine the number of repetitions required 
for the poem to be learned. Then read the poem to 
other learners till each has learned it. If you have not 
tried to learn it, you probably can not reproduce it 
although several persons have learned it while you have 
been reading it. Repeat the experiment with a dif- 
ferent poem, and try to learn it while your subjects are 
learning it. The effects of attitude will be evident.

4, The effects of knowledge of errors can be studied 
by means of an experiment in which some form of 
concealed hand movement is required. Compare the 
results when the subject is ignorant of his errors with 
the results of other subjects who are shown their 
errors. The movement can be such as placing a pencil 
at a certain angle with the perpendicular. The details 
should be planned by the instructor. 
5. The effects of attitude and consciousness on learn- 
ing can be further studied by means of experiments 
modeled after those of Ordahl and Peterson. See the

CHAPTER V. 
ECONOMIC LEARNING. 
SPECIAL FACTORS. 
In the preceding chapter we considered the funda- 
mental factors that influence learning. We shall now 
consider a number of specific factors that have a bear- 
ing on economical learning. The ultimate explanation 
of the specific factors is to be found, in most cases, in 
the more general and fundamental principles already 
discussed. 
School Room Drill.—Habits can be established only 
through repetition. Knowledge can be organised and 
fixed for permanent and practical use only through 
thinking it over, by bringing the ideas to conscious- 
ness again and again. The school undertakes to estab- 
lish a great number of essential habits in the pupils, 
and to help them acquire and organise a great body of 
knowledge. There are writing habits to be formed, 
Spelling habits, reading habits, language habits, arith- 
metic habits and a multitude of social, moral and con- 
ventional habits. This work takes most of the time of 
the school. The public schoo] in this country originated 
as a place where the education of the home was supple- 
mented by drill in the so called three R’s. As the years 
have gone by, the school has enlarged its function and 
taken over nearly the whole work of the education of 
the child. It is not our purpose here to go into the 
Seneral question of the socialisation of the school, and 
its other modern developments. We shall consider enly 
one aspect of this development.

14 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Certain modern educational reformers have under- 
taken to dispense with formal drill altogether. Their 
notion is that the child will incidentally get enough 
repetition to fix the fundamental habits. In such a 
scheme, spelling, writing, arithmetic and even reading 
are not taught as such specifically. The child writes 
letters and essays and in writing them gets practice in 
writing and spelling. The child is never drilled in the 
fundamentals of arithmetic, but he solves concrete 
problems and in doing so gets practice in the use of 
the fundamentals. 
The problem of formal versus incidental drill is really 
an_ experimental one. It can not be settled by argi- 
ment but only by an appeal to the facts. One of the 
primary principles of learning is, there must be repel tion. For learning to be economical, the repetitions 
must be under the general conditions of economi 
learning already discussed. Any procedure that s¢ 
cures practice under these principles is psychologically 
sound. We have therefore to compare the results 
repetition that is merely incidental with the results of 
repetition that is specific or formal. There are sever‘ : 
studies that touch upon the problem. 
Drill in Arithmetic—In 1911 J. C, Brown reported 
an experiment in which he had undertaken to deter. 
mine the effect of drill in arithmetic. He worked with 
children whose average age was thirteen and a hi 
years. He divided them into two groups of equa 
average ability in arithmetical operations. One group 
of twenty-five pupils was given five minutes of daily 
drill in the fundamental operations of arithmetic fort 
thirty days. The other group of twenty-six pupils may . 
be ealled the control group. It did the same work ia 
a

arithmetic as the drill group except that it had: no 
formal drill in fundamentals. The only practice it had 
in the fundamental operations of arithmetic was what 
it got in solving the regular problems. A* **- -~7 -* 
thirty days the groups were tested and th 
was found to be 21.2 per cent. better in tk 
problems solved, while the non-drill or contro: group 
was only 9.8 per cent. better. After a twelve weeks 
vacation, the groups were again tested and it was found 
that the drill group maintained its superiority. 
Brown later repeated his experiment using 222 pupils 
whose average age was 12.2 years. The drill was in 
arithmetical fundamentals as before and continued five 
minutes a day for twenty days. The drill group im- 
Proved 16.9 per cent. while the non-drill group improved 
only 6.4 per cent. This second more extensive study 
therefore corroborated the results of his first study. 
Thorndike in 1910 and Donovan and Thorndike in 
1913 reported some experiments which show the value 
of school room drill in arithmetic. In one experiment, 
twenty-nine fourth grade children were drilled two 
_ Minutes twice a day for fifteen days—sixty minutes 
Practice in all. They improved from two and three- 
fourths examples per minute to four and a half a 
minute, showing the great effects of practice. 
‘Phillips reports (1913) an experiment with sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grade children. He divided them 
into a drill and a control group. The drill group had 
fen minutes a day practice for two months in arithmeti- 
cal fundamentals and in reasoning. The drill group 
gained 15% more in fundamentals and 50% more in 
Teasoning than did the control group.
-P-A-G-E-81
16 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Winch, while studying the problem of the transfer 
of training, obtained evidence of the great effect of 
drill in arithmetical fundamentals. He made several 
extensive studies, in every case dividing the pupils 
studied into a drill group and a control group. I give 
the results of two experiments which may be taken a8 
typical. . 
(1) Thirty-three pupils, ten years old, were drilled 
in arithmetical fundamentals thirty minutes a day for 
ten days. As a result of the drill they showed a0 
improvement of 21% in numerical accuracy. The 
basis of the comparison was the improvement of the 
last two practices over the first two. 
(2) Thirty-two boys, ten years and three months 
old, were given ten daily practices of thirty minutes 
each, and as a result showed an improvement of 45.5% 
in numerical accuracy. . 
In these experiments, the control group did 1 
mathematical work whatever. While the drill grou? 
was practicing on arithmetical fundamentals, the col 
trol group studied English in one case and drawing 
the other. The drill group did no mathematical work 
except the drill of the experiment. Winch was inter | 
ested only in ascertaining whether the drill made the 
pupils better in arithmetical reasoning. He was n0h 
therefore, able to compare formal drill with incidental 
drill, since the control group did not have any drill of 
any kind during the experiment. The experiments 40 
show, however, the very remarkable effects of a fe¥ 
hours of drill. 
The experiments leave no doubt of the great effet 
of even very short drills. daily in the fundamentals 
arithmetic. It seems clear that besides the regulat
-P-A-G-E-82
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—SPECIAL FACTORS a7 
work in arithmetic, that of learning the principles and 
solving problems, pupils should be given short, vigorous 
drills on fundamentals and perhaps also in solving 
easy problems mentally. The returns from such drills 
areenormous. Not only do drills in fundamentals give 
ease, facility and confidence in their use but make the 
solving of concrete problems easier because, since the _ 
pupils have mastered the fundamentals through drills, ~ 
their energies are all available for the solution of the 
problems. The earlier experiments of Winch gave 
some experimental evidence for the above statement, 
but his later experiments did not. However in his 
experiments, the pupils did not actually solve the . 
Problems, they only indieated the solution. If they 
had actually performed the operations, the effects of 
their previous drill in fundamentals would doubtless 
we been evident. 
Drill in Other Subjects.—Wallin’s studies in the 
Cleveland schools showed the value of spelling drills. 
He says, “It is by no means evident that modern peda- 
Sogy demands the substitution of incidental spelling 
instruction for the spelling drill. It is still less evident 
that the schools have outgrown the drill in the other 
formal branches of the curriculum.” 
Peters made a study of the influence of speed drills 
Upon the rate and effectiveness of silent reading. He 
gave speed drills for a period of seven months to grades 
three, four, five and six. Grade three is omitted from 
his results. Two hundred and seven pupils took part 
in the experiment. In each grade, there were two drill 
groups and one control group. The drill groups took 
five to ten minutes of the regular reading period for 
drill in rapid silent reading. The drill group at the
-P-A-G-E-83
73 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
beginning of the experiment read 83.8% as fast as the 
non-drill group; at the end of the experiment the drill 
_ group read 107.5% as fast as the non-drill group. The 
pupils that were trained in rapid reading therefore 
* improved 18.7% more than did the control group, and 
this improvement was not at the expense of quality, 
which, according to Peters, was not materially affected. 
The experimenter says his result “strongly suggests 
the advisability of giving speed drills as a part of the 
teaching of reading”, and says further: “It is also 
probable that it is worth while to teach children to 
skim.” 
Whipple and Curtis made a specific investigation of 
skimming in reading. They seemed not to be concemed 
with improvement in skimming through practice, but 
rather in a comparison of skimming with other methods 
of reading. It is impossible to determine from the 
published report of their study how much their sub 
jects improved by practice. The experimenters com 
clude, however, that “It seems probable that practice 
in skimming might profitably be given in the public school.” 
Thorndike reports three experiments showing the great improvement of adults resulting from a relatively 
short period of practice. I give the results of one of 
these experiments. Ten hospital nurses, 21 to 85 
years old, were given 2 hours and 25 minutes of 
practice, five minutes daily except Sunday, in adding 
one place numbers. The results are shown in terms 
of the number of one-place numbers added in five 
minutes. The first number of each pair represents the 
initial ability and the second number represents the 
ability after practice. 180-230, 200-430, 225-368

225-460, 290-540, 150-280, 220-380, 235-570, 250-440; 
260-540. This makes an average improvement of 
88.7%. 
Some Miscellaneous Factors Influencing Drill — 
Conard and Arps compared two methods of drill iu 
arithmetic. They divided 76 high school pupils into 
two equal groups by the Courtis tests. One group was 
drilled for eight periods on arithmetical fundamentals, 
by the traditional method; the other group was drilled 
for the same time, but their method was to name only 
the results. For example, instead of saying “six plus 
four are ten”, they simply looked at six and four and 
said “ten”. The latter group showed a great saving 
of time. In every school subject, the best and most 
economical procedures or methods for doing the various 
Processes should be experimentally determined, then 
these processes and procedures should be followed. 
Kirkpatrick compared two methods of learning to 
multiply. He had two groups learn to multiply by 
Using a table. One group memorised the table, the 
other group used the table from the beginning. The 
latter method proved the most advantageous. Kirk- 
Patrick draws the following conclusion from his study: 
“The results indicate that in many lines of teaching | 
there has been a tremendous waste of time, energy, 
and interest in first memorising, then later practicing 
the use of what has been learned.” It is not economical 
to acquire skills too far removed from their practical 
Use in life. I have performed an experiment in card- 
sorting which gives results similar to those obtained — 
by Kirkpatrick in multiplication. The experiment was 
a8 follows: ‘Two subjects worked an hour a day for 
two days sorting cards into five boxes. On the first
-P-A-G-E-85
"80 ‘THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
day, one subject sorted cards for the whole hour, the 
other subject, instead of sorting, studied the boxes 
trying to learn their locations without sorting cards 
into them. On the second day, both sorted the cards 
into the boxes. By repeating the experiment several 
times, having first one subject study instead of sort, 
. and then the other, it became quite evident that the 
most economical way to learn to sort cards is to sort “ 
them. Studying the boxes for an hour made learning 
progress on the next day faster than it would have been 
without study but not so fast as when the first hour 
had been spent in sorting. 
Capman studied the effects of various forms of 
external incentives on the drill effects in adding, cal- 
celling out and in the digit-symbol test. The incentives 
used were knowledge of previous records, the learning 
graph,.and credit rewards. The motivated group di 
much better except in cancelling out. In the latter n0 
incentive was needed. 
Practice in Fundamental Mental Functions—We 
shall now turn from the question of strengthening 
bonds by practice to the question of the general im 
provement of a function by practice. This is a wholly 
different problem from those we have been considering: 
We take up the question here because certain men 
functions or capacities may be considered the tools 
machinery of learning. The various forms of sensory 
discrimination, for example, are necessary elements 2 
many forms of learning. The question of whether 
these functions, important as elements of learning, ¢% 
be improved by practice is therefore a vita] one. 
there are mental functions which are important in 
learning, and these functions ean be improved bY
-P-A-G-E-86
ECONOMICAL LEARNING—-SPECIAL FACTORS 81 
practice, then we can improve a person’s general learn- 
ing capacity. We turn to the experiments. 
Training in Pitch Discrimination—Studies in pitch 
discrimination by F. O. Smith in the University of 
lowa indicate that there is no improvement from prac- 
tice. He studied children of all ages as well as adults. 
As a result of his extensive investigations he makes 
the following positive statement: ‘The sensitiveness 
of the ear to pitch differences can not be improved 
appreciably by practice. There is no evidence of any 
improvement in sensitiveness to pitch as a result of 
practice.” It looks as if functions as simple as pitch 
discrimination are little improved by practice. ‘ Aey 
depend upon inherited nervous organisation. More com- 
Plex functions seem to be improved by practice at least 
early in life, 
Whipple, by means of a specially devised tachisto- 
Scope, gave several adults practice in the range of 
visual attention and in visual assimilation. He found 
no improvement after the first few days of work. This 
early improvement was due to the subjects becoming 
adapted to the conditions and methods of the experi- 
Ment. 
Dallenbach, following Whipple, made similar experi- 
tents, using school children as subjects. Whipple had 
found that adults made practically no improvement. 
Dallenbach found that children made considerable im- 
Provement. For bright and normal children, the im- 
Provement was rapid at first and then slow. For dull 
and feeble-minded children, the improvement was very 
slow at first, but continued throughout the experiment. 
At the end of the experiment some of the dull and 
feebleminded children were as good as the average
-P-A-G-E-87
82 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
normal child. Two conclusions seem warranted. (1) 
in fairly simple mental functions, improvement is pos 
sible in the case of children when it is not possible for 
adults. (2) It sometimes happens that the ordinary 
situations of school and of life fail to develop 
even the primary mental functions. In such 
eases definite, special drill seems to develop 
_these backward functions. Such being the case, 
although we cannot speak from definite experiments on 
the subject, it seems likely that the experiences of 
_ early life can at least in some measure affect the de 
velopment of important mental functions. It seems 
obvious that these functions would not adequately de 
velop without some external stimulation; then surely 
the character and amount of such stimulation must be 
of consequence. When the character and amount o 
stimulation have not been adequate to develop a child 
to the limits of his natural capacities, then specifi drill is highly effective and valuable. When the chat 
acter and amount of stimulation have been sufficient to 
bring aout the natural growth and development of the 
various aspects of mental capacity then specific practice 
with a view to develop mental capacity is of little value. 
It is of little value because the development has already 
taken place. 
Practical Inferences—What practical advice shall

The experiments leave no doubt of the great value of 
specific drill, of direct practice. By far the larger part

tion. "The formation of these habits should be faced

eessantly, day after day, month after month, year after : 
year. We should follow a similar procedure in the case 
of spelling habits, reading habits, and all other habits to 
be acquired in school, Is there a certain skill that it is 
desirable I should possess? Then I must practice, 
practice, practice. By and by I shall have the skill. 
There is no reason why we should beat about the bush, 
evade, or come at it indirectly. I must know exactly 
what the skill is, have some good reason for desiring it, 
then I should practice it vigorously, regularly, directly. 
The school room, for the early years of child life, should 
be a drill room. The drill periods should be short; the 
drills vigorous. “During the drill, the attention of the 
children should be of the highest order. They should 
working at the highest possible point of efficiency. 
Usually the drills should be of only a few minutes in 
length, not long enough to tire the children. Com- 
Petition, both individual and group, can be used, if used 
Wisely, to advantage. Every known legitimate device 
should be used to make the practice effective and profit- 
able. Particularly should we have the pupil keep his 
Tecord and plot his learning curve. We should arouse 
in him an ambition to make the curve rise a little every 
day. We should show him definitely the skill that is 
possible of attainment. He should know about how 
long it will take him to acquire that skill.

particularly what we have just learned to do. This 
~ delight in mere exercise can be maintained provided 
the drills are short as well as vigorous. 
Practice in school subjects should not, however, be 
wholly formal, Every skill is only a means to some 
end. The skill has no real and permanent value ia 
itself. It should therefore be used in its proper setting. 
Spelling, reading, writing, arithmetical fundamentals 
have no value in themselves. They are all merely 
means to ends that are intrinsically valuable. We must 
be able to spell and write if we wish to communicate 
with friends at a distance. We must be able to read 
to get the pleasure and information that is possible 
from reading. We must be able to add, subtract, mul tiply and divide in order to be able to carry on the actu’l 
business of our life. In acquiring these skills, we 
. Should certainly use them in their real life connections 
and settings, but not merely so. If a child writes spells only when writing a letter, it will probably nevet write a letter. If a base ball pitcher pitched only ™ 
games, he would never win many games. Much pre 
tice must be preparatory, anticipatory. Early life # 
preparatory. Nothing can change that fact. Never 
theless, there should be much incidental drill. Situ 
tions should be devised in school and in the home th 
duplicate or mimic life situations, such as keepilg | 
store with its buying and selling and calculations # 
computations. There should also be much letter wt 
ing, actual as well as fictitious. The child should hav 
much practice in using his newly acquired skills in thet 
proper settings. But he should have additional pra 
tice of a direct and formal sort also. The two Dp 
cedures combined will give the efficiency which 
situations of life demand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90

Definite Procedure.—The thing about habit-forma- 
tion that should be made clear is this: The teacher 
should understand definitely and clearly what she is 
trying to do, the knowledge she is to help the pupils to 
acquire and the habits she is to help them to form. 
These facts should be clear and definite to her. And 
- she should make definite and systematic plans for the 
work, The school work of the past has been too indefi- 
nite, too hazy, too nebulous. Too often neither pupils 
nor teachers knew where they were going. Objectives 
must be known and clear. They must also be as close 
48 possible. There must be constant realisation of 
aims. We can not put off all realisations, all fruits, _ 
all rewards to an uncertain future date. We must set 
a certain skill to be attained this week, perhaps even 
in this single practice. Not only must ends be definite 
and clearly known, but the time and place and manner 
of practicing must be definite. A thing that is to be 
one at any time is too often done at no time. e 
teacher should therefore supervise in great detail the 
Whole work of practice on the part of the pupils, what 
Work is to be done at school, what at home, the exact 
of practice, the lengths of periods, the manner 
of practice. By means of the standard tests she 
thould measure the progress of the pupils. Not only 
should all these things be definite and clear ‘to-the 
teacher, but they should be clear to the pupils as well. 
The pupils should know what they are doing and why 
they are doing it. They should know the precise 
nature of the habit they are to form, what it will be 
Worth to them when they have it, how they are to pro- 
teed to acquire it. And, as already pointed out, they 
thould plot the course of the voyage they make in the
-P-A-G-E-91
86 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
process of acquirement. Not only should teacher and 
pupils have a clear understanding of their aims and 
their means of attaining them, but parents should have 
this knowledge, too. Teacher, parent, and pupil are all 
working together for the accomplishing of the one defi- 
nite, clear-cut purpose. Too often the parents do not 
. know, more often still, do not understand the purposes 
of the school. Under such circumstances they can not 
properly co-operate. It must not be forgotten that the 
schools are maintained by the parents for their chil 
dren. It sometimes looks as if schools were maintained 
by teachers for teachers, that pupils are important only 
because it is hard to have school without them, and 
that parents have no importance at all. Their wishes 
are not to be considered. So easy it is to lose propet 
perspective and to forget the proper relations of things 
Developing General Ability.—It does not seem that 
the school can do much.toward developing general capa 
city. There need be no training in the use of the senses. 
Nature provides for this training in the ordinary course 
of life. Probably most of the simple, elemental forms 
of mental activity need no specific training. It may be 
that in some cases they do, in case of exceptional chil 
dren; generally they do not. The various aspects 
association, learning, remembering, attending get suff 
cient practice for their development in the process 0 
forming the needed habits, and acquiring the necessalT 
knowledge. Briefly, we do not need to have studies 
practices whose purpose is the development of the mind. 
The life that we must necessarily live develops about 
as far as development is possible. 
We do not mean to say, however, that mental fut 
tions develop without reference to the stimulation & |
-P-A-G-E-92
ECONOMICAL LEARNING-—-SPECIAL FACTORS 87 
the environment. On the contrary, the development of 
mental functions is absolutely dependent upon environ- 
mental stimulation. What we do mean to say is that 
the ordinary stimuli which are fairly constant to all 
human environments are sufficient to bring about nor- 
mal mental human development. No doubt extreme 
differences in this environment can measurably influ- 
ence human development. The evidence of the neurolo- 
gist supports this view. Burnham*, for example, says, 
“We see from the genesis of the nervous system that 
the one condition necessary for normal development is 
arich environment giving plenty of stimulation and 
freedom for the nervous mechanism to develop in its 
own way. This seems especially important for the 
cerebral cortex and its dependent structures. The same 
thing is emphasized, too, by all the cases of defect where 
Normal stimuli are shut off. In such cases, there is 
always imperfect or arrested development.” 
What Amount of Skill Is Desirable?—A legitimate 
question and a very practical one is this: What degree 
of skill should we attain in the various school subjects? 
It is certainly not profitable to acquire great skill in 
Unctions that are not to be used for a long time, for 
unless practice is kept up in the interval, the skill will 
deteriorate before the time comes for its use. If we 
are always to consider economy, a skill should not be 
aquired until near the time for its use. It is certain 
that much time is wasted in school because we do not 
e this principle into account. “We have the child 
acquire numerous skills in the hope that some time, 
Somewhere he will have occasion to use them. Many

of these skills he will never use, and many others wil 
deteriorate before the time comes for their use. Inall 
of the school subjects we should make a careful study 
of the skills which they give, and at the same time we 
should make a study of the present and future need of 
the child. The skills should be acquired with some 
reference to these present and future needs. It 
is certain that in many subjects, the amount that we 
teach should be cut down, stripped of unessentials, We 
should make a careful estimate of future needs, and 
consider the relative nearness of these needs. In mathe 
matics, for example, the general needs are very few, the 
fundamental operations. These are needed constantly, 
or at least we can say that in any normal sort of life 
they should be used constantly. They should be maé 
tered, and carried to a point where they can be us 
with speed, certainty and facility. The same thing 
true of reading to get thought, of spelling, and of writ 
ing. There is a minimum of essentials which all norm 
people should get to a fair degree of mastery. Bey 
the minimum of essentials, all other skills should lt 
mastered with reference to the time when they wil ® 
needed. As a general rule we should master first the 
skills that we shall need first. A great deal of tim? 
could be saved for the children of the country if col 
, petent people would select from the various subj 
the minimum requirements of skill that are desirable 
for all. Whenever the special work which a perse! 
takes up requires ‘a skill additional to those alres 
acquired, that skill can then be acquired. The 
acquired for distant and uncertain uses should be fe®. 
The immediate demands are too great to substitute fot 
them uncertain future demands. But when future & _\aen—manmeuens, xvuminapummamnenmen samme

is the most economical, provided there are no other 
factors. 
Function of the Teacher.—The relation of the teacher 
to the learners is a close and important one. Book has 
enumerated and discussed the various ways in which 
the teacher can be of service to the pupils in their 
leaming. He gives ten points, which may be condensed 
into eight, and stated concisely as follows: 
The teacher can— 
(1) Help pupils to overcome difficulties as they appear; 
(2) Help pupils to discover the best methods of study 
and work; 
(3) See that pupils use the most economic methods in 
forming habits; 
(4) Minimise the formation of interfering tendencies; 
(8) Help pupils to organise and assimilate details in a 
natural way ; 
(6) Provide special incentives to effort; . 
(7) Make hygienic and environmental conditions of 
learning favorable; 
8) Develop in pupils an attitude of permanent interest 
in work. 
To these may be added another: The teacher can_ 
help the pupils to understand the purpose and nature 
of the habits to be formed. 
EXPERIMENTS AND EXERCISES. 
The facts of this chapter do not readily submit them- 
telves to class room demonstration. However, the stu- 
denty might very well make application of the facts to 
the various branches of the public school. These 
ches can be examined and the habit-forming

aspects of each determined. The students can then 
work out a scheme of drill or other form of practice for 
fixing the habits, and in doing this, provide for the use 
of the psychological facts that are applicable. For ex- 
ample, let us take arithmetic. The actual number of 
habits that should be formed in the elementary study of 
arithmetic can be listed, so many in adding, so many in 
subtraction, so many in multiplication, and so on. The 
order in which these habits should be established should 
be worked out. The use of early habits in acquiring 
later ones should be noted. After the elementary 
habits have been provided for, a study should be made 
of the use and application of these in fractions and per- 
centage. On this basis, a course of study in arithmetic 
as habit-formation could be made. Let the student 
make an estimate of the amount of time necessary 
master the course outlined. 
Take other branches and make similar studies from 
the point of view of habit-formation. The plans of 
different students should be compared and discussed.

CHAPTER VI. 
IDEATIONAL LEARNING, 
The Nature of Ideational Learning.—By ideational 
learning, we mean acquiring knowledge. In the last 
analysis, as pointed out in Chapter I, there is little if 
any difference between habit and knowledge. Both de- 
pend upon established neural connections. In habit, 
stimulus is connected with its motor response; in knowl- 
edge, idea is connected with idea. In forming habits, 
Neural bonds are established which connect certain 
stimuli with certain muscular responses; in ideational 
earning, neural bonds are formed which connect cer- 
tain ideas with certain other ideas. In habits, the mus- 
cular response is the important element; in knowledge, 
although muscular action may take place, it is not an 
Important element, not an essential part of knowledge. 
In knowledge, the important thing is sequence of ideas. 
if action takes place, it follows upon the sequence of 
ideas, and has no causal relation with them.\ In the 
last four chapters, we have had in mind chiefly habit- 
ormation. In this chapter, our exclusive concern is 
With ideational Jearning, the getting of knowledge. 
Knowledge and Ideas.—Our first concern is to get a 
Clear notion of the meaning of the words idea and 
“towledge. The meaning given to each of these terms: 
8 a simple and common-sense one. We shall call our 
Sensory experience with the world, primary experience, 
and the revivals of sensory experience in the absence 
Sensory stimulation, we shall call secondary experi- 
[91]
-P-A-G-E-97
92 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
ence. Sensory experience takes the form of perception; 
secondary experience takes the form of ideas. Percep- 
tions are the conscious processes representative of the 
jects in revived/or secondary experience. To illustrate: 
Ideas are the conscious processes representative of ob- 
jects in revived or secondary experience. To illustrate: 
Suppose I take a walk through the ‘woods. I see, hear, 
touch, smell, and taste various things. I have primary, 
sensory, perceptual experience of birds, trees, flowers, 
fruits, breezes, sounds, temperatures. Afterward, when 
night has come, I sit in my room and experience the 
trip all over again in the form of ideas. We shall, thea, 
use idea as the general name for the bits or elements 
of revived experience. We shall use knowledge as the 
name for connected ideas, remembering that one ele 
ment of the connection may be a perception, but the 
second element is always an idea. . 
As I sit in my room and live the wood trip over agai, 
many ideas come to me, not only ideas of the trip but 
other ideas that come up from every part of my past 
experience, Within an hour, ideas come, revived from 
almost every part of my past life. Various experiences 
of the trip, owing to similarity with past experiences, 
revive the past experiences, so that the experiences 0! 
the trip serve as a means of tapping or sounding almost 
the whole of past experience. The intricacy with which 
all of our past experience is bound together is well 
shown by the free association experiment. In this & 
periment, the subject is given a word and told to write 
all the other words which come to mind. The autho? 
has the following sequence: sky, sun moon, clouds, ral 
umbrella, wet, woman, hat, hair, dress, skin, comb, ey 
glasses, water. Why did these words—representilé
-P-A-G-E-98
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 93 
ideas—come in this order? In the case of my wood- 
trip, I find that my ideas correspond to the perceptual 
experience as it came during the trip, not in strict 
chronological order, but all the ideas of or from the 
trip are closely bound together. Do the words, sky, 
suns, etc., written above, represent any particular expe- 
tience, or do they come from a great variety of experi- 
ences? They, of course, come from a great variety of 
” experiences, and it shall now be our purpose to examine 
into the laws that determine their coming. 
The Law of Association.—Let us suppose that on my 
walk through the woods, I passed a large boulder and 
saw a snake coiled up beside it. When the experience 
comes back to me, I have an idea of the boulder and 
aso of the snake. Or, when I go by the same place 
again and see the boulder I also think of the snake. 
This is typical of all experience. What is experienced 
together in perception, comes back together as ideas. 
Processes that take place together in the brain, or come 
in close succession are connected, they are really a part 
of one process, as they leave in the brain some form, a 
trace of this connection, so that later a revival of one 
of the processes tends to revive the others, the snake 
and boulder were together ‘in the woods; they are like- 
Wise together in my mind; the creek, and the shore, and 
the frogs, and the dragon-flies, and water lilies were 
together in my experience; they are likewise together 
inmy mind. Clouds, and lightning, and thunder, and 
tain, and mud are together in the world, they set up 
Simultaneous and immediately successive processes in 
ny brain and are consequently together in my mind. 
Corresponding to all the outer world, with its spatial 
and temporal and casual relationships, I build up an )\
-P-A-G-E-99

inner world of ideas, Whatever relationships and se- 
quences exist in the objective world, hold also with my 
ideas. The outer world is lawful, orderly, systematic, 
so also is my world of ideas. 
It is obvious that the various objects of perceptive 
experience are experienced in myriad connections. A 
horse, for example, is experienced in connection with 
buggies, wagons, trucks; as being ridden, as being 
driven ;. they are seen in pastures; they are seen run’ 
ning away; they are seen dying; they are seen lying 
on the streets with broken legs; they are seen with colts 
following them; in a word, they are experienced in a 
great variety of situations. At any particular time if 
horse. is suggested to me, what one of its ideational 
connections will follow? Both observation and labora- 
tory experiment have revealed several determining fat 
tors, as follows: primacy, the original connection: 
recency, the most recent connection. The other factors 
are frequency, meaning the number of times the parti 
ular’ connection has been repeated in perceptual or idea 
tional experience siintensity, meaning the intensity ow 
' vividness of the experienced connection ; and mental s 
or attitude. :"By mental set we mean that the attifude 
- or feeling tone of the original experience is a determil- 
ing factor in the revived experience. Other factors be 
ing equal, the mood or attitude that I am in will deter 
mine that sequence, in any given case, which corre 
sponds to previous sequences in the same attitude. At 
any time, if I see a horse, or if the idea of horse come 
to mind, the idea which the idea horse will first suggest 
or arouse, will depend upon the most pervious neu 
path at that moment, and the most pervious path of 
connection will depend upon the various strengths 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 95 
the factors above mentioned. The first idea may be of 
arun-a-way horse, depending upon recency, the next 
idea may be of a horse pulling a plow depending upon, 
frecuency, the next idea may be of a, horse pulling a 
buggy depending upon primacy; and the next idea may 
be of horses pulling a hearse depending upon mood. 
Always these various factors are at work; always there 
is a conflict for the determination of the course of asso- 
cation. The path that is most open leads to the first 
connected idea; the path that has the least resistance 
next in order determines the next idea; and so on, till 
the trend of association is diverted by perception or till 
it is carried internally to another center or matrix. 
Thinking. —We shall use the word thinking as a gen- 
eral term to designate the free flow or passage of ideas. 
8 flow or passage depends entirely upon the law of 
association. While we are awake, there is in us a con- 
stant succession of ideas. Usually a perception initiates 
aseries of ideas. .For example: I walk along the street. 
Treceive impressions through all the senses. The sights 
and sounds and odors arouse trains of ideas. I pass a 
man. His name comes to me. Then I think of various 
experiences which I have had with him—when I first 
saw him, when I last saw him, of his business, his 
family. These ideas are in process when I pass a dough- 
nut shop, which sets up a different series of ideas. The 
Smell of doughnuts makes me think of my childhood, 
the early home, my mother and her cooking. Nearly 
everything which I pass as I go down the street is rich 
In association and sets going a series of ideas. 
All day long, wherever we are and whatever we may 
doing, we have perceptions. These perceptions set 
going trains or series of ideas. A closely related series
-P-A-G-E-101
96 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
of ideas leads presently to another. And so the ideas 
flow along till a new perception breaks in and sets up 
a different series. 
Reasoning.—Reasoning is the flow of ideas evoked by 
_ & Situation, new or partially new. Since the situation 
.is new, it arouses no response through habitual connec- 
tions. For all situations that have been repeatedly met, 
there follow habitual forms of response that have been 
organised in connection with situations. When we meet 
a situation partially new and no instinctive or habitual 
response follows, we have to stop and wait for the asso . 
iative processes to suggest a solution. The process of 
reasoning may he illustrated as follows: The outlet of 
my bath tub was stopped up so that the water would 
not drain out. The following ideas came to me—there is an obstruction just at the bend outside of the tub, 
probably there is a way to get in there and get the ob- 
struction out, I look and find that there is. I can get 
in by unscrewing a nut. But the nut is in a place difi- 
cult to get at, and besides I have no wrench handy t 
unscrew the nut. The pressure of the water in the tub 
is not great enough to force the obstruction out. If 
should fill the tub full of water perhaps the pressufe 
would be great enough to force the obstruction out. | 
try it and it will not doit. How can I get greater pres 
sure? The pressure of the water in the water pipes 8 
strong enough to force it out. But how can I utilise 
this pressure? If I could put a piece of rubber hose 0 
the pipe from which the water passes into the tub and 
hold the other end of the hose at the outlet of the tub, 
the force of the water might force the obstriction out. 
I try it. It will not do it. If I could wrap a rag around 
the end of the hose at the outlet of the tub so as to forte
-P-A-G-E-102
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 
all the water into the drain pipe, the pressure woula uy. 
great enough to force the obstruction out. I try it and»: 
it works. The obstruction is forced out. The illustra- 
tion is fairly typical of all reasoning. We meet a situa- 
tion that has not been met before. The situation sug- | 
gests or arouses various ideas from our past experience.” 
Certain elements of the situation are like past. experi- 
ences. An idea comes to us. We try it out. It may 
work. It may not. If it does not work, it.is because 
we do not have accurate enough information about the 
forces with which we deal. In the above illustration, I 
‘ did not know how hard the obstruction would be to 
foree out. I did not know whether the pressure of the 
tub full of water would be sufficient or not. I had to 
try and see. Various ideas of getting pressure behind 
the obstruction came to me. I tried out the ideas till 
success came. 
In the above illustration, an actual situation had to 
be met. It often happens that we meet a hypothetical 
Situation as when we have to answer a question. The 
are 
thought processes are the same, but the illustration ' 
shows that we can not be sure of an answer to a hypo- 
thetical question unless the conditions are accurately 
stated. Suppose I have a ring of iron and a sphere of 
iron that will nearly but not quite go through the ring. 
How can I get it through? Now if my past experience 
has taught me that heat expands iron, the idea may 
come to me that if the ring is heated, it will expand and 
Possibly let the ball pass through. If I have accurate 
Imowledge about the expansion of iron due to heat, I 
can answer the question by making accurate measure- 
 Ments of the ring and ball. If I do not have this accu- 
tate knowledge and can not make very accurate meas-
-P-A-G-E-103
98 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
urements, I shall have to try and see, I can not give an 
accurate theoretical answer. The latter is often the 
case in our theoretical reasoning. The facts that we 
have are not full enough and not accurate enough to 
enable us to make an exact answer. Much of the ordi- 
ary reasoning of men has this defect. Much that is 
taught in school is untrue because due to inferences 
from incomplete or erroneous data. We have been 
taught much in physiology and hygiene that is now dis- 
covered to be untrue, much about digestion—what we 
ought to eat, how we ought to eat it and when we ought 
to eat it—much about diseases, their causes and their 
supposed cures. All the social sciences are full of false 
doctrines because of incomplete and inaccurate knowl- 
edge. It is so often true that we can not gauge cor 
rectly the forces or principles that enter into our Te 
soning, that we can seldom be sure of our conclusion 
unless we can put our tentative solutions to the prac: 
tical test. Reasoning is usually the means by which 
our past experience suggests possible solutions to the 
problem or situation which confronts us. The public 
schools can be of great service to‘our people and to our 
country by making these facts clear to children, but 
this point we must take up in a later paragraph. 
There is nothing new about the process of reasoning: 
nothing different from: the ordinary flow of ideas; 10 
new law in operation. The flow of ideas, however, 8 
limited by the situation. We maintain the situation, of 
external conditions maintain it for us—the water per 
sists in staying in the bath tub—and one series of ideas 
after another is initiated. Each series of ideas is the 
result of past experience. Our problem is solved, thee 
retically, when an idea comes that satisfies us, that

seems in the light of our experience, to fit the situatic: 
The idea may be adequate; it may not. All depen: 
upon our past experience and the accuracy of our knovi 
edge of the situation. : 
\Primary Experience.—It is clear that in ideation 
learning and in the processes of thinking and reasonir: 
all depends upon primary experience. Ideas, the el 
ments of knowledge, are derived from perceptual € 
Perience.\, We must therefore take pains to see th 
children have wide experience, that the facts of expe! 
ence are correctly interpreted. The child must have 
first-hand experience with nature—with all the fore 
of nature and with all the objects of nature—with ai- 
mals and plants, and with machinery. It must learn 
their names, and their uses or functions. It learns by 
seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, etc. In 
getting knowledge of things, nothing can fully take the 
Blace of direct experience. No description of the taste 
of sugar could ever give us a clear notion of the taste 
of it if we had never tasted it. And if we have tasted 
it, no description is necessary. No description of a 
cow could give us a clear notion of one. All of our 
knowledge must be built upon actual sensory experi- 
ence. If a person lacks some sense, as sight, from 
birth, no description can make clear to him what expe- 
Hence is like in the field of the sense that is lacking. 
The basis of all knowledge must come through the 
Senses.) Throughout all the years of a child’s life, it is 
getting this knowledge; it is learning the world in all 
the world’s manifold aspects. Day after day, and year 
after year, the individual is having new experiences, is 
learning new aspects of the world. The early life of the 
child must be economised, useless knowledge eliminated
-P-A-G-E-105
              100 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
and economical methods of learning used, so as to give 
plenty of time for mastery of the material world in all 
its various phases. . . 
The Organization of Experience.—Since we get expe- 
rience through the senses, the getting of experience is 
determined by the circumstances of life, by the place _ 
where we live and the time when we live.\ The boy on 
the mountain has mountain experience; the boy on the 
plain has plain experience. Boys that lived at a certain 
time and were at a certain place, witnessed the Battle 
of Gettysburg, others saw Lincoln, others saw Wash- 
ington, others witnessed the San Francisco earthquake. 
The organisation of experience, however, is independ- 
ent in some measure, of the original order of expert 
ence. We get experience as the chances of life deter- 
mine. In accordance with the law of association, things 
are bound together which have been experienced to 
gether. But things which we have experienced together 
may have for us no useful connection. Chance may 0 
termine that I see a rattlesnake and hear a hoot owl 4 
the same time, but this connection of the two may 
have no use for me. We can organise our experien® 
by thinking it over in helpful relations. The importat' 
idea for me to have when I see a rattler, is not of a 
owl but that the snake may bite me and that its bite 
is poisonous. Out of the raw material of the day's & 
perience, we reconstruct a useful world, the world that 
concerns us. The objective world is not lawless. The 
order in it determines the order of our ideas. But cet 
tain relations in the world are more important to @ 
than others. We therefore reorganise the world bY 
thinking over our experience in the relations that at 
important vto us. The causal relation is usually m 
\ \, 
\ a3
-P-A-G-E-106
IDEATIONAL LEARNING : 101 
important to us. The causal sequences exist in nature, 
and it is best for us to fix them in memory by repeated 
thinking of the ideas in the causal sequence. But many 
things that happen together have no causal relation, as 
my seeing the snake and hearing the owl. Repeated 
. xperience on our part is necessary to enable us to dis- 
tinguish true causality from mere accidental concomi- 
tance. Older people, as our parents and teachers who 
have had more experience, can be of great service to us 
in the organisation of our experience. They can point 
out to us the important relationships and aid us in es- 
tablishing them in the sequence of our ideas through 
repetition. 
Getting Knowledge.—To live in this world we must 
be able to control it. To control it, we must have knowl- 
edge of it. Since some aspects of the world are more 
important to us than others, some knowledge is more 
inportant than other knowledge. One function of the 
School is to help the child to get and organise useful 
knowledge, such as knowledge of the mechanical, phys- 
ical and chemical aspects of the world; knowledge about 
animals and plants, knowledge about the human body— 
its organs and their functions, how to keep healthy, 
how to keep strong,—civic and social knowledge. Just 
What this knowledge should be in detail we shall not 
here enquire. We want simply to get a general view 
of it. The child must learn certain aspects of the world 
to enable him to control it and to direct his life in it. 
question we wish to raise here is how we can eco- 
nomically get this knowledge. 
But first let us recall fully the nature of Imowledge. 
Knowledge consists in the names of things coupled to « 
the ideas of the things and the functions or uses of the
-P-A-G-E-107
102 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
things coupled to the names. These we must know. , 
From infancy the process of getting this knowledge 
goes on. The child learns how to move about in its 
little world, learns what will hurt it and what will not, 
what it can manipulate and what, not. Year after year 
more and more knowledge is added until at maturity we 
have usable knowledge about most material things. Our 
method of getting all this knowledge is through per- 
ception. There is no other way. We see the objects 
of the world, touch them, taste them, smell them. 
hear them. We note their actions. We experiment 
with them and thereby learn their characteristics and 
their ways of reacting. We wish, for example, to learn 
the various factors that determine the germination of 
seeds. We therefore try to germinate seeds under all 
possible conditions, without air, without moisture, with- 
out heat, and with various combinations of these factors 
and with various degrees of these three factors. As 4 
result of our experiment, we learn the factors that are 
necessary for germination, All our basic knowledge of 
the world must be got either by careful observation of 
phenomena as we meet them or from the results of 
carefully planned experiments. The child must be 
taught not only to be a close observer, but a critical 
erver, a 
Vari of Experience}The process of getting 
knowledge and of organising knowledge is constantly 
one of analysis. In the first place our notion of quali- 
ties and all abstract characteristics comes through 4 
process of analysis, and analysis is possible through - 
experiencing things in a great variety of relationships. 
We get the idea of redness by experiencing different 
things of different sizes and shapes having this chat 
tna pein en ee
-P-A-G-E-108
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 103 
acteristic. We get the notion of triangularity, of 
squareness, of roundness, etc., in a similar way. From 
avariety of experiences our general notions crystallize 
out. The world at first is largely unitary. Every day 
of our life, it falls apart into its separate parts, and the 
parts into their separate characteristics. The relation- 
ships among the parts grow ever more subtle and intri- 
cate, As we grow older, bonds are possible between 
ideas that were not possible before because the ideas 
did not and could not exist for us before. 
\Meaning —The most important thing about an idea is 
its meaning. The meaning of an idea is another idea 
Closely associated with it. Since an idea may have 
Many such associations, it may have many meanings. 
The most important meaning of an idea is the use to 
Which the thing represented by it may be put. Of all 
the things that the idea of an object may bring to our 
tind, what most concerns us is what we can do with 
the thing, how we can make it serve our purposes, how 
it is likely to affect us, whether it will harm us or do 
us good. \ 
Ice ig cold, hard, slick. It may be used to keep our _ 
food cool in the refrigerator, to cool our drinking water, 
for making ice cream, ete. A pencil is a thing made of 
Wood, with lead inside, but more important, it is a 
thing with which I can write a letter. An ax is a thing 
used for chopping, a saw for sawing, a fork for con- 
veying food to the mouth. Shakespeare was a drama- 
tist; Longfellow, a poet. Sympathy is feeling with 
another. The meaning of an idea is, then, another idea 
that represents some characteristic, some relation, some 
Use. Most of our knowledge is knowledge of meanings. 
Most of our progress in knowledge consists in learning 
5
-P-A-G-E-109
104 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
new meanings. The development or growth of the 
meanings of the same thing are almost unlimited. A 
flower to a child is not the same thing that it is toa 
man or woman, and far from the same thing that it 
_ is to a technical botanist. To the child it may bea 
pretty thing that has an agreeable odor; to the botanist, 
it may still be this and in addition a means of develop- 
ing seeds for propagation. A stone may be to a boy 
. merely a thing to be thrown at a dog, to the geologist 
it tells a long story about a most interesting past. Long 
and intimate experience with objects reveals meanings 
before undreamed of, subtle relationships, resemblances 
before unnoticed. How different from ours is the bota- 
the world take on to the mathematician, the physicist, the chemist, the geologist, the zoologist, the psycholo- gist! How different is the world of the farmer from that of the banker or merchant! 
As the.years go by we severally build up for our 
selves our own particular kind of world with meanings 
suitable to our needs and uses. To the doctor it be 
comes a world of disease; to the preacher, a world of 
' sin; to the physicist, it is a world of forces. At bok 
tom, it is all the same world, but we have seized upoa 
different aspects of it and thereby narrowed our inter- 
est in it, and circumscribed our knowledge of it. This 
course is necessary, because since we of necessity must 
deal with and manipulate different aspects of the world, 
we must know these aspects with more fullness than 
we know other aspects that do not direetly concern us. 
Trouble comes when we forget that our world is only 
a partial world and not the whole world. I may be nist’s notion of a plant! What different aspects does

-P-A-G-E-110
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 105 
ested in the bottom. I may be interested only in the 
outside of things; others are interested in the inside. 
It takes both top and bottom, both outside and inside to 
make the whole. 
The school should help the child to organise the world 
with reference to useful meanings. The child should 
always be asking the question, what does this thing 
mean? What is its true significance? What caused it? 
What will it cause? What is its relation to other things? 
In history, for example, what are the causes? What 
results follow? What are the underlying movements? 
What does Socrates mean? What, Napoleon? What, 
Lincoln? What means the Renaissance? What, the 
French Revolution? In literature, what means Oedipus 
Tyrannus? Macbeth? King Lear? Othello? Romola? 
The Scarlet Letter? 
_ A defect in our acquiring knowledge and meanings 
's that often we get the knowledge in an abstract, iso- 
lated sort of way apart from the real situations of life. 
As a result, we do not really have knowledge of an actual world, we do not have clear comprehension, and. 
when situations arise when the knowledge would be 
available, the right idea does not readily come to us 
because the knowledge was not learned in connection 
with that particular kind of situation, consequently 
the situation often fails to arouse the right association. 
_ Reasoning Specific.—Is reasoning capacity general or 
88 it specific? Can we speak of a person being a good 
Yeasoner in general or do we have to say he is a good 
Teasoner in such and such fields and a poor reasoner 
in other fields? These questions can: pe answered in 
the light of the facts already given. ince reasoning y 
depends upon experience, one can_ not reason_inufields
-P-A-G-E-111
106 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
where. he has had no experience, One may have knowl- 
edge ever so extensive in other fields, but if he have no 
botanical knowledge he can not reason in the field of 
botany. There are some aspects of reasoning, how- 
ever, that are in a measure general. There are certain 
criteria for the testing of truth that are of general 
validity. The assumption that a phenomenon always 
has a. cause is one that can be made in all fields. The 
practice of being cautious, of waiting until all the facts 
are examined is of general validity, as is also that of 
putting a conclusion to the practical test of experiment. 
‘Training in reasoning must, therefore, be rather spe 
cific. If one wishes to be a great reasoner in the field ot 
physics, he must get a large experience in that field. 
- He must learn all the laws and principles and be familiar 
with the methods of the science. One can be trained 
in reasoning, (1) in getting a wide experience in the 
field wherein he is to reason, (2) in the matter of be 
ing cautious and waiting to examine all the facts, and 
(8) in putting the conelusion to the practical test 
experiment or experience. 
Measuring Reasoning Capacity—How well one cat 
reason, or how well one can learn to reason depends 
. upon hereditary factors as well as upon experience 
“sPeople of the same experience have different capacity 
to reason. Some people, by reason of inheritance, see 
able to know what is significant, what relations are im 
portant, while other people have little ability to se 
relative values, and it seems they can never lear to 
_ doit. Our ability to reason, then, has certain hereditary 
limitations. Since reasoning depends so largely upd 
experience and since few people have had anything 
like the same experience, its measurement is difficult,
-P-A-G-E-112
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 107 
and can be accomplished only approximately. How well 
one has established certain logical relationships, is to a 
considerable extent indicative of one’s ability to reason. 
The measurement of these verbal relationships is then, 
in a measure, a measurement of reasoning capacity.. 
Such is accomplished by the opposites test, the genus- 
species test, the part-whole test, and other similar tests, 
also by the analogies test. Certain tests, as those of 
Bonser, have been specifically devised to test reasoning 
capacity. Specific reasoning tests are likely to have the 
defect that they demand specific experience and train- 
ing; for example, problems in arithmetic are good meas- 
ures of reasoning capacity only if those measured have 
had equal opportunity to learn the principles of arith- Tnetic, 
Verbatim Learning.—Learning the actual words of a 
Section is a task not often required of people gen- 
erally, but in all grades of school some verbatim learn- 
ing is necessary. Experiments have shown that learn- 
ing by small bits, a line at a time or a few lines at a 
time, is not the most economical way. There is a sav- 
ing of time in the learning of either prose or verse by 
Working on a large segment at a time, reading this 
rge segment clear through from beginning to end till 
the part is learned. In the experimental work it ap- 
Peared that there is a saving in the whole method on 
Selections up to one 240 lines in length, as compared to 
earning the same selections by small bits or the part 
method. No experimenter has used selections longer - 
than 240 lines. / 
Each of the two methods, however, has its advan- 
tages and disadvantages. If a selection is divided into 
Parts and each of the parts learned, and the time for
-P-A-G-E-113
108 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
learning the separate parts added, it is found usually 
to be less than the time for learning the selection by — 
the whole method. But after the selection is learned 
in parts, it takes more time to cement the parts to 
‘gether, so that the total is greater than the time re. 
quired by the whole method. The weakness of the 
whole method is that it is difficult to maintain a high 
degree of attention throughout a long selection. Fur- 
thermore, there is much over learning. Some parts are 
learned long before the others. In spite of both of 
these factors, the whole method proved more econom- 
ical. A combination of the two methods in a way to 
utilise the good points of each is probably to be recon 
mended in practice, such a combination, for example, a8 
learning a segment of several lines, then another; 0 
casionally going over it from the beginning as far 48 
learned, and also occasionally going through the entire 
selection. 
The experimental work on which the preceding state 
ments are based, was done with meaningful material in 
prose and verse. Pechstein has recently reported that 
with nonsense material, the part method is the best, 
and gets favorable results by a combination of the two 
methods. 
How to Study.—When a student sits down to study a 
lesson, how should he proceed? Of course, the answet 
depends somewhat on the kind of lesson, whether in 
chemistry, history, or mathematics, for example. Get 
erally, a lesson contains but a few facts or principles. 
The student should first read through the assignment 
as a whole to get the general drift of the argument or 
description, then he should go back and pick out the
-P-A-G-E-114
IDEATIONAL LEARNING 109 
essentials, As a rule, one should underline in the text 
the crucial, fundamental statements, so as to make it 
easy to turn through the pages and get the funda- 
mental thoughts. The student should make sure of 
what the author says, of the meaning and of its sig- 
nificance. He should always put the question: What 
does this mean? Especially, What does it mean to me? 
The author should be translated into the understanding 
and experience of the student. In reading a book, it 
should always be our task to find out the author’s mean- 
ing. Certainly we should not attempt to criticise be- 
fore we know what the author means, The student 
should early learn to discriminate between fact and 
theory or opinion, and should always note carefully 
Whether an author is giving facts, or the author's 
opinions, or the opinions of some one else. Unfortu- 
nately many people go through life without learning to 
criminate between a fact and an opinion. 
EXPERIMENTS AND EXERCISES. 
1. Association. The object of this experiment is to 
. Make a study of the factors that determine the con- 
hection of ideas. In a class experiment nothing beyond 
illustration should be attempted. The free association 
experiment will serve well enough for this purpose. The 
instructor should prepare a list of words, then pro- 
Nounce them one at a time to the class. When a word 
8 pronounced the students are to write down the first 
Word that comes to their minds. Let the students de- 
termine the factors operative in the case of each word, 
Considering recency, primacy, frequency, intensity, 
mental set and emotional factors. The experiment 
thould make it clear that there is nothing in the nature
-P-A-G-E-115
110 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
of ideas as such that bind them together, that the way 
in which they become bound together is a matter of 
_ experience. 
2. Reasoning. The object of this experiment is to 
show that reasoning depends primarily upon experience 
and the ability to recall the experience when it is 
needed. The instructor should prepare a number of 
problems and questions for solution and answer. The 
following will serve as examples: If a rope were 
stretched entirely around the earth at the equator and 
then lengthened six feet, how much space would there 
be between the earth and rope, supposing the distance 
to be made equal all around? Suppose three inch-cit- 
cles are tangent, each to the other two, what is the 
area of the space between the circles? Suppose a bar of iron is riveted to a similar bar of copper and the 
combined bar is then heated in the middle, which way 
will it bend? If a metal ball four inches in diameter 
weigh 50 pounds, how large must a ball of the same 
‘ metal be to weigh 100 founds? If a cube of ice weigh 
ing ten pounds melts in an hour, how long will be re 
quired for a twenty-pound cube to melt, the tempera 
ture of the surrounding air being the same? 
Give the above and similar problems to the students 
and let each report on the reasoning processes that fol- 
low. When a problem can not be solved, determine 
whether it is because of lack of experience or inability 
to recall the experience. 
8. “Knowledge consists in the association of the 
name of a thing with the idea of the thing, or the funt- 
tion or some characteristic of a thing with the name 
or idea of the thing.” Let the student verify this state 
ment by an examination of various kinds of knowledge. '

4, Give several illustrations showing the difference 
between primary and secondary experience. 
5, Make a study of meaning by getting the responses 
of students to various characters in literature and his- 
tory and to objects in nature. Put the questions as 
follows: Who was Caesar? Pericles? Shakespeare? 
Hamlet? Othello? Antigone? What is sulphur? 
Iron? Platinum? Heliotrope? Water? Oxygen? 
The experiment should show that the same person or 
thing may have different meanings to different people. 
Interesting facts are learned by reading short bits of 
literature to the class and having each student give his 
interpretation. 
6. “All knowledge of function and characteristics is 
analytic.” Let the student verify this statement by an 
examination of many different kinds of knowledge. 
; 7. The instructor can measure the reasoning capac- 
ity of the members of the class by giving several con- 
trolled association tests, several completion tests, and 
by giving specific problems. The elements needed in 
the solution of the problems must have been within 
the experience of the students. In exercise 2 above, 
the problems may very well go outside the experience 
of the students, but in a study of reasoning ability, the 
Problems must be within the experience of the students. 
The best reasoner is he who makes the best use of his 
experience. 
8. In Chapter VI, the students are asked to apply the 
’ facts of the chapter to the habit-formation aspects of 
the public school curriculum. Make a similar applica- 
tion of the facts of this chapter to the ideational learn- 
ing involved in the public school branches. Show, for 
example, that in history, the child is learning the names
-P-A-G-E-117
112 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
of people and places and the causes and consequences 
of events. The students should carefully work out the 
knowledge aspects of each school study.

CHAPTER VII. 
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE. 
ing and Memory.—Learning would be impossi- 
ble without memory. To learn means to become 
changed, different from what we were before. If the 
difference is not retained, at least for some length of 
time, then we have not learned. Learning and memory 
each involves the other. To learn means that we must 
have memory; to remember means we must have 
learned. : 
Memory—the retention of experience—is one of the 
most remarkable facts of human life. Any bit of ex- 
Perience leaves us different from what we were before. 
Every new habit, every repetition of an old habit, every 
bit of new knowledge, makes us a somewhat different 
Person. This is because we are the sum of our exper!- 
ences and tendencies; because we are the result of our 
accumulated experience. 
It is memory alone that puts meaning into life. A 
Merely perceptual life would be meaningless. Every 
Perception arouses ideas which have resulted frem past 
€xperience, and which give the perception meaning. The 
Importance of memory, the part it plays in life, is at 
once evident when one tries to imagine what life would 
be without it. If every new experience were to us as 
if it were our first, if it called forth no echoes of a 
Past, it would not really be experience. Experience 
must have a longitudinal dimension as well as a trans- 
Verse one. It consists in a union of past and present) 
(21131

114 + THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Learning and memory are really different aspects of 
the same thing. To learn means to become different. 
To remember means to retain the difference. Much of 
the experimental work in memory might well be called 
studies of learning, and many learning experiments 
might well be called studies in memory. It is all a mat- 
ter of emphasis. In this chapter we are to consider 
those facts which bear more especially on the retention 
of experience. We shall use the term memory ina general sense as synonymous with the expression 
retention of experience. . 
‘Memory and Age.—Ability to retain experience, 28 
far as it can be measured by experimental means, im- 
proves with age from the earliest time in childhood 
when such measurements are possible, up to maturity 
or near maturity. Of course, retention is different with different aspects of experience, but age brings improve 
ment in all aspects. If we show children a number of 
objects, a number of pictures of objects, a number of 
names of objects, or a number of abstract words, and 
then determine later how well the experience is re 
tained, we find that it is better with each succeeding 
year till near maturity. If we read a story to children, 
and later determine how well the story is retained, we 
find retention better up to near maturity. There seems 
little increase in ability to retain experience after about 
thirteen years of age. In fact experiments often show 
a falling off of ability to reproduce stories during the 
high school age. It is quite likely that this apparent 
decrease in memory capacity is due to a certain atti- 
tude of the subjects and not to any decrease in retentive 
capacity. In the earlier years, children reproduce, pat 
rot-like, stories read to them, without discrimination.

THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 115 
Older children reproduce only the salient facts, through 
habit omitting details. This attitude results in a lower 
seore. A careful study of all the experimental work 
in this field leads one to the conclusion that retentivity, 
as far as it can be measured by experiments, improves 
considerably to about the age of adolescence, then more 
slowly to the age of physical maturity. There is no 
undoubted evidence of a decline of retentivity before 
middle age. Improvement in retention due to age is 
shown in tables 5, 6, and 7:

ciency of boys and girls is shown for the different ages 
from eight to eighteen. The comparison is show 
graphically in figures 18 and 14. It can be seen from 
the tables that girls are better in rote memory at every 
age except nine, in concrete rote memory. Here the 
boys excel by a hundredth of a word. While the girls, 
with this one exception, are uniformly better, the dif 
ference is very small. The average yearly improvement 
of boys from nine to eighteen is 3.94%, while that of 
girls is 4.08%. The large gain shown for the boys in 
concrete rote memory from eight to nine is doubt 
less spurious, due to the inaccuracy of measuring eight 
year-old boys. 
In logical memory, as determined by using The Mar- 
ble Statue test, the girls are better at every age from 
eight to eighteen. And university women are bette 
than university men. It must be said, however, that # 
tests of logical memory, the results depend upon the 
kind of material used. This may be true of rote met 
ory as well. In The Farmer’s Son test used by the 
author, boys are better from eleven to fifteen. The 
author used three tests of logical memory, one 
Willie’s Dog in the lower grades, one called The Far 
mer’s Son in the upper grades, and one called Costl# 
Temper in the high school. There are records for ag 
13 in all three tests. In the Willie’s Dog and Cost 
Temper tests girls are better at age 13, while in the 
Farmer’s Son test, at the same age, boys are better. At 
age 18, the average score for boys in the three tests 
is 38.46, and for girls, 39.57. There are so many factof 
effective in learning, which have their influence on © 
tention, that it is difficult for us to compare the rete 
tion of girls and boys. We can say that in any give
-P-A-G-E-124
ee 
g THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 119 
test one sex is better than the other, but whether it is 
better because of better retentive capacity or because 
of difference in attitude, attention, interest, or famil- 
jarity of the material, it is difficult to say. However, 
in the extensive experimental work in memory, the 
superiority of girls over boys is so general that we are — 
warranted in concluding that they have a better re- 
tentive capacity. 
Some experimenters have reported boys as having 
better retention in certain fields of memory. Mulhall, 
for example, reports boys as having better memory for 
form, and cites Chamberlain as having found no sex 
difference. But both these experimenters make their 
Comparisons by grade and not by age. Now, in the 
Same grade the boys average older than the girls. An 
equate sex comparison should be made by age, not 
by grade, Several writers have stated conclusions 
a ut sex differences, with this same error entering into 
thelr calculations. However, even if we are careful to 
Make sex comparisons by age and not by grade, we may 
€xpect to find boys superior if they are favored by 
ether material or interest, i. e., if the experience of 
wait, makes a certain material used in the test more 
table to them than to girls. It seems clear, how- 
ever, as stated above, that if we rule out the influences 
lue to differences in experience and interest, the reten- 
n of girls is better than that of boys. 
Girls have better retention than boys, but do women 
me men? Gates, basing his conclusion on an exami- 
tae Mm psychology, finds women better than men in 
immediate and delayed recall. It is possible that 
Women had spent more time in study, and remem- 
better because they had learned better. In the
-P-A-G-E-125
120 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
author’s experiments, men and women were on an 
equality as far as opportunity of learning was con 
cerned, for in both rote and logical memory, the mate 
rial was presented to both men and women in the same 
manner, at the same time. In concrete rote memory 
38 university men make a score of 28.5, and 61 univer- 
sity women make a score of 28.6. With abstrac 
words, 40 men make ascore of 28.4, and 61 women 
make a score of 27.9. There is but little difference, the 
women excelling by one-tenth of a word in the test 
with concrete words and the men excelling by five 
tenths of a word in abstract rote memory. 
In logical memory, with The Marble Statue as mate 
rial, 65 university men make a score of 38.3, and 8 
university women make a score of 40.1. The womel 
have a superiority of 1.8 words, or 4.7%. There B 
the possibility that this story makes a stronger 4 
to women than it does to men. The difference betweet 
boys and girls with this same test is nearly twice # 
great. The average score of boys from 8 to 18 is 
while the average score for girls is 35.9, a difference 
' 2.9 words, or 8.7%. The comparison of boys with gs 
is based on tests of 1215 boys and 1364 girls. | 
Briefly, in summary: The retention of girls is bett# | 
than that of boys because of their more rapid develo 
‘ment. At maturity, there is no clearly demonstra 
sex difference not due to experience, training oF 
tude. 
Effect of Practice.—Can we improve memory 
practice? We are constantly having experience, 
consequently have constant practice in retention. 
have as much practice in retention as we do in 
tion. Sensation does not need, in ordinary cases,
-P-A-G-E-126
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 121 
dal exercise to develop it. Will special exercise in 
memorising permanently improve the retentive capac- 
ity of the brain? James, some thirty years ago, an- 
swered this question as follows: ‘All improvement of 
the memory lies in the line of elaborating the asso- 
ciates of each of the several things to be remembered. 
No amount of culture would seem capable of modifying 
a man’s general retentivenes. This is a physiological 
quality, given once for all with his organization, and 
which he can never hope to change”’.* The great 
amount of experimental work in memory gives us no 
teason for modifying James’ statement. The experi- 
ments do prove beyond doubt, however, that we can 
greatly improve our ability to memorise. In all kinds 
of materia) at least some improvement comes through 
Practice, from the learning of nonsense syllables on the 
one hand to the learning of the logical material of a 
k on the other. But that this improvement is in 
any sense due to an improvement of the retentiv- 
ity of the brain it would be difficult to prove. 
Winch using consonants as material, presenting them 
‘sually and later in another experiment, auditorially, 
ound an improvement in ability to memorise, due to 
Practice. Bolton using digits as material, also found 
provement from practice. Miller and Schumann 
ound an improvement in ability to memorise nonsense

experiment was conducted as follows: About a 
of material was read to the subject, who then re- 
| Peated all the ideas he could recall. The selection was 
read again, and the ideas reported. This pro-

cedure was continued till the subject could report all 
the ideas of the selection. After three months of prac 
tice, the subject could memorise in fifteen minutes an 
amount of material that required an hour at the begin- 
ning of the experiment. The improvement doubtless 
depended upon an improvement in methods of getting 
and organising the facts, and in an increased famil- 
iarity with the matter discussed in the book used as 
material. Improvement in memorising comes with so 
little practice and in so short a time that it is absurd 
to believe that the retentivity of the brain could be 
affected. . 
However, we must not forget that we can tremen- 
dously improve our ability to fix our experience so that 
it will be retained. We can become immensely bettet 
at remembering not because we have changed the bran 
8o that it retains simple impressions better than before 
through better attention, better and more repetition, 
better and more associations, we so organise our & perience that it is much more lasting than if got 7 
poorer methods. Poor retention is usually due to pot 
__ attention, lack of repetition, poor organisation. We 
improve retention by improving these factors. The Po | 
sibility of improvement in memorising is much greater 
in logical material, connected ideas, than it is with dt 
crete material, as letters, words, nonsense material, be | 
cause of the greater possibility of organisation 00

-P-A-G-E-128
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 123 
results of the experiments are in accord. The work of 
Miller and Schumann, Ogden, Henderson, Norsworthy, 
Lyon and the author leads to one conclusion: in general, 
the fast learner is also good in retention. This is espe- 
cially true with logical material, such as prose and 
Poetry. The experimenters used all kinds of material, 
honsense syllables, words, digits, and selections in prose 
andverse. We give some typical results. 
. In the author’s experiments, each subject learned the 
ideas in 21 separate segments of prose material. The 
Segments were of equal length, each containing 40 
ideas. The procedure was to read the matter to the 
subject till all the ideas could be reproduced. The num- 
ber of readings was taken as the score. Twenty-four hours later a written reproduction was required, and 
the number of ideas correctly reproduced was taken 
48 the score. The results were as follows:

_ The quickest learner is F, the slowest is K. Sub- 
lect. F requires only 55.7% as many repetitions as K, 
but Tetains 11% more ideas. It will be noticed that 
ere is less difference in retention as measured by the 
| absolute amount that could be reproduced than there 
is in learning. There is general agreement among all 
"perimenters on this point. 
Norsworthy found that the students who learned the 
Steatest number of words in a German-English vocabu- 
In a given time, retained the largest percentage of 
at had been learned. The most extensive work on
-P-A-G-E-129
124 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
this problem was done by Lyon. He used three dif- 
ferent methods of testing retention. (1) The first was 
by the absolute amount retained. (2) The second was 
by the amount reproduced after hearing the material 
read once again. (3) The third was by the amount of 
time taken to relearn the material. Using method 1 
as the criterion of retention, we find the fast learners 
are the best in retention in all forms of material used, 
poetry, prose, nonsense syllables, words, and digits. 
Using method 2 as our criterion, we find the fast learn 
ers the best in retention except in the case of digits 
But by using method 3 as our test of retention, we find 
the fast. learners the best in retention in the case of 
logical material, prose and poetry, only. By all the 
tests of retention, the fast learners show up the poor 
est in retention in the case of the digits. The greatest 
variability in learning time was shown in the case of 
digits. Commenting on his results, Lyon says: “Tak 
-ing all three methods into consideration, we are & 
titled to say that with material that is logical in chat 
acter, those who learn quickly remember the longett 
With digits, however, we find the conditions, so far 8 
method 8 is concerned, reversed, for here it is the 
quick learners who seem to forget the most. One 
might make the inference that those who learn slowly 
remember long, if the material used is such as involve 
motor associations, but that they forget quickly if the 
material is logical in character.” Lyon found that, & 
far as method 8 was concerned, nonsense syllables gave 
the same sort of results as prose material, and that 
words gave the same sort of results as digits. For this 
apparently strange result, Lyon has “no satisfactory 
explanation to offer.”

THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 125 
An experiment performed in the author’s laboratory 
confirms the results given above. The material used 
was nonsense syllables, 25 in a series. The procedure 
was to learn the series at one sitting, by repeating the 
syllables to the stroke of a metronome, then relearning 
them on the second and succeeding days until they could 
be said from memory twenty-four hours after the last 
learning. The number of repetitions required to learn 
the syllables the first time is called the learning time. 
The total number of repetitions at the different sit- 
tings is called the total learning time. The ratio is 
found by dividing the total learning time by the first 
leaming time. As a rule, those who are quick in first 
learning are quick also in relearning.

_ Another experiment somewhat similar gives results 
mharmony with those given above. The author gave 
a logical memory test to about 2000 school children in 
Stades three to eight. Whipple’s Marble Statue was 
read to the pupils and an immediate reproduction re- 
quired. One month later a second reproduction was 
alled for. Standing in the immediate memory test was 
‘orrelated with standing in the retention test taken one 
Tonth later, the correlation being computed by grades. 
le 4 relations by the Pearson formula ranged from 
80.

126 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
The evidence seems conclusive that quick learning 
and good retention are positively related. However, 
the relation’ is not simple and there are many things 
that must be taken into consideration. If slow learning 
is due not to poor learning capacity but to caution and 
care in learning, then slow learning will be coupled 
with good retention. On the other hand, if the quick 
learning is at the same time poor learning, it will be 
coupled with poor retention. The factors that make 
person a good learner are the factors that will make 
him good at retention, a high degree of attention and 
_ Concentration, quick and accurate apprehension, quick 
grasp of meaning and significance, organisation of m+ 
terial through schemes of meaning and association. 
The reason that a quick learner often seems to remelr 
ber poorly is because he is content with poor learning 
and especially because he does not take advantage 
the value that comes from repetition. In comparing 
the retention of different individuals we should always 
take into consideration the quality and method | 
learning. It is worth noting that in Lyon’s extensiv 
experiments, he found not a single case of a consistently 
good learner who was consistently poor at retentiot. 
There is little doubt that Lyon would have found still | 
stronger evidence of the positive relationship of Jeart- | 
ing and remembering if he had used a different criteria 
of learning. Some of his subjects doubtless had the 
material better learned than others. 
Memory Material.—-Memory of objects or pictures of 
objects serially presented is better than memory fot 
the names of objects either seen or heard. Typical 
sults are those of Calkins shown in the following table

  Tt will be seen that the pictures of objects are re- 
membered much better than the names of objects either 
seen or heard, and that in delayed memory more than 
twice as many pictures of objects are recalled as 
names of objects heard. Patterson compared memory 
for objects seen with memory for words seen and words 
heard. The results for immediate memory were: words 
heard, 6.85; words seen, 6.92; objects seen, 8.28. The 
ratio of objects seen to words heard is 1.209 to1. By 
comparison with the table above it is seen that objects 
ies femembered somewhat better than pictures of ob- 
The educational inferences to be made from these 
facts are obvious. Visual illustrations by means of 
drawings or pictures will:be helpful, and demonstra- 
tions by means of the actual objects will be of the high- 
est value, 
As for other types of material: digits are remem- 
bered better than consonants; meaningful words better 
han meaningless words; related words better than 
Tonrelated words; material that submits itself to 
srouping better than that which does not; lists of con- 
‘rete words better than lists of abstract words. In the 
author's study of the rote memories of 2654 boys and 
2744 girls, it was found that the boys remembered 7.3% 
More concrete words than abstract words, while the 
Sirls remembered 5.7% more. : 
Manner of Presentation.—The effect on memory of 
the form and manner of presenting the material for
-P-A-G-E-133
128 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
learning has not been determined beyond doubt. We 
shall not, therefore, go into a detailed discussion of the 
numerous experiments. A very general statement will 
suffice. On the one hand we find Meumann, Miinster- 
herg and Bigham, Pohlmann, Smedley, and others 
claiming on the basis of their experiments that visual 
presentation is better in the case of children, especially 
with meaningless material. On the other hand, Kem- 
sies, Hawkins, Von Sybyl, and Henmon find auditory 
presentation better. 
There are evidently many factors entering into the 
problem, particularly the kind of material and the age 
of the subjects, as well as the habits and training of the 
subjects, possibly also their ideational type. For e 
ample, Pohlmann and others find auditory presentation 
best for significant material, and visual best for meal 
ingless material. Henmon found the auditory preset 
tation best for nouns, nonsense syllables, and numbers. 
But his subjects were six adults. He did not exper 
ment with children. | 
Several experimenters find that memory is better if 
the material is presented to both vision and audition 
Others find little or no advantage by such presentation. 
Some have reported that if the subject .is allowed t 
articulate the learning material in addition to hearing 
and seeing it, memory is better. Others report no ad- 
vantage. 
Unfortunately, although the question of the most 
favorable method of presenting material to different 
ages of pupils and for different kinds of material is a0 
important one for education, it awaits the solution of 
a future experimenter. The solution can come only 
. from a careful consideration and isolation of all the 
factors involved.

SARE THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 129 
Length of Series.—What is the relation of memory 
to the amount learned at one time? Strong’s studies of 
advertising showed the importance of the length of 
series, i. e., of the number of impressions at one time. 
He found that if only five advertisements were shown 
at one time, the subject could recognise 86% of them 
immediately afterward, while if 150 were shown, only 
41% could be recognized immediately afterward. The 
per cent. of correct recognitions decreased as the length 
of the series increased. In Strong’s experiments we 
have evidence of the relation of retentiveness to the- 
number of impressions; in the earlier experiments of 
Ebbinghaus, we have evidence of the relation of the 
time of memorising to the amount to be memorised. 
Ebbinghaus could memorise a series of seven syllables 
M one repetition, but a series of twelve syllables re- 
quired on the average 16.6 repetitions. Series of 16, 
24, and 86 syllables required respectively 30, 44 and 55 
Tepetitions. While 12 syllables were learned in a little 
over 16 repetitions, a series of 24, or twice as many, 
tequired not 38 repetitions, but 44 repetitions. As the 
length of series is lengthened beyond one’s memory 
Span, the learning time is enormously increased at 
first, then more slowly. The results from the experi- 
ments of Ebbinghaus and Strong are shown in tables 
ll and 12.

Several other psychologists have repeated the experi- 
ments of Ebbinghaus, and have also used other mate 
rial—digits, prose, and poetry. The experimenters 
.were Binet and Henri, Meumann, Henmon, and more recently, Lyon. In Table 13 are shown the results of 
some of their work in parallel columns for comparison. 
Lyon’s results are shown in Tables 14, 15 and 16. Lyon 
used two methods of learning. One he calls the “cor 
tinuous” method, and the other, the “once-aday’ method. In the former, all the learning was done at 
one sitting. In the latter, the learning was done at the 
rate of one reading a day. The results show the latter 
much the better way to learn, especially in the case of 
non-meaningful material. , 
A careful study of all the tables shows that the diff- 
culty of learning increases when the length of the m& 
terial is increased. How much does it increase? 
the increasing difficulty is in proportion to the increas? 
in length, then the number of repetitions will remala 
constant, and the time will increase as the length. Thi* 
is not the case. There is a general increase in the num 
ber of repetitions, showing that the difficulty increases 
more than the length increases. On the other hand, 
the number of repetitions does not increase in propor 
tion to the increase in length. The increase in number 
of repetitions is greater than the increase in length at   
 
-P-A-G-E-136
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 131 
first and then much less when the learning is done at 
the rate of one reading a day. When the learning was 
all done at one sitting the added length increased the 
difficulty more than when the learning was spread out. 
In Table 15 it is seen that 8 syllables require two repe- 
titions. Sixteen syllables require not four repetitions, 
but 28. On the other hand, 32 syllables require not 46 
repetitions, but only 24. 
The results in the tables show some irregularities and 
discrepancies due to individual differences, differences 
in material and in some cases to difference in method. 
All the results agree in showing that: increasing length 
of material increases the difficulty of learning. They 
disagree as to what the law of this increase is. 
The educational importance of the facts shown by 
these experiments is very great. From the point of 
view of the economy of learning and memory, the num- 
ber of impressions received at one time should be few. 
Ifina lecture, for example, too many ideas are pre-

V4 eee .    Forgetting.—As soon as we learn we begin to forget. 
It is well to know the rate of this forgetting, its prog- 
ress for different materials, and the laws that seem to 
control it. The experimental work of chief importance 
here is that of Ebbinghaus, Radossawljewitsch, and 
  Fiovre 15. The solid line is a logarithmic curve. The broken line 
is a forgetting curve constructed from the actual data, 
Finkenbinder. The results of these three investigators 
are shown in table 17. The differences in the results 
from the three sources are due to differences in 
method,—differences in method of presentation of the
-P-A-G-E-139
134 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
material and differences in determining when learning 
was completed. The work of Finkenbinder was the 
more accurate. A study of the table and the graphs 
shows that forgetting, in the case of nonsense material, 
is very fast at first and then slower. The fourth col- 
umn in the table gives the figures for a theoretical 
logarithmic curve, which the curve for the nonsense 
syllables as shown in column one approximates. Such 
a curve is shown in Fig. 15, also an actual curve con- 
structed from the data in column 2.

planation of the curve of forgetting.
-P-A-G-E-140
ee NEE THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE. 185 
(1) The rate of forgetting depends on the degree to 
which the material had been learned before the com- 
mencement of the period of forgetting. Overlearning 
makes forgetting slower. 
(2) The rate of forgetting depends on the method 
of learning, i. e., on such matters as the concentration 
and distribution of practice. Distributing learning 
makes forgetting slower; concentrating learning makes 
forgetting faster. 
(8) The rate of forgetting varies with the kind of 
performance in habit-formation, or the kind of material 
in ideational learning. Significant material, for exam- 
ple, is forgotten more slowly than meaningless material. 
(4) The rate of forgetting varies with the method 
by which forgetting is measured. Bean thinks forget- 
ting is faster if measured by the reproduction method, 
slower if measured by the relearning method. 
(5) The rate of forgetting varies with different indi- 
viduals. 
To these factors should be added two others. First, 
the rate of forgetting varies with the amount learned 
at one time. If a small amount is learned, forgetting 
is relatively rapid at first. If a large amount is learned 
at once, forgetting is slower at first. This fact is a 
corollary of (2) above, for learning a large amount 
makes necessary spreading out learning. If twenty- 
four syllables are learned at one time, the learning is 
spread out over much more time than if only twelve- 
syllables are learned. Second, fast learners, with other. 
factors equal, are slow forgetters. 
The main facts of the psychology of forgetting, 
briefly summarised, are as follows: If the material . 
learned is new material, the ratio of what is retained _
-P-A-G-E-141
136 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
to what is forgotten varies inversely as the logarithm 
of the time. This is the conclusion to which Ebbing- 
haus came, and nothing that has since been discovered 
gives any cause to modify the statement. The rate of 
forgetting is different with different materials, differ- 
ent methods, and for different individuals, but it is 
always very fast at first, then slower and slower. 
In Ebbinghaus’ experiments, more than one-third of 
the syllables were forgotten in the first twenty min- 
utes; more than one-half in one hour; nearly two 
thirds in nine hours; more than two-thirds in 24 hours. 
In the experiments of Radossawljewitsch with mean- 
ingful material, one-third was forgotten within two 
days, while one-third of meaningless material was for- 
gotten in one day; one-half of meaningful material was 
forgotten in 7 days, while one-half of meaningless ma- 
terial was forgotten in 6 days. In 30 days three-fourths 
of the meaningful material was forgotten and: four- 
fifths of the.meaningless material. 
Meaningful material is not forgotten as quickly as 
meaningless material, because it is not new material, 
and the learning of it has been going on perhaps for 
years, in some cases, all our lives. The learning of 
meaningful material means merely the re-arrangement 
of what we already know. If we undertake to commit 
to memory Evangeline, we read: “This is the forest 
primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,” ete. 
Neither the words nor the thought is new. This fact 
makes the learning of meaningful material a wholly 
different matter from the learning of meaningless ma 
terial. 
Retention Over Long Periods.—The longest interval 
shown in Table 17 is 120 days. We have now to enquire
-P-A-G-E-142
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 137 
concerning the effect on retention of a much longer, 
interval. We shall consider only the work of Book 
and Swift. The former tested the retention of type- 
writing skill after a lapse of about six months and of 
a year and six months. The original practice had cov-

In the regular practice there had been 50 minutes of 
practice and a ten-minute test each day. In Fig. 16 
are shown the learning curves for these ten-minute 
tests for the last ten days of practice, also for the ten 
ten-minute tests made on ten successive days about six 
months, and a year and six months later. The striking 
thing about this experiment is the quickness with which 
the skill was regained. Although nearly a year and a 
half had passed since the regular practice ceased, in ten 
minutes daily practice for ten days the skill was re 
gained, and an average of 1611 words was made a8 
against an average of 1508 made on the last ten days 
of practice. 
 Swift’s experiments were with ball-tossing. The 
practice was finished on Dec. 11, 1902. Memory tests 
were made in 1903 and 1904, and again Dec. 28, 1908, 
six years and 17 days after practice had ceased. The 
original practice had covered 42 days. In the relearn- 
ing test,.covering 11 days, the original speed was re 
gained and exceeded. A score of 1600 was made a8 
against a score of 1051 in the earlier work. Swift re 
ports that the work was done in the last test “with 
greater skill, greater ease.” 
Swift thinks that such experiments as these prove 
that learning is to some extent a growth, that learning 
goes on after practice has ceased. Book, on the other
-P-A-G-E-144

hand, thinks the facts can be explained by the disap- 
pearance of interfering associations. There is no ques- 
‘ tion in either experiment that forgetting had taken 
place. When Book sat down for his first memory test, 
he had forgotten the key board, but he quickly re- 
learned what he had forgotten. The fact seems to be 
that when learning is carried to a high degree of per- 
fection, when it has required a large number of repe- 
titions, it persists with great tenacity. It may be that 
the associative connections begin to lose strength at 
once, but they can be easily re-established and restored ~ 
to their former strength. 
Hill found that three years after learning mirror 
writing, skill was nearly as good as at the start and 
very soon regained. In three or four days of practice 
the skill originally acquired in 48 days of practice was 
regained. The author has also noted the peculiar per- 
sistence of the ability to do mirror writing once it has 
been mastered. Most people can learn to do mirror writ- 
ing in an hour, try it no more for a year, and then find 
themselves able to do it. 
Perhaps a related fact was that found by Downey 
and Anderson that there is “considerable retention of 
capacity to maintain two processes (reading and writ- 
ing) after lapse of practice for more than two years, 
with a rapid relearning and approximation of one’s last 
record.” However, in both these cases, it is not so 
much a matter of having established a number of 
bonds, as having acquired a principle of procedure or 
attitude, or perhaps a method, a new way of taking the 
world. We learn this and get considerable practice in 
an hour or two, the results of which persist for a long 
time, but perhaps no longer than would a new idea that 
had a similar amount of repetition.
-P-A-G-E-145
140 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Thorndike holds the opinion that associative bonds 
of the neuromuscular kind probably are better retained 
than bonds that are formed in ideational learning, and 
that the explanation is to be found in the fact that the 
bonds connecting ideas have their basis in the later de- 
veloped, more instable parts of the brain. Such may 
be the case, but it is not at all sure. There are on an 
Underwood typewriter 46 keys. Book practiced strik- 
ing these 46 keys for 60 days, an hour a day. For the 
last ten days of practice this gave an average of about 
270 strokes for each key. In the 60 days of practice, 
each key was struck many thousands of times. In 
Swift’s experiments the muscular movements involved 
in keeping two balls in the air were few. These muscu 
lar movements were repeated many thousands of times 
in the 42 days of practice. Owing to the immens? 
amount of repetition in both of these experiments, it 
is no wonder that the bonds persisted. If we should 
practice as much in the case of ideational learning, who 
knows but that the associative bonds would be fully as 
tenacious? Suppose we should take a poem involving 
46 words or 46 ideas and practice saying it for 60 days, 
and then after a year and a half relearn it, the results 
might be much similar to those of the experiments 
mentioned above. The reason why we seem to forget, 
in the case of ideas, faster than is the case in neuro- 
muscular learning, is more probably because in the case 
of ideational learning practice in fixing bonds ig insig- 
nificant in amount when compared to practice in the 
case of motor learning. We study a lesson once, or at 
most, a few times. We hear a lecture once. Perhaps 
the facts of the lecture are reviewed a time or two. We
-P-A-G-E-146
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 141 
could not expect the fixation in such learning to com- 
pare favorably with motor learning involving hundreds, 
perhaps thousands of repetitions. 
The facts available do not enable us to settle the 
matter of the relative persistence of ideational learn- 
ing as compared to motor learning. But the facts do 
enable us to say that the strength of ideational bonds 
could be much increased by more repetition. 
The results of motor learning suggest that great im- 
provement is possible in ideational learning. This im- 
provement is in the direction of association, organiza- 
tion, repetition. Some people seem to have the idea 
that if a thing is well learned once, it is learned for all 
time. Such is not the case. The only way known to 
fix and perpetuate a neural bond of any kind is by repe-~ 
tition. It makes no difference whether the bond is one 
connecting ideas, or stimulus and response, the facts 
are the same. Poems and songs that are learned in 
childhood through countless repetitions persist through 
life, or at least can be quickly and readily relearned. 
The tables which we learn in childhood by countless 
repetitions also persist in our minds. In all cases of 
ideational learning involving a-great-number.of repeti- 
tions, retention is good over long periods of ti 
Relation of Memory to Intelligence. —Th elation of 
memory to intelligence has been determined in various 
ways: (1) Many investigators have compared pupils’ 
standing in logical memory tests with their standing in 
school studies. The relation is found to be positive, 
those having good retention standing well in their 
studies, and those having poor retention standing low 
in their studies. The relation is not absolute, of course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
142 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
but high and positive. The author has found the cor- 
relation to be as high as .76 in the upper grades. 
(2) Standing in logical memory tests has been cor- 
related with other mental tests. The author has ob- 
tained the following correlations: 
TABLE 19. 
CORRELATION OF LOGICAL MEMORY TEST WITH SIX OTHER 
MENTAL TESTS. 
    Completion . 
Average of s . 
It is evident from the table of correlations that log- 
ical memory has a high positive relation to other aspects 
of intelligence, giving the highest correlation with 
completion, the best single measure of intelligence 80 
far devised. 
(8) If all the children of the same age in any school 
system are compared with reference to their logical 
memory, those having the better memory are found in 
the higher grades as shown in Fig. 17. 
All psychologists who have seriously investigated the 
relation of memory to intelligence have found the facts 
as stated above. For example, Lyon, after years of 
experimental study of memory, says: “The students 
who stand highest in their various studies, and who 
prove upon examination to be the most intelligent, have, 
as a rule, the best memories. They not only learn more 
quickly, but they retain better.” Winch in his exten- 
sive studies of the memories of London school children, 
came to the same conclusion, as have Bolton, Bourdon,

Pohimann, and many others. It is interesting to note 
here that Winch also found a positive correlation be 
tween ability to memorise stories and the ability to in- 
vent stories, the correlation being higher with the more 
intelligent. 
When we say memory has a high relation to intelli- 
gence, we mean particularly logical memory. People 
of low intelligence may have good rote memories, may 
remember well discrete material, but only the intelli- 
gent have good memory for logical material. The 
unintelligent have no comprehension of significance. 
Such comprehension is necessary in logical memory. 
Some teachers have the mistaken notion that a good 
memory is to be deplored, that children should under- 
stand rather than memorise, that children should 
reason things out. But one cannot reason unless one 
remembers the facts of experience. Remembered ideas 
are the raw material of thought. Other things equal, 
the one who remembers best can reason best. ( 
course, remembering things without knowing their sis- 
nificance is of little value, but we must remember if 
we are to know their significance. 
Individual Differences in Retentiveness.—Individual 
differences in the various aspects of memory are very 
great. The author once determined the logical memory 
of 100 high school students and found the best memory 
to be four times as good as the poorest. The distribu- 
tion of 1032 university students is shown in Fig. 18 
The test on which the graphs of the figure are based is 
’ the Marble Statue. The records, as represented on the 
horizontal axis of the figure, are for the number of 
ideas correctly reproduced after hearing the story read.
-P-A-G-E-150

The number of students represented is 516 men and the 
same number of women. 
The range of ability in rote memory is not quite so 
great as shown in Fig. 19. The graphs are based on 
measures of 419 university men and an equal number 
of women. 
The differences in retentive capacity are thus seen 
to be very great. It is of very great consequence to a 
teacher to know that in an ordinary class retentive

hervous system. It probably is, but when we under-

take to measure it, we have to use some particular kind 
of impression, some particular stimulus, some definite 
kind of material. It turns out that we get different 
results from different kinds of material.. We can not 
therefore treat memory as if it were a definite, unitary 
function. We must always speak of memory for this 
or that kind of material, presented in such and such 
manner, and tested in such and such way. It is prob- 
ably true that our nervous systems have very definite 
capacities for retention, different for different people, 
but our various interests, and attentions, and preju- 
dices, our various experiences with their different con- 
sequences, bring it about that different things make 
very different appeals to us. As a result, retention 
of one type of impression may be very different. from 
our retention of another. If a group of people are 
measured to ascertain their retention of various types 
of material, such as numbers, letters, objects, words, 
Sentences, or the ideas of some selection of prose or 
Poetry, it is found that their relative standing is not 
the same. Indeed, their retention of several different 
selections of meaningful material will vary. The author 
has twice computed the intercorrelation between the 
various pairs of measures for four different logical 
Memory tests. In the first experiment, the intercor- 
relations were .379, .524, .555, .556, .568, 590. The 
average of these correlations is .5287, and the average 
P. E. is 089. In the second experiment, the correla- 
tions were .545, .559, .550, .518, .617, .476. The average 
is 5441, and the average P. E. is .074. For raw cor- 
relations in any sort of mental tests, these are high, and 
we may conclude that the relative ranks of individuals 
in logical memory tests will be about the same unless 
   
-P-A-G-E-153
148 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
some are specifically favored by the type of material. 
Thorndike found the correlation between memory for 
words and memory for numbers to be .45, and the cor- 
relation between immediate memory for words and de- 
layed memory—24 hours later—to be .55. 
So called rote memory is of considerable importance 
in early education, and of some importance throughout 
life. Rote memory has a positive correlation with 
logical memory but it is not very high. The average 
raw correlation is 355. The true correlation being 
about .58. 
There are two definitely different aspects of mem- 
ory. One we may call retention; the other, organisa- 
tion. By retention, we mean the after-effects of ner- 
vous excitation, the persistence in the brain of the 
effects of neural activity. By organisation, we mean 
the associative connections between the separate im- 
pressions. These associative connections are the basis 
- of recall. For the practical purposes of life, not only 
must impressions be retained, but we must be able to 
recall them. The significant thing for life is therefore 
logical memory, and it depends on more than mere 
retention. It depends on organisation, on meaning. Our 
ability to organise our experience in helpful ways de- 
pends on our capacity to see the significance of experi- 
ence, and this is something entirely apart from retet 
tion. Indeed, our simple retention may be good while 
we entirely lack the power of organisation. Organis® 
tion can not exist without retention, but we can havea 
high degree of retentive capacity and lack the power 
of organization. A low type of mind may have an ex- 
perience as rich as that of a Newton, and retain that 
experience as well, but lacking the power of organisa
-P-A-G-E-154
THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 149 
tion, the person uses this experience to no advantage 
because there are no helpful, meaningful associations 
in it. 
Immediate and Delayed Memory.—The problem here 
is virtually the same as that discussed above under the 
head of relation of learning to retention, for the imme- 
diate memory span is taken as the measure of quickness 
of learning. We shall cite here no further evidence of 
the relationship, but merely recall that it was said that 
the quick learner is in general good in retention also. 
We may here put the matter in a somewhat different 
way. Suppose we present a given amount of matter 
toa group of people and find what amount of the matter 
they can immediately reproduce, then a day later, or a 
month later, we ascertain how much of the matter is 
still retained, we find in general that those who had 
the most facts immediately after the presentation still 
have the most facts. In any particular experiment, the 
relation will not be found perfect and absolute, because 
it is impossible to keep the conditions equal. The mat- 
ter will come back to the minds of some and be reneated 
more than will be the case with others. Their retention 
will consequently be better relatively. 
Measurements of Retention.—There are three main 
methods of measuring retention. (1) The reproduction 
method. By this method, we(determine the amount of 
material previously learned that can be recalled. This 
is the most widely used method of measuring retention, 
and it is the test which the practical affairs of life put . 
upon us, for no matter how easily we could relearn the 
material, no matter how much of it is just below the 
conscious level, if we can not recall it, it is not imme- 
diately available, and does us no more good for the
-P-A-G-E-155
150 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
moment of need than if it were in no sense retained, 
(2) The relearning method. By this method we really 
measure the amount forgotten by the time required to 
relearn. The procedure is to learn a certain material 
to the point of just being able to reproduce it, and then 
later determine how much time is required to relearn 
the amount forgotten. The relearning time is taken 
as the measure of the amount forgotten and is inverse- 
ly related to the amount retained. A relatively short 
relearning time indicates a good memory. This is prob- 
ably a better method of measuring absolute retention 
than is the reproduction method, for it gives weight to 
any retention, no matter how vague or how faint. The 
reproduction method emphasises organisation, for re- 
call depends on organisation and, as said above, for the 
practical purposes of life is perhaps more useful than 
the relearning method. (3) The recognition method 
By this method we do not have the subject either recall 
or relearn but recognise a previously experienced stimu- 
lus. The method may be illustrated by Strong’s adver- 
tisement experiments. Strong presented to his subjects 
a certain number of advertisements and later pre 
sented these same advertisements along with many 
others. The subjects were to say whether each adver- 
tisement had been seen before or not. It is evident that 
the one of these methods we should use in any given 
case would depend upon our purposes. 
Usually we are most interested in the logical mem- 
ory of our students. This can be accurately measured 
by the form of tests now in use for this purpose. The 
procedure is to divide a story into ideas ‘or units. The 
story is read to the subjects and, for immediate mem- 
ory, we then require a written reproduction of the
-P-A-G-E-156
~ 
  ” THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 161 
story. In scoring it, we give credit for each idea ade- 
quately reproduced. Another method is to have the 
subjects answer a number of questions concerning the 
story. This procedure makes the grading of the work 
easier and more accurate. The questions can be so 
constructed that they can be answered in each case 
by a single word. 
The best standardised method of measuring rote 
memory is as follows: Prepare six lists of words of 
one syllable each. Put three words in the first list, four 
in the second, five in the third, six in the fourth, seven 
in the fifth, and eight in the sixth. The first list is 
tread to the subjects and an immediate reproduction 
required. The second list is then read and an immediate 
reproduction required, and so on to the eighth list. We 
can score the reproduction by giving one credit for 
each word reproduced without regard to position in 
the list, or we can give credit for the word and one 
credit for its position. The results are about the same, 
and of course, the former method is much simpler and 
easier. 
Recognition.—A few facts have been discovered in 
the study of recognition memory that should be men- 
tioned. Myers found recognition memory to be about 
two-and-a-half times as efficient’as recall, and the cor- 
relation between the two to be low. For boys, recogni- 
tion was three times as efficient as recall and for girls 
Tecognition was only twice as efficient. But girls were 
More efficient in recognition than were boys. 
Strong studied the effect of the time interval upon 
recognition. The procedure was to present 20 words 
and then later present the same 20 along with 40 others. 
He tried different intervals up to 42 days. In immediate
-P-A-G-E-157
152 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
recognition, 84% were recognised. After 7 days, only 
10% were recognised. The decrease was rapid at first, 
then slow, as it has been found to be in other tests of 
memory. 
Voluntary Recall.—Until matter is well learned, at- 
tempt at voluntary recall is a hindrance and a waste of 
time, but after matter is learned, voluntary recall has 
great value just as re-presentation has great value in 
fixing the material. Myers has studied the former of 
these factors. To 332 subjects he gave four series of 
tests, presenting orally ten words in each series. He 
found a decided gain in final recall as a result of inter- 
vening recall without re-presentation of the stimuli 
(The effects of recall were greater if recall took place 
five minutes after presentation than when recall was. 
immediate. This is in harmony with Jost’s law—that 
fetitions have greater value for the older associa 
ions. 
Guillet showed the value of presenting matter agait 
two to five days after first presentation. Both re 
and re-presentation are valuable. Which we should use 
at any particular stage of learning depends upon the 
kind of material and how far learning has progressed. 
As long as learning is uncertain and doubtful, re-pre 
sentation is preferable. When recall is easily possible, 
recall is preferable. The importance for permanent 
fixation of re-presentation and recall can not be over 
estimated. In the practical work of studying our le- 
sons, we should Jearn the material of the lesson; thea 
after an interval of some hours go over the matter 
again; then after another interval go over the matter 
in the process of recall; then with longer and longef
-P-A-G-E-158
£ ~~ 
| THE RETENTION OF EXPERIENCE 153 
intervals go over the matter again and again, using re- 
presentation or recall as the conditions demand. 
In poor learning, as Myers has pointed out, the 
wrong elements become coupled together in recall. We 
should not try to recall when this is likely to happen. 
The remedy for poor learning is re-presentation, drill, 
better organisation. 
Position in Series——Numerous experiments have 
shown that in committing to memory a series of words, 
letters, or other items, the first ones and the last ones 
are learned first. Dell considered the matter with ref- 
erence to meaningful material. He found that, other 
things being equal, the beginning and end of material 
were learned first. Generally speaking, other things are 
_ hot equal; other factors are usually more important 
than position in series. Logical and systematic ar- 
Tangement are probably more important. If we can 
Combine logical and systematic arrangement with put- 
ting important items at the beginning and end, the re- © 
sults will be favorable. 
Cramming.—Cramming may be defined as the learn- 
ing or trying to learn a great amount of material in a 
«Short time. It is a legitimate process in two definite 
situations. If one has to organize a large amount of 
Material for a particular occasion, it is legitimate and 
economical to concentrate the learning and do it all just 
before the knowledge is needed. Secondly, in the learn- 
ing of material that is to be organised and remembered 
for life, or for a long period of time, the economical 
Procedure is to spread the learning out, and occasionally 
to go over in concentrated fashion the whole of the 
material, for example, go over a whole book in one eve- 
ning. This concentrated consideration of a large amount
-P-A-G-E-159
154 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
of material helps one to see each part in the light of 
other parts. By the very process of being considered 
together, facts become related in memory. The oftener , 
we can think over bits of experience that belong to 
gether, and that are needed together for use, the better 
these bits become cemented in memory, and the more 
likely one idea will be to recall the other related ones. 
The cramming process is not effective for lasting mem- 
ory, however, unless there has previously been learning , 
of the parts in detail. A bird’s eye view of a lot of ma- 
terial is profitable provided we have previously had a 
microscopic view. 
EXPERIMENTS AND EXERCISES. 
1. The logical memory of all the students in the class 
should be determined by giving at least four tests, om 
the order of Whipple’s Marble Statue test. The in- 
structor should select four short passages of prose that 
are likely to make a strong appeal to all members of 
the class. Divide the passage up into its ideational units 
for ease in scoring. Read each passage and give plenty 
of time for each student to reproduce it. The score 
should be the number of ideas adequately reproduced. 
Combine the scores of the four tests to obtain each stu 
dent’s logical memory efficiency. Compute the inter 
correlations, six in all, to determine the co-efficient of 
reliability of the tests. 
2. Determine each student’s rote memory for words 
by using lists of one syllable words, the lists ranging 
in length from five words to eight. Make at least four 
such tests. Determine the co-efficient of reliability 3 
in experiment 1 above. Determine each student's 
standing by combining the results of the four tests, and
-P-A-G-E-160

correlate the results with those from the logical mem 
ory tests. 
8. Make a study of memory for objects in the follow 
ing way:, Select four groups of objects, ten in eac] 
group. Conceal them from the class. Expose the ok 
jects of each group serially, one at a time, and requir! 
the students to write down the names of the objects 
without regard to the order of presentation. Combin: 
the four records for the total score. Determine the cc 
efficient of reliability as above, and correlate the com 
bined scores with those in the two tests above.

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY. 
Our problem is now to enquire into the nature of 
learning capacity. The question which we shall try 
to answer is this: Are the characteristics of the ner- 
vous system such that a person may be spoken of as a 
ie learner” or a “poor learner” in general? Or 
must we say that a person is good at learning one type 
of material and perhaps poor at learning other types? 
Must we say that a certain person can learn mathe- 
maties easily, but learns some other subject, let us say 
history, with difficulty? Or can we say that a person 
is a good learner or a poor learner at whatever he un- 
dertakes to leam? In the schools, for example, is 4 
person known as a good student or a poor student in 
general, or is he known as a good student in history and 
lage, for example, and a poor student in science 
nathematies? Generally students are spoken of as 
or poor without reference to any particular sub- 
ject of study. There are, however, numerous excep- 
tions. Sometimes a student is known as an excellent 
student in science and as a poor student in language. In 
such cases the question arises whether the explanation 
may not be quite other than difference in ability to 
learn the different subjects. The explanation may be 
found in difference in preliminary training, difference 
in interest, and other factors of.experience.

THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY 159 
The question which we have raised in this chapter is 
of the highest importance to education, for if learn- 
ing, whatever its nature, depends upon fundamental 
characteristics of the brain and nervous system, then 
it will be found a comparatively simple matter to de- 
termine by experiment the learning capacity of the 
pupils in the public schools and of students in the col- 
leges. On the other hand, if learning is a specific mat- 
ter, we can not speak of learning capacity in a general 
sense, but must speak of ability to learn this or that. 
But let us turn to the experiments. 
Interrelation of Different Learning Capacities.—We 
shall first consider extensive experiments performed in 
the author’s laboratory with several different kinds of 
material. The learning falls under four different types. 
(1) First, what we may call motor learning, consisting 
of card sorting and marble sorting. The card sorting 
consisted in distributing 150 numbered cards into trays 
numbered correspondingly. There were 80 trays ar- 
ranged with five in a row, and in six rows. There 
were therefore five cards to each tray. An experiment 
consisted in distributing the 150 cards into their appro- 
Priate trays. In marble sorting 96 marbles of different 
colors and sizes were distributed into six different 
Yeceiving boxes by means of a complicated machine 
demanding the use of both feet and both hands. (2) 
The second type of learning is what we may call 
semi-motor in character, the substitution experiments. 
There were three types of these experiments, turning 
digits into symbols, turning symbols into digits, and 
transcribing the alphabet irito”ai_arbitrary-symbol 
alphabet. The former two we shall call the digit sub- 
stitution experiment and the latter the alphabet substi-
-P-A-G-E-165
                  160 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
tution experiment. The essential difference in these 
experiments was that in the digit substitution experi- 
ments, there were only nine bonds to form, while in the 
alphabet substitution experiment there were twenty-six 
bonds to form. In the substitution experiments 
while there was a motor element, it was not so im- 
portant as in the sorting experiments, and the idea- 
tional element was of more importance. (3) The third type of experiment we may call ideational, 
because the motor element was relatively unimportant. 
In this experiment series of ten nonsense syllables were 
learned. They were exposed visually in series of ten, 
one second exposure to each syllable. The exposure of 
the syllables was continued until the subjects could 
write them in their proper order. (4) The fourth type 
of learning we may call motor-inhibited. It consisted in 
learning mirror writing. The method consisted in learn- 
ing to write, with a mirror-reflected stimulus, letters 
that appeared normal in the mirror. It will be seem 
that these experiments were widely different in type. 
Even the two we have called motor were widely differ 
ent. In the case of card-sorting, simple associations 
had to be built up between numbers and places. There 
were 30 such associations. In marble-sorting, the 
matter.was much more complicated. Appropriate re 
sponses had to be learned for marbles of four different 
colors and two different sizes, only six in all, but there 
were four different holes for the reception of the mar: 
bles, and the feet had to manipulate pedals when cer- 
tain marbles were deposited. Most of the experiments 
were repeated with several different groups of stu 
dents. There were usually about 75 in a group. The AI ee anion

learning capacity of each student for each type of 
learning was determined, and all the possible correla- 
{ions were computed, 41 in all. The results were very 
constant. Only the averages will be given here. In 
table 20 are shown the average correlations of each 
type of learning with all other types.

Only one correlation could be computed with mirror 
writing, and that was with learning nonsense syllables. . 
Between these two tests, the correlation was .505, and 
a included in the averages as given for nonsense syl- 
bles, 
What is the significance of these correlations? A 
Taw correlation of a little more than .5 indicates a very 
high positive relationship between the abilities required 
to learn the different types of material. But if learn- 
ing capacity is general, should not the correlation be 
unity? In the author’s opinion, if the disturbing fac- 
tors could be eliminated, the correlation would be unity. 
There were several disturbing factors. In the first 
Place, the score obtained was not always a correct indi- 
cation of quickness of learning. In card-sorting there 
were wide differences in ability to manipulate the cards 
which affected the score but had no relation to ability 
to learn. These differences in facility with the cards
-P-A-G-E-167
162 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
were due to past experience. Another factor which 
affected the score but had no relation to capacity to 
learn was attitude toward the different experiments. 
Owing to difference in interest, students would try much 
harder in some experiments than in others. Previous 
experience, then, affected the scores through giving 
the students some advantage or disadvantage and 
through their effects on the students’ attitude and in- 
terest. In motor learning, reaction time, which prob- 
ably has no relation to ability to learn, affected the 
scores, We conclude that as far as these learning 
experiments furnish evidence, learning capacity is 4 
general characteristic. . 
Evidence From Memory Experiments.—Experiments 
in immediate memory are virtually experiments In 
ability to learn, and their results throw light on our 
present problem. In Table 21 are shown the intercor- 
relations among four logical memory tests. Each mem- 
ory test was given to two separate groups of students. 
This made possible two complete sets of correlations, 
twelve in all. The different correlations together with 
the averages are shown in the table. .The four tests 
were The Dutch Homestead, Cicero, and Marble Statue 
from Whipple, and The Costly Temper from the av- 
thor’s “Manual.” :

but a trifle more than the intercorrelations of the leart- 
ing tests. Ability to reproduce stories heard is cel 
tainly as nearly a unitary function as one could ima 
gine, still the correlations between story reproductions 
are. practically the same as the correlations among 
widely different types of learning.

In Lyon’s memory studies we find correlations com- 
puted for five different types of memorising. In one 
Serles of studies with 24 subjects he found an inter- 
Correlation of .51; and in another study with 17 sub- 
Jects he found a correlation of .42. His correlations 
Were computed by the rank-difference method. His re- 
sults are therefore about the same as those reported 
above, His correlations for different types of memor- 
ory. are practically the same as those in logical mem-

-P-A-G-E-169
164 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
was found that relearning time had a very definite re- 
lation to learning time and this ratio was fairly con- 
~. gtant and about the same for all subjects. While the 
experiment threw no light on the matter of learning 
different types of material, it showed great definiteness 
and constancy in learning the same kind of material. 
The other illustration is from card-sorting. In this 
kind of learning, nothing was more noticeable than the 
definiteness and regularity of the different subjects. 
They retained their relative positions or ranks from 
day to day with great constancy. At the beginning of 
an experiment the experimenter could predict, on the 
basis of the previous day’s work, the relative ranks of 
the subjects. The learning capacity of the various 
learners became definitely known to the experimenter. 
The characteristics underlying learning capacity seem 
to persist and to be as definite as anything in human 
nature. Such variations as usually occur in a givel 
subject’s learning from day to day, have definite causes 
and can be predicted when the causes are known. 
course, constancy in learning depends upon constancy 
of the conditions and factors involved. These factors 
are numerous. The condition of nearly every organ 1 
the body can have its effect on the temporary efficiency 
of the learner. But there is probably a constant factor 
which may be ealled general learning capacity, depend- 
ent upon the characteristics of the central nervous sys 
tem. 
Interrelation of Mental Functions.—The question of 
the relations of different types of learning capacity 
raises the more general question of the relation of all 
mental functions: The question may be put in this way: 
Are mental functions positively or negatively related? 
‘Or is there any dependent relationships among them at
-P-A-G-E-170
THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY 165 
all? If the efficiency of one mental function is known, 
can we predict the efficiency of others? These ques- 
tions can be answered with some degree of certainty. 
The answer comes from mental tests given in various 
countries during the last twenty years. We shall show 
certain typical results and then discuss their signifi- 
cence. In table 22 are shown the intercorrelations for 
@ group of mental tests given to three different groups 
of students in the author’s laboratory. There were 21 
correlations for each group, 63 correlations in all. Only 
the averages are shown in the table. 
What is the significance of the figures shown in the 
three tables of correlations? In table 22 the correla 
tions are all positive but one. Free association gives 
with substitution a negative correlation. It is small, 
however, and may be considered zero. The averages of 
all the correlations, although small, are positive. A 
careful study of all the correlation tables published 
shows that all important complex mental functions are 
hoevely related. The raw correlations are never very 
igh. The disturbing factors are so many that we can

never expect to get a very high correlation between any 
two different mental functions. In table 22 it is see? 
that the raw correlation between two successive tests 
of the same kind is not nearly unity. In the seven tests 
they range from .382 to .805, the average being only 
.608. This last coefficient indicates the reliability of 
our measure, for, of course, the true correlation is no 
.608 but unity. The average raw correlation in this 
table is 239. The average true correlation would 
about .40.  
-P-A-G-E-172
THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY 167 
We said above that all important mental functions 
are positively related. This is not quite the truth. 
What we should say is that all mental functions which 
may be considered a part of general intelligence, gen- 
eral mental ability, are positively related. For, of 
course, it is not true that any aspect of human behavior 
that we may measure will be found positively related 
to all other aspects of human behavior. Quickness of 
reaction time, for example, probably has no relation to 
intelligence. Rapidity in running has no relation to 
judgment of color. Strength of grip has no relation 
to accuracy of ethical judgment. Now, a few perfor- 
mances that have been used as mental tests have given 
negative correlations with other tests. The author has 
found Whipple’s ink-blot test, the free association test, 
and cancellation tests given for speed only, to show 
small negative correlations with certain other tests. 
These correlations are usually small, and probably 
should be considered zero, for they are sometimes posi- 
ne Some writers, Simpson for example, have at- 
3 ped some importance to these negative correlations. 
ut their explanation is plain. Older children make

relation to general intelligence otherwise determined, 
and none of these tests is of any value as a measure of 
intelligence. We repeat, in agreement with Thorndike, 
that no test that is a measure of general intelligence has 
a negative relation with any other such test. On the 
other hand, every test that has proven to be a high 
criterion of general intelligence, has shown high cor- 
relation with other such tests. Of all single tests, the 
-completion test has proven to be the best measure of 
intelligence. This test gives the highest average cor- 
relation with other tests. The other tests of proven 
value as measures of general intelligence—opposites, 
logical memory and analogies—all give high positive 
correlations with other important tests. From this 
evidence, only one conclusion seems to us possible. 
There is a human characteristic which we may call 
general learning capacity, just as there is another 
which we may call general intelligence. 
Specific Abilities —We have a general learning capac 
ity. We are quick learners, slow learners or mediocre 
learners. But when we learn, we work with some par 
ticular kind of material. There are therefore two addi 
tional factors that must always be taken into account 
besides the general factor. One of these factors i 
volves the specific characteristics necessary to somé 
type of learning. For example, in music, one will leat 
fast if he has a good general learning capacity and als 
those specific characteristics necessary to music, pat 
ticularly ability to differentiate pitch, judgment of hat 
‘mony and dissonance, perception of rhythm. In ath 
one might learn slowly although having good gen 
learning capacity, because of lack of muscular con! 
or because of being color blind. In all learning requit- 
ing specific abilities, quickness of learning will depend : | 
_.
-P-A-G-E-174
THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY 169 
upon the degree of general learning capacity possessed 
and also upon the degree to which the specific abilities 
| are possessed. . 
! The other secondary factor that must always be 
taken into account is the effect of experience. In the 
realm of habit, when we start in to form a new one, we 
usually find some old habit that either helps or hinders, 
so that our speed of learning is affected by the old habit. 
| And likewise in the realm of knowledge, the knowledge 
| we have already acquired is of great consequence. Our 
learning is fast because of the previously acquired 
knowledge or slow because we do not have it. Great is 
the effect, also, of the attitude which previous experi- 
ence gives us toward new tasks. Because of past ex- 
Perience we like certain things and dislike others, and 
these affective attitudes are of the greatest consequence 
in learning; helping if favorable and greatly hindering , 
if unfavorable. If by any chance a pupil gets the idea,’ 
that he can not do a thing, he does not like that thing 
and he does not try to do it. As time passes, his inabil- 
ity increases because of the increase of the force of the 
inhibition and also because of lack of practice. While 
we therefore have a general Jearning capacity, it never 
Operates entirely freely but is always complicated by 
Specific factors and by the effects of previous experi- 
ence, 
Nature of General Learning Capacity.—It is clear 
that specific learning capacity depends upon the pos- 
session of certain specific characteristics, such as reac- 
tion time, muscular co-ordination, quality of sense per- 
ception, and sensory discrimination, color sense, vari- 
ous auditory characteristics, ideational type, ete. But 
on what does general learning capacity depend? What 
the characteristics of the central nervous system on | |

        170 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
which quick learning depends, are, we do not know. In 
psychological terms, however, something can be said 
of what characterises a quick learner. The quick learner 
has what is called in ordinary terminology, the power 
of concentration. All the available cerebral energy 
seems to participate in the learning; there is no waste 
of energy. This characteristic is what is usually spoken 
of as power of attention. The fact that good learners 
also remember well, and the further fact that good 
retention is known to depend upon the vividness and 
intensity of impression which are secured only in a high 
state of attention, lend evidence to the assumption that 
power to learn depends upon power to attend. Since 
attention is merely sensory clearness, it is probable that a low level of attention means a low level of met 
tality. ‘The mental processes of the slow learner would, 
on this assumption, be more vague, less potent, more 
poorly knit together. Another characteristic that ur 
‘doubtedly affects learning capacity is ability to perceive 
significance. This factor is particularly effective in the 
higher realms of intellectual learning, where meaning 
and organisation are the important things. All of w 
have about the same sensory experience; the good 
learner is he who knows what, in all this experience, 8 
significant and what is not. The essential thing in inte- 
lectual learning is organisation. Organisation depends. 
upon knowing what and how to organise. The 
learner sees what characteristics of experience are sig- 
nificant for the purposes of his life, he attends to thest 
characteristics to the exclusion of unimportant charoe 
teristics. The result is a helpful and useful organiss 
tion of the items of experience. As a consequence e 
perience is more vital to the good learner, more usefil 
in the after application to life’s purposes and more hel
-P-A-G-E-176
THE NATURE OF LEARNING CAPACITY 171 
ful in learning other related things. The good learner, 
then, has available a large amount of cerebral energy 
which he can bring to bear in the learning process, and 
is able to recognise the significant and distinguish it 
from the unimportant. The result is a good organisa- 
tion of what is useful. The poor learner lives on a lower 
intellectual level. His mental processes are more 
vague, more loosely knit together. The poor learner ~ 
can not discriminate. One item of experience is to him 
about as important as another; there is therefore no 
selective attention, and as a result no helpful organisa- 
tion of the items of experience. Experience is therefore 
of little use in the practical affairs of life or in learning. 
the very simplest of learning, these two factors 
tan be seen to operate. Let us apply them to card- 
Sorting. In the case of the quick learner, the mental 
Power is all concentrated on the learning. There is no 
division of attention. The quick learner further sees 
Significant and helpful connections and associations. 
He says, for example, “such a number is in the corner,

A General Mental Factor—Our consideration of the 
nature of learning leads us to the question of the nature 
of general intelligence. We have found reason to be- 
lieve that there is a general factor that operates in all 
learning, a factor which we call general learning capac- 
ity. Certain psychologists claim that there is a gen-

eral or central intellectual factor that participates inal | 
intellectual activity. This central factor is claimed t 
be the chief basis of the positive correlation found be 
tween any two important intellectual activities. Spear 
man is the leading psychologist who advocates the cet 
tral factor. The main item of proof of this factor is 
that in a table of correlations, if the correlations them 
selves are high and dependable, any two pairs of ed 
umns give a high positive correlation. This could b 
true, Spearman claims, only if there is a common factor 
in all the tests, Thorndike, Brown, Simpson, aid 
others oppose this theory. Thorndike holds that post 
tive correlation between two activities depends ot 
upon some identity of the functions involved, a cel 
identity of processes. The evidence available does 4

MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY. 
In the last chapter we came face to face with the 
Problem of measuring learning capacity, for in order 
to compare ability in one field of learning with ability 
in another, we must have some means of measuring 
capacity to learn. Since the question of measuring 
learning capacity is an important one and has many 
details that demand specific investigation, we have re- 
served its treatment for a separate chapter. Our prob- 
lem here is but a part of the more general question of 
Measuring all mental functions. Into the general ques- 
tion of mental measurements, we shall not enter. The 
Possibility of such measurements and their practical 
feasibility have been fully demonstrated. 
Leaming is forming bonds between stimuli and re- 
sponses or between ideas. Common observation as well 
8 experiment shows that the rate and effectiveness 
with which we form these bonds vary from one person 
to another. In order to measure the efficiency of a 
learner we have but to set him a task of bond-forming 
and determine the amount accomplished in a given 
time; by comparing this amount with the results from 
other learners we can determine whether the learner 
being measured is fast or slow. 
Such a procedure seems quite simple, as indeed it is. 
But before we can feel confidence in the results of such 
Measurements, we must have information on several 
(175)
-P-A-G-E-181
176 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
details of the procedure. In the first place, if we are to 
compare the efficiency of one learner with that of an 
other, the learners must not only be set the same task 
but each must work with all his might. If one learner 
puts forth all possible energy, and the other does net 
try, of course, the results are not comparable. A mental 
test of any kind is valid only on the assumption that the 
learner does his best. The validity of a mental test de- 
pends further on those tested being in good physical 
and mental condition. By good physical condition, we 
mean the subject must be free from fatigue, sickness 
or any other physical ailment that would interfere with 
learning. By proper mental condition, we have refer- 
ence to emotion and attitude. The person being mea 
ured should not be excited unduly or nervous. A favor 
able attitude is always desirable, because it is necessary 
to get the subject to do his best. So much for the cor 
ditions required on the part of the subject. There i 
also certain problems of method that must be cons! 
ered. In comparing the learning efficiency of differ 
learners, we compare their learning curves. But Ww 
point in the curves shall we take for comparision? 
we measure a group of learners which we wish to 
pare after they have worked a short time or after the” 
have worked a long time? The results may be differ 
ent. We do not know in the absence of experiment. 
do not know whether some learners may S' pa 
slowly and become much faster later, while some 
start out fast and become slower later. If we allow oe 
subjects to work till they have reached their lim”, 
the given task, and then measure them, we a4 ‘te 
dently measuring final efficiency, which may be oe 
a different thing from learning capacity. For
-P-A-G-E-182
MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY 7 
know to the contrary, a quick learner may soon reach 
his limit while a slow learner may continue to improva 
and reach a final efficiency much greater than that 
reached by the fast learner. It is evident therefore 
that the length of time we allow our subjects to work 
before taking their measure is an important matter. 
These various questions of method we shall consider 
below. We must first see what sort of tests have been 
used as measures of learning capacity. 
Learning Tests.—The type of learning test most ex- 
tensively used is the substitution test, which is one of 
the simplest of tests and has a wide range of possibili- 
tes in the materials that can be used and the varia- tions that can be made in them. The principle of the . 
test is as follows: The learner is given a number of 
symbols with which he is familiar and is required to 
couple with these symbols others which have not been 
50 coupled with them in the experience of the subject. 
th a form of the experiment standardised by the au- 
or, the known symbols are the nine digits, and the 
panels that are to be coupled with them are letters of 
et alphabet. The procedure in giving the test is as 
conta, he Subject is given the test sheet which ins columns of numbers, five digits in a number. 
t the numbers are five squares in whith the proper 
isage, > (0 be written. At the top of the test sheet 
digit owing what letter is to be coupled with each 
ve : € child, after hearing an explanation of the 
ont th what he is required to do, proceeds at once to 
to it Th. Squares, looking up at the key to-Ree’ how to 
¥il soon ery of the test is that the quick’ learner 
he ther ow the key and will not have to look at it; 
*lore makes a higher score in a given time. As
-P-A-G-E-183
178 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
the author has used the test, eight minutes were allowed 
in grades three, four, and five, and five minutes in the 
grades above. The score—indicating the learning capa- 
city—is the number of correct substitutions made in a | 
minute. | 
In practice, this test does not turn out to be just what | 
it is in theory. The discrepancy consists in the fact — 
that some subjects do not try to learn the key, but con- 
tinue to refer to it throughout the experiment. Since 
these are the less intelligent pupils, the error is not 80 | 
great as might be expected. Nevertheless a better way 
to administer a substitution test is to provide the sub- 
jects with the key and allow them to study it for a cer ; 
tain length of time, then require them to write the 
substitutions from.memory. In Table 25 are the norms 
for public school children by age and sex; method, 
pupils using the key while practicing.

  The substitution test has a high co-efficient of reli« 
bility, and it gives the highest average correlation with 
the other learning tests, as shown in table 20. With the
-P-A-G-E-184
MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY “179 
other mental tests, it gives low but constant correla- o 
tions. While it gives low correlations with the other... ° 
types of mental tests, if its correlations with the other ~ 
tests are themselves correlated with the averages of the. 
correlations of each test with all the others as shown. - 
at the bottom of the correlation table (p. 165), it gives. 
a higher correlation than any other test similarly 
treated. This indicates the most constant presence and 
regularity of the factor common to the tests. 
Many different forms of the substitution test have 
been used. Their validity depends upon how they are 
given and how they are scored. If they are properly 
administered and properly scored, and repeated so as 
to give a stable measure, they give a measure of con- 
siderable reliability. 
Tests of Motor Learning.—A motor learning test ex- 
tensively used by the author and, in various forms, 
wed in other laboratories, is the card-sorting test de- 
scribed in Chapter VIII. This test has many advan- 
tages, It has no relation to book-learning or any of the 
ordinary learning that goes on at school. By using 
Playing cards or cards with colors instead of numbers 
it can be given to illiterates or very young children. The 
demands of the test are easily understood. By sorting 
into asmall number of boxes, the learner soon gets suf- 
ficient data for the construction of a learning curve. 
The test practically always arouses interest and the 
subjects do their best. Its only disadvantage is that in 
the case of older subjects, those who are adept in the 
handling of cards, make a somewhat higher score than 
they otherwise would. 
The card-sorting experiment has many possibilities. 
The author uses a card-sorting box having six rows of
-P-A-G-E-185
180 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
trays with five trays in a row, thirty in all. These are 
numbered in miscellaneous order from 11 to 40. On 
the reverse side of the box there is the same number 
of trays. For the study of inhibition, these have the 
same numbers with a different arrangement. There 
are five cards of each number, 150 in all. In six days 
of practice not only can reliable measures of learning 
capacity be obtained but data be secured for the con- 
struction of six comparative learning curves, and facts 
be discovered which throw light on the problem of 
transfer of training. The procedure is as follows: 02 
the first day of practice, the learners spend an hour 
sorting into the first row of boxes. Since there are only 
five boxes in the row, their location is soon learned and 
the learning curve rises fast. On the second day, the 
learners spend an hour on the second row of boxes. 02 
the third day, they take the third row, and so continue 
to take a new row each day till all the rows are used. 
This requires six days if only one side of the box is 
used. By going on with different numbers, both sides 
of the box can be used, giving twelve days of learning 
with a new set of boxes for each day. Such an expert 
ment teaches students more about habit-formation and 
the laws of learning than they could learn from a book 
inalongtime. Indeed such facts can not be adequate- 
ly learned from a book in any length of time. Facts 
discovered in this experiment which throw light on the 
problem of inhibition and also that of the transfer of 
training are discussed in later chapters. 
The marble-sorting experiment, discussed in Chapter 
VI, is a valid measure of capacity in motor learning. 
It has the advantage also of being different from the 
ordinary school work, and arouses great interest. It | 
pe ca

pera 
ee, MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY 181 
requires a high degree of attention and concentration. 
It can be given to illiterates and young children. Sub- 
jects who have had much experience with the piano or 
typewriter have a slight advantage in the score. The 
author used this experiment with success in comparing 
the learning capacity of negro children with white chil- 
dren. The comparisons are shown in Table 26. 
In the field of ideational learning the number of 
kinds of learning tests that can be devised is as great 
as the number of kinds of learning material. Nonsense 
syllables, properly constructed and arranged, furnish 
us with one of the best means of measuring learning 
Capacity. Their learning demands a high degree of 
Concentration. In a few hours several series can be 
learned, affording an adequate measure of this form of 
learning. The material has the advantage that it is 
absolutely new to experience. Previous experience gives 
no bias. The associations must be established ab novo. - 
It may be claimed that the best types of learning 
tests should use meaningful material. The author has 
Some sympathy with this claim. Such material has 
Many advantages, but has the disadvantage that when 
Used for comparative purposes, it will favor certain 
subjects or groups of subjects, because of differences in 
Previous experience and interest. If we take great care 
In the selection of test material, such tests as those 
usually given under the head of logical memory are of 
Breat value in measuring differences in learning capac- 
ity. There are various ways in which they can be ad- 
ministered. A description of two methods will be suf- 
ficient. A short story can be divided into ideational 
units for ease in grading the results. This story is 
tead to the subjects once. They then make a written

reproduction of the ideas. The number of ideas ade- 
quately reproduced is the score. The other method of 
giving the test is to read the story once, have a repro- 
duction, then continue to read it and have it reproduced 
until all the ideas are reproduced. This procedure has 
been used by the author for individual tests, the repro- 
ductions being made orally. The former method re 
quires much less time, and if repeated with four differ- 
ent kinds of material, gives a valid measure of learning 
capacity. 
To summarise: Learning is connecting. Any test 
that measures the capacity of a subject to establish 
connections between two processes not before asso 
ciated, is a valid measure of general learning capacity. 
In practice, we should use several different types of 
test. Each test should be repeated at least twice, and 
preferably four times. The results of the several tests 
should then be combined and taken as a measure of 
learning capacity. Any test of learning capacity that 
uses only one kind of material and is given but once 
can be only a rough measure of learning capacity. In 
ordinary practice, only group tests can be used. The 
author recommends the use of the substitution test, the 
second procedure mentioned above, repeated four 
times ; card-sorting, an hour test with each of six boxes; 
the learning of four ten-syllable series of nonsense sy!- 
lables ; and four tests of logical memory. The combined 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY 183 
results are to be taken as the measure of general learn- 
ing capacity. 
Where to Make the Measure.—If our purpose is 
merely to measure the quickness of learning, we have 
but to set our subjects to work forming new bonds, let 
them work for a time, then measure the degree of per- 
fection with which the bonds are formed. But how 
long should we let them work? If there are only a few 
’. bonds to form, and the subjects work for a considerable 
time, and we then determine the subjects’ relative effi- 
Clencies in using the bonds, we are not measuring learn- 
ing capacity at all, but the various individuals’ capaci- 
ties to do a certain thing. We should take our measure 
| early in the practice period in order to measure learning 
capacity and not final capacity. We should take our 
_ Measure while the learning curve is still rising steeply. ow many minutes or hours should precede the appli-

| Complexity of the bonds. In the case of card-sorting,

ge of a longer period, however, is to offset minor 
‘rors that would unduly affect a shorter period. In 
; Seferal, the longer the period covered by any mental 
; test, the more reliable the test. For example, in a test 
Covering a minute, the various accidents that happen 
| l getting started—accidents with paper, pencil, ete— 
, lave an appreciable effect on the score. Such accidents 
_ donot have a measurable effect on a test covering an 
; hour, In learning involving the formation of very 
many bonds, we should not apply the measure until all 
the bonds are formed at least weakly.
-P-A-G-E-189
184 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
The importance of knowing when to apply our mea 
ure is at once apparent when we undertake to measure 
the learning capacity of people having widely different 
learning capacities, as negroes and whites. If we take 
the efficiency at the end of five minutes practice witha 
nine-digit substitution test, we find the whites very 
much superior. If we should take as our measure the 
efficiency attained by twenty minutes of practice, the 
negroes are found to be as good as the whites. In the 
first case we are really measuring learning capacity; in 
the second case, we are measuring not learning capacity 
at all but quickness at copying. At the latter task, the 
negroes are as good as the whites. 
It is quite evident that at different points on the 
learning curve, we measure different things. We s#!! 
above that in the case of card-sorting involving 3) 
boxes, we should not make our measure too early. 1 
reason for this is that in such a case we are measuring 
neither learning capacity nor final efficiency, but how 
quickly a person can look over a list of numbers 
find a certain one. 
Correlations in Learning Experiments—The vari 
questions raised in the above discussions can be sci 
tifically studied by applying the correlation formule 
We can put a group of people to working at a learnilé 
experiment and allow them to continue till considerable 
fixation is reached, taking measures of efficiency at fre 
quent intervals. We can then compare the relatité . 
standing of our subjects at any point. with their § / 
ing at any other point. In nine-digit substitution, of 
example, in an experiment involving 29 subjects wa 
worked for five-minute periods, the correlatiot 
standing at the end of the first five minutes with { 4
-P-A-G-E-190
MEASURING LEARNING CAPACITY 185 
at the end of five practice periods was .64, while the 
correlation of the standing at the end of the second 
period with that at the end of the fifth was 96. Ina 
learning experiment so simple as this, the subjects very 
soon assume relative positions that are indicative of 
their final efficiencies. Even in a complicated learning 
experiment such as sorting cards into 30 boxes, a group 
of subjects soon reach a relative position that changes _ 
little. In the case mentioned, four subjects on the fourth 
day attain relative positions that do not change during 
the rest of the experiment. 
_Relation of Learning to Other Functions.—The rela- 
tion of learning capacity to other mental functions and 
to general intelligence can be determined by correlating 
the results of learning tests with the results of other 
8 of mental tests and with other measures of gen- 
eral intelligence, such as class standing or the estimates 
of teachers. In Table 27 are shown the correlations of 
three learning tests with the results obtained from the 
Amny Alpha test.

If leaming capacity is determined by combining the 
Yesults of the substitution test, marble-sorting test, 
and card-sorting test, and the combined rating corre- 
lated with general intelligence as determined by seven 
| Stoup tests, the correlation is found to be 42. The 
group tests were tests of logical and rote memory, 
{ Word-building, substitution, opposites, completion test, 
{
-P-A-G-E-191
186 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
analogies. The corresponding correlation obtained from 
a different group of students was .467. With this sec- 
ond group of students the substitution test alone gave 
a positive correlation of .42 with general intelligence; 
marble-sorting test, a correlation of .83; and nonsense 
learning, a correlation of .46. 
In a class of 40, class standing was determined by 
three examinations, general intelligence from the re 
sults of seven group tests mentioned above and learm- 
ing capacity by the three learning tests—marble-sort- 
ing, card-sorting, and digit-symbol substitution. The 
following correlations were obtained: : 
Class standing with 
Average of mental tests gives. 
Average of learning tests. 
Logical memory alone. 
Completion alone. 
        The high diagnostic value of learning tests is at onté 
evident. If learning capacity could be determined wi 
absolute accuracy and class standing determined wi 
equal accuracy, the correlation between the two would 
probably not be over .50 or .60, because of the many 
other factors that enter into the determination of class 
standing. Learning capacity is probably the most im 
portant single factor, but previous preparation for the 
course, interest in the course, amount of time spent i0 
study upon the course are important factors in dete 
mining class standing. 
In conclusion it may be said that general learnin8 
capacity can be determined by the use of several form 
of learning tests, and that the results of such tests a 
valid in practical diagnosis.

The amount of regularity to be found in a practice 
experiment, and the relative ranks of the subjects at 
different periods of practice, are shown in Table 28. 
The experiment which furnished the data for this table 
was as follows: Thirteen subjects practiced at a substi- 
tution test, five minutes at a time, four times a day for 
three days. The results for each practice are converted 
to a group average of 50. This enables the reader to 
determine at a glance how each subject stood at any 
time with reference to the group average. It will be 
noticed that some subjects are always above the group 
average and others are always below, while some who 
are close to the average are sometimes a little above and 
at other times a little below. If the first two tests are 
combined and taken as a measure of initial speed, and 
the last two are similarly combined as a measure of 
final speed, and the two arrays correlated, the correla- 
tion is found to be .554. If all those subjects above 
the average are combined into one group and those 
below the average are combined into another group and 
graphs constructed to show their relative position above 
and below the average, we get the results shown in 
Fig. 21. It will be seen that the fast group as a whole 
is fast throughout, and the slow group as a whole is 
slow throughout. 
The actual raw correlation of each practice period 
with the last is as follows: 1, 883; 2, .700; 8, .755; 
4, 834; 5, .793; 6, .767; 7, .861; 8, .9389; 9, .965; 10, 
952; 11, .976. 
In comparing learning capacity in one kind of mate 
rial with that in another, it is of special importance 
that we know just where to apply our measure. If we 
apply it at a point where the curves are still steep, we

are really comparing learning efficiency. If we apply 
it after the curves have become relatively flat, we are 
comparing the efficiency of two different functions. In 
the latter case, the correlation might be high and posi- 
tive or it might be high and negative. 
An important question arises here. What is the re- 
lation of learning capacity to final efficiency? The 
Question can be answered by correlating standing early rz

in the learning curve with standing after the curve has 
become relatively flat. In all such computations made 
by the author, the correlations are found to be positive. 
As a rule, the quick learners have the highest final eff 
ciency. It therefore turns out that although learning 
capacity and final efficiency are different things, they 
are positively related. In a group of learners there is 
not much change of position after practice has pr0- 
ceeded a little way. Of course there is some change of 
position due to the fact that the particular material 
may demand specific abilities that are not possessed in 
the same proportion as learning capacity, and also due 
to different methods used by the learners. In some 
cases an early score is low because of a method that 
does not give good results immediately, but Jater. In 
card-sorting, for example, a low early score may be due 
to the fact that the subject is trying to fix the location 
of boxes in mind. A valid measure of learning should 
be taken late enough for such slow learning to show 
 
-P-A-G-E-196

its effects, perhaps at a point where the curve is most 
convex. In general, then, the learners who stand high 
early in the practice periods, stand high later. This is 
shown in Fig. 20, page 187. It will be noticed that 
those who are high early ‘are high at the end of a prac- 
tice. 
Hollingworth has made a study of the effects of 
Practice on correlations, but his study did not involve 
learning capacity in the sense that we are using it. He 
studied the following functions: adding, opposites, col- 
or-naming, discrimination, cancellation, co-ordination, 
and tapping. The correlation in the preliminary test 
was 41. In the 5th, 25th, 50th, 80th, 130th, and 175th 
Practices, the average correlations of each with all the 
others were respectively .61, .78, .77, .85, .92, and 1.00. 
This increase in the correlation is due to the stabilizing 
of the performances. After 175 practices each of these 
tests measured the same thing, namely reaction time. 
In any kind of motor performance, final efficiency de- 
Pends upon reaction time. In the case of learning ex- 
Periments the author has often found a higher correla- 
tion between early practices than between later ones. 
Ih studying correlations, therefore, we should always 
bear in mind what the things are which we are corre- . 
lating. Burt finds a higher correlation with intelligence 
hefore than after practice in the case of mental tests. 
is is because intelligence is more closely related to 
quickness of learning than to final efficiency, although 
all three are generally in some degree positively related.

CHAPTER X. 
DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING CAPACITY. 
Individual Differences.—When we measure the learn- 
ing capacity of a group of students, we find great indi- 
vidual differences. In Figure 22 is shown the distribu- 
tion of 443 university students with reference to their 
learning capacity. The test used was the substitution 
test, The subjects were all students in the same course 
in educational psychology in successive classes. Men 
and women are included together in the records shown 
inthe figure. There were about one-fifth as*many men 
%8 Women. Efficiency is indicated by the scores shown 
on the horizontal axis. The efficiency scores range 
from 28 to 72. The average of all the scores is 50. The 
Peaks just above and just below 50 are probably due to 
our combining both sexes in the same curve, for the 
Women average ten per cent. better in learning capac- 
ity, as shown by this test, than the men. 
A child’s status in school is determined chiefly by his 
Seneral intellectual ability, but learning capacity is 
doubtless the main factor in intellectual ability. The 
variability in learning capacity is well shown in Figures 
23 and 24. In Fig. 23 is shown the age distribution of 
2943 boys and 3152 girls in the eighth grade of the. 
Detroit schools. It will be seen that eighth grade chil- 
aren range in age from 10 to 17. In Fig. 24 difference 
Inability is shown in a different way. The graphs show

in the city of Detroit. It will be seen that they range 
from the first grade to the ninth. The graphs repre- 
sent 2382 boys and 2457 girls. . 
Collings found the distribution of 112 twelve-year old 
boys in the rural schools of a certain county to be as 
shown in Table 29. The author studied experimentally 
the mental differences of forty-four twelve-year old 
pupils in the schools of a certain small city of Missouri. 
Their distribution through the grades and their men- 
tality as shown by four tests are given in Table 30.

  In four different high schools, the author selected the 
brightest and the dullest pupils on the basis of class 
standing and teachers’ judgments, and determined their 
eneral ability by means of various tests. The tests 
Were somewhat different in different schools. The re- 
sults of all these studies are shown in Table $1. The 
figures, expressed in per cents, in every case indicate - 
the amounts by which the good pupils excelled the poor 
Ones, 
The scores of the bright pupils are, on the average,

Racial Differences in Learning Capacity.—Careful, 
though not extensive, studies have been made of the 
learning capacity of the American Negroes and of the 
native Chinese. In Table 82 Chinese boys and girls 
are compared with American boys and girls. The 
numbers in the table represent the per cent. which the 
Chinese scores are of the American scores for the ages 
shown. In the substitution test alone, the average 
efficiency of the Chinese children is, in the case of boys, 
86.6 per cent. of American learning efficiency, and, in 
the case of girls, 77.9 per cent. If the results of the 
various tests are combined, it is seen that the average 
efficiency of the Chinese is for boys, 84 per cent. and 
for girls, 77 per cent. of that of Americans. In Table 
83a similar comparison is made with the Negroes. The 
average of the norms for the Negro boys is 57 per cent. 
of the average for whites. The average for the Negro 
girls is 60 per cent. of the average for white girls. In 
the substitution test alone, the average score for the 
Negro boys is 44.5 per cent. of the white average. The 
average for Negro girls is 43.7 per cent. of the average 
for white girls. : 
It will be seen that the Chinese, although they were 
at many disadvantages in experience, training, and 
language, compare very favorably with American white 
children, while the Negroes, although at no such disad- 
vantage, show up very poorly. 
The author made an extensive study of Negro ability 
to learn, using for the purpose the marble-sorting 
apparatus mentioned above. The comparisons are 
thown in Figures 80 and 81.

206 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Causes of Individual Differences——The causes of 
individual differences in learning capacity may be 
grouped under two heads, (1) hereditary and (2) 
environmental. The great influence of hereditary 
factors is shown by such studies as Galton’s study of 
twins, Thorndike’s study of twins, Goddard’s study of 
the causes of feeble-mindedness, Galton’s studies of 
hereditary genius, and by various studies of learning 
capacity. 
Galton found that twins that were alike remained 
alike in spite of difference in treatment, and that twins 
that were unlike remained unlike in spite of similarity 
of treatment. Thorndike found the resemblance 
among twins to be greater than the resemblance among 
siblings. Goddard’s extensive studies of feeble-mind- 
edness show heredity to be the chief cause of mental 
defect. In fact, Goddard’s figures seem to show that 
feeble-mindedness is Mendelian and recessive. In 
Galton’s studies, although there is always the question 
as to the part played by favorable family influences 
and training, there seems no question of the prepot- 
perant influence of heredity. In learning experiments, 
it is found that practice does not eliminate differences. 
In some cases, practice decreases, somewhat, individual 
differences, but in no case does it eliminate them. All 
eareful experiments in learning show not only that 
ability to learn is a definite characteristic, but that 
final efficiency at any performance igs definitely de 
pendent upon native, inherent factors, that seem 48 
definite and characteristic as are a person’s height 
and weight, or any other physical features. When & 
group of subjects are started on a learning experiment, 
after a short time, they assume characteristic, definite,
-P-A-G-E-212
DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING CAPACITY 207 
relative positions, that remain constant except for 
minor fluctuations, which are due to temporary causes. 
In the public schools, it is found that children early |. 
, in the grades assume a position in ability with refer- 
ence to their fellows which remains fairly constant in 
the later grades. For a pupil to be poor in one grade 
and good in a later grade is the exception, and probably 
has some clear explanation other than native ability. 
As a rule, bright children continue to be bright and . 
dull children continue to be dull in spite of what may 
happen to them. Special attention has now been given 
‘osubnormal children for many years. It is found that 
‘ven when they are taken early and given the best 
training that science is able to give, they remain sub- 
Tormal in as true a sense as they retain their hair-color 
or their facial features. se 
One of the strongest arguments for the influence of 
hereditary factors comes from a theoretical considera~ 
tion, Biological studies in heredity show that the 
structure of living tissues is dependent upon hereditary. » 
forces. The brain in its structural aspects falls within 
the general category of casuality, is a product of hered- 
ly. The differences in the nervous development of 
different classes and species of animals are clearly 
hereditary, so also are the smaller differences within 
the human race. No one would probably deny that the 
tremendous difference between the idiot and the genius 
8 due primarily to differences in brain structure. 
ere seems no doubt that smaller mental differences 
are also due chiefly to differences in hereditary brain 
structure, : 
An important fact pointing to the influence of here- 
comes from studies concerned with training in:
-P-A-G-E-213
208 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
mental functions. It seems that training has no very 
great influence on simple functions, such as reaction 
time, mental span, speed of association, sensory dis- 
erimination. The ordinary experiences of life bring 
these and other simple mental functions to approxi- 
mately their full possibilities. Much improvement is 
possible in the case of complex mental functions, but 
such improvements are not due to fundamental 
changes in native ability but to tricks and schemes of 
~method and procedure; in most cases they are due to 
the establishing and perfection of some bond or other. 
Environmental Influences.—The relative importance 
of heredity and environment in the life of an individual 
is a question that has been much discussed, and on 
which people have very different opinions. There is 
my, no room for difference of opinion. An appeal to 
e facts shows that heredity and environment are 
complementary, that each makes its own contribution, 
and Which the other can not make. The bodies that we 
have, with their bones and muscles and nerves, come 
from our ancestors; they are the gift of the past. We 
are tall or short, heavy or thin, light or dark, because 
of heredity. Our nervous systems on which all educa 
tional influences must work, are the gifts of heredity. 
The value and efficiencies of these nervous systems 
range all the way from near zero to those having almost 
infinite possibilities. Heredity gives us the raw 
material on which educational influences work. This 
raw material has its possibilities and its limitations. 
Education cannot transcend these limitations, But 
while social influences are limited to the material which 
heredity gives, they are of very great importance 
What this importance is, we must now see.
-P-A-G-E-214
DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING CAPACITY =. 209 
The statistical studies of Cattell* show well the im- 
portance of environment. He found that the Southern 
states have contributed very few men of science as 
compared to the New England states. The man of the 
South is very much the same sort of man as his brother 
of the North. He does not go into science because the 
influences do not urge him in that direction. He be- 
comes a land owner, a man of affairs. In New England 
are our greatest universities. The influences there are 
such as to invite to an educational career, to science, to 
ketters. Nature determines what is possible for us to 
do, The kind of work in which we actually engage is 
largely determined by the influences which surround us. 
. The relative importance of heredity and environment 
's well illustrated by musical ability. Suppose that 
fomewhere in the “backwoods” of the mountains a 
chil is bom having in it the possibilities of a great 
Danist, If the circumstances of life are such that this 
child never even sees a piano, he will never become @ 
Danist. On the other hand, there are children who 
1 never become great pianists, although all the in- 
ences of wealth and science combine to make them. 
he fact is that heredity and environment combine and 
} féive us the outcome of every life. Every act of our 
| flives is the resultant of what we are and of the in- 
fluences that work upon us. The same influences do not 
get the same result from different people because the 
People are different. If you lay side by side on an anvil,

ness and usefulness sometimes fail to save others, 
- because the others are different and do not give the 
x same response to the same stimulus. In the same 
school room the same educational influences work upon 
all the pupils, but some learn fast and others slowly. 
But what we must not lose sight of is that each can 
learn something. Education can make each different 
from what he would otherwise have been. It can not 
make them all alike, it can not make them equally 
efficient, but it can make each more efficient than he 
would otherwise have been. It is well that we recog- 
nise the truth; it is well that we know the facts and 
face them squarely. Social reformers often make the 
mistake of assuming that_the same causes will always 
produce the same effect. The same effect is produced 
only When the same causes act upon the same or equal 
things. And nothing in the world is more unequal 
“than human_heings. On the one hand, we have the 
idiot that can searcely be taught to feed itself; on the other, is a Newton, or a Shakespeare. 
The School and Individual Differences.—Both scien- 
tific studies and common observation show us that there 
are great individual differences in learning capacity. 
The practical question is: What are we to do about it? 
The school can not ignore them. It must take them 
into account. By means of scientific measurements 
and on the basis of actual achievements in the school, 
’ the children should be divided into classes according to 
their ability to learn. A child should be put into a class & 
with other children having about the same ability. 
When this is done, it is possible for us to do what 18 
_ best for each child. Some can go fast; others more 
slowly. Not only will the different groups have differ-
-P-A-G-E-216
DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING CAPACITY 211 
ent learning capacity, but they should learn, to some 
extent, different things, in preparation for fillin; 
widely different places in the world. The distinct, 
sub-normal children should have a very different course 
from that pursued by the great majority of normal 
children, To make this possible, they should be sepa- 
tated from the other children. Their education should 
be almost wholly manual. The unusually bright 
children should also be put into classes by themselves 
tomake it possible for us to do the right thing for them. 
They are to be the leaders of the coming generation. 
In every case, we are to do for each child what is best 
foreach. The dull child has its claim upon us as well 
88 does the bright. We put them into different classes 
only to enable us to do what is best for them. 
EXPERIMENTS AND EXERCISES. 
L. All the experiments so far performed may be 
Wed to show individual differences. Frequency sur- 
can be plotted for each learning test, and for the 
combined scores worked out in the exercises of the 
Preceding chapter. What is the range between the 
best and poorest in the several tests? In the combined 
results?

TRANSFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE. 
Nature of the Problem.—The problem of this chapter 
may be stated in the following words: Will the forma- 
tion of. one habit either help or hinder in the formatio 
ofanother? Will the acquiring of one bit.of knowledg 
help or hinder in acquiring other knowledge? If Ihav 
learned to operate a typewriter having a certain key- 
board will it be either easier or more difficult to learn to 
operate a typewriter having a different keyboard? If 
one has learned to run an automobile will it be either 
‘asier or more difficult to learn to run a machine which 
different types of levers and pedals? Inthe field of 
owledge, does the learning of one language make the 
learning of a different language easier? Will the study 
of history make the acquisition of mathemathics easier? 
n general, are the results of learning narrow and 
Specific, or, are there general effects also? 
The problem raised here is of far-reaching theoretical 
and practical significance. It involves the very founda- 
tion principles of education, and we must face it at 
every turn in practice. It involves our fundamental 
Conception of the nature of mind. Is the mind an entity, 
a unity, of such a nature that it gains strength by exer- 
tise? If so, then the effects of all learning are general, 
and it will make little if any difference what the mind 
does, for whatever it does give it strength to do other 
things, One can train the muscles of his arms by one 
[213]

sort of exercise and his arms will then have strength 
to do other th: . Tean strengthen my arms by chop. 
ping and théy will have strenght for hoeing. Can] 
likewise train my mind by studying mathematics so 
that it will then have power to work in other fields? 
Our answer to these questions will color our whole 
scheme of education. If the results of training are spe- 
cific, then we should learn those things which we most 
need to know, without any reference to their general 
effects. If the results of training are general, then we 
should pick out as the studies for our curriculum those 
branches which are best for the exercise of the mind. 
Much of the misconception and misunderstanding 
with reference to this problem have been due to a mis- 
conception of the nature of mind... Modern psychology 
does not look upon.the mind as an entity that functions 
as a unity and that can gain strength as a whole in 
The “samie sense that-is.true of a muscle. Mind is 4 
, complex, mosaic, of sensation, perception, idea, feeling, and-depends in every--process-uponan-almost infinitely 
complicated nervous structure, Modern conceptions of 
the nature of learning also put a different aspect on the 
problem. In the case of habit-formation, we couple 4 
muscular response to a sensory stimulus. In the cas? 
of ideational learning, very definite brain processes 
which underlie the ideas are coupled together. Whether 
the formation of one such bond has any facilitating of 
inhibiting effect on the formation of another is an & 
perimental question which can not be answered on 4 
priori grounds. Let us turn to the experiments. 
Historical and Critical.=<Experimentatien-in thi 
- lies almost—wholly_in—the—lest—twenty.years. One 
would think that in twenty years a question so simple    
 
-P-A-G-E-220

and straightforward as this could have been definitely 
settled. But such is not the case. It_is not definitely . 
Settled. There is not agreement among psychologists 
themselves, not to mention those who have no scientific 
knowledge of the question. There has been much ex- 
perimentation. The literature is large. But very few 
experiments have been done with sufficient thorough- 
ness and attention to scientific detail to merit the 
respect of an impartial investigator. As one reads the 
experimental literature, one seldom feels, with refer- 
ence to any experiment, that it is final, that it settles 
that aspect of the question with which it deals. Few 
experimenters have repeated their experiments again . 
and again, to see if every result confirmed every other. ° 
Too often the article reporting the experiments is only 
Va “preliminary report.” One usually searches the liter- 
ature in vain to find a “full report” of the “main study.” 
in more than one case, an experimenter has reported 
his resiilts and given his inferences, while another 
Psychologist would claim that different inferences 
Were warranted from the results. Thorndike’s infer- 
ences have been so questioned by Judd; Winch’s, by 
Skight. If educational psychologists are to-tOmmand 
the respect of a scientifle world, they must do their 
Work with such thoroughness that it will stand the tests 
of repetition and criticism. Too often a class exper- 
iment that is scarcely worth anything as a mere demon- 
stration is published as having scientific value. 
A Statement of Method.—Before reviewing the ex- 
terimental literature it will be well to make some en- 
quiry as to the type of experiment required in solving 
ow problem. We-must take a group of subjects and 
have them form a habit which we shall call “X,” and
-P-A-G-E-221
216 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
then have them form another habit, “Y,” and determine 
whether the formation of “Y” was easier because of 
their having previously formed habit “X.” But how 
are we to know whether the second habit is easier of 
formation than the first? The only way we can be sure 
of this point is to have a second group form the second 
habit. The only difference between the groups must 
be that one has formed habit “X,” and the other has 
not. Both are to form the second habit; only one is to 
form the first. The groups must be equal in every 
other respect; or, if not equal, the differences must be 
accounted for. Of course, if there is any way of com- 
paring the difficulty of the two habits, the control group 
is not necéssary. If, for example, we know that two 
habits are of equal difficulty, then we can have our, 
subjects form first one, then the other. If the second 
is formed more easily than the first, then we can say 
that the effects of the first are favorable in the forma 
tion of the second. In some cases, such procedure is 
permissible. 
Much of the earlier experimentation is worthless be- 
cause the experimenter used no control group. Some of 
the later experiments algo suffer from this defect. 
Ebert and Meumann’s extensive memory experiments 
are worthless because of the lack of a control group. 
These experimenters gave their subjects practice in 
one aspect of memorising, and found improvement in 
other aspects. Later, Dearborn repeated the expeti- 
ments and found that the control group improved about 
as much as Meumann’s group that had the practice. 
Further explanation will make the matter of method 
clear. Suppose there are ten aspects of memory, and 
we wish to learn whether training in aspect number 5 <
-P-A-G-E-222
  TRANSFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE 217 
will improve all the other nine aspects. We take a 
group of people and measure all 10 aspects of memory; 
we then train the group in aspect number 5 until there 
is great improvement and then measure again in the. 
other nine aspects. Suppose we find that there is im-_ 
provement in all the other nine aspects; we can not say 
that it is due to the practice in number 5, because, for 
all we know to the contrary, the group might have made 
this improvement without the practice. It may be that 
if we give the ten tests and then wait a few weeks and 
give teri similar tests again, there will be considerable _ 
improvement. In fact, such is usually the case. We must, 
therefore, in an experiment of this kind, ~~ 
groups and give one group the initial and fin: 
give the other group the same initial and fine 
the special practice besides. Then whatever unercurse 
in the final tests are not otherwise accounted for, may 
be considered to be due to the practice. 
Evidence from Card-sorting.—-A very simple experi- 
ment in card-sorting will serve to bring the problem of 
transfer clearly before us. Suppose we take a card- 
Sorting apparatus which has on each side six rows of 
five boxes each, thirty boxes on each side, sixty in all. 
Suppose we learn a row a day until we have learned the 
12 rows. Will the mastery of each succeeding row be 
easier because of our having learned the rows before? 
The answer is yes. The following record is typical: A 
‘subject spends six days with one side of the box. Each 
Yow has different numbers from the preceding rows. 
Each succeeding row is learned with greater ease. 
After waiting two weeks, the other side of the box is 
med. This other side has the same numbering as 
the first side, but the numbers are differently arranged.
-P-A-G-E-223
218 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
The average number of cards sorted per minute for the 
first six rows were 538, 60, 64, 67, 75, 79. For the next 
six rows, the records were 78, 80, 80, 84, 91, 90. These 
records would raise a very strong suspicion in any mind 
to the effect that learning to sort cards into a row of 
numbered boxes would make learning to sort into a row 
of boxes with different numbers easier. We wonder 
whether all subjects will behave as did this one. Such 
proves to be the case. The author has repeated the ex- 
periment with different subjects and different groups 
and in all cases it is found that learning to sort cards 
into one row of numbered boxes makes learning to sort 
into another row with different numbers, easier. 
The experiment just described was repeated with a 
group of 47 students. The group, however, sorted for 
only five days, learning a new row each day. Ten sort- 
ings a day were made in each case. The average time 
in seconds for each of the five successive rows was a3 
follows: 28.2, 20.5, 19.7, 18.7, 18.2. The average time 
for the fifth row was 27 per cent. less than for the first 
row.. The single subject reported above reached an 
efficiency on the fifth day 41 per cent. better than was 
reached on the first day with the first row. 
Still another card-sorting experiment was performed 
as follows: A group of four university students sorted 
eards for fifteen days, using ond side of the box contain- 
ing 30 compartments, then fifteen days using the other 
side of the box having the same number of compart 
ments. The thirty boxes on one side had the same num- 
bers as the boxes on the other side, but the arrange 
ment of the numbers was different. In the sorting of 
the second period, therefore, the habits of the first 
period had to be broken up. In spite of the inhibition
-P-A-G-E-224

trom the first set of habits, on the fifth day of the sec- 
ond experiment, a speed was reached as great as that 
attained in fifteen days in the first part of the experi- 
i ‘ment. The results of this experiment are shown 
graphically in Figure 32.

220 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
These simple experiments leave no doubt that the 
experience gained from sorting cards into one row of 
boxes makes it easier to learn to sort into another row 
of boxes having different numbers, or having the same 
numbers differently arranged. Two important ques- 
tions now arise. (1) What are the causes of this im- 
provement in ability to learn? (2) Does the improve- 
ment in ability to learn extend to other kinds of learn- 
ing? The second question we shall leave for later dis- 
cussion. The first question can be partially answered 
now. (1) Facility was gained in manipulating the cards. 
This increased facility improved the scores from day to 
day. Proof that increased facility is a factor comes 
- from the following experiment: Two subjects were re 
quired to deal a set of playing cards into a compart- 
ment. The time became less from day to day. The 
records for the two subjects for 15 days were as fol- 
lows: 
Sub- ject. Daysl 2 38 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 19 14 16 Annee 17.6 14.6 11.9 10.5 9.7 9.5 85 7.7 7.5 6.9 5.9 5.4 5.3 49 ‘3

The records are in terms of seconds required to deal 
out the 52 cards, all into the same compartment. It will 
be seen that the time required the 12th day was about 
70 per cent. less than that required the first day. See 
figure 6, page 25. 
(2) A second probable factor was increased ability to 
recognize the numbers of the cards. (3) A third factor 
was the learning of schemes by which the locations of 
numbers were associated and fixed. It is possible that 
subjects learn how to hold themselves to the task and 
resist distracting influences. One also learns how to 
hold the body, how to use the hands to best advantage,
-P-A-G-E-226
  span 
a TRANSFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE 221 
how to get the cards out of the pack in the quickest 
way, All of these factors and probably others operate. 
to reduce the time of learning the successive rows of 
boxes. ° 
Other Similar Experiments.—Coover and Angell find 
that practice in card-sorting increases efficiency in 
typewriting. Bair’s experiments are identical with the 
card-sorting experiments of the author’s reported in the 
paragraphs above, except that he used the typewriter, 
tequiring his subjects to master successive types. of 
keyboard. He changed the keys from one experiment 
to another by putting caps on them. Six labeled keys 
constituted a series, and 20 series were learned. The 
average number of seconds required by four subjects 
for the first series was 73.4. For the twentieth series 
the time was 57.5, or 21 per cent. less. 
Experiments in Memorising.——We shall pass over the 
early experiments of James and their repetition by 
EetersenWithout comment. As is well known, James 
tock the position that memory in the sense of retention 
could not be improved. .The most extensive experi- 
ments on the transfer of memory training have been 
Performed by Fracker, Winch, and Sleight. The exten- - 
sive experiments of Ebert-and. Meumann-were repeated 
y Dearborn. As was mentioned above, Ebert and 
Meumann did not use a control group. Dearborn gave 
4 group the initial and final tests to determine how 
much of the improvement which the German experi- 
Menters attributed to the practice was due to improve- 
Ment from the initial to the final test. He found that 
the improvement of the final test over the first was 
about as much as the improvement of Ebert and Meu- 
Mann’s training group. In some cases, the improve- 
Ment was more.
-P-A-G-E-227
222 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Fracker trained a group in memorising the order of 
_ four different intensities of the same tuning fork, and 
determined the spread of improvement to similar per- 
formances such as memory for four grays, and to dis- 
similar performances, such as memory for poetry, geo- 
metrical figures, etc. In the similar memorising, the 
improvement was 16 per cent. more than the control 
group. In the dissimilar memories, the improvement 
was only 3.75 per cent. more than the control group. 
Winch performed two series of experiments on Lon- 
don school children. One group was trained in memo- 
rising poetry, and the transfer to memory for prose 
material in geography and history was determined. In 
one case the improvement was 10 per cent. more than 
the control group, and in another, 5 per cent. In a sec- 
ond series of experiments the training group was prac- 
ticed in the rote memorising of meaningful and also of 
meaningless material. The transfer of the training to 
substance memory was determined. The transfer was 
very slight; the residual gain over the control group 
was about 3.3 per cent. on the initial ability. 
The most extensive and careful experiments on the 
transfer of memory training are those of Sleight. He 
trained one group in memorising poetry, another in 
memorising tables, and another in memorising prose. 
2 initial and final tests in many different aspects 
torising. His results show that training in one 
of memorising gives little or no increased effi- 
n other types of memorising. Sleight conducted 
uwo independent experiments, one with school children 
and one with two classes of women students 18 to 19 
years old. The results obtained from the latter are 
shown in Table 84. The column to the left shows the

aspect of memory tested. Group 1 was the unpracticed 
group; group 2 was practiced in poetry; group 3, in 
learning tables; group 4, in learning the substance of. 
prose. The figures indicate the improvement divided by 
the standard deviation. The practice covered a period 
of twelve days, one-half hour a day. A study of the table 
shows that there is no general improvement of mem-{” 
ory. In nine cases the unpracticed group improved more. 
in the aspects of memory tested than did the practiced 
group. In three cases the practiced group made a poorer . 
record in the final tests than they had made in the ini- 
tial tests, .

not in learning prose substance. Practice in learning 
poetry gives more facility in learning nonsense syllables, 
but very little more in learning tables than the unprac- 
ticed group gained, and not nearly so much gain in 
learning prose substance as was gained by the. unprac- 
ticed group. These examples are sufficient to enable the 
reader to interpret the table. 
Interpretation of Memory Experiments.—The mem- 
ory experiments are essentially the same as the card- 
sorting experiments first discussed. In card-sorting, the © 
subjects spent a certain period of time in fixing the 
association between a certain series of numbers and 
their corresponding boxes. They then built up another 
series of connections between other numbers and other 
boxes. We found that the first experience facilitated 
the later habit-formation. In the memory experiments, 
the subjects were given practice in building up the 
bonds necessary to enable them to recite, verbatim, 
poetry. It was found that this experience gave in- 
creased facility in learning dates and nonsense syllables, 
slightly increased facility in learning prose verbatim, 
but none in learning prose substance or in learning let- 
ters. Practice in learning tables gave increased facility 
in learning dates and prose substance, slight increase 
in learning nonsense syllables, but none in learning 
poetry or prose verbatim or letters. Practice in learn- 
ing prose substance did not give increased facility in 
learning any of the other types of material. All the 
memory experiments are in substantial agreement. 
They show that experience in one type of learning may 
either facilitate or hinder another type. 
Discriminative Judgments.—The experiments to be 
reported under this head are quite different from those
-P-A-G-E-230
TRANSFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE 225 
above discussed. They consisted in giving subjects prac- 
tice in making a certain type of judgments, and then 
determining whether this practice facilitated or hin- - 
dered the making of other types of judgements. In one. 
type of experiment the judgment of experimenters is: 
unanimous. In reaction experiments, practice in react- 
ing to stimuli in one sense department gives facility in 
reaction to stimuli from other sense departments. Gil- 
bert and Fracker, for example, found that simple and. 
choice reactions to sound stimuli reduced the reaction 
time to touch and visual stimuli. He did not, however, 
use 2 control group. Coover and Angell did in similar 
experiments, and obtained a similar result. . 
Thorndike and Woodworth gave subjects practice in 
estimating various types of magnitude, such as lines, 
and surfaces, and weights. They found the effects of 
Practice very narrow. Training in the estimation of 
the lengths of lines gave facility in estimating similar 
lengths but not in the case of lines very much longer 
or shorter. Judd however finds that practice in judg- 
Ments of location of lines in one position facilitated 
similar judgments when the lines were in different posi- 
tions, and that the influence of practice in making judg- 
ments concerning the Miiller-Lyer illusion figure, was 
effective when judgments were made with the figure 
under different conditions. The situation with refer- 
enee to this type of experiment is not so clear as in the 
case of the other experiments so far considered. There 
has not been sufficient repetition of experiments in the 
field of discriminative judgments to settle the question 
of the extent of transfer.

Transfer of Knowledge.—A few typical experiments 
will show the results of the transfer of knowledge to 
the mastery of a new situation. Judd tested subjects in 
shooting at a target under water. The subjects who

that of Ruger with puzzles, and those «

the most extensive experiment of all, mos

Were given initial and final tests in non-geometrical 
material, quasi-geometrical material, and geometrical 
material. The non-geometrical material consisted in 
Mental division, two tests, and in making words using 
the letters in the word M-A-T-E-R-I-A-L. The quasi- 
Seometrical test was a test in straight-line lettering. 
There were two geometrical tests, one which Rugg calls 
the painted cube test and the other a test in imaging 
objects and determining how many lines would be neces- 
Sary to construct them in space. The painted cube test 
was this: A three-inch cube is painted on all sides, 
how many one-inch cubes have paint on three sides? 
On two sides? On one side? On no side? 
Results.-In one of the division tests, the practice

test, the residual gain of the practice group over the 
Control group was 15.78 per cent. The average residual
-P-A-G-E-233
228 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
gain in these two experiments was 7.44 per cent. In the 
word-building test, the residual gain of the practice 
group was 13.37 per cent. As this test was given, it 
was subject to direct influence from the practice in 
descriptive geometry. Holding the word and the let- 
ters in mind would be easier by virtue of the practice in 
visualising in descriptive geometry. The improvement 
in the quasi-geometrical test was 20.4 per cent:; while 
the improvement in geometrical material was 31.25 per 
cent. In each case, the gain is the residual gain over 
the control group. These, then, are the residual gains 
for the three types of test,—7.44 per cent., 20.4 per 
cent., and 31.25 per cent. Or, if we average the word- 
building test in with the two division tests, we have for 
the jnon-geometrical tests, a residual gain of 9.42 per 
cent. 
This criticism should be passed on the experiment. 
While the division tests are non-geometrical, they are 
mathematical and the engineers would have more train- 
ing in mathematical calculations during the semester 
than would the 72 education students. All the tests are 
too closely allied to the practice in descriptive geometry. 
Why did not Rugg test his two groups in something 
further removed from the practice, say in learning the 
English equivalents of Latin words or Chinese words. 
As the experiment stands, however, it falls in line with. 
the other experiments already reported. Some transfer

‘ous factors that are likely to influence the results of his 
experiment, the impartial reader is likely to feel that

mastering the new; other aspects will not, and may 
actually hinder in mastering the new. 
Interpretation and Explanation of the Results—The 
following factors probably explain most of the phe- 
Nomena of transfer:        
      
-P-A-G-E-235
230 ‘ THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
(1) Identical elements. (a) In habit-forination. If 
habit X is To , and afterward, a complex habit Y is 
formed—a habit in which X is a constituent part— 
then Y is more easily formed because of the previous 
formation of habit X. To illustrate: Addition is a 
part of multiplication. Multiplication is more easily 
mastered if addition i is previously mastered,, In.general,. 
cilitate the mastery_of 
qny_other-process in-whict the-one frst mastered isa~ 
~fansttinent park. (b) In knowledge-getting. What is 
true in habit-formation is also true in knowledge-get- 
ting. Acquiring one bit of knowledge facilitates the 
acquisition of other related knowledge. The mastery 
of zoology is easier after the mastery of botany, for 
many facts are common to the two sciences, and their 
methods are largely the same, the tools of study and 
investigation, largely the same. For example, one 
learns to use the microscope in one study and this skill 
is profitable in the other. One learns many facts about 
cells, development, and heredity in the one that con- 
tribute to an understanding of the other. Similarly, 
mastery of Latin assists in the study of French because 
of common elements in the vocabularies. Higher math- 
ematics involves algebra; physics and chemistry involve 
mathematics. In general, any study will be more easily 
mastered if the learner has previously acquired knowl- 
edge that contributes to an understanding or explana- 
tion of the principles of this study, or a method that can 
he successfully used init. — 
(2) Attitudes, and Methods of Attack.—In learning 
ne thing, a person not only forms a definite habit or 
rets definite knowledge, but gets a general scheme of 
ttack, a point of view or a method that will be carried
-P-A-G-E-236
TRANSFERENCE AND INTERFERENCE 281 | 
into other situations. In sorting cards into one row of 
" boxes, one not only forms the definite bonds involved, 
but forms schemes of association which assist the mem- 
ory and are available in learning to sort into a different 
. tow of boxes. In mastering any study, one. not. only 
masters the content of that study, but learns a certain 
method of mastery, and this method he carries into the - 
mastery of another study. Some aspects of the method 
may be applicable in that other study, some may not. 
In solving puzzles, as Ruger found, subjects learn cer- 
tain principles, certain schemes of solving puzzles which 
are applied to the solution of new puzzles. They may ‘ 
Work, they may not, it depends on the puzzle. In 
" stienee one learns always to look for causes. One comes 
totake the attitude that every phenomenon has a cause. 
This attitude of looking for causes, the scientist carries 
into the solution of new problems. The mathematician 
forms the general attitude of trying to get a quantita- 
tive statement to apply to every fact or condition. He 
‘always wants to get some sort of graph or curve to see 
What light it may throw on the nature of his data. The 
lawyer, the doctor, the minister, form attitudes peculiar 
to their profession. Out of most studies, there come, 
therefore, not only specific content of habit and knowl- 
edge, but by-products of method, attitude, and definite 
schemes of orientation. 
(3) Ideals. Related to attitudes are ideals_of accu- 
Jacy, ideals of thoroughness, ideals of intellectual hon- 
esty, ideals of perseverance, ideals of doing-one’s_best 
Under all circumstances, and these ideals may carry 
Over into new experiences. Of course, ideals may have 
all degrees of generality, but whatever degree of gener- 
ality they have, they carry over from one experience to
-P-A-G-E-237
232 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
others. Honesty, for example, can be general or can 
apply only to certain types of situation. It is important 
to know that it can be general, and usually zs general. 
A human being is very much of a piece, and general 
principles color our whole life. It may be, as Bagley 
holds, that idéals of neatness may be either specific or 
general, but it is important to know that they can have 
generality. All ideals have some degree of getierality. 
Honesty and truthfulness, if we possess them at all, to 
some extent permeate our being and enter into all our 
acts. A person can form an ideal which will not allow’ 
him to do a poor piece of work. Such an ideal then af- 
fects all he does. He is unwilling to do anything poorly. On the other hand, one can have such an ideal which 
applies only to certain work. In doing other work, he 
will not care. But we do get ideals and we do carry 
them over to other work. 
(4) Confidence. Successful mastery of a problem or 
a process gives confidence in attacking ‘similar prob- 
lems, and this confidence is no small factor in leading to 
success with these problems. It enables one to put 
forth all his energy and to persist til] success comes. 
This factor is of unusual importance in education. For 
example, if a child is fortunate in his early experience 
with mathmetics, he succeeds. He likes it because he 
succeeds. He studies mathemathics more and more be- 
cause he likes it. The more he studies it, the more 
power he has in it. On the other hand if he is unfor- 
tunate, he does not like mathematics, he has not faith 
in his ability in it. As time goes by, he has Jess and 
less power in it because of neglect of it. And in general, 
success or failure has a great effect on our lives because

of the effects they have on our future efforts. The man 
who succeeds, has more and more confidence in his abili- 
ties, He comes to attack all problems. 
dence, and this attitude has a great deal todo with ¥ 
continued success. While failure makes one distrust 
his powers, he attacks problems with a faint heart and 
little courage, and is doomed to failure. Success breeds 
success, and failure breeds failure. 
(5) Attention. There is no question that certain , 
ipects of what..we call attention can be trained and have some degree of generality. In the first placeone

Latin, for example, to set m

arly life of children, we can somewhat extend the range 
of attention. One can learn through practice in so-called

mind for mental manipulation. The influence of this 
training is not wholly narrow and specific, 
Other factors of transfer have been given by various 
writers, but they are merely other names for the fac- 
tors which we have enumerated. The fact is, all these 
factors might well be called, as done by Thorndike, 
identical elements. Habits, knowledge, ideals, and atti- 
tudes that result from our experience are carried into 
new experiences, and color and affect those new experi- 
ences. It could not be otherwise. Wee. have nothing to ‘(erty into-a new experience b but our old experience. But 
it will be a mistake if we suppose that our old experi- 
/ ence will always be helpful, will always be adequate. 
4 We shall make a mistake if we assume that certain 
inds of training will give the mind strength in general 
nd make it able to cope with all kinds of situations. We 
form certain habits and acquire certain knowledge. 
This is all we have to help us in a new situation. Some

of knowledge might help in a given situation, but it 
will be of no avail unless something in the new situation

speak of the mind having power and of increasing that 
power. But the only sense in which the mind can have 
power is in the person’s possessing available habits and 
. knowledge and methods applicable to the situation in 
question, and in the habits and knowledge being 
brought to bear through properly organised association. ee

There is nothing mythical or mysterious about the 
whole matter. Either all experience transfers or none 
of it does; it all depends on how we look at the matter. 
A given muscular response must have its adequate 
stimulus or it does not come. A needed idea does not 
come to consciousness except by some organised asso- 
ciative route. The mind has power if it has available 
and usable habits, knowledge, and attitudes. 
Generalised Experience.—The discussion of the pre- 
ceding paragraph leads us to consider a matter clearly 
Presented by Judd, namely the importance of generalis- 
ing our experience. Whether and to what extent habits, 
knowledge, ideals, and attitudes function in a new ex- 
Perience depend to a large extent upon their organisa- 
tion, In the various branches of study, one gets various 
facts about the world. These facts are abstract and 
isolated. To be useful in the future they must have an 
interorganisation that will make them available when 
they can be useful. One of the great dangers of school 
and college instruction is abstraction and isolation. We. 
too often learn facts out.of-their natural setting, and 
When such setting comes, the facts do not come to mind 
because they have never really been coupled to that 
situation. It is the duty of teachers and parents to as- 
sist children in learning things in as nearly as possible 
their natural setting and in making helpful and profit- 
able associative connections, so that the knowledge will 
he usefully available in the future. Book-learning.as

-P-A-G-E-241
236 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
remembered situations in which it is likely to be helpful. 
All isolated facts must be organised not only with ref- 
erence to our experience, but with reference to other 
facts, laws and principles, so that we can go in thought 
from one fact to other related facts. The mere having 
an experience is no guarantee that the experience will 
come up in memory and help us when it might be help- 
ful. Whether it comes or not depends on organization. 
Every phenomenon has intricate and far-reaching re 
lations to other phenomena. For us to profit from our 
experience with a phenomenon, we must know its rela- 
tions. Truly knowing the phenomenon means knowing 
these relations. We do not know a fact in any helpful 
way until we have generalised it and carried the gen- 
eralisation over to its multitude of applications. This 
discussion carries us back to our previous discussion of 
meaning. The important thing about a fact is its mean- 
ing, its relation to the world of other facts. 
It turns out that those psychologists who hold to the 
specific nature of learning are right. All learning con- 
sists in bonds. But these bonds can be of such nature 
as to make our learning more or less generally avail- 
able. Indeed, our solution of a new problem will de 
pend upon such general availability. If I can not solve 
a problem by using: remembered facts and remembered 
methods or other methods which they suggest I am 
_ not likely to solve the problem, unless by fortunate acci- 
’ dent. Even the accident is likely to be the result of 
persistent attack which previous experience has taught 
me.

usetome, Briefly, we are always to ask in the face of 
anew fact, what does it mean? What new light does 
‘ it throw on my world? What are its consequences? 
What facts are related to it? In what generalisation 
does it find a place? What are the uses to be made 
of it?

discipline in this sense has any foundation. Years 5pé 
studying mathematics would help us to solve prob- 
lems where mathematical knowledge would be helpful 
and where its method would be available, but would no 
help us to solve other problems. It is true that nearly 
all problems have a quantitative aspect. Mathematical

edge, ideals, and attitudes which they give me. There 
fore, every study must have in itself its only justifica- 
tion. Every study must stand on its own legs. I must 
study neither Latin nor zoology for any general myth-

the habits, knowledge, and ideals which they do give 
me. If Latin has anything in itself worth while which

lnterference——The problem to be considered here is’ 
the result of trying to’ form two mutually interfering 
habits at the same time. The most extensive experi- 
ments bearing directly upon this problem have been 
mith card-sorting. Brown used playing cards, having 
his subjects sort them into four piles according to suit. : 
i Y used one scheme one day and a different scheme * 
enext day, and so continued to alternate from day to

Thave performed extensive experiments similar to

The boxes were numbered from 11 to 40. The cards 
Were numbered correspondingly, five to each number. 
One group of four subjects sorted an hour a day for 15 
with one arrangement of the boxes and then for 15 
8 with a different arrangement of the boxes. The 
had the same numbers in both cases, but a differ- 
eat arrangement. Another group of subjects sorted

the best. My experiment is essentially different from 
Brown’s. Sorting cards into four piles is a different 
sort of thing from sorting them into 30 piles. When 
one sorts playing cards into four piles, he very quickly 
gets the pattern of the arrangement, and after only a 
few minutes, sorts with great speed. But this is not 
tre when the number of bonds to be formed is great. 
Although my four subjects using the alternating 
method were slightly better learners than the other 
group, the results of their method were poorer. On 
the basis of my experiments, I should say that if one 
has two complicated sets of mutually interfering motor 
habits to form, the most economical procedure is to 
form one set, then the other. 
That two mutually interfering sets of habits can exist — 
tide by side in the same individual has been estab- 
ed by many investigators. In the card-sorting 
Work of Miss Howe, already mentioned in previous 
thapters, practice with two interfering habits was car- 
hed further than has ever been done before. Her ex- 
Periment extended over a period of seven months. She 
Practiced on one scheme till she acquired great speed, 
then acquired speed in the other scheme. She alter- 
tated from one scheme to the other during the same 
hour, continuing with one scheme, however, till she 
| Reached maximum speed, then turning to the other. 
Finally, she alternated directly from a sorting with one 
“®heme to the other. At her last sitting, she made the 
following records, which are the number of seconds re- 
Qred for sorting the 150 cards: (The first number 
Rpresents one scheme; the second, the other, and so 
oi) 112, 112, 112, 112, 110, 107, 116, 120, 112, 117,
-P-A-G-E-247
242 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
This represents the placing of the cards at the rate of 
about two-thirds of a second to each card, which is a 
very great speed. 
An interesting question is: Is habit interference 
greater with fast learners or with slow learners? 
Brown found that interference was greater with fast 
learners but that they overcame it quickly. My own 
experiments seem to confirm Brown’s conclusion, but 
the matter is not definitely settled, and forms an inter- 
esting problem for the future. Interference is certainly 
very different with different individuals. In the mirror 
writing experiment, which involves the interference of 
old habits in the formation of new, some subjects can 
write the whole alphabet in two or three minutes, while 
some subjects can not do it in a whole afternoon. Just 
what causes this great difference has not yet been 
determined. We do not yet know just what type of 
person suffers most from interference, nor do we know 
whether it is an advantage or.a disadvantage to suffer 
from interference. If one’s old habits resist change, 
that makes for stability; on the other hand, it works 
against progress when progress means the breaking 
up of old habits.

CHAPTER XII. 
FATIGUE AND LEARNING. 
Nature of Fatigue.—The subject of fatigue has been 
studied by both psychologists and physiologists. Many 
experiments have been performed. The literature of 
thesubject is voluminous. It is difficult to sift the mass 
of results and determine what is established and what 
Snot. The results, in many cases, are conflicting and 
Neonclusive. The phenomena of fatigue are so.com- 
«x, and so combined with all sorts of other phenomena 
‘hat the experimenter finds it difficult to assign results 
their proper causes. The phenomena nearly always 
‘pear in connection with practice effects, the one off- 
tetting the other. Moreover, an adequate measure of 
gue, universally applicable, has not yet been dis- 
ee Many of the physiological phenomena due to mon are also produced by other causes. Fatigue ju ces inability to work, but the work curve also falls

Present such facts of practical importance as seem 
t ‘finitely established. And, in spite of the fact 
the psychology of fatigue can not be finally and 
tein) Y written, there is a respectable body of facts 
¥ well established. ; 
to peactigue of an organ is merely a reduced capacity 
ianstion brought on by work. In the functioning of 
‘tious organs of the body, their tissues are torn

down and the products of the katabolic processes are 
eliminated by various excreting organs. [When work is 
of such amount that the waste products can not be 
éliminated as fast as produced, they are scattered over 
the body by the ci y_the circulation and produce the effect 
known as fatigue. This effect is essentially incapacity 
to work. That the toxic substances produced in our 
bodies by the functioning of its organs lower their ca- 
pacity to function is definitely known, but just how 
they produce this ineapacity is not known. It seems 
pretty clear that it is a nervous phenomenon. The 
fatigue poisons seem to lessen the conductivity of the 
nerves, thereby lowering their functioning capacity. 
Fatigue is therefore loss of ability to work, not so much 
because of lack of energy as because the energy is not 
available. 
The recent discoveries of a German physiologist 
seem to make conclusive the evidence that fatigue is 
due to certain toxic substances produced in the body. 
He found that certain antitoxins which he introduced 
into the body of his subjects counteracted the toxins 
produced by work. His experiments were conducted 
with guinea pigs and school children. By injecting the 
antitoxin into guinea pigs, he lessened fatigue in them. 
On school children, he performed the following experi- 
ment. A number of school children were divided into 
groups. The children of each group were required to 
do hard work in arithmetic. One group worked in 4 
room the air of which contained the antitoxin. The 
pupils of this room suffered less from fatigue than the 
children who did not breathe air containing the anti 
toxin.
-P-A-G-E-252
FATIGUE AND LEARNING 247 
Measures of Fatigue.—Nearly every sort of. mental 
and physical performance has been used as a measure 
of fatigue. In the earlier work some kind of physical 
test was usually used, especially aesthesiometry and 
dynamometry. The attempt was also made to deter- 
mine the presence of fatigue by changes in the circu- 
lition and respiration. While fatigue does produce defi- 
tite changes in both circulation and respiration, these 
changes are also produced by other causes, and are inti- 
mately connected with the emotions. Therefore when 
these changes occur, it is difficult to know what factor 
what combination of factors has produced them. In 
Practice, it is difficult to use any of the physiological 
methods with any degree of certainty. The school 
teacher is concerned with the fatigue of children due to 
hental work. As a measure of mental fatigue, certain 
Uental tests have proved far more successful than any 
tt the Physiological methods. A fairly successful 
Method of measuring general mental fatigue is to take 
"Measure of some simple mental function after first 
sing the function to-maximum efficiency through 
 Mactice. For example, we can use auditory memory 
Bator digits. We first bring this span up to its maxi- 
tm through practice. Then we apply the test as a 
Measure of fatigue on the assumption that fatigue will 
Ww the memory span. This is typical of the more 
Recess] fatigue experiments. The purpose of bring-

Another successful method of studying fatigue is to “ 
ite the decrease in efficiency of some task continu-

  ously performed. School children can be kept at work 
continuously on some definite school task, as an exercise | 
in arithmetic, and measures be taken of their efficiency | 
at successive intervals of time. If practice effects ar 
eliminated or accounted for, the amount of fatigue is 
_ indicated by the loss in efficiency. Such a method was 
used by Thorndike, Arai, and others. 
Kinds of Fatigue—-When fatigue is occasioned by 
mental work, it is called mental fatigue, when it is ocesr | 
sioned by muscular work it is called bodily or physical 
fatigue. Its nature is the same however caused. 
fatigue is very great, its effects are general; if not very 
great, its effects may be to some extent only local of 
specific. Owing to the effects of less of interest ie 
work, it is difficult to determine to what extent fatigue 
* is general. Some experiments seem to indicate 
in the case of mental fatigue, there is still ability 
do physical work. And when one is so fatigued that he 
can not pursue the same kind of mental work profitably 
it is often found that he can do some other kind of | 
mental work with profit. This is probably not because 
mental fatigue_is to a very great extent specific, but 
betause Tes relative. One can pursue one kind of 
mental work Till the fatigue is so great for the interest 
in that subject that further work is not profitable, while 
work will still be profitable in another field where it 
est is fresh. This is not because there is more et 
for the other field but because interest makes the & 
ergy available. Common experience as well as experr 
ments seem to indicate that when mental fatigue ¥ 
very great, one is incapacitated for any kind of m 
work. On purely a priori grounds, it would seem tht 
fatigue must necessarily be rather general, for 38 ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
FATIGUE AND LEARNING 249 
fatigue poisons accumulate, the circulation will scatter 
them till they affect the entire nervous system. In- 
' capacity to work due to fatigue seems not to be because 
of depletion of the nervous or muscular tissue but is due 
to the effects of the poisons upon the nervo! stem. 
| Certainly, very great fatigue due to muscular work in- 
tapacitates one for serious mental work. Winch’s ex- 
| Mtiments with the students in evening schools would 
- €em to corroborate this view. These students were for 
| the most part clerks who during the day were engaged 
jin work chiefly physical. They fatigued so readily in 
the work of the night school, that Winch drew the con- 
tlusion that such work was not profitable. 
Fatigue of School Children.—The first important 
Tactical question to raise is concerning the amount of 
fatigue occasioned in-school children by the ordinary 
York of the day. Careful experiments have been per- 
formed by several investigators which throw light on 
question. The experiments of Winch, Gates, 
| fore’ Heck and others are fairly unanimous to the 
ithe that the regular work of the school occasions very 
“qpectigue. Winch found that children 6 and 7 years 
‘die mere_fatigued in the afternoon than were 
dren 11years old, and those 11 years old more than 
tiga ees old. The extensive studies of Heck on . 
sue of school children led him to the following con- 
, 0h, which I give in his own words :+¢‘Mental fa- 
getitzelation to the daily school program is far less “ 
wp eenerally believed. The small amount of fatigue . 
teable during the school day was more probably 
te, t by improper conditions of ventilation, lighting, 
ais by the school work itself. Unhygienic con- 
; in the school and physical defects, however
-P-A-G-E-255
250 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
slight, in the children are undoubtedly the great causes 
of fatigue in most schools. The decrease in quality of 
work of children as the day advances, supposed to be 
more or less general in schools, is due less to a using 
up of the energy-producing materials in the nerve cells 
of ;the body and an autopoisoning of the nervous sys- 
tem by the waste products from this process, than to 
a loss of interest in the school work with its lack of 
vital and varied appeal and its monotony of instruction 
and_enyironment. The bored child unconsciously of 
consciously, rebels and does a less correct amount of 
work. Continued work produces boredom and continued 
boredom decreases efficiency, on account of the close 
mutual relation between physiological processes and , 
mental attitudes. With sound bodies, a hygienic school, 
proper classification, frequent relaxation, a_vital_an 
varied curriculum, and live teachers, most children will 
show no problem of fatigue in relation to the daily 
_School program. However, the individual variations | 
in fatigue in children of the same class are so great - 
that the teacher is under constant obligation to wateb 
the easily fatigued child and decrease his work when- 
ever necessary below the requirement for the class a8 
a whole.” The work of Thorndike leads to a similar 
conclusion. Under the author’s direction extensive eX- 
perinients have been carried out in several city school 
systems in three states to determine the learning capa- 
. city at the end of the day as compared with the learn- 
ing capacity at the beginning of the school day. I did | 
; attempt to measure fatigue, but to find an answer \ 
this question&Is the capacity of school children to | 
yn in the late afternoon any less than it is at the 
rinning of the school day? The Whipple digit-symbol 
  =e
-P-A-G-E-256
FATIGUE AND LEARNING 251 
substitution test was used in these experiments. The 
results of the various experiments were in general 
agreement. The ability to learn just before dismission . 
in the afternoon was only about 2 per cent. less than in ' 
the morning. Our results are therefore in agreement 
with those of Heck and Thorndike. , _ 
The Course of Daily Efficiency.—Similar to the ques- 
tion just discussed is the problem of the change of 
working efficiency during the course of the day. But 
this is not precisely the same question, although it is 
telated to the question of fatigue. After we awake in 
the morning from sleep, we have recuperated from the 
fatigue of the preceding day, but are not able to do our 
most efficient work of the day. During sleep the fune- 
tioning of the various organs of the body is suspended , 
or partially suspended. After we awake, it takes some A 
ime for them to rise to their maximum efficiency. 
Winch, using arithmetical reasoning as a measure of ; 
efficiency, studies children of both sexes and various 
ages and finds that at 11:30 they do on the average 5.6 7 
Per cent. better than at 9:40. But in one school Winch ¢ 
obtained different results. This school was in a poor. ¥ 
Reighborhood. The pupils were the children of laborers 
and got up earlier in the morning than did the children 
of the other schools. The pupils in this school reached 
Maximum efficiency earlier than the children who got - 
up later, : . 
The extensive studies of Gates are in agreement with 
those of Winch. Gates’ first study was with fifth and 
Sixth grade school children. He used as tests of effi- 
tency, addition, multiplication, auditory memory, visual 
Memory, recognition, completion, cancellation, and L 
j 2 
§peed and accuracy of movement. His results are re-

produced in Figure 34. In the more purely mental func- 
tions there was an improvement up till nearly twelve 
o’clock, a decline at one o’clock, with some improve- 
ment up to three o’clock. The motor tests show an 
improvement throughout the day. There is better 
muscular control and better speed the latter part of 
the day. os 
Gates performed similar experiments with 165 college 
students. With these students he used as tests, audi- 
tory memory, visual memory, substitution, recognition, 
and logical memory. The combined results of all the

tests are shown in Figure 35. The results are much 
the same as those obtained from the children. There is 
improved efficiency till nearly noon, lowest efficiency 
about one o’clock, an improvement till about three, a 
slight falling off at four and still more at five. In Table 
85 are shown in tabular form Gates’ results from the 
students. The first record of the day is called 100, and 
the other records are expressed in terms of per cents. 
of this initial record. It is interesting to compare his 
results from the substitution test with those of the au- 
thor, mentioned above, obtained from school children of . 
allages. At 9:25, the adults made a score of 179 digits, 
and at 3:25 a score of 177 digits, only about 1.3 per 
cent. less. The difference in the case of the children in 
our study was just a trifle more, 7. e., the children were 
not quite so efficient in the late afternoon as compared 
_ with morning efficiency as was the case with the older 
students. It will be remembered that Winch found the 
| younger children showing more fatigue as the day 
progressed than did the older children. From many 
sources the evidénce is clear that children fatigue more 
readily than do older people. Childven are not capable 
of such long sustained effort as is the case with adults. 
This is doubtless partly, though not wholly, due to lack 
of habituation. 
The practical significance of these studies on the 
course of diurnal efficiency is as follows: Neither chil- 
ke dren nor adults are capable of the best work early in 
the morning. They gradually come into the full swing 
of their power, and just before noon are able to do their 
best work of the day. Just_after noon, their powers 
are at the lowest ebb for mental work, with some in-  
-P-A-G-E-260
a SS nena, | FATIGUE AND LEARNING 255 
crease in efficiency toward the end of the school day. In 
arranging the school work of the day, then, the most 
dificult work should be placed at the last morning 
period; the least difficult just after noon. It has been 
suggested that motor work, such as drawing or writing 
might well come in the first afternoon period. While 
mental efficiency is lowest at this time, motor efficiency 
ishigher than at any earlier period, though not so high

a8 later in the afternoon. While these differences are 
hot very great, they are great enough to be taken into 
Practical account. If, for example, we wished to get the 
Maximal effort from children in a mental performance, 
We should have them work from about 10:30 to 11:30. 
Itwe wish to get the maximal physical effort, we should 
have the work from about three to four-o’clack. The 
accompanying conditions must be taken into account, 
owever. The above facts are approximately true if 
the subjects are doing the ordinary school work, but are 
Probably not true under other conditions. If the chil- 
dren should work at a much higher level of efficiency
-P-A-G-E-261
256 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
than is ordinarily the case in school, the point of highest 
efficiency would doubtless be shifted. It would probably 
come earlier. And if instead of doing the ordinary 
school work, they should be engaged in hard manual 
work, the point of highest efficiency at such work 
would doubtless come earlier than four or five o’clock. 
The work of several intestigators makes it appear 
that mental fatigue comes earlier than physical fatigue, 
under the same Conditions of mental and physical work. 
If one works at hard mental work, fatigue comes earlier 
than if one works at hard physical work in a field where 
he is habituated. As mentioned above, fatigue is largely 
a nervous phenomenon. In mental work, the nervous 
system is much more fully involved than it is in physical 
work. 
Continuous Work.—From the laboratory of Professor 
Thorndike have come some interesting studies of long 
continued work of the same kind. The most notable 
work is that of Arai. This investigator practiced her- 
self at mental multiplication of five place numbers, and 
then worked for a long period. The notable thing in 
the results is that efficiency continued for so long 4 
time with little falling off. 
Painter performed a similar experiment. Painter 
first reached stability through practice, then worked 
from 11:00 p. m. till 3:07 a. m., multiplying four place 
numbers. Inability to “work seemed to come rather 
suddenly. He concludes: “There exists a definite and 
relatively abruptly appearing point beyond which men- 
tal work becomes impossible.” It seemed to Painter 
that there was no “tailing off.” He was not only unable 
to multiply four place numbers but was unable to do
-P-A-G-E-262
FATIGUE AND LEARNING | ' 969 
anything. Such a conclusion can not be accepted with- 
out-further confirmation. Other experiments indicate 
that inability to work comes on by degrees. Memory 
span, for example, does not suddenly jump from the 
normal span to zero. Painter was working with an 
habituated process. It is possible that in the case of: 
habituated processes, even though they are complex, 
inability to work may come rather suddenly, and that 
when one is unable to carry on such a process he is 
practically unable to do anything. ~ ve 
In accepting Thorndike’s conclusions in regard to our 
ability to do long-continued work without much fatigue 
and without much diminution in our ability to perform the work, a certain distinction must be kept in mind, 
tamely, the difference between habituated and non- 
habituated work. Fatigue comes much more quickly 
in non-habituated work. The author once undertook 
tolearn the point alphabet of the blind. Fatigue was 
% great that rest periods had to be allowed every fif- 
minutes. When children are learning to write, or 
bying to master any difficult feat of muscular co- 
ordination, fatigue comes very quickly, and rest periods 
Should be frequent.. In establishing new bonds in men- 
tal leaming, fatigue also comes very quickly. 
For still another reason the distinction between . 
habituated and non-habituated work must be kept:in 
tind. As has been shown, one can perform a task in - 
habituated work for a long pefiod of time with ‘little’ 
diminution in effectiveness. If one starts out todo a 
hon-habituated task, one’s efficiency rises for a time and 
then fails to rise any more during the work period, even’ 
though work continue for hours. Efficiency may remain: 
tt very near the same level, just as in the habituated
-P-A-G-E-263
258 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
performance it remains at nearly the same level. But 
two other things besides efficiency are to be taken into 
account. In the case of the non-habituated perform- 
ance, although the level of work remains about the 
same, the effect of the work in fixing the habit after 
the first three or four half-hours is practically nothing. 
Effective learning can not go on unless fatigue is at a 
minimum. And in the case of habituated work, al- 
though one can maintain the same high level of effi- 
ciency for a long period of time, that the after effects 
of a short period of work are the same as for a'long 
period has not been demonstrated. The evidence points 
in the other direction. For long continued work, one 
pays the penalty afterward, as is indicated by the work 
of Smith which is discussed below. 
Fatigue Antitoxins.—In a preceding paragraph the 
discovery of a fatigue antitoxin was mentioned. This 
antitoxin introduced into the circulation of an animal 
delayed the effects of fatigue. The work of Miss Smith 
makes it look as if the body itself produces an anti- 
toxin which in some degree neutralises the effects of 
fatigue. Smith withheld sleep and then noted the effect 
on work. At first, the effect of loss of sleep seemed to 
enhance work, but later, after a day, or two or three or 
four days, work suffered from the loss of sleep. We ca” 
not consider such a notion established, but many phe- 
nomena seem to support Smith’s inference as to the 
bodily antitoxins. Such a theory would explain the Te 
sults of Thorndike, Arai, and Painter, and the common 
observation of every day life_of people who work fot 
long periods at a high tension and then suffer from 
complete exhaustion. If as soon as waste products are 
produced in the body, the body sets to work not only to
-P-A-G-E-264
FATIGUE AND LEARNING 259 
eiminate them but to neutralise them, one ought to be . 
able, under sufficient incitement to work to the point of 
exhaustion. In such case exhaustion would be due not 
oly to an accumulation of the fatigue toxins above 
elimination arid neutralization, but also to at least a 
partial depletion of the tissues. Our attitude toward 
Smith’s speculation must be that of waiting for fur- 
ther facts. 
Several experiments have been performed to deter- 
line the fluctuations in efficiency during a work period. 
Phillips found that in the first minute of a ten minutes 
Practice period, 6 to 12 per cent. more work was done 
in the fundamentals. of arithmetic than for the average 
of the remaining nine minutes. Poffenberger compared 
the two halves of a very short work period. He gave 
subjects tests in opposites, adding, color-naming, and 
cancelling, of less than a minute in length. The first 
half of the work was done in less time than the second 
half, Poffenberger’s inference was that fatigue had set 
iin this short time, and thought fatigue not so rare 
4S sometimes supposed. Smith’s hypothesis comes to 
Mind in this connection. It is possible that when we 
start to work the waste products can not be immedi- 
uely taken care of either by elimination or neutraliza- 
"tion, It doubtless takes some time for the etion 
7 the bodily antitoxins, Tf such a thing happens. 
Ysiological processes can not be instantaneous. When 
Paste products are produced anywhere in the body, it 
€s a measurable time for the body to establish a new 
fUilibrium. It has been demonstrated that the fune- 
‘ening of the ne Sas well as the nerve cells re- 
ities the presence of oxygen. When a group of neu- 
es begins to function, their supply of oxygen 1s tem-

porarily depleted, a new balance must be established. It 
can not be established immediately, for the stimulus for 
the increased supply of oxygen is the need of it. This 
explains why it takes some time for one to come into 
the full swing of his power. When one starts a certain 
piece of work, the part of the nervous system involved 
is rested and in full functioning condition and can do 
well immediately, but can not do well continuously until 
a new balance of performance is established among all 
the processes involved, elimination, neutralization, oxy- 
gen sup) or whatever they may be. The author has 
extensive records which show that in card-sorting, even 
after considerable habituation is reached, the best work 
of an hour’s sitting is not done at the beginning, but 
only after the sorting has gone on for a while. The 
records of four subjects are shown in Figure 36. (See 
also Fig. 8). While there is some individual difference, 
all subjects agree in showing a drop in the curve or in- 
creased efficiency after the initial performance of the 
hour. This seems to be universally true in motor work. 
Sleep and Fatigue—The best cure for fatigue is 
sleep. During sleep, the body does only the work neces- 
sary to keep life going. The waste products of work 
are eliminated during sleep. The waste of the tissues 
is repaired. A stable equilibrium is established. Sleep 
is absolutely necessary. The body by one device or 
another can keep at work for some hours, but eventu- 
ally it must have sleep. There must be complete cessa- 
tion from all work except what is necessary to keep the 
vital processes going. Several authorities have pub- 
lished statements giving the amount of sleep required 
by people of different ages. One of the latest state 
ments is from Terman and Hocking. They give not the 
time people should sleep but the average amount of

eral places in western United States, and are shown in

The hours of sleep shown in the table may be taken 
as fairly representative of the amount of sleep required 
at the different ages. Rather, they should be taken as 
the minimum requirements, for it is doubtful that any 
of the figures used in computing the averages would be 
too high, and it is quite likely that in some cases, they would be too low. This would make the averages a lit- 
tle lower than they should be. 
It seems clear that some people need more sleep than 
do others, and doubtless the work one is doing makes 
- some difference in the amount of sleep needed. Older 
people should determine by experiment how much sleep 
they need, and take that amount. Parents should de- 
termine how much sleep their children need and see 
that the children get that amount. Present social con- 
ditions in the cities make it difficult for children to get 
enough sleep, for there are so many attractions to keep 
them up and awake in the evening. They consequently 
go to bed too late to get enough sleep before they have 
to get up to get to school on time. “Teachers should 
make a study to determine the amount of sleep taken
-P-A-G-E-268
FATIGUE AND LEARNING 268 
by their pupils, and should take such steps as are neces: 
sary to bring about the proper amount of sleep. 
Terman and Hocking found no_relation between 
amount of sleep and intelligence_or success in school. 
This need not mean that sleep is not a factor in school 
success but that other factors are of more importance 
than the slight variation in sleep. The children gifted 
by nature with superior endowment are able to hold - 
their high ranks in school with varying amounts of 
sleep. The children dull by nature are not able to excel 
by any amount of sleep. But children whether bright 
ss dull will do their best work when they have plenty of 
ep. . 
¥ Experiments have shown that the most value comes 
‘ftom the early sleep of the night. ‘Sleep is then deeper. 
After only two or three hours of sleep, a subject shows 
48 great working capacity as if allowed to sleep the re- 
quired amount. The experiments on which this state- 
nent is based did not determine how long the subjects 
could work, but only their efficiency for a short time. 
Itis quite probable that an hour or two of sleep suffices 
for a removal of the fatigue poisons and a renewal of 
the SSigen supply to the neurones, but is not sufficient 
for a renewal of the wasted tissues. One’s immediate 
Capacity to work doubtless depends upon the amount 
of fatigue poisons present and on the oxygen supply in 
the central nervous system, but one’s capacity for pro- 
longed work depends on the amount of available energy. 
If one wishes to keep his body in a high state of 
Working efficiency, he should have enough rest during 
the day and sleep at night to enable the body to repair 
the waste of work. Tf one work in such a way that for 
Aconsiderable time the outgo of energy exceeds the re-  
-P-A-G-E-269
264 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
pair, then he must eventually pay the penalty. In sick 
_ ness the body has to make such a fight to overcome the 
disease that it becomes very much weakened. There is 
-often great loss of tissue shown by decrease in weight. 
After sickness, children therefore fatigue very easily, 
and when they return to school, their work should be 
lightened instead of increased. 
The Feeling of Fatigue.—It is of practical importance 
to know that the feeling of fatigue is no reliable cri- 
terion of the presence of fatigue. Fatigue may be pres- 
ent when one does not feel fatigued; and on the other 
hand one may feel fatigued when the body is not fa- 
tigued. The only sure test is the ability to. work. Some- 
times one feels tired and is disinclined to work, but 
finds that if he will start in and try, after a little time 
he is working with great efficiency. A very interesting 
phenomenon is that of “second breath,” a matter not 
yet fully explained. One may work for a time, fatigue 
comes on and there is lessened capacity for work, but 
it is often found that if one keeps on at the work, the 
capacity increases again and efficiency goes up perhaps 
even to a higher point than at first. Such rhythms may 
be repeated several times in the course of continuous 
work. Their explanation, while not fully known, doubt- 
less is to be found in the various physiological processes 
already discussed. An excess of waste products pro- 
duces the temporary incapacity, and at the same time 
stimulates the removal and renewal processes, which 
presently restore the original capacity. These rhythms 
keep up till there is probably temporary depletion of 
the tissues, which only rest and sleep can cure. 
Practice and Fatigue—Several times we have called 
attention to the relation of practice to fatigue. Ha- 
bituation reduces fatigue. When we are learning 4

process fatigue is great, after we have acq: 
ency, the work can be carried on for a lon; 
time with relatively little fatigue. These facl

young children. In trying to master

is true in all work. When the org 
comes adapted through the strengthening of wie useuce 
and the establishment of the necessary neuro-muscular 
bonds work can go on for a long period of time with. . 
very much less fatigue than is occasioned earlier in the 
Work. When a process is thoroughly habituated, it par- 
takes of the nature of a reflex, and can be.carried on all 
day at a high point of efficiency. The organs and tis- 
ses concerned become so. adapted and adjusted that 
a can maintain the processes for ‘long periods of 
8, 
A related phenomenon is the fact that the best work- 
{rs fatigue less easily than do the poor workers. The 
fastest workers usually make fewer mistakes than do 
the poor and slow ‘workers. In the slow worker, the 
ements involved in the work are not so well co-ordi- 
nated; there is usually more waste of energy through 
interfering processes. Even iri the same worker there 
48 often found a direct relation between speed and 
accuracy, fewer mistakes being made in connection. 
With the fastest speed. Sonie investigators have found 
an inverse relation between improvability and fatigue, 
“ose who improve the fastest suffering least from fa- 
tigue. These several phenomena have their chief ex- 
Dlanation in facts of adjustment and adaptation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
266 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
Work and Oxygen Supply.—Physiological experi- 
ments have shown the necessity for the presence of 
oxygen in the fufetioning of the neurones. An isolated 
nerve fibre functions when oxygen is present. If it is 
placed in some other medium, it ceases to function. 
When oxygen is supplied, it functions again. These 
facts show the necessity for hygienic conditions proper 
boanthing apparatus of the child being in perfect condi- 
tion. The open-air school has fully confirmed this con- 
clusion. One should also have constant pure air while 
asleep in order to facilitate the restoration of all the 
organs of the body to their full working power. Food, 
in Proper duality and quantity is also necessary if chil- dren are'to be in condition to profit to the full extent 
rom instruction. It is folly to maintain schools al 
great éxpense and then go to no trouble to see that 
children are in proper condition to profit from the work 
of the schools. It is the business of a teacher not only 
to hold recitations, but to know that all the conditions 
necessary for effective work have been supplied. 
The Work of Students. — University students can 
profit from a consideration of the facts discussed in 
this chapter. Their energies are often dissipated. They 
too often have all sorts of activities and interests which 
consume both their time and energy. In some cases, 
the night is half gone before they get down to the work 
which is supposed tb be the proper work at a univer- 
sity. But the assignments must be prepared, so they 
work, or attempt to work, when their bodies are in no 
condition for work. The energy of our body is like the L~ 
money in our purse. When it is gone, it is gone. If it
-P-A-G-E-272
is spent in one way, then it is not available for spend- 
ing in another way. We have to decide; we have to 
choose. If we spend all of our energy performing in 
the side shows, there is none available for the main 
circus, : 
A very serious trouble among students is that they 
do not keep their bodies physically fit, to be able to 
learn éffectively. The body, after all, is a motor ma- 
thine. To be maintained in a high state of effectivi 
' ess, a large amount of motor work is necessary. Fe:

CHAPTER XIII. 
INBORN NATURE IN RELATION TO LEARNING. 
Habits and knowledge are the results of established 
bonds, instincts are the result of inherited bonds. In 
the strict sense, an instinct is a response connected to 
its stimulus by an inherited neural bond. This inherited 
bond may have all degrees of definiteness, from zero on 
the one hand to absolute definiteness on the other. It 
is our purpose in this chapter to enquire into the rela- 
tionship between the inherited bonds and the acquired 
bonds, particularly into the use that can be made of 
the itistincts and emotions in the work of forming 
habits and acquiring knowledge. 
In the first place it is necessary to correct an et- 
roneous notion in regard to the instincts. Some writers 
state that the instincts are the basis of all our acquire- 
ments, that every habit is merely the modification of 
some instinct, This is not true. We are born witha 
nervous system with some differences in resistance to 
various types of stimuli already established. But any 
conceivable connection of stimuli with responses is pos- 
sible. We have the nerves. They go on the one hand 
to sense organs; on the other, to muscles. The stimulus- 
response couplings that are possible are practically in- 
finite, regardiess of the inherited couplings. Not only 
are inherited bonds not the basis of all acquirements, 
but we can overcome and reverse inherited differential 
resistances. The inherited bonds are colorless or indif- 
[270]
-P-A-G-E-276
INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING 271 
ferent to most of our acquirements. For example, lan- 
gage, saying the multiplication table, playing a piano, 
we in no sense modifications of instincts. Some chil- 
dren learn to call a certain animal a “dog”; others, learn 
| ti call it “ein Hund”; the ancient Roman called it 
j “nis.” And we could just as well learn to call it any- 
thing else, for there is no inherited bias in the matter. 
h playing the piano, the position of the notes on the 
staff determine what piano key we shall strike. It is 
of course absurd to believe that there is any inherited 
bias for striking one key for a certain note rather than 
tome other key. The part which the instincts play in 
or learning is other than forming the basis of our 
quirements. . 
Initation.—Imitation is not an instinct in the strict 
tase, If it were, then the perception of an act would, - 
Without training, be an adequate stimulus for the act. 
But such is not the ease. However, the tendency to imi- 
te, the desire which children have to do what they 
# others do, is an inborn human characteristic. This 
tdency is universal in the human race, and from the 
Vint of view of education, is one of the most important 
‘tall human traits. The tendency to do what is seen 
ne probably has more to do in leading a child to a 
Mastery of the world which immediately surrounds hint 
‘an any other single factor with the possible excep- 
of play. One has only to observe children in the 
to be convinced of the importance of imitation. 
e little girl wants to do and tries to do all that she 
"es her mother do. She attempts to do all that she 
®s done. The acts which she thus attempts, she can 
Mot perform at first, unless these acts have already been 
red in some other connection, but she tries to do
-P-A-G-E-277
272 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
them, and she keeps on trying till they are mastered. 
. As a rule, when such an act is mastered, it loses its at- 
traction, and the child passes on to the mastery of some 
other perceived action. The result is mastery of all 
the mother does; and in acquiring this mastery, the 
girl has learned a great many things about the world. 
The case is similar with the boy, only his world is 
larger. In mastering what he sees his father and other 
older people do, he not only learns to do many different 
things, but learns much about the world in all its varied 
aspects. He learns much about forces and energy, the 
principles of machines, etc. One can hardly overesti- 
mate the importance which imitation has in adjusting 
and adapting the child to the physical and social world. 
Through imitation, children acquire their language, 
manners and customs, traditions, morals, religion, and 
their attitude toward nearly all important aspects 
life. It is doubtful whether any other factor is so im- 
portant in developing habits of honesty, industry, per- 
severance, and the various important ideals of life and 
’ character. 
Imitation in School Work.—Imitation can be used in 
school as a method of mastering mechanical processes, 
such as arithmetical processes, writing, drawing, and 
music. The first step in the process of habit-fdé¥mation 
should be demonstration by the teacher. When any 
new process is taken up, say long division, the teacher 
should demonstrate clearly every step in the process. 
This is a matter of economy. Such a procedure leads to 
quick mastery. The child should not have originality in’ 
formal processes. He needs merely to master them 
and do them as older people do them, and master them
-P-A-G-E-278
INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING - 273 
inthe quickest possible way. To imitate the perform- 
| me of the teacher is the quickest way. 
Imitation and Ideals.—During the high school period, 
thich covers roughly the period of adolescence, boys 
ad girls acquire what, in most cases, prove to be their 
‘fnal life ideals. These ideals are copied from the acts 
their fellows, primarily from their elders, and from 
te acts which they read about in literature and his- 
ly. It seems probable that the attitudes and ideals 
Which adolescents acquire are of far more importance 
their lives afterward than all the facts they acquire 
| diting this period. If this is true, and the author be- Teves it is, then the influences which the school, home 
ad all the other social forces bring to bear to develop 
these ideals and attitudes, are of more importance than 
te ordinary formal high school curriculum. The actual 
mount of the content of the high school curriculum 
that gets into the life of the boys and girls, and becomes 
“important factor there, is doubtless small, but there 
{a be no doubt of the profound influence on their lives 
the moulding of character that goes on during this 
kriod. The character-formation of these years is cru- 
» al and determining for the future. All educational 
forees that concern this period should take these facts 
account. In careful, scientific fashion the sources 
adolescent ideals should be determined and measured. 
| “great use here is literature. The high school teacher - 
| literature has great things within her power. The 
Thole literature of the world, of all ages and all coun- 
fs, should be studied with reference to its value in 
nging before adolescents the highest ideals of action.

_'8 are teachable, susceptible, easily swayed one way

274 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
or another. The teachings of the world’s great teachers 
should be brought before them. Under the sympathetic 
guidance of teachers and parents these forces mould 
the character of the boy and girl. 
Imitation in Adult Life.—Imitation is an important 
factor not only in the lives of children, but in the lives 
of men and women. Throughout adult life, imitation is 
one of the great social forces. In childhood, as shown 
above, we become adapted and adjusted largely through 
the process of imitation. As long as we live imitation 
holds us to the forms to which we have become accus- 
tomed. Of course, other factors are also at work, the 
desire of public approval and the fear of public con- 
demnation. These three forces are the whip which 
makes us conform, makes each do what all the others 
are doing. What others are wearing, I must wear; 
what others are saying, I must say; what others are 
doing, I must do; what others are learning, I must 
learn; what others are thinking, I must think. The 
press comes to the aid of conformity. We read the 
same newspaper at breakfast, the same magazine after 
supper, the same “best seller” at the week-end. Educa- 
tion itself is a great force for conformity. Education is 
conservative; it moulds us in the same mould. It must 
- necessarily be organised and systematised. In the 
process there is a danger that the child will lose origi- 
nality and initiative. Organisation and systematisa- 
tion are but means to an end. The end is the teaching 
of children, The machinery of education has its proper 
function, and principals and superintendents who direct 
the machinery have their proper functions, namely to 
secure all those conditions that will enable the best 
teachers to do their work in the best way. We must
-P-A-G-E-280
  INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING 275 
‘aot, however, lose sight of the fact that the final goal 
which all must strive to reach is good teaching. The 
chool must preserve a proper balance between con- 
servatism and progress. While the school is an institu- 
tin of society one of whose great functions has been 
tohand down to a new generation that which the old 
“generations thought good, it must also be a means of 
progress by encouraging and stimulating individuality. 
In impressing the past on the young, we must not de- 
stroy the future. Imitation is the aspect of inborn na- 
ture which makes possible the great influence which the 
od generation has upon the new. But there are also in 
human nature inborn tendencies which work for varia- 
tim and individuality. The wise teacher will seek a 
Proper balance between the two sets of tendencies. 
There must be a certain degree of conformity if we are 
tolive together with any considerable contentment and 
ppiness, but the conformity must not be such as to 
destroy all initiative, individuality, and progress. 
" Rivalry and Learning.—One of the oldest and strong- 
est inherited tendencies in man is the tendency to fight. 
For ages unnumbered, our ancestors have been fighters. 
Each human individual has had to look out for himself. 
Natural selection has picked out the fighter. Our an- 
Cestors were those who overcame their adversaries. 
lan’s progress has been one great fight. Every step 
has been marked in blood. As a result of the constant 
action of natural selection, there have been established 
in Us many strong inherited tendencies connected with - 
individual survival, that may be called the individual- 
‘istic instincts. Examples of these instincts are the acts 
‘onnected with rivalry, competition, fighting, and with 
the emotions of anger, envy, and jealousy. The stimuli
-P-A-G-E-281

that evoke these various tendencies and responses are 
attacks upon ourselves. This attack may be an actual 
physical attack upon our person, or a threatened 
attack. It may, however, be merely a verbal attack 
upon our belief, or our looks, or our friend or relative. 
Whatever the nature of the attack, the physiological 
response is much the same. There are characteristic 
changes in the heart-beat, circulation, respiration, and 
in various other muscles and organs. A strong emotion 
is aroused, as anger, or envy, or jealousy. 
When children start to school no tendency is stronger 
or more marked than individualistic tendencies. The 
self is then the biggest thing in the world. Children 
are constantly measuring themselves with one another. 
They not only compare their personal selves but every- 
thing that belongs to them, their parents, their homes, 
their clothes. I have heard children boast-of how many 
@ dentist! Eternal competi- 
tion is the rule of child life, as it has been the rule of 
all life, all business, all trade, in fact almost everything 
in the life of man. What should be the attitude of the 
teacher toward this characteristic of childhood? We 
ean not get rid of it. It permeates almost every fibre. 
in the structure of life, and every work and institution 
of man. We must take it into account if we are going | 
to deal with human nature because it is a large part of 
human nature. Fortunately it has its good aspect. Self 
respect depends upon this aspect of our nature. When 
a person has no fight in him, he is just about hopeless. 
As society and human nature are now constituted, we 
must make-a limited use of competition in learning. 
The desire to excel must continue to be a motive. But 
the use we make of rivalry and competition must be
-P-A-G-E-282
    
PR er rer Ye Noten em ese 
  INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING 277 
limited. As the child grows older we can develop other 
motives. We can create desire for things in them- 
selves, desire for absolute good, apart from what others __ 
may have. Education must certainly take this attitude, 
for nearly all the pain and sorrow and trouble in the 
world are due to some aspect of selfishness. This selfish- 
ness is in human nature, it is true, but our only hope for 
Any sort of decent life consists in suppressing certain 
aspects of selfishness, and in developing sympathy and 
co-operation. The hope of the world lies in. building 
school houses rather than battleships. As long as peace 
is maintained by the sword, it is not peace, it is merely 
a truce, . : ; 
’ Roving and Collecting Tendencies.—Man’s wild life in _ 
the past has left him with two tendencies which are 
educational assets. The child, by nature, dislikes con- 
fnement, restriction of liberty, and likes freedom. Chil- 
dren like to be going, to see new things, to have new 
experiences in other places. A closely related tendency 
is collecting. A child, by nature, picks up and takes 
along with him everything that attracts attention and 
is loose. Education ean profit greatly from both these 
tendencies. Part of the work of education is learning 
the world. The world is, for the most part, outside of 
*- the school house. The child must go out to study it. 
The river, the mountain, the animals, the plants, nearly 
all the world, is outside, and the child must go out to 
study it. He can bring back to school not only a report 
but specimens. From the specimens should be made 
4 school museum, which should be a ‘reproduction of 
the world outside. 
Play and Education.—From the point of view of edu- 
cation, imitation and play are the most important’
-P-A-G-E-283
278 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
aspects of child life for they lead to nearly all acquire- 
ments. The importance of imitation has already been 
pointed out. Play is the spontaneous activity of the 
individual. It is doing what we want to do, it is the 
expression of our inmost desires, our most real self. 
Play activities are those intrinsically pleasurable, those 
which we seek for the pleasure which they give and not 
for any good that results. The child learns most suec- 
cessfully when his practice has in it the spirit of play. 
This is at once evident to us when we remember what 
was said in preceding chapters about attention and in- 
terest. We learn best when we are attentive and when 
the learning or its result is pleasurable. To put it in 
another way: we learn best when we put our whole self 
into the learning. In no other activities are these con- 
ditions so well met as in play activities. But it is not 
always easy to realise these conditions. We who are old 
'» set the tasks for those who are young. We know what 
is best for the young to learn. We put them to work 
to do what we impose upon them. One is not likely to 
put forth all his energy except in a self-imposed task. 
The learning of children will progress at a much faster 
rate if we can enlist their native desires and their own 
ambitions. Many helpful improvements can be made 
in this direction. Goals and objectives can be selected 
that are near instead of remote. While the ultimate 
end of education is adult efficiency, closer ends can al- 
ways be made out. A child can not be expected to work . 
on indefinitely in the mere hope that some time, some- 
where, he will reap some return for his labors. Ina 
large measure a child’s present needs can be used as 
incentives which lead to performances that prepare for 
later life. About all this amounts to is this: In as far
-P-A-G-E-284
INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING 279 
«possible, we are to make appeal to the child’s native 
quipment, native desires, and native ambitions. The 
danger is that the teacher, in making this appeal, will 
go to an extreme that will cause education to lose more 
than it gains. While we learn best when we do what 
we want to do, an education that permits the child todo ~ 
| tly what it wants to do is no education at all. For life 
is such and this world is such that we all have to do 
| many hard things, many disagreeable things. No one 
\rer amounts to anything who has not learned to do 
vhat is hard, who has not learned to stick to a task - 
tndertaken. No use of play should be made in educa- 
tin that in any way hinders us in giving the child a 
discipline and a training that will lead to worthwhile 
whievement. The proper solution of the problem con- 
sts in leading the child to form ambitions and aims 
ind desires in the attainment of which he is willing to 
York to the uttermost. After all, we never succeed in 
] lucation until our aims have become the child’s aims, 
til our purposes have become his purposes. ; 
) “ManipulationA native tendency that is of use in 
‘arly education and all later education as well, is that 
tf manipulation. The child, by virtue of its inborn 
‘ature, wishes to touch, handle, manipulate all that it 
"es, In the early years of infarcy this tendency leads 
te child to a mastery of many things in its environ- 
Tent. Of course, it is a rather expensive tendency, and 
tents usually suppress it in the interest of preserving 
furniture and other household implements, such as 
cks, sewing machines and door bells. In suppressing 
tendency, parents kill or partially kill one of the 
‘et important characteristics of human nature. True 
" accurate knowledge comes only from contact with
-P-A-G-E-285
280 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING 
things, only from manipulation. But in opposition to 
all that is natural, we take the child to school, put it 
into a seat, tell it to keep its hands off of things, and 
give it a book. As a result, the child’s education is a 
sort of second hand education, one or more steps re- 
moved from reality. The proper procedure would be 
to use in every step of education the inborn tendency 
to manipulate. In getting a knowledge of the world, 
the child should manipulate the various objects of the 
world. . 
The Emotions and Learning.—Our discussion of the 
inborn nature of children leads us finally to a considera- 
tion of the emotions and their relation to learning. Our 
emotions are the most intimate parts of us; they are 
back of nearly all that we voluntarily do. At the bot- 
tom of nearly every act is love, or hate, or envy, or 
jealousy, or anger, or fear. Nothing of very great con- 
séquence is ever undertaken that does not have back of 
it some emotion. The great teacher is he who has a 
profound understanding of human life, and knows how 
to mould and change it; knows how to use what he finds 
as a means of making the child different. 
In the preceding chapters of this book we have dis- 
cussed many factors and elements of learning, we have 
tried to find the most economical ways of learning. And 
this is well for we must use every known means 
to facilitate learning. But no factor is of more signifi- 
cance than the emotions. It is worth while that a child 
practice for the proper length of period at whatever he 
is trying to learn, but unless he is in the proper emo- 
tional attitude it does not make much difference 
whether he practice at all. The great teacher is he who 
can profoundly influence the child, who can inspire, and | 
|
-P-A-G-E-286
INBORN NATURE AND LEARNING 281 
command respect and reverence. The teacher is not 
merely to find out what the child wants and help him 
jo attain his wants, but should change the wants. The 
child is to be changed into a being that wants the higher 
things. What gives us pleasure is in a large measure 
the result of experience and training. It is the business 
of the teacher to train the child to get pleasure from the 
higher things of eternal value. All knowledge, all 
habits are merely a means, The end is the satisfaction 
of the higher nature of man. The teacher in the detail 
of teaching geography, or arithmetic, or history, should 
always have in mind the higher aim of education as a 
Whole; should always remember that education is to 
led to knowledge, and habits, and ideals that are the 
heans of living a life that is worthy of man.

CHAPTER XIV. 
MEASURES. 
_ Central Tendency.—After measuring the learning 
capacity of a group of students, we must, have some 
method of expressing and interpreting the results. The 
frst important determination is the central tendency. 
There are three commonly used measures of central 
tendency, the average, the median, and the mode. To 
find the average, we simply add the scores made by the : 
Various individuals tested and divide the sum by the 
number of cases. The median is the middle measure. 
To find the median it is necessary to rank the subjects 
tested on the basis of efficiency in ‘the test, giving the 
Person making the highest score the rank 1; the next 
| highest, the rank 2; the next highest, the rank 3, and 
80 on to the poorest. We then find that rank that has 
4 many ranks above it as below it. The score which 
is rank represents is the median score. It often hap- 
Pens that the median represents no actual score, as 
When the number of cases is an even number, and when 
the median falls within a group of cases having the 
Same score. In such cases, the median must be caleu- 
ted as shown in the illustration. 
| The three measures of central tendency may be illus- 
tated from the following data, which represent the 
eed in seconds attained by each of 64 university stu- 
dents, sorting 25 cards into five boxes. The numbers

given represent the 12th score. The actual scores were 
as follows: 20, 19, 21, 11, 19, 16, 17, 21, 19, 27, 16, 15,

The sum of the scores is 1189; the number of cases 
is 64, 1189-+-64--18.56, the average. By arranging the 
scores as shown in the accompanying table, it ean be 
seen that 32 scores are 18 seconds or less, and that 82 
cases are 19 seconds or more. The median therefore 
lies midway between 18 and 19, and is 18.5 seconds. 
Suppose we omit the slowest person, whose time was 
27 seconds, and find the median of the 63 remaining 
scores. There are 31 scores of 19 seconds and slower 
and 82 scores of 18 and faster. The median lies in the 
group of five making a score of 18 seconds. In such a 
case we find the percentage of this group that must be 
added or subtracted to make the number of cases equal, 
and add or subtract, according to which way we are 
counting, this percentage to the last score preceding
-P-A-G-E-290
MEASURES 285 
the score of the group in which the median lies. The 
number of scores up to and including 17 seconds is 27. 
Half the number of scores is 3114. 3114—27=41f. 
There are 5 scores in the group 18. 414 is .9 of 5. We 
therefore add .9 to 17, which gives a median of 17.9. 
The mode is the most frequent measure. Reference 
‘to the table shows that 16 seconds is the mode. 
Measures of. Variability——After we have measured 
the central tendency of a group, we need to know the 
variability, i. e., how much the members of the group 
vary from the central tendency. There are three com- 
mon measures of variability, the average deviation, the 
standard deviation, and the probable error. The aver- 
age deviation is simply the average amount of deviation 
from the central tendency. It is found by finding each 
individual's deviation from the central tendency, adding 
hese amounts without regard to whether they are posi- 
tive or negative, and dividing by the number of cases. 
The standard deviation is the square root of the aver- 
age of the squares of the individual deviations. The 
Probable error is that measure above and below the 
tentral tendency that includes half the cases. - All of 
these measures can be illustrated from the scores from 
‘ard-sorting given above. For computing them, it is 
‘ustomary to use either the median or the average as 
the measure of the central tendency. We shall use the 
Measure 18.5, which is practically both the median and 
the average. In the table are shown the individual 
ores, the deviations, the squares of the individual 
iations.

To determine the probable. error, we count back each

Taking 1.5 seconds above and below gives us 24 cases. 
In the 16-second group are 11 cases, and in the 21-sec- 
ond group are 6 cases. In the two groups are 17 cases. 
Only eight of them can be counted to make up the re- 
‘quired 82. Eight is .47 of 17, the probable error is 
therefore 1.97 seconds. In a normal distribution, the 
probable, error is .6745 of the standard deviation. If 
the scores were distributed in accordance with the nor- 
mal frequency curve, the probable error would be .6745 
of 3.3, or 2.28.

Frequency Surfaces.— The frequency surface or 
curve of distribution is a graphical means of represent- 
ing the distribution of a group with reference to some 
measure. The distribution of the scores given above is 
shown in Figure 37, constructed as follows: We deter- 
mine the number of cases included in the 10 and 11 
minute groups, the 12 and 18 minute groups, the 14 
and 15 minute groups, and so on. The scores are rep- 
resented on the horizontal axis and the number of 
cases for each score, on the vertical axis. We arbi- 
trarily select some-unit to represent one case, and then 
simply take those distances above the base that repre- 
sent the several numbers of cases. The score-groups 
with their respective numbers of cases are as follows:

traits are probably distributed in accordance with the 
normal curve, and in measuring human traits, if we 
have a large number of cases, we may expect our re- 
sults to approximate the normal curve. 
Correlation.—By correlation we mean the relation 
that exists between two functions. For example, sup- 
pose we have measured the several abilities of the 
members of a group in one kind of learning and wish 
fo compare those abilities with the corresponding 
abilities in another kind of learning, we resort to the 
correlation formula. In a small group, mere 
inspection of the results of the experiments would 
enable us to make a rough comparison of the two differ- 
ent functions, but from mere inspection we could not 
make an accurate quantitative statement. There are 
several formulas for computing correlation. The ne in

We give below an illustrative problem. In column one

Substance learning, in column 4 are given their corre-

A simple method of computing correlation by using 
rank differences instead of the absolute deviation is 
what is known as Spearman’s “Foot-Rule” formula:

nt 
in which R=-correlation, 
‘s=the sum of 
g—an individual’s gain in rank in the second function 
over the rank in the first function, 
u=the number of cases. 
The Spearman formula gives a lower correlation than 
the Pearson formula. 
The procedure in using the Spearman formula is as 
follows: Rank the subjects with reference to standing 
in one function, then find their corresponding ranks in 
the other function. The gains in rank are then added 
and multiplied by 6. This product is the numerator of 
the fraction. The denominator is one less than the 
square of the number of cases. The fraction converted 
into decimal form is subtracted from 1. The result is 
the correlation. The result is not so accurate as that 
obtained from the Pearson formula because no account 
is taken of the absolute amount of individual differ- 
ences. It is a useful formula for rough determination 
of correlation when there are only a few cases. 
The use of the Spearman formula is illustrated in 
the following example from the same data used in 
illustrating the Pearson formula. In the first and third 
columns are given the scores in the two functions. In 
the second column are the ranks in the first function, 
and in the fourth column are the ranks for the second 
function. In the fifth column are indicated the gains in

Probable Error of Correlation.—The formula for de- 
termining the probable error of correlation is, 
1—r 
P. E.=.6745 —— 
| vn Tn the illustration of the Pearson formula above, the 
correlation was found to be .556. (.556)?~-.309136.

.6745 X.178=.12, P.E. 
A correlation is not of much significance unless it is 
at least three times its P. E. 
Conversion of Grades and Scores.—It often happens 
that we wish to convert scores or grades made in dif- 
ferent experiments or different subjects to the same 
basis for purpose of comparison, or to be able to add 
the scores and give a single rating for all the scores
-P-A-G-E-298
MEASURES 293 
combined. The object of reducing to the same basis is 
to be able to give the same weight to the different 
measures. For example: Suppose we have given a 
number of different mental tests to students and wish 
to express in one number their respective abilities. If 
we simply add the scores more weight is given to those 
scores that have a high average, but if we reduce the 
Scores in each test to a common average, each test has 
the same weight in this average. It makes no differ- 
ence what average is chosen, but 50 is a convenient 
number. The process of conversion is as follows: Find 
the average in each test, and then give each subject a 
score that has the same ratio to his actual score that 
50 has to the actual average. By the use of a slide rule 
this conversion can be quickly and accurately done. In 
tests that have a work limit, efficiency depending upon 
fime required to do the work, a low score means high 
ficiency. In such cases, first determine the reciprocals 
of each score by means of a slide rule or by using tables, 
such as Barlow’s, then make the conversion as explained 
above, es ae

~ FOREWORD 
‘Ts book is intended for use in the upper 
grammar grades where bench work in wood 
is first introduced to the pupils. 
The aim has been to present a collection of 
working drawings of useful projects that are 
suitable for beginners of the age found in these 
grades. Not all of the projects can be called 
“new,” but all have been successfully worked 
out at the bench by grammar grade pupils. 
_ The writer wishes this to be recognized as a 
. collection of drawings, not a course or series. 
- No effort has been made to present a sequence 
of projects or exercises. That is the job of the 
individual teacher. He should be the best 
judge of what will lead his pupils to do their 
best work. He should be capable of selecting the project that involves such exercises in wood- 
working as his pupils are Prepared to do in a 
workmanlike manner. 
It is not the intention that the notes that 
accompany each working drawing are to be 
substituted for the usual demonstration and 
instruction by the teacher, While in most 
cases the notes outline the steps to be taken, 
their purpose is to be helpful, to clinch the 
teacher’s demonstration and instruction, and to 
stimulate the pupil to do a little planning and 
thinking for himself. Nearly every project— 
even those most simple in character offer pos- 
sibilities for modification by the pupil without 
upsetting the teacher’s plan of presentation of 
the technical part of the work.

I. PLANING TO DIMENSIONS 
There are several ways of planing the pieces 
of wood contained in a project. When the 
project is a simple one, there are two common 
wed. The first is 
he project is fur- 
inished thickness. 
The second is used when the wood is furnished

marks on the surfi ces. The second set of steps in planing is the one 
used most often in the manual training shop, 
or where very fine, close and accurate work is 
to be done. Seldom is a piece of wood procured 
that is perfectly flat or straight across, as it is 
“subject to change without notice” after it 
leaves the sawmill, due to changes in tempera- 
ture, dampness, etc. To plane the broad sur- 
faces flat and true would tend to make the 
board too thin. Therefore the stock should be 
procured thicker than the finished size is to be. 
The usual allowance for planing, as made by 
careful workmen, is: 14” in thickness, 14’’ in 
width, 14” in length. 
The two common sets of steps in planin 
follow in “Steps in Planing,” (First Method) 
and (Second Method). 
When a number of pieces are to be made tha 
have several dimensions in common, it is mor 
economical to plane the pieces in such a wa’ 
as to save time, labor, and material. There ar 
several cases where this is done to advantage, ani 
they are outlined in plates C, D, E, and F.

PLANING TO DIMENSIONS 
  
STEPS IN PLANING 
A. (First Method) 
Planing in two dimensions, or, steps in planing when the wood is of the required thickness. 
1. Mark the hollow, or concave side of the board with one straight line, thus: / Call this 
the “working face.” 
2. Plane the better edge straight and smooth, and square to the working face (/). Mark 
with two lines, thus: // 
Call this the “working edge.” 
  3. Gage the width from the working edge (//), and plane to the line. 
4. Plane the better end square to the working face (/) and the working edge (//). 
5. Mark off the length from the finished end, saw next to the line, and plane the second end 
square to the working face (/) and the working edge (//). 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
ELEMENTARY WOODWORKING PROJECTS 
  STEPS IN PLANING 
B. (Second Method) 
Planing in three dimensions, or steps to be taken when the wood is thicker than the 
required dimensions. 
1. Plane the better broad face flat and smooth. Mark thus: / 
Call this the “working face.” 
2. Plane the better edge straight and smooth, and square to the working face (/). Mark //. 
Call this the “working edge.” 
3. Gage the width from the working edge (//) and plane to the line. 
4. Gage the thickness from the working face (/) and plane to the line. 
s. Plane the better end square to the working face (/) and to the working edge (//). 
6. Mark off the length from the finished end, saw next to the lines to remove the waste 
wood, and plane the second end square to the working face (/) and the working edge (//). 
Nore: When the wood is narrow the end planing may be done with the aid of the bench 
hook, using the block plane. : 
When the wood is 4” wide, or wider, it is better to hold it end up in the vise. 
When the board is very wide, 8” or more, the smoothing plane or the jack plane will be 
used to better advantage than the block plane for end planing. 
In any case, plane only part way across the end from each edge. Planing all the way 
across the end of a piece of wood causes the corners to be split off.

C. (Third Method) 
When there are two long pieces of the same length, width, and thickness, or of the same 
length and thickness. 
1. Procure a piece of stock wider than the combined width of the two pieces. 
2. Plane the better broad face flat and smooth. Mark / 
Call this the “working face.” 
3. Plane both edges straight and smooth, and square to the working face (/). Mark both 
of these edges //. They are the working edges—one for each piece. 
4. Gage the thickness from the working face (/), and plane to the line. 
5. Gage the width of each piece from the working edges (//) saw between the lines, and 
plane the sawn edge of each piece to the gage lines. 
6. Plane the better end of each piece square to the working face (/) and the working edge 
(//). 
7. Mark off the length of each piece, saw next to the line and plane the ends square to the 
working faces (/) and the working edges (//).

Nore: If there are three pieces to be made the wood sawed out of the middle will make 
the third piece. The ends should be squared to make it the proper length. 
If there are four pieces to be made repeat steps 6 and 7 on the wood sawed out of the 
middle of the strip.

the taper and plane carefully to the line. All 
surfaces should be cleaned with sandpaper. The 
No. O sandpaper shown on the drawing is cut 
from the larger sheets. Ordinarily sandpaper 
is torn to size, and not cut, as it may be plainly 
seen that it would ruin the cutting edge on any 
tool. In this case an old knife may be used to: 
prepare the paper, as a smooth edge is desired. 
The paper is glued to the wood with a very 
thin coat of glue. The handle may be decorated 
with a stencil design or simple carving.

TRELLIS 
This project may easily be changed in con- 
struction or dimensions to suit some individual 
need. It may be made taller, with more cross 
pieces, or some other arrangement of parts may 
be used by the workman. If the drawing is 
followed: Procure stock in two pieces, one 
54 X24" X25”, to make the upright parts, the 
other 54’x«214"x12", to make the cross 
pieces. 
Plane these pieces to thickness, and on each 
edge. Then gage the widths of the parts from 
the edges, saw between the gage lines, and plane 
the sawn edges of each piece to the gage lines. 
Point the ends of the long pieces as indicated in 
the drawing, using either the knife or the 
chisel. Then measure for length and square ends 
on the pieces to make them the required length. 
When assembling, tack the pieces in place 
with only one brad in each joint. Then make 
sure that the pieces are square to each other, and 
secure them with a second brad in each joint. White or green paint is a good finish for this 
project. 
Piant LaBEL AND GARDEN STAKE 
The steps taken in making these objects are 
quite similar to those for making the trellis. 
Procure material enough larger than the 
finished sizes to allow for planing. Plane to the 
finished width and thickness, draw the shape of 
the point carefully, and whittle or chisel to the 
lines. Then mark off the length and square the 
second end. 
The plant label has a saw cut in the top to 
hold a card with the name of the plant written 
on it. This card is held in place with a small 
nail or wire thrust through the hole shown, and 
thru the card when it is in the saw cut. 
The garden stake is trimmed as shown with 
the chisel or knife. 
These two objects may be left unfinished or 
may be painted to suit one’s taste.

PAIL STAND 
This project gives practice in planing long 
pieces and in making duplicate parts. Procure 
stock for the slats and square them up after 
the method described on page 11. The legs are 
planed square after the method on page Io. 
The outline for the bottom of the legs shown 
in the drawing may be used, or one more 
pleasing may be designed by the workman. 
. If the drawing is followed, locate the center of 
the hole as indicated. Then draw the slanting 
lines shown. After boring the hole, saw on these 
slanting lines, and smooth up the edges. Sandpaper all the surfaces smooth and assem- 
ble, using either nails or screws. To be sure that 
the stand will go together squarely, first fasten 
the legs to one of the outside slats, making sure 
that the legs are at right angles to the outer 
edge of the slat. Then fasten the other outside 
piece so that it is flush with the other ends of the 
legs. The middle slat is then put in place and 
the job is done. Make sure that the ends of 
the slats overhang the legs the proper amount, 
and that they are in line, also that the stand 
rests level when stood on a flat surface.

DISH DRAINER 
This article is intended to be used in the 
bottom of the kitchen sink to raise the dishes 
placed upon it to drain off. 
The dimensions may be readily changed to 
fit any particular sink. 
. Considerable drill is obtained by the maker 
in the planing of narrow surfaces. He should 
read the matter on planing; pages 9, 10, 11, 
and 12, and should try to apply the rules in 
such a way that he will complete the work in the 
most efficient manner, as demanded by the 
stock he has to use. In the making of an article 
like this the workman often has an opportunity 
to make use of a good deal of material that has been accumulated as waste. Cz

BACK REST 
This project gives the workman lots of drill 
in planing narrow surfaces. Generally there 
is material in strips about the shop that will 
work into the making of a few of these objects 
to advantage. 
Follow the rules for planing carefully. (Steps 
in Planing; Second Method, page 8, or Fourth 
Method, page 10.) When assembling, it is 
good to square a line across the outer edges 
of two of the slats to mark where the edges of the cross pieces are to come. Tack the 
outer slats in place with only one nail in each 
cross piece. The four sided frame, thus pro- 
duced may be squared, and held true by the 
second nail in each corner. The middle strip 
may then belocated and tacked in place. Finally 
the remaining strips are placed carefully and 
fastened. If screws are used the same steps 
may be taken. If the nails should show thru 
they may be clinched on the under side.

SEWING STAND 
This is a very popular little sewing stand 
because of its extreme lightness which makes it 
easy to carry about. When not in use it may be 
stowed away in a closet as it takes but little 
room when folded. 
The maker of this stand gets experience in 
planing duplicate pieces and in boring. The 
material for the legs is procured in one piece, 
54” x6" X27”, and is planed as described on 
page 11. All four legs should then be the same 
width and thickness. This method is useful in 
making boxes and any other object made with a 
number of long duplicate parts. The ends of 
the legs are next marked out with the compasses 
and trimmed to shape with the chisel. When 
marking for the holes for the dowels, place the 
legs on the bench edge to edge and square the 
lines across all four at one time. Bore very carefully. If any hole is bored at an ar: |

This is a simple exercise in broad surface 
planing. Procure the material 74” x6” X13”. 
Plane to the required size, following the rules 
for planing in three dimensions, page 8. A 
choice of four designs is offered on the drawing. 
The curve in the working drawing is made with 
compasses, sawed out with the turning saw and smoothed with the spoke. shave. The other 
designs show simpler treatments. Locate the 
holes as shown. Remember to bore only until 
the spur shows thru. Then reverse the wood, 
finishing the boring from the opposite side. Be 
sure all surfaces are clean and smooth. No 
stain or shellac should be used on this project.

be made, as they would tend to destroy the 
usefulness of the board. After making a number 
of patterns get the teacher’s advice as to which 
one is the most suitable to use. 
The board may be stained, or finished ir 
natural color, according to the kind of wood 
used. Four thin coats of shellac should be 
applied and rubbed down with fine pumice- 
stone and raw linseed oil.

FOOT STOOL 
This article finds its place of usefulness by the 
easy chair or in the sewing room. 
The pieces are to be planed to size after the 
method outlined in the plates showing the 
steps in planing. In the case of the legs it 
would save labor to procure a piece of stock long 
enough to make both legs and plane it to width 
and thickness before sawing it in two, as indi- 
cated on page Io. 
The drawing shows how the stool may be 
modified in design to satisfy the individual 
taste. 
After assembling, the stool had better be 
stained and polished as this is difficult to do 
after the upholstering has been done. 
The upholstering is very simple. First tack 
strips of burlap or heavy cloth, 4’ wide, to the 
top of the stool so that two thirds the width overlaps the edge of the top. Make a long roll of 
the material that is to be used for stuffing 
(curled hair, cotton, or tow) and lay it around 
the edge of the top. Carry the free edge of the 
strip of burlap over the filling and tack it down

round edge, all along the outer edge of the top. 
The stuffing will fill the space inside this roll. 
It is covered with burlap or other rough, cheap 
material which is tacked down around the outer 
edge of the top. The top cover may then be 
smoothly stretched and tacked around the edge. 
Bind the edges with gimp, tacked with covered 
tacks that match the top material. The gimp 
should cover all the rough edges of the cover 
and the plain tacks. With reasonable care, 
after studying these directions, any boy ought 
to be able to do a very neat job.

MITER BENCH-HOOK 
This project lays strong emphasis on the 
squaring-up process. 
The stock for the base should be carefully 
squared to size following the rules for planing 
on page 8. The center line may then be drawn 
and the holes located upon it and bored, as 
indicated in the drawing. Procure a piece of 
stock long enough to include the miter block 
and the two end blocks. Plane this to the 
width of the base and to the thickness indicated 
on the drawing. The angle of 45° for the miter 
blocks may then be marked off and the surplus 
wood cut away by carefully sawing near the line 
with the back saw. Care should be taken to 
plane this surface to the exact angle and at the 
same time keep the surface at right angles to the 
broad surface. When this has been done, the 
length of the miter block may be marked off 
and the piece trimmed to size. The material remaining should make the 
two end blocks. Carefully square both ends 
before marking the length of these pieces and 
sawing them in two. In this case the “length” 
goes the short way of the board, as “length” 
in wood is generally understood to run with the 
grain. When these pieces have been trimmed to 
the finished size they are carefully glued in 
place, preferably with hot glue, and left in 
clamps until dry. The corners may then be 
trimmed as shown and the work cleaned up. 
The miter block is held in place with a niece 
of dowel, which is glued only to the block, 
block may then be set aside, when it is d__..-_

  BOOT-BLACKING STAND 
‘This project is an old favorite of the boys and 
gives excellent practice in broad surface planing 
and simple construction. 
The ends and sides should be planed according 
to the rules for planing, B, page 8. 
The construction lines for the pattern cut on 
the end have been left on the drawing to aid the 
workman to reproduce the curve on the wood. 
Draw the center line first and locate the center 
of the hole. Make a mark 2” from each edge 
on the bottom end. Adjust the compasses to 
half the distance from this mark to the center of 
the hole and describe the arcs shown in light 
lines. Where these arcs intersect is the center of 
the arcs that outline the pattern. The radius 
is the same for all arcs. Bore the hole and then 
saw the curves with the turning-saw. The 
pupil may design his own outline with the per- 
mission of his teacher. When these curves have 
been smoothed nicely, the joint may be marked 
out. First make a line across the edges as far from the top end as the side boards are wide, 
Square this line with lead pencil on both sides 
of the board. Set the gage to the thickness of 
the side boards and gage lines parallel to the 
edges on both sides of the end piece, from the 
top to the pencil lines. Saw very carefully just 
to this line with the rip saw, so that the saw will 
leave a flat surface for the side board to fit 
against. If the sawing is well done, no trim- 
ming will be necessary. Saw across the grain 
with the back saw to complete the joint. The 
sides and ends should next be assembled. All 
inside surfaces should be made smooth and clean. 
The location of the brads should be marked 
lightly and the brads started in the sides as 
shown on the drawing. Put glue on the edge of 
the end piece before placing the sides and driving 
the nails home. The corners of the box should 
be square when nailed together. The bottom 
board may be planed to thickness and with one 
edge and one end squared. The length is then

marked very carefully and the board fitted and 
nailed in place. The edges may be trimmed off 
flush to the sides of the box. The pieces for the 
top are planed to dimensions and chamfered as 
shown on the drawing. One side is fastened 
down and the other is hinged to it. If the box 
is to be painted the brads may be driven thru 
the top, but if it is to be stained and polished 
it would be best to fasten the top with “blind 
nails” and glue. To do this drive brads into 
edges of the box on the side the cover is to be 
fastened to and cut off the heads 3%" above the 
surface of the wood. Press the top down on 
these brads until it touches the top edge of the

of the box and clamp the top down with hand- 
screws. Wipe off any surplus glue and set aside to harden. The foot rest may |

  PEN AND PENCIL HOLDER 
To make a good job of this project the work- 
man must use extreme care in boring the holes. 
Therefore he gains valuable experience in using 
the auger bit. 
The two pieces are first planed carefully to 
the dimensions shown in the drawing. Then the 
holes are located on the thicker piece. First 
draw the center lines the long way on each 
edge. Then square pencil lines around the piece 
to locate the holes, as shown. When boring, 
the position of the bit should be carefully noted 
so that the holes will be straight. If the boring is exact the spur on the bit will show thru at the 
intersection of the lines on the opposite side. 
The pieces should then be reversed and the 
boring completed from the opposite sides. Tf 
the holes are not bored straight the fact wil. 
emphasized when the pencils are placec. 
them, as they will stand very much out of line. 
After boring, sandpaper all surfaces, and nail 
the two pieces together as shown on the drawing. 
Finish this object well with wax, or with 
stain, shellaced and rubbed down with pumice 
stone and raw linseed oil.

THE TOOTH BRUSH RACK 
This project gives the maker practice in 
planing duplicate parts, in boring, | and fastening 
with brads. 
It is a project offering a number of opportuni- 
ties for the maker to exercise his ingenuity. The 
drawing shows five very simple designs for the 
outline of the back, and the workman may 
design many more by cutting paper patterns. 
Often boys want to make the rack hold more 
brushes. This is easily done by adding 134” in 
width for each extra hole. 
The back is planed to dimensions according 
to the rules for planing given on page 8. The 
wood for the cross pieces is procured long enough 
to make the two pieces in one strip. This is 
planed to proper width and thickness and the 
ends squared before it is cut in two. (See 
pageto.) This is the best way to get out pieces 
of wood of similiar dimensions, especially when 
they are short, as it is much more difficult to plane short pieces of wood straight than it ie +, 
plane longer pieces that give better 
the plane.

  CLOTHES-LINE REEL 
This is a very useful article and a favorite 
with beginners in woodwork. The maker gets 
experience in planing duplicate pieces, in boring 
and in nailing. 
Procure stock for the sides in one piece, 
54” x5"x17". Plane out the sides as de- 
scribed on page 9. 
Draw the center lines on the side pieces. 
Then place the pieces side by side and draw the 
lines across both at once, 5” from each end. 
This will make the holes sure to be in line. 
When boring the holes make sure that the bit is 
at right angles to the wood. If any one hole is 
bored at an angle the frame will be distorted, 
making a poor job. Bore until the point of the 
bit shows, then turn the wood over to finish 
from the other side. The corners of the side pieces are easily trimmed with the chise

  TOWEL STAND 
This rack is intended to be used in the bath- 
room, or kitchen, where towels may be hung to 
dry. It is so easily moved about that it may be 
stood before the radiator or stove to take advan- 
tage of the heat in drying out towels. Another 
use of this rack is that of holding newly ironed 
linens, such as towels, pillow slips, sheets, etc., 
until the ironer is ready to put the things away. 
To save lumber and labor, procure two pieces 
of stock, one 14” <5" X22” and one 54” 514" 
x26". The first will furnish the top and bot- 
tom pieces for each end. The second will fur- 
nish the four upright pieces. Plane the first

This is another useful article for the home. 
Itis designed to hold two pairs of trousers. Any 
kind of wood may be used. 
First plane the material to the thickness,

page 8 for method of planing. Then draw the 
center lines for the holes as indicated and bore 
the holes with the auger-bit. 
Draw the lines for the slots with the marking 
gage on both sides of the board. Saw out the 
slots with the rip-saw, making the kerf on the 
inside of the lines. Mark out the “V” shape openings at the ends of the slots and saw with 
the back-saw. Before driving the screws shown 
in the drawing, bore with drill bits, first with 
one the size of the shank of the screw, and then 
with one smaller than the worm of the screw, 
so that the wood will not split as the screw 
enters. 
Use the countersink to ream the edge of 
the hole to fit the screw head. Sandpaper

described in Steps in Planing, page 10. 
In marking for the oblique surfaces, square 
lines across the edges and ends of the pieces the 
required distance from the corners, as shown on 
the drawing. Connect the ends of these lines 
with oblique lines drawn on both sides of each piece. Saw next to the lines with the back-saw> 
holding the pieces on the bench hook, broad side 
up. Smooth to the lines with the plane. To 
plane obliquely one must remember to plane 
from the edge of the board towards the end. 
The surface will be badly torn and roughed if 
the planing is done in the opposite direction. 
Sandpaper the surfaces smooth and clean and 
fasten the pieces together with brads.

urged to try to originate his own outline by 
means of cutting paper patterns. Neither 
outline shown on the drawing is very beautiful, 
and the workman ought to find it very easy to

danger of getting the hole off center, as might 
happen if only pencil marks were used. This 
method of marking is good to use whenever 
very accurate boring is to be done. ‘In this case, 
when boring, it will be best to bore only half 
way thru from each side to make sure the holes 
are exactly centered on the rods. 
The front corners of the brackets, and all 
four corners of the back are to be rounded. The 
curve should be marked on both sides of the 
wood with compassess. The bulk of the waste 
wood is removed with the chisel. The wood may 
be held in the vise and the chisel used so as to 
cut from the side towards the end wood, so as to 
follow the grain. Another way of chiseling 
would be to hold the wood flat on a scrap piece 
and chisel vertically, beginning at the side and 
proceeding around the corner toward the end. 
The flat side of the chisel is held next to the 
wood. The corner is finished smooth in both 
cases by filing or sandpapering around the end. 
When finished, there should be no corner or ridge where the curve began or ended, 
curve should blend into the straight s: 
end. The rods and brackets should : 
sandpapered clean and smooth, and 
together as shown on the drawing. 
The center lines for the screw holes are next 
drawn on the back pieces. It will be noticed 
that the drawing shows how far from the top 
the upper screw holes are. A line is squared 
across the piece at the distance from the 
shown on the drawing. Then the center 
for the lower holes is located as far below the 
first line as the distance between the cent 
the brackets. The screwholes may th 
bored, the holes countersunk and the

the wall should not be overlooked when boring. 
To find a solid place for this rack, tap on the 
wall lightly with a hammer if it is plastered. 
Fasten the rack where the wall sounds solid so 
that the screws will enter the framework of the 
house instead of only plaster.

VI. CONSTRUCTION— BOXES, ETC. 
TELEPHONE BRACKET 
This bracket is designed to hang on the wall 
at a suitable height to support the telephone, 
either for a person sitting or standing while 
talking. If fastened so that the upper shelf is 
about 30” from the floor, the bracket takes the 
place of a telephone table. The upper shelf 
supports the telephone, the lower shelf forms a 
pocket for the telephone directory. Before 
getting out the material for the bracket make 
sure that the pocket is large enough for the 
directory used in your locality. If not, the 
dimensions should be changed to suit. 
A board 4” X94" X40", is needed for the 
two shelves and the two ends. Plane one edge 
of this board straight, smooth, and square to 
the broad faces. Next mark off the width (9’’) 
and plane the second edge to the line. This 
procedure ensures your making all four pieces, i.e., the two shelves, and two ends, of an equal 
width. This board may then be cut up to make 
the four pieces, care being taken to keep to the 
dimensions called for in the working drawing. 
The best method would be to square both ends 
of the board first, then mark off the length of 
one shelf from each end. These pieces may 
then be sawed off, and the ends trimmed 
to the lines. The pieces remaining should 
make the two ends. This may be left intact 
until after the pattern is drawn upon it, 
as it may be noted from the drawing that the 
ends are not squared, but modelled from an 
outline preferably designed by the individual 
workman. 
The wood for the back should be 14” long, 
taken from a board slightly wider than 10”. If 
it is difficult to obtain a board wider than 10”,

  TRAY FOR TABLE SILVER 
This tray is used in the drawer of the serving 
table or sideboard to make a separate place for 
each kind of table silver—knives, forks, tea- 
spoons and tablespoons. It gives the workman 
considerable practice in accurate planing and 
teaches him to make a “butt-joint.” The 
material for sides may be provided in one piece 3B" x6" x15”. 
To plane out the two pieces, proceed as de- 
scribed in the Third Method under Steps in 
Planing, page 9. 
The best way to make the end pieces and 
partitions (if no small pieces are available in 
the shop that will work in at this time) is to 
use two strips, one 56X3'"X29”, and the 
other 543”x19”". These strips will make 
three and two pieces respectively when planed 
out as described under Fourth Method, page 10. 
Mark out the positions of the brads that fasten 
the sides and partitions together. When these 
are located, prick a hole into the wood with a 
brad point or marking awl and sandpaper the surfaces clean—excepting the ends. 
The ends are not sandpapered be: 
are apt to be rounded and thereby 
joints. Nail the pieces together very

to the cover so as to hold it in position. Th 
cover may also be hinged.

  LETTER TRAY 
If someone uses a typewriter at home or in 
office work, one of these trays will be found 
almost indispensible, as it takes care of the 
paper used on the machine, or keeps letters in 
place until they can be taken care of. Many 
business men are accustomed to have three 
trays like this on their desks, one marked 
_ “IN,” containing the letters to be examined, 
one marked “OUT,” containing work completed, 
and one marked “HOLD,” containing letters or 
work that needs attention later. 
To make this project use a piece of stock for 
the sides 148" x1534”, and another piece 
56" X8" X1114", for the ends. These pieces 
are planed as described on page 9. 
If either of the optional joints are used the 
lengths of the sides and ends will have to be 
changed. 
One end only of the tray is cut down as shown 
on the end view. This is cut to lines drawn with

BIRD FEEDING SHELF 
This little shelf is made very much like the 
grain feeders for poultry. The food is placed in 
the hopper and sifts thru as the birds eat away 
that which is at the bottom. The top is made 
overhanging to shelter the food and the floor is 
made with an incline to make sure that the rain 
will run off and away from the food. The floor 
is also wide to catch and save any food flicked 
about by the birds. 
The drawing shows how the sides are marked 
out to prevent waste of wood. These sides are made of 34” material so that there will be plenty 
of thickness to hold the nails. The rest of the 
feeder is made of 34” stock. 
The top is hinged to make it simple to place 
the food in the hopper. Give the feeder at least 
two coats of paint before placing it outdoors to 
preserve it from the action of the weather. 
A piece of spruce 2” x 3” x 6 feet in length 
will serve for a pole. The feeder may he*>- 
tened to the pole by means of two 14”:

this sewing stand. 
Make the ends, or legs first. The outline may 
be drawn directly on the wood, or a stiff paper 
pattern may first be cut out and used for 
marking on the wood. Care should be taken 
when cutting the wood to shape, to keep the 
sides symmetrical. 
Next prepare the sides. These may be planed 
to dimensions as indicated in Steps in Planing, 
page 8. The side pieces are nailed to the legs, 
and the upper edge is planed to the sameangle 
that is on the upper end of the legs. The work- 
man should remember that it is good practice to 
sandpaper the inner surfaces of an object like 
this before it is nailed together. 
The piece for the handle should next be pre-

ROLLING BLOTTER 
This project gives the student an opportunity 
to learn some of the principles involved in 
modeling a broad surface with hand tools. 
The piece of wood for the base is first planed 
to the dimensions called for on the drawing. 
Center lines are drawn around the short way 
of the piece. It is next held in the vise so that 
the edge is flush with the top surface of a waste 
piece of wood that lies flat on the bench. The 
center line is then extended square across the 
waste piece. The center of the arc outlining the 
base is located on this line, and the arc drawn 
with the compasses. When the arc has been 
drawn on both edges, saw cuts are made with 
the back-saw across the grain on the bottom 
side, nearly to the arc. These cuts should be 
about 4" apart. Their purpose is to make it 
easier to remove the waste wood with the chisel. 
It is best to do the chiseling part way across the 
board from each edge, rather than to cut all 
the way across the wood. In cutting clear across 
a board with a chisel, (or any cutting tool), one is apt to chip off the further edge. When the 
waste wood is removed, the spokeshave may be 
used to model the surface true to the lines. 
When finished this surface should test straight 
across, and should be without lumps—a nice 
true curve from end to end. / 
The top piece is very simply prepared, as it 
needs only to be planed square and true to 
dimensions. If desired, the top edge may be 
chamfered, measuring 34” in on the top, and 
1%" down on the sides and ends. The holes for 
the screws should be located and bored carefully 
so that they will correspond with those in the 
handle. 
It would be appropriate to apply some surface 
decoration to the top surface of the blotter. 
Either carving or simple stencilling in colors 
would be suitable. The top piece could be 
covered with ooze leather, which has been 
tooled, and the idea could be carried out in the 
making of a complete desk set. 
The handle offers a boy an opportunity to
-P-A-G-E-89
88 : ELEMENTARY WOODWORKING PROJECTS 
  design his own pattern. Sometimes a drawer 
knob is used for a handle. The metal kind that 
has the screw threaded into it is the best. 
If the drawing is followed in making the 
handle, a piece of wood 34” x2" X4}4" should 
be used. This is planed to size except for the 
width, which is not changed. Then the centers 
of the curves are located and the arcs drawn 
with the compasses as shown on the drawing. 
The coping-saw or turning-saw may be used to cut to the curves and the edge is smoothed, care 
being taken to make the edge square to the 
broad surface. 
The holes for the screws are located and 
bored from the bottom edge and all the pieces 
sandpapered clean and smooth, and assembled. 
This model should be nicely finished, either 
with stain, or wax or shellac, according to the 
kind of wood used and the finish on the furni- 
ture with which it is to be used.

An excellent opportunity is offered by this 
project for the pupil to design his own outlines. 
The drawing suggests five different patterns for 
each edge that are practical to model. The 
pupil may design many more by folding and 
cutting pieces of paper that are the same size 
as the piece of wood. After a number of simple 
patterns have been cut, the most pleasing may 
be applied to the wood and cut out with the 
coping-saw. 
Procure material for the back enough longer, wider and thicker than the finished sizes t 
allow for planing. The sides of the holder ar 
made ‘easiest from one piece 34” X134" X6" 
which is planed to width and thickness before i 
is sawed in two (See page 10). The front i 
first squared to size, and then the edges ar

Procure stock for the base of this project 
first. Plane it to proper size, following the out-

groove is to be, and use a gouge, about 34” wide 
to cut out the wood. The surface should be 
made as smooth as possible with the gouge. 
Then a piece of sandpaper may be wrapped 
around a piece of 1’ dowel, and the surface 
dressed down smooth. 
If the shop is equipped with a plow, the groove 
for the stationery holder should be planed out 
next. Ifno plow is to be had the groove may be 
chiselled out. Gage lines deeply to mark the 
sides of the groove, and chisel between them 
with a narrow chisel.

outline with the knife point, and use the chisel 
to make the recess. The chisel is driven into 
the wood with the flat side against the edge of the opening, and the bevelled side towards the 
waste wood. To cut out the waste wood the 
chisel is held bevel down, flat side up. When 
finished, the recess for the bottle should be 
flat on the bottom and the edges should be 
smooth, just fitting the bottle.

BOOK SUPPORTS 
In making these book supports the workman 
practices the making of duplicate pieces, the 
modelling of edges, the making of the dado 
joint, and oblique planing on a broad surface. 
If time permits, he may also apply some form 
of surface enrichment to the ends, such as 
stencilling or simple carving. In the making of 
the supports, the following method of procedure 
has been found to work out best. 
Procure two pieces of material, each 34”X 
6%4"X14”. - Each piece will make one of the 
supports. Plane each piece square as described 
on page 10, except that the last step is to be 
omitted at this time, that is, the pieces -will not be cut in two. Next mark on the sides 
of each piece the outlines of the obliqu: 
The wood is then held in the vise a: 
that makes it easy to plane on the ol: 
face. Most of the waste wood may: 
removed by first planing across the ;, 
the jack plane. If the plane is held a:

  Plane this piece of wood after the method 
described on page ro. 
Make sure that the face marks are on each 
of the pieces. Square a knife line across the 
longer piece 44” from the end. Place the edge 
of the shorter piece against this line and mark 
with the point of the knife where the opposite 
edge comes on the long piece. A second knife 
line squared across the piece at this point marks 
off the exact width of the joint. In a similar 
way the width of the joint may be marked on the 
shorter piece. One must take care to locate the 
joint in the-middle of this piece, and on the 
side opposite to the face side. These lines are 
then squared half way down on the edges of 
both pieces. Lines are made parallel to the face sides with the marking gage set to half th 
thickness of the wood. With the knife cut ; 
notch on the inner side of each knife line on th 
broad surfaces. This makes a place for th 
back-saw to start in and makes the saw-ker 
come just within the knife lines. Several othe: 
cuts may be made between the knife lines t 
make it easier to chisel out the waste wood 
Take care to cut only to the gage lines, and t 
chisel only half way across from each edgi 
of the board. If each step is carefully taken 
perfect fitting joint should be made. 
The hole is easily located and bored, and th 
corners trimmed as shown with the chisel. Th 
joint may then be glued and the surfaces sand 
papered. 
SKIRT MARKER 
The making of the mortise and tenon joint 
may be learned thru this project. First prepare 
the base, planing it to size as indicated on 
page 8. Do not chamfer the edges until after 
the joint has been cut. Procure the wood for the post long enough to include the piece that slide: 
on it. This strip may be planed to width anc 
thickness before it is cut in two to make the 
post and cross piece. (See page 10.) When al. 
pieces have been planed to size the opening:

118 ELEMENTARY WOODWORKING PROJECTS 
Or 
may be marked with the gage and knife. Bore 
out as much stock as possible before chiseling to 
the lines. Square a knife line around the post 
to mark for the shoulder of the joint. Gage on 
each side of the post for the sides of the tenon as 
dimensioned on the drawing. Saw across the 
sides of the post and chisel off the waste wood, 
making the tenon fit snugly into the mortise 
(the opening in the base). If care is taken in cutting, the post will stand solidly, and square 
to the base. The opening in the sliding piece is 
made in a similar manner to that in the base. 
Note that one end of this opening is inclined to 
fit the wedge. 
The remaining features are all shown clearly 
enough on the drawing for the workman to 
complete the project. The post is glued in the 
base. Finish with shellac. 
SPOOL REEL 
This project was originated by a boy to hold 
the spools of thread or carpet warp used by his 
mother in crocheting. 
The uprights are fastened to the base with 
housed dado joints. The rod for the spools is 
loose in the holes. 
To make the project procure two pieces of 
wood, one for the base, 14" X414" X814", and 
one for the uprights, 54” x314" x12". Plane 
the first piece after the rules in Steps in Planing, 
page 8, and the second piece after the rules on page 10. Do not chamfer the edges of the base 
until after the joints have been made. 
The joint is marked on the base first. Square 
a knife line across the top side of the base, 34” 
from each end. Stop these lines 34” from each 
edge, so that they will not overrun the joint and 
show after the work is finished. Stand one of 
the uprights on end with one of its edges against 
one of the knife lines. With the point of the 
knife mark where the other edge falls on the 
base. At this point square another line across

the base similar to the others. Then the width 
of the dado will be marked on the base and it 
will be exactly equal to the thickness of the 
upright that is to fit into it. Repeat the process 
for the second joint. It would be well to mark 
these 4 and B, or in some similar way, so that 
they will not be confused later. Set the gage 
at 34" and gage from each edge of the board so 
as to make a line between the two knife lines of 
each joint. This marks the length of each dado. 
To chisel out the waste wood use a 1” chisel to 
cut across the grain of the wood, just inside, and 
parallel to the knife lines. Use a mallet to 
drive the chisel. The second cuts may be made 
with the chisel edge directly in the knife lines, 
and with the flat side of the chisel next to the 
lines. The'reason for doing this is that the 
chisel crowds the wood to each side when it is 
driven in. The first cut in the waste makes an 
opening into which the wood is crowded when 
the second cut is made on the line. This process ELEMENTARY WOODWORKING PROJECTS 
  
prevents the chisel from making the dado toc 
wide. The wood between the chisel cuts i: 
removed with a 3%” chisel. Do not try tc 
remove all the wood with the first cut of the 
chisel. About 14" is enough to expect to remove 
before cutting again with the wider chisel across 
the grain. Proceeding in this way the workmar 
will soon remove the waste wood to the proper 
depth. The sides of the dado should be clean 
cut and square to the top side of the base. The 
uprights may then be marked out to fit the 
dadoes. Use the back-saw to remove the waste 
wood in the corners of the uprights. When 
gluing together make sure that the uprights 
are square to the base. The outline of the 
upright pieces could be made more beautiful if 
modelled to pleasing curves. The outline may 
be designed by the individual workman. All 
the minor details are shown clearly on the 
working drawing. Apply four coats of shellac, 
and rub down smooth with pumice and oil.

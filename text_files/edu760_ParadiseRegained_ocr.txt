With dread attending when that fatal wound 
Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve 
Upon my head; long the decrees of heav’n 
Delay, for longest time to Him is short; 
And now too soon for us the circling hours 
This dreaded time have compast, wherein we 
Must bide the stroke of that long threaten’d

Broken be not intended all our power 
To be infringed, our freedom, and our being, 
In this fair empire won of earth and air:

Destined to this, is late of woman born;

But his growth now to youth’s full flow’r, dis-

Besides what her virtues fair 57 
Added to her noble birth, 
More than she could own from earth

She had told; alas! too soon, 
After so short time of breath, 
To house with darkness, and with death 
Yet had the number of her days 
Been as complete as was her praise, 
*This lady was the wife of John, Marquis of Winchester, 
one of the noblest and most devoted of the adherents of 
CharlesI. His house at Basing, in Hants, stood a two-years’ 
siege by the rebels, and was finally levelled to the ground by 
them, Lord Winchester died in 1674. On his monument is 
an epitaph by Dryden. “It is remarkable,” says Warton,

In giving limit to her life, 
Her high birth, and her grace 
Quickly found a lover meet; 
The virgin choir for her request . 
The god that sits at marriage feast, 
He at their invoking came, 
But with a scarce well-lighted flame; 
And in his garland as he stood, 
Ye might discern a cyprus bud.* 
Once had the early matrons run 
To greet her of a lovely son, 5e 
And now with second hope she goes 
And calls Lucina to her throes; 
But whether by mischance or blame 
Atropost for Lucina came; 
And with remorseless cruelty 
Spoil’d at once both fruit and tree: 
The hapless babe before his birth 
Had burial, yet not laid in earth, 
And the languish’d mother’s womb _ 
Was not long a living toinb. 60 
So have I seen some tender slip, 
Saved with care from winter's nip, 
The pride of her carnation train, 
Pluck’d up by some unheedy swain. 
Who only thought to crop the flow'r 
New shot up from vernal show’r;

COMUS, A MASK. 1684. 
Presented at Ludlow Castle before John, Earl of Bridgewater, 
then President of Wales. 
“Comus” was suggested to the Poet by the fact that the 
‘two sons and the daughter of the Earl of Bridgewater, on their 
return from a visit to some relations in Herefordshire, were 
benighted in Haywood Forest; and the Lady Alice was, for a 
short time, lost. The Mask was written for the Michaelmas 
festivities of 1684, and acted by Lord Bridgewater’s chil- 
dren. The music composed for it was by Henry Lawes, who 
performed in it the part of the Spirit, or Thyrsis. He was the

  184 COMUS.: 
son of Thomas Lawes, a Vicar-Choral of Salisbury Cathedral, 
and was at first a chorister himself. He became finally one 
of the Court musicians to Charles I. Masks and music fled 
before the stern gloom of the Commonwealth, and Lawes was 
compelled to gain his living by teaching the lute. His greatest 
friends during this period of difficulty and poverty were the 
‘Ladies Alice and Mary Egerton. He lived to the Restoration 
and composed the Coronation Anthem for Charles If. ‘*Co- 
mus" was first publish xt by Lawes, without Milton’s name, 
in 1687, with a dedication to Lord Brackley. Masks were the 
fashion of the age; and Milton was probably cailed on by 
Lord Bridgewater to produce one, because he had already 
~written the “ Arcades” for Lady Bridgewater's mother, Lady 
Derby, at Harefield, in Middiesex.

‘TRAGEDY, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held. 
the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other poems; 
therefore said by Aristotle to be of power, by raising pity, 
and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like 
passions, that is, to teraper and reduce them to just measure 
with a kind of delight, stirred up by reading or seeing those 
passions well imitated. Nor is nature wanting in her own ef- 
fects to make good his assertion, for so in physic things of 
melancholic hue and quality are used against melancholy, 
sour against sour, salt to remove salt humors. Hence philos- 
ophers and other gravest writers, as Cicero, Plutarch, and 
others, frequently cite out of tragic poets, both to adorn and 
illustrate their discourse. The Apostle Paul himself thought 
it not unworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the text of 
Holy Scripture, 1 Cor. xv. 31,* and Pareeus, commenting on 
the Revelation, divides the whole book, as a tragedy, into acts, 
distinguished each by a chorus of heavenly harpings and song 
between. Heretofore men in highest dignity have labored 
not a little to be thought able to compose a tragedy. Of that 
honor Dionysius the elder was no less ambitious, than before 
of his attaining to thetyranny. Augustus Cesar also had be- 
gun his “ Ajax,” but unable to please his own judgment with 
what he had begun, left it unfinished. . Seneca, the philoso- 
pher, is by some thought the author of those tragedies, at

68 feast the best of them, that go under that name, Gregory 
Nazianzen, a father of the Church, thought it not unbeseem- 
ing the sanctity of his person to write a tragedy, which is en- 
titled, ‘Christ Suffering.” This is mentioned to vindicate 
tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in 
the accoun of many if undergoes at this day* with other 
common interludes; happening through the poet's error of in- 
termixing comic stuff with tragic sadness and gravity, or in- 
troducing trivial and vulgar persons, which by all judicious 
hath been counted absurd and brought in without discretion, 
corruptly to gratify the people. And though ancient tragedy 
‘use no prologue, yet using sometimes, in case of self-defence, 
or explanation, that which Martial calls an epistie, in behalf of 
this tragedy coming forth after the ancient manner, much 
different from what among us pasees for best, thus much be- 
forehand may be epistled: that Chorus is here introduced 
after the Greek manner, not ancient only but modern. and 
still in use among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of 
this poem, with good reason, the ancients and Italians are 
rather followed, as of much more authority and fame. The 
measure of verse used in the chorus is of all sorts, called by 
the Greeks Monostrophic, or rather Apolelymenon, without 
regard had to Strophe, Antistrophe, or Epode, which were a 
kind of stanzas framed only for the music then used with the 
chorus that sung; not essential to the poem, and therefore not 
material; or being divided into stanzas or pauses, they may be 
called Alleostropha. Division into act and scene referring 
chiefly to the stage, to which this work never was intended, 
is here omitted. 
It suffices if the whole drama be found not produced be- 
yond the fifth act; of the style and uniformity, and that com- 
monly called the plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is 
nothing indeed but such economy, or disposition of the fable 
as may stand best with verisimilitude and decorum, they only 
will best judge who are not unacquainted with Mschylus, 
Sophocles, and Euripides, the three tragic poets, unequalled 
yet byany, and the best rule to all whoendeavor to write 
tragedy. The circumscription of time, wherein the whole 
drama begins and ends is, according to ancient rule and 
best example, within the space of twenty-four hours. 
  
*The Puritans held the drama in the utmost abhorrence. 
It was probably on this account that the Puritan Poet wrote 
this defence of tragedy, to justify himself for writing a 
drama,

TRE ARGUMENT, 
Samson made captive, blind, and now in the prison at Gaza, 
there to labor asin a commion workhouse, on a festival-day 
in the general cessation from labor, comes forth open intothe 
air, to a place nigh, somewhat retired, there to sit awhile-and 
bémoan his condition; where ke happens at length to be 
visited by certain friends and equals of his tribe, which make 
the chorus, who seek to comfort him what they can; then by 
his old father Manoah, who endeavors the like, and withal 
‘tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; and, 
lastly, that this feast was proclaimed by the Philistines as a 
day of thanksgiving for their deliverance from the hands of 
Samson, which yet more troubles him. Manoah then departs 
‘to prosecute his endeavor with the Philistine lords for Sam- 
son’s redemption; who in the mean while is visited by other 
persons; and lastly by a public officer to require his coming to 
the feast before the lords-and people, to play or show his 
strength in their presence. He at first refuses, dismissing the 
public officer with absolute denial to come; at length persuad- 
ed inwardly that this was from God, he yields to go along 
with him, who came now the second time with great threat- 
enings to fetch him. The chorus yet remaining on the place, 
Manoah returns of joyful hope, to procure ere long his 
Son's deliverance:(in the midst of which discourse a Hebrew 
comes in haste, cohfusedly at first, and afterward more dis- 
tinctly, relating the catastrophe, what Samson had done to 
the Philistines, and by accident to himself; wherewith the trag- 
edy ends.

Under the seal of silence could not keep, 
But weakly to a woman must reveal it,

Suffices that to me strength is my bane, 243 
And proves the source of all my miseries, 
So many, and so huge, that each apart 
Would ask a life to wail; but chief of all, 
O loss of sight, of thee I most complain!

Dungeon, or beggary or decrepit age!

And ali her various objects of delight

To daily fraud, contempt, abuse, and wrong.

Since light so necessary is to life, 
And almost life itself, if it be true 
That light is in the soul, 246

To such a tender ball as th’ eye confined, 
So obvious and so easy to be quench’d? 
And not, as feeling, through all parts dif- 
fused, : 
That she might look at will through every

Then had I not been thus exiled from light, 
As in the land of darkness yet in light,

And buried; but O yet more miserable!

From intimate impulse, and therefore urged .

I might begin Israel's deliverance, 
The work to which I was divinely call’d.

Only my love of thee held long debate, 
And combated in silence all these reasons 
With hard contest: at length that grounded 
maxim, 
So rife and celebrated in the mouths 
Of wisest men, that to the public good 
Private respects must yield with grave au-

At distance I forgive thee, go with that, 
Bewail thy falsehood, and the pious works

Cherish thy hasten’d widowhood with the gold 
Of matrimonial treason: so farewell. 
Dau. I see thou art implacable, more deaf 
To prayers than winds and seas, yet winds to

Are reconciled at length, and sea to shore: 333 
Thy anger unappeasable still rages, 
Eternal tempest never to be calm’d.

’ For peace, reap nothing but repulse and hate? 
Bid go with evil omen and the brand 
Of infamy upon my name denounced?

Henceforth, nor too much disapprove my own.

And with contréry blasts proclaims most

Bears greatest names in his wild aery flight. 
My name perhaps among the circumcised, 
In Dan, in Judah, and the bordering tribes,

Came to the place, and what was set before 
him,

Between the pillars; he his guide requested, *

Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined, 
And eyes fast fixt he atood, as one who 
pray’d, 401

At last with head erect thus cried aloud, 
Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed 
I have perform’d, as reason’ was, obeying,

Now of my own accord, such other trial 
I mean to show you of my strength, yet

Of this, but each Philistian city round,

eyes had nearly lost its sight. The physicians predicted the 
loss of both, if he used them, But Milton told Du Moulin, “I 
did not long balance whether my duty should be preferred to 
my eyes.” ‘ + The celebrated controversy with Salmasius originated thus: 
Charles II, employed that great scholar to write a ‘‘ Defence 
of Monarchy.” and to vindicate his father’s memory. Sal- 
masius was the greatest scholar of his age. Grotius alone 
could compete with him. Selden speaks of hizn as “ most ad-

wisely in ordering Milton to answer him. How he did so at 
the price of his sight we see above.

On Sion my holy hill. A firm decree 
I will declare; the Lord to me hath said 
Thou art my Son, I have begotten thee 
This day; ask of me, and the grant is made; 
’ As thy possession I on thee bestow 
Th’ Heathen, and as thy conquest to be 
sway’d 
Earth’s utmost bounds: then shalt thou bring 
full low 
With iron sceptre bruised, and them dis- 
perse 
' Like to a potter’s vessel shiver’d so, 460 
And now be wise at length, ye Kings averse, 
‘ Betaught, ye Judges of the earth; with fear 
Jehovah serve, and let your joy converse 
With trembling; kiss the Son lest he appear 
-In anger, and ye perish in the way, 
If once his wrath take fire like fuel sere. 
Happy all those who have in them their stay.

WHEN HE FLED FROM ABSALOM, 
Lorp, how many are my foes! 
How many those 
That in arms against me rise! 461 
Many are they 
That of my life distrustfully thus say 
No help for him in God there lies. 
But thou, Lord, art my shield, my glory, 
Thee through my story 
Th’ exalter of my head I count: 
Aloud I cried 
Unto Jehovah, He full soon replied 
And heard me from His holy mount. 
I lay and slept, I waked again. 463 
For my sustain * 
Was the Lord. Of many millions 
The populous rout 
I fear not, though encamping round about 
They pitch against me their pavilions. 
Rise, Lord, save me, my God, for thou 
Hast smote ere now 
On the cheek-bone all my foes, 
Of men abhorr’d. 
Hast broke the teeth. This held was from 
the Lord; 463 
Thy blessing on thy people flows.

Will hear my voice what time to Him Icry.

Upon your beds, each one, 
And be at peace within.

Of righteousness, and in Jehovah trust.

For them that persecute.) Behold

Trouble he hath conceiv’d of old 
As ina womb, and from that mould ATG.

And fell into the pit he made:

Turns on his head, and bis ill trade,

How long wilt thou declare 
Thy smoking wrath, and angry brow 
Against thy people’s prayer! 
Thou feed’st them with the bread of tears, 
Their bread with tears they eat, 
And mak’st them largely drink the tears 
Wherewith their cheeks are wet. 
A strife thou mak’st us and a prey 485 
To every neighbor foe, 
Among themselves they laugh, they play, 
And flouts at us they throw. 
Return us, and thy grace divine,

A vine from Egypt thou hast brought 
Thy free love made it thine, ‘ 
And drov’st out nations, proud and haut, 486

Thou did’st prepare for it a place, 
And root it deep and fast, 
That it began to grow apace, 
And fill'd the land at last.

With rudest violence?

Up turns it by the roots, 489 - 
‘Wild beasts there browse, and make their food 
Her grapes and tender shoots. 
Return now, God of Hosts, look down 
From Heav’n, thy seat divine, 
Behold us, but without a frown,

Visit this vine, which thy right hand 
Hath set, and planted long, 
And the young branch, that for thyself 
Thou hast made firm and strong. 
But now it is consumed with fire, 490 
And cut with axes down, 
They perish at thy dreadful ire, 
At thy rebuke and frown. 
Upon the man of thy right hand 
Let thy good hand be laid, 
Upon the son of man, whom thou 
Strong for thyself hast made.

I set his shoulder free; 
His hands from pots, and miry soil, 
Deliver’d were by me. 
‘When trouble did thee sore assail, 494 
On me then didst thou call, 
And I to free thee did not fail, 
And led thee out of thrall.

Throughout the land of thy abode

And to their wand’ring mind; 
Their own conceits they follow’d still, 
Their own devices blind. 
O that my people would be wise, 
To serve me all their days, 
And O that Israel would advise 497 
To walk my righteous ways. . 
Then would I soon bring down their foes, 
That now so proudly rise, 
And turn my hand against all those 
That are their enemies. 
Who hate the Lord should then be fain 
To bow to him and bend, 
But they, his people, should remain 
Their time should have no end. 
And he would feed them from the shock 498 
With flour of finest wheat, 
And satisfy them from the rock 
With honey for their meat.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue history of the teaching of manual training is 
one of the most interesting chapters in the evolu- 
tion of the elementary school. Manual work was 
introduced into the curriculum at the beginning 
of the present period of educational unrest; and, 
because it had no fixed traditions to hamper its 
progress, responded most fully to modern educa- 
tional principles. 
When manual training was inaugurated in our 
schools, the public supposed it was to serve a 
practical industrial purpose; but the laity had not 
reckoned with the schoolmaster and school tra- 
dition. The teacher proceeded to make manual 
work a mental discipline rather than a practical 
utility, —a fallacious distinction long held by 
his craft. The new study was made into a set of 
formal exercises, rather than a group of interest- 
ing problems. The chief emphasis was laid on the 
practice of technique. The need of the child to 
express himself in manual activities that fulfill 
his desires was completely subordinated if not 
overlooked. What was worse, — the techniques

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
were studied in isolation, that is, apart from the 
personal or social situations which call for their 
use. 
Thus, in the earliest days of this movement, 
the pupil was taught to make a half-dozen differ- 
ent kinds of saw cuts. The purpose was not to 
construct anything with the pieces thus sawed; 
but merely to get technical efficiency. The exer- 
cises were not graded so as to give the child power 
to build some simple, useful object, in which the 
skills learned might be employed. They were or- 
dered so as to constitute a series of complicated 
technical skills, the uses of which even the 
teacher did not always foresee. The training 
given had little relation to the child’s need to 
understand, solve, and express his own experi- 
ences and needs through the use of the hands. 
Any one who had heard children rendering 
scales and other vocal exercises in the music 
period, or seen children studying diacritics and 
phonetics in the reading class, or watched them 
dissecting sentences into clauses, phrases, and 
parts of speech in language instruction, can 
readily understand what had happened to the 
new study of manual training. It had fallen a 
victim to pedagogical formalism. The subject 
had been wrenched out of all relation to the 
viii
-P-A-G-E-9
  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
child’s imperious constructive instincts; just as 
school music had been divorced from the child’s 
spontaneous desire to sing, and as school reading 
and composition had been isolated from the 
eager wish of the child to acquire new and appeal- 
ing experiences through print and to express them 
by the written word. 
For a time it seemed as though the introduction 
of manual training had contributed nothing to 
the school save an additional expense. It was as 
subservient to traditional pedagogical standards 
as any of the older subjects. But its rescue was 
easier, because its failure was more dramatic. 
Teachers could not fail to observe the instinc- 
tive eagerness with which children always make 
their first entry into the manual training shop; 
no more could they fail to note that inevitable 
flagging of interest which characterized successive 
days of work at the formal exercises of the work- 
bench. Somehow discipline was harder to main- 
tain in the shop than in the other classrooms; yet 
these same children would coéperate in building 
kites and sleds in the back yard at home with an 
absorption so complete that the interference of 
parent or neighbor was seldom needed. Some- 
thing was radically wrong with manual work at 
‘ school. The teacher noted the fact. _

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Then ensued a struggle to keep manual work 
motivated. The children ceased to saw a bit of 
wood at six different angles just to show that they 
could do it. They began to make projects for 
which they had a real use, —a coat-hanger, a 
shelf, a box, a stool, or a table. At first the in- 
structor selected thetask and set the model; later 
each child chose a project for himself and made 
his own drawings. Meanwhile all the technical 
requirements were acquired incidentally, and 
acquired more effectively than before, because 
the relation of skill to ends was now apparent 
to the child himself. Interest in the shop was 
reawakened, and increased efficiency followed. 
Under this reformed regimen it was natural 
that the child should master such facts as he 
needed with unusual readiness. In this respect, 
the manual training period offered a marked 
contrast to other school exercises. In conse- 
quence, the great value of action or expression 
as a mode of educative experience was soon 
established. 
This recognition by the schoolmaster of the 
worth of “learning by doing’’ expressed itself 
in a number of ways. It was easy to see that this 
primitive and therefore natural mode of learning 
would be most valuable with the youngest chil- 
x  
-P-A-G-E-11
EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
dren. Thereupon, manual training was extended ~ 
to the lower grades. The simple projects and 
skills of primitive peoples were utilized in the 
primary classes, — weaving, basketry, knife- 
work, and the like. This new sympathy of the 
elementary school with activity and occupations 
gave it common ground with the kindergarten, 
and additional types of constructive activity 
were borrowed, — building with blocks, paper 
folding and cutting, clay modeling. A differentia- 
tion of sex-needs added sewing and cooking. The 
range of manual work was greatly broadened 
with each of these successive extensions. Indeed, 
the field of manual work was now so much en- 
riched that it became inchoate. The whole move- 
ment needed reinterpretation and reorganiza- 
tion. 
The teacher’s rediscovery of the principle 
of “learning by doing” profoundly influenced 
the whole curriculum. It changed elementary 
science into nature-study, where children 
actively participated in the control of nature 
instead of passively perceiving experiments dem- 
onstrated to them. It made the active social 
relations of children on the playground and in 
school thoroughly respectable resources for moral 
training. Organized play and self-government 
xi
-P-A-G-E-12
  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
became methods of learning through self-expres- 
sion. The principle of self-activity, which had 
been walled up among kindergartners, began to 
be quoted and applied by primary teachers. 
Dramatization and games became more impor- 
tant as modes of instruction in teaching beginners 
to read, and actually appeared within the stern 
precincts of the arithmetic period. Even lan- 
guage teaching relaxed enough to permit chil- 
dren to learn to speak and write through express- 
ing their own thoughts and feelings. Grammar, 
too, came to be mastered through use. And song, 
long silenced by the demand to sing scales, 
emerged in rote singing. Learning through self- 
expression or action, a method first exemplified 
in a large, concrete way by manual training, came 
to be utilized in many school subjects, thus 
greatly reinforcing its worth as a mode of teach- 
ing and learning. 
This projection of manual training into the 
center of educational debate greatly modified 
the point of view and the resources of those 
specially charged with its teaching. They re- 
turned from discussion to teaching with a dispo- 
sition to reorganize their own work. They were 
now keenly alive to the enlarged purposes of 
manual training. They had lost much of the 
xii

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
cultural narrowness which often makes the aca- 
demic mind a matter of reproach. They saw in 
their instruction a large and important oppor- 
tunity for giving the child an understanding 
of the economic organization which rests upon 
industry. Because elementary school children 
are young, they proceeded to develop an appre- 
ciation of industrial workmanship through the 
actual manipulation of materials in simple con- 
structions, leaving information and interpreta- 
tion of the more intellectual sort to be provided 
in a supplementary way as opportunity offers. 
Thus the great need to give all men some com- 
prehension of the industrial processes and eco- 
nomic problems of American life begins to be 
amply met in the elementary school. 
It is interesting to note how old oppositions 
are here reconciled. Active work with representa- 
tive materials, — woods, metals, clays, fabrics, 
and foodstuffs, — supplemented by wider obser- 
vations and readings, is adequate to develop that 
general industrial intelligence which every man 
ought to have. It is also broad enough to provide 
an adequate sampling for the child, destined by 
interest or necessity to make an early choice 
among trade schools and apprenticeships. This 
modern program provides an exceptionally 
xiii

appealing course for all elementary school chil- 
dren regardless of their future schooling or life. 
The importance of the social service it is devised 
to render makes an understanding of its essential 
principles desirable.

  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
I 
THE ANCIENT VIEW OF INDUSTRY AND 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
1. Culture, education, and industry 
Tue term “culture” implies the pursuit of 
objects regarded as good in themselves. The 
study of music is a branch of culture, because 
this study is thought to be an end in itself, not a 
means to something else. The same may be said 
of art and philosophy. Education is a broader 
term which includes ‘every branch of mental 
development, so far as it is subjected to deliber- 
ate guidance. Education includes culture; but 
also includes a utilitarian element. On the sur- 
face, utilitarian education seems the direct oppo- 
site of culture. Such education is sought not for 
its own sake, like culture, but for the sake of 
something else. In the present discussion we are 
not concerned with the whole range of utilitarian 
I  
-P-A-G-E-16
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
education, but with industrial education only. 
To define the latter we must first define industry. 
Industry is the process by which natural products 
are made available for human uses. Industrial 
education, then, is the preparation of the mind 
for appreciating, understanding, and performing 
the transformation of natural objects into forms 
which are, according to human ideas, suitable for 
consumption or use. 
2. Ancient prejudices survive in modern culture 
and education 
The thinkers of the ancient world drew a rigid 
line between cultural and utilitarian education. 
They did not perceive that culture and utility 
might overlap. They could not see that although 
utilitarian education has an aim outside itself, 
it may also be worth while in itself. Their re- 
stricted view still persists both in the United 
States and in Europe, and constitutes more than 
half the prejudice against a recognition of the 
due place of industry in education. The Greck 
philosophers are chiefly responsible for this tra- 
ditional contempt for industry. They convinced 
the Romans, persuaded the schoolmen, and dom- 
inated the Renaissance. Thus, in order that the 
traditional attitude of the schools toward indus- 
2
-P-A-G-E-17
THE ANCIENT VIEW 
trial education may be understood, it is desirable 
that an investigation should be made into the 
various causes which contributed to prejudice 
the Greek mind against industry. 
3. The Greek prejudice against industry 
(a) Aristocratic occupations glorified in culture. 
The principal business of a Greek aristocrat was 
war. We have the evidence of Herodotus that the 
honor of war among the Greeks contributed to 
the dishonor of trade and industry. “I have 
remarked,” he writes, “that the Thracians, the 
Scythians, the Persians, the Lydians, and almost 
all the other barbarians hold the citizens who 
practice trades and their children in less repute 
than the rest, while they esteem as noble those 
who keep aloof from the handicrafts, and espe- 
cially honor such as are given to war. These 
ideas prevail throughout the whole of Greece, 
particularly among the Lacedemonians. Corinth 
is the place where the mechanics are least de- 
spised.”” 
Doubtless Herodotus was right. Amid the ar- 
rogant conditions of militarism the soldier soon 
comes to despise the humbler if more useful pur- 
suits of industry. The artisan who turns to a 
soldier’s life, having once tasted the sweets of 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
idleness, the pleasure of browbeating others, and 
perhaps the profit of the sack of cities, learns to 
look down upon the life of the workshop. As a 
soldier he stands in the relation of employer to 
employee, of patron to client, toward the armorer 
and other artisans; and he scorns to reverse this 
congenial status by resuming his former lowly 
occupation. In the hour of victory he may have 
ransacked richer stores than as an artisan he ever 
contributed tomaintain. From the fears of trades- 
men he may have extorted money or goods be- 
yond what he could have hoped to acquire in the 
course of months of honest toil. Thus the sword 
scorns tools, while tools resent the scorn of the 
sword. 
After war, the chief interests of an Athenian 
gentleman were sport, music, politics, and litera- 
ture, to which was added, after the time of Plato, 
philosophy. None of these subjects was utili- 
tarian. Industry was not among the interests 
of the Greek aristocracy. It is probable that the 
philosophic conception of culture was deeply if 
unconsciously affected by the actual pursuits of 
the upper classes. 
(b) The status of industry as affected by slavery. 
Again, the institution of slavery could not but 
affect the status of industry in the ancient world. 
4
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE ANCIENT VIEW 
Slavery has always made industry of certain 
kinds appear degrading. The ancients, however, 
justified slavery on psychological grounds. Aris- 
totle maintained that some are slaves by nature. 
In taking this view, moreover, he was not enun- 
ciating an independent principle, but a corollary 
of Plato’s division of the appetites from the 
reason. According to Plato, the reason should rule 
over the appetites; but as a matter of fact the 
mental nature of some is dominated by appetite 
or desire, while in others reason rules. Conse- 
quently the latter should organize and direct the 
lives and activities of the former. Those in whom 
the reason predominates should rule. Those who 
are swayed by appetite should be ruled, should 
in fact be slaves. Further, argues Aristotle, since 
in the world of nature as of art the inferior always 
exists for the sake of the superior, the slave exists 
entirely for the sake of his master. Yet, since no 
mind is wholly constituted of desires, Aristotle, 
perhaps, should only have concluded that some 
should be more servile, some more free. He 
scarcely had the right to argue that some are 
entitled to no freedom at all. In fact, however, 
the principle that some men are totally another’s 
was frankly and ferociously adopted in Sparta, 
where the life of the slave was one of indescrib- 
2
-P-A-G-E-20
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
able danger and misery. In the Roman Empire, 
too, slavery became an expansive festering sore 
within the body politic, sapping and destroying 
the estate of both yeoman and laborer, involving 
the land in servile wars and falling into line with 
other forces detrimental to the spirit of individ- 
uality. In Roman law the only legal form pro- 
vided for questioning the slave was by torture. 
Favors might fall to the lot of the slave; rights 
he had none. Under these circumstances it was 
impossible that industrial pursuits, carried on as 
they were chiefly by slaves, should escape the 
servile stigma. Social status always affects work 
as well as worker. The contamination of indus- 
try was sure and unavoidable. 
(c) The thinkers, poets, and historians aristo- 
cratic. Further, industry suffered in the estima- 
tion of the Greeks from the fact that it was not 
extolled like other activities by the poets whose 
works were a household word throughout Hellas. 
Most of the early poets, like Homer, wrote or 
sang for the royal courts; and almost necessarily 
expressed aristocratic sentiments in their songs. 
They had, therefore, no meed of praise for the 
deeds of the common people. Commoners are 
never mentioned by name in Homer. While 
Hesiod stands on a lonely height in sounding the 
6
-P-A-G-E-21
THE ANCIENT VIEW 
praises of the simple life of rural labor, he never 
attempts to dignify the life of the urban artisan. 
Nor were the historians more enlightened in this 
respect. Herodotus, Xenophon, and Thucydides 
were men of high social degree who could not 
entirely escape from the prejudices natural to 
their station. The same may be said of the phi- 
losophers. Drawn from the more leisured class, 
they naturally shared its views of life. The two 
great minds, those of Plato and Aristotle, adopted 
a psychological theory prejudicial to industry, 
the outlines of which have been indicated in the 
section on slavery. In his book on education, 
in the Politics, Aristotle hurries over the more 
utilitarian subjects, reading, arithmetic, drawing, 
and even gymnastics, in order to devote his chief 
attention to music, which alone has no use out- 
side itself. Music was a costly and aristocratic 
study, the principal test of the education of an 
Athenian gentleman. An uneducated person was 
described not as illiterate, but as one who could 
not play the lyre. This meant that education 
and aristocracy coincided. 
What is the main conclusion to be drawn from 
our survey of the ancient view of industry? In 
general, it is that the Greeks, from whom our 
own opinions.are to a considerable extent derived, 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
based their conception of the place of industry 
in life upon a dubious psychological and ethical 
analysis, reinforced by a certain bent of mind 
native and hereditary in them. This would not 
be of great importance were it not that the 
opinions of the Greeks have never been rejected 
by the main current of Western thought. For 
many centuries the Hellenic preference for cul- 
tural rather than industrial effort has been taken 
as final. 
4. The historic descent of Greek prejudice 
(a) Rome. The Romans under the Empire, 
cursed with the institution of slavery, and es- 
sentially aristocratic in their views, fell easy vic- 
tims to the Greek ideas, which entirely separated 
industry from culture. Under the Republic, 
indeed, the Romans had gloried in their hus- 
bandry; but this was before the time of advanced 
education in Rome. The typical attitude of the 
Greco-Roman period is expressed by Cicero, 
who in this treatise on “Duties” distinctly re- 
fuses a place to industry in the vocation of a 
Roman gentleman. The Roman proletariat was 
indifferent; he lived for neither culture nor in- 
dustry, but only for bread and the circus. 
(6) The Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, 
8 
a
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE ANCIENT VIEW 
religion was the chief concern of the intellectual 
life. The Christian religion has so much to say 
for the worker that it might have led to his edu- 
cation as a worker. The fact that it did not was 
due largely to the emphasis placed upon another, 
an eternal, life. The world and all its works were 
regarded as temporary and comparatively unim- 
portant. Even the Benedictine monks, who gen- 
erally gave part of their time to manual work, 
did so mainly as a discipline. They had little or 
no desire to exalt industry. Industrial education 
stood far apart from culture, the one a matter of 
apprenticeship, the other a matter of books. The 
villein’s son who learned to read escaped from 
villeinage into the Church. The industrial life 
knew him no more. 
(c) Scholasticism. Nor was the scholastic sys- 
tem which preceded the Renaissance more favor- 
able to the progress of industrial education. It 
was one thing or the other; one might either be 
a Latinist, logician, and theologian, or a son of 
industry. One could not be both. The former 
was considered a scholar, the latter an ignora- 
mus. 
(d) The Renaissance. During the Renaissance, 
the eyes of scholars were dazzled by the glory of 
the ancient literatures. Humanism, or the study 
9
-P-A-G-E-24
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
of the classics, was the dominant note in educa- 
tion. Even those who rebelled against a system 
of mere imitation of Cicero remained enthralled 
to books. Bookishness is the hereditary foe of the 
industrial life; it removes men’s eyes from the 
world about them and concentrates their atten- 
tion upon the ideas of the past. The educated 
man henceforth was the classicist, who had 
neither time nor inclination for industrial inter- 
ests. 
(e) The Reformation. The Reformation might 
have made a difference in favor of industrial edu- 
cation had not the reformers been obliged to 
educate leaders. Their main need was of clergy 
and scholars to defend their theological positions. 
Consequently, although Luther, Calvin, and 
others were not blind to the needs of the masses, 
they concentrated their efforts upon the second- 
ary or Latin schools. Thus in practice the 
Reformation, except in the field of religious in- 
struction, made little difference to the course 
of studies which had been determined by the 
Renaissance. 
({) England. In England, moreover, as far as 
~ the schools were concerned, the Reformation and 
the Renaissance coalesced. Both movements 
were regulated by Henry VIII and his royal 
10
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE ANCIENT VIEW 
successors. As the classical education provided 
by the Latin schools was necessarily limited to 
the leisured class, or to those who made their way 
by scholarships or otherwise into that class, the 
ancient contempt for industry continued to be 
transmitted from one generation to another. In 
England, until the recognition of higher ele- 
mentary schools by the Board of Education in 
1900, there was practically no attempt to com- 
bine industrial with general education. Up to the 
nineteenth century, in fact, primary education 
was dominated by the idea of charity. The 
pupils were educated to be employees. They 
were expected to continue in their station of life. 
Reading, writing, arithmetic, and the catechism 
formed their course of study. Culture was the 
exclusive possession of the upper classes, and 
had nothing to do with utility. Cultural exclu- 
siveness, indeed, is still a feature of the so-called 
great public schools. It was from England chiefly 
that the United States inherited its prejudice 
against industrial education in the schools. 
(g) The United States. Part of the inheritance 
of the United States from the Old World was the 
sharp distinction between culture and industry. 
Culture, the result of a liberal education, was the 
mark of a gentleman. What had a gentleman to 
Ir
-P-A-G-E-26
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
do with industrial efficiency? It is true that from 
the first the conception of culture was modified by 
the fact that a gentleman had estates from which 
he profited. The work of conducting an estate, 
however, has always been regarded as compatible 
with aristocratic tastes. Aristocracy is at all 
times closely associated with the ownership of 
land. Besides, a landed proprietor did not actu- 
ally engage in manual operations. The colonial 
grammar schools, in which gentlemen were 
taught, therefore confined themselves to cultural 
studies, and chiefly to the classics. A broader 
view characterized the academies of the eight- 
eenth century, but they had nothing to do with 
industry. The universities long resisted the intro- 
duction of industrial departments. Many of the 
universities, indeed, still give ground very slowly 
before the advance of industry. With some ex- 
ceptions, old and endowed institutions adhere 
as long as possible, rightly or wrongly, to the 
traditions of the past. Industrial pursuits were 
poorly represented in the universities until after 
the Morrill Act of 1862, by which the States 
received generous grants of land for the sup- 
port of agricultural and mechanical instruction. 
Manual work did not come into its own in the 
public high schools until about 1880, and then 
12
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE ANCIENT VIEW 
only under the guise of a general or liberal disci- 
pline. Its connection with industry was deliber- 
ately minimized. Trade schools, dating from 
1881, involved no sacrifice of aristocratic preju- 
dices, as they stood entirely apart from general 
instruction. Preparatory schools, and especially 
part-time and codperative schools, have done a 
little, by bringing some elements of general in- 
struction within the scope of industrial educa- 
tion, toward the establishment of the claims of 
industry to a place in a liberal education. Tech- 
nical schools have little bearing on this problem, 
The public primary schools now give indirect 
attention to industry. They have not yet 
advanced to the point of giving the subject its 
own column in the program of studies. Except in 
a few centers, manual training is only inciden- 
tally industrial. In general, the situation in the 
United States is that the aristocratic prejudice is 
still in the field, although gradually yielding to 
the assault of democratic principles. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
       II 
THE MODERN VIEW 
1. Falsity of the traditional theory under modern 
conditions 
(a) As undemocratic. From a modern stand- 
point, the traditional theory of industry fails in 
two respects, (1) as undemocratic, (2) as inade- 
quate. According to the view which found its 
first philosophic expression in Greece, the busi- 
ness of the best minds is the pursuit of virtue, 
which was regarded as identical with culture. 
Only the leisured could devote themselves exclu- 
sively to this end. The masses were to support 
the classes in their cultural existence. Modern 
democracy rebels against this hypothesis. The 
democratic tradition has already won for the 
laborer a voice, sometimes even a controlling 
voice, in political government. It is making work 
of some kind obligatory upon almost every mem- 
ber of the community. It is living down the 
ancient contempt for the laborer, and investing 
work with a new respectability and dignity. Its 
14
-P-A-G-E-29
THE MODERN VIEW 
underlying principle, the worth of man as man, 
is incompatible with a theory which excludes the 
majority of mankind from participation in the 
real ends of life. It insists that the things of real 
value in life shall be shared among all. Culture 
must be made universal. 
(b) As inadequate. The traditional view of in- 
dustry fails not only as undemocratic, but also 
as inadequate to the facts of modern life. In 
three respects the industrial conditions of to-day 
differ radically from those of earlier times: (1) 
industry is more ambitious than formerly; (2) it 
is more successful; (3) it is more scientific. So 
broad is the scale, so certain the results, and 
so ingenious the processes of modern industrial 
enterprise that it is now worthy of study for its 
own sake. Once industry was too simple to be 
worthy of intellectual steel. Now its manage- 
ment involves extreme mental development. 
The ablest intellects are no longer engaged in 
philosophy or art, but in industry. 
2. The new importance of industry in life, 
culture, and ideals 
(a) A stimulus to culture. The cultured man 
owes a debt to industry. Industrial efficiency is 
‘the condition of his culture. Progress in indus-

trial operations liberates an ever-increasing pro- 
portion of the population from the work of. 
primary production. But for industrial progress, 
so many men could not have been spared from 
tilling the ground to become teachers, writers, 
and clerks. Modern industry pays their salaries 
and provides them with leisure and books. Insti- 
tutions as well as persons are indebted to indus- 
try. Schools and universities are endowed from 
its proceeds. This alone is a reason for the study 
of industry within their walls. In ordinary grati- 
tude they should attempt to repay the debt by 
devoting a tithe of their attention to industrial 
concerns. , 
(b) A condition of higher standards of living. 
As a result of modern progress in industry, not 
only non-industrial workers, but even those who 
remain in the ranks of industry are furnished 
with rarer luxuries than were formerly accessible 
even to the few. The laborer has his piano, the 
servant her silk dress. The worker lives in a more 
comfortable if less pretentious dwelling than that 
of a nobleman in the Middle Ages. It is true that 
most of the Greek, Roman, and early Christian 
thinkers deprecated high standards of comfort. 
Plato pictured a simple city as the ideal, in which 
people would be satisfied with rude huts, beds of 
16
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE MODERN VIEW 
myrtle boughs, simple country fare, and plates of 
fig leaves. Juvenal satirized the pleasures of the 
Roman table; Tertullian inveighed against love 
of dress in women. The chief merit of industrial 
progress, indeed, is not that it raises the standard 
of material living, but that it provides new oppor- 
tunities for the spiritual life. Hours of work are 
shortened to the advantage of both body and 
mind. The only hope of further advance in this 
direction is in future industrial development. 
(c) A source of ideals. Modern industry is not 
only a stimulus to culture and a condition of 
higher standards of living, but also a source of 
ideals. Moral standards are developed in connec- 
tion with industrial operations. Out of his indus- 
trial experience the worker has evolved the ideal 
of a unity of labor. The invention of automobiles 
suggests an ideal of duty to pedestrians. The 
construction of the Panama Canal brings into 
focus the ideal of healthy conditions of work. In 
such ways as these the moral life has been made 
richer and fuller by industry. Esthetic ideals, 
too, are developed by the invention of new pro- 
cesses in pottery, dyeing, and other industries. 
Even the intellectual ideal, truth for truth’s sake, 
is strengthened by conscientious and accurate 
workmanship. In industry a man learns to be 
17
-P-A-G-E-32
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
true to himself. His work may deceive others, 
himself it cannot deceive. 
3. The status of industry as changed by historical 
factors 
(a) The rise of a new psychology. An epoch in 
the theory of industry is marked by the psychol- 
ogy of David Hume. According to Hume, reason 
is and must be the slave of the passions. This 
dictum reversed the doctrine of Plato and Aris- 
totle, that reason should rule over the appetites. 
The Greek philosophers had held that the life 
of reason is the only life good in itself, and that 
its expressions are art, music, and philosophy. 
These accordingly constitute culture. Culture is 
rationality. Industry merely provides material 
goods for the satisfaction of the appetites. It is 
an irrational, uncultural pursuit. If Hume be 
right, however, the shoe is on the other foot. 
Appetite, and industry as the satisfaction of 
appetite, becomes the central element of human 
life. From this point of view reason is the serv- 
ant, not the master. It is unnecessary to adopt 
this position. Kant showed how to overcome it. 
Rightly or wrongly, however, Hume’s empiricism 
favored the growing dignity of industry, and 
called attention to the fact that the psychological 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE MODERN VIEW 
argument of the Greek masters is not unanswer- 
able. Reason and appetite are not so different as 
was formerly supposed. They are interdepend- 
ent. There is no longer a psychological ground 
for the exclusion of industry from the scope of 
culture. 
(b) Modern religious interpretation. The early 
Christian Church expected little but harm to 
come of luxury or riches. The good of the body 
seemed on the whole antithetical to the good of 
the soul. Bodily satisfactions were regarded as 
- matters of indifference or as evils. This theory 
tended to diminish industrial achievement, and 
to exclude economic considerations from educa- 
tion. The modern tendency, however, is to dwell 
upon those elements in the primitive Church 
which reacted in favor of the development of 
material civilization. It is pointed out that the 
Apostles followed industrial callings, that the 
laborer is described as worthy of his hire, and that 
artisans are the equals of kings from the point of 
view of eternity. It is further argued that indus- 
try is not void of spiritual meaning, and that its 
development may be carried on in a religious 
spirit. 
(c) The growth of science. Science seeks a theo- 
retical mastery over nature; industry is content 
19
-P-A-G-E-34
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
with practical victories. The growth of science, 
however, means the development of industry. 
The scientific attitude is experimental and in- 
quisitive, and was formerly discouraged by the 
Church. Roger Bacon was only the most bril- 
liant of a long line of investigators who suffered 
the ecclesiastical censure. The legendary sin of 
Faust consisted in his desire to know the unknow- 
able, and to command the infinite. The modern 
tendency, however, is to develop an alliance 
between science and religion which cannot fail 
to benefit industry. The character of Sir Isaac 
Newton, at once scientific and pious, illustrates 
the possibilities of such an alliance. Science, by 
showing the operation of eternal laws within the 
universe, stimulates religious thought. By reveal- 
ing the divine nature as essentially creative, it 
paves the way for the recognition of industry as 
sacred. From this point of view industry may 
be defined as the attempt of man to imitate the 
creative acts of the eternal mind. 
(d) The new humanism. Another force which 
has tended to improve the status of industry is the 
movement known as “humanism.” The essen- 
tial feature of the movement is an emphasis upon 
human needs and interests. Humanism insists 
that the most direct and immediate concern of 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE MODERN VIEW 
man is his present life. Upon the acts of the 
present life all future life is based. Man’s work 
is not specious and temporary, but real and per- 
manent. Men are not puppets, but in a literal 
sense masters of creation. The mastery of man 
over nature is real though incomplete. This point 
of view gives industry a new dignity. It is a seri- 
ous attempt to better the conditions of human 
life. It is the tool with which man clears the road 
to his ideals. It is his effort to codperate with 
divine purposes. 
4. Consequences of an obsolete conception of 
industry 
(a) The antagonism of classes. With all these 
forces ranged on her side, industry has not yet 
overcome the opposition of traditional prejudice. 
Obsolete conceptions of industry still abound; 
and one result is a world-wide strife of classes. 
The aristocratic and industrial classes still mis- 
understand one another. Those who, by birth, 
wealth, or talent, take their place in the upper 
strata of society tend to regard culture as their 
own monopoly. It is for them to pursue things 
worth while in themselves. The masses exist to 
support but not to share their culture. The pro- 
vision of educational advantages for all has not 
21
-P-A-G-E-36
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
radically changed the aristocratic attitude. There 
is still a great gulf between cultured and uncul- 
tured. The worker cannot find time to continue 
his education along so-called cultural lines. The 
gulf can be bridged in one way only, that is by 
making industry itself an integral part of the 
material of culture. When this is effected, the 
worker can obtain his culture in and through his 
work. The study of his own industry will make 
him a cultured man. 
(6) The ignorance of industrial operations. 
Another result of the traditional prejudice against 
industry is that the so-called cultured classes 
know little or nothing about it. It would not be 
surprising to find a professor in arts who cannot 
tell what jute or terra-cotta is. It would be sur- 
prising to find one who knows how soap is made. 
Yet apart from tradition, the study of soap- 
making is as cultural as the study of grammar. 
When science fought its battle for admission into 
the curricula of the schools and universities, it 
had to be pointed out that a Greek particle has 
no cultural superiority over a chemical atom. 
The prevalent ignorance of industry among the 
educated is a serious matter. It deflects able 
minds from productive occupations. It alienates 
the sympathies of one class from another. It 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
    THE MODERN VIEW 
diminishes social efficiency. It must be combated 
by universal instruction in the fundamental in- 
dustrial processes. 
(c) Separation of industrial from general educa- 
tion. The traditional prejudice against industry 
is still strong enough to exclude the subject from 
a definite place in the school curriculum. The 
subjects of language, mathematics, geography, 
history, etc., are there, but not the subject of 
industry. Industry is treated in special depart- 
ments of special institutions. Its broad outlines 
are not taught at all. 
(d) The need of industrial education in the 
elementary school. (The purpose of the elementary 
school is to give such knowledge, feeling, and 
power as all citizens should possess.) As far as 
it neglects industry, the school falls short of its 
purpose. Industry is among the departments of 
civilization about which everybody should know 
something. Further, social sympathy should be 
cultivated in all citizens, and social sympathy 
cannot be developed until all the world knows 
what most of the people do. Social efficiency, 
too, depends upon knowledge, for without some 
acquaintance with industrial affairs even those 
who are engaged in other pursuits are handi- 
capped. They cannot intelligently codperate 
23  
-P-A-G-E-38
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
with work which they know nothing about. The 
modern view of industry, as a stimulus to culture, 
a condition of higher standards of living, and 
a source of ideals, implies that it should be no 
longer neglected even in part by the elementary 
school.
-P-A-G-E-39
  Il 
THE PRESENT PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL 
EDUCATION 
1. The distinction between industrial and 
vocational education 
InpusTRIAL education is not the same thing 
as education for industrial productivity. The 
former is parallel to mathematical, geographical, 
or linguistic education. It is general, not tech- 
nical. It includes those ideas, feelings, and voli- 
tions which all citizens ought to have concerning 
industrial operations and industrial life. It is as 
necessary for those who follow other occupations 
as for those engaged in industry. Consequently 
it falls within the scope of the elementary school. 
Vocational education, on the other hand, sug- 
gests preparation for specific callings. This is not 
the business of the elementary school, but of 
trade schools and other technical institutions. 
Elementary education should not become voca- 
tional, except in the broadest sense. In this sense 
all education is vocational, since all education 
tends to increase efficiency in all callings. 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
    INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
“2. What the elementary school should do— 
What the elementary school owes to industry 
is the study of man as a worker. This study is 
general, not technical. The subject is too broad 
for technical treatment. It is comparable to the 
study of language, history, or art. As the ele- 
mentary school already focuses the attention of 
children upon man as a reader, writer, artist, 
traveler, mathematician, fighter, and ruler, so 
should it study him as a worker. Industry is the 
only great department of civilization, with the 
exception of religion, which is not studied as such 
in the elementary school. What, then, should be 
done? This: an investigation should be made 
of fundamental understandings, values, and 
skills as seen in industrial work, industrial life, 
and industrial institutions. This general state- 
ment may assist the teacher in selecting his 
material. The principle is constant, while the 
details vary. The exact field of investigation in 
any school will depend upon the nature of indus- 
trial operations in the neighborhood. Suppose 
that iron works, being near, are visited and 
studied. Children will notice the ores, machinery, 
molds, and processes used, the character of the out- 
put, the division of work, the skill of the workers, 
26
-P-A-G-E-41
  
THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
their relation to foreman, manager, and employer, 
the institutions connected with the works, and 
the conditions of labor. Children should be edu- 
cated to take an intelligent interest in factories as 
well as in art galleries, museums, and libraries. 
3. The existing resources 
Industry has some allies on the program of the 
elementary school. As a subject of study, it has 
many points of contact with domestic art and 
science, manual work, commercial geography, 
and industrial history. Industry might be taught 
adequately under these heads. But it is not. A 
subject without a name may be well taught in 
the schools, but such a result is not to be ex- 
pected. History might be taught as a part of 
civics, art, and literature, without being set 
down as history at all; but nobody is willing to 
take the chance. The same should be true of 
industry. Give industry its own place and name, 
and it will receive more attention than as an 
aspect of other subjects. It will still preserve an 
alliance with domestic art and science, manual 
work, history, and geography. It will not dis- 
place these subjects, although it may involve 
their reconstruction. It will have escaped from 
their leading-strings. 
27
-P-A-G-E-42
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
(a) Domestic art and science. These subjects 
have a true relation to industry in two respects: 
(1) they are themselves industrial, since they 
involve the transformation of materials into 
forms adapted for human use; (2) they introduce 
students to a wide range of economic processes. 
The tendency is to emphasize the former rather 
than the latter relation. Food is prepared, but 
the catering industry is not studied. Attention is 
concentrated too much on individual items. The 
study of actual industries is neglected. The mak- 
ing of a handkerchief in class differs essentially 
from the industrial production of the handker- 
chief. The industry taught is and claims to be 
merely domestic. It is not the industry of prac- 
tical life. 
(b) Manual work. This subject also is indus- 
trial. Timber, metal, raffia, or other material is 
changed into serviceable form. Sometimes the 
aim is not use but discipline. In this case the 
industrial element disappears. Making a picture 
frame is industry; making a mortise and tenon 
joint is discipline. Manual work came late into 
the schools, but its evolution, accelerated by 
critical suggestions, has been remarkable. Dur- 
ing the last twenty years it has passed through 
five stages, and the time is ripe for a sixth. It 
( 28 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
    THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
would not be just to say that each stage has been 
abandoned in turn for the next. Rather each 
stage has been absorbed into the next. The first 
stage was disciplinary, the object being the 
training of hand and eye. The second was utili- 
tarian. Useful articles were made, the criterion 
being the interest of the pupil. The third was 
to a certain extent industrial. Objects were made 
to illustrate typical processes. For example, 
raffia-weaving was expected to typify the tex- 
tile industries. The fourth stage was esthetic. 
Manual work was treated as a phase of art, a 
form of self-expression. The aim was to cultivate 
the natural desire to express one’s ideas in beau- 
tiful forms. The fifth stage was social. Manual 
occupations, such as sewing, weaving, or the 
construction of wooden models, were used as a 
center for instruction in other subjects. It is time 
that manual training entered upon a sixth stage, 
which may be called the “real-industrial,” as 
opposed to the third, or “typical-industrial.” It 
should be used to illustrate actual industries. 
The typical-industrial stage was marked by the 
construction of primitive or simplified forms 
of industrial apparatus. Such forms bear little 
resemblance to those in actual use. If the pupil 
is to understand industry practically and not 
29  
-P-A-G-E-44
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
academically, his manual work should differ in 
no essential particular from industrial produc- 
tion, except that the work should be conducted 
upon a more conscious and critical level. 
(c) Geography and history. Commercial geo- 
graphy and industrial history have a precarious 
footing in the elementary school. Sometimes 
they are taught incidentally; sometimes not at 
all. History still concerns itself chiefly with poli- 
tics and war. Even in geography, the commer- 
cial and especially the industrial references are 
generally subordinated to the physical aspect 
and location of countries and towns. Yet the 
converse scheme is feasible. This is how a sixth- 
grade teacher taught the subject: The geography 
came in only as it bore on the industrial side; that 
is, the climate, soil, rivers, etc., would only be 
incidentally touched on in connection with the 
growing of wheat, the raising of silkworms, or 
something else of an agricultural or industrial 
nature. The occupations in the immediate 
vicinity were most strongly emphasized. Among 
these was paper-making; and an excursion was 
made to a mill in order that the class might 
observe the whole process from the log to the 
paper. In this particular city there are many 
box factories, and another excursion was made 
30
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
to one of these. The growth of cities and its 
causes were given particular attention. In most 
cases the principal factor was found to be com- 
mercial or industrial. For example, Albany, 
New York, grew to be a fairly large city because 
of its situation on the Hudson, and was later 
augmented through the influence of the construc- 
tion of the Erie Canal, which made it a go- 
between for the Great Lakes and the Atlantic 
Ocean. The forests of the State were compared 
with forests previously studied, and an examina- 
tion was made of the different uses the trees were 
put to, and the objects into which the various 
woods were fashioned, such as flag-poles, piano- 
cases, other articles of furniture, or small boats. 
The superiority of one kind of wood to another 
for a particular purpose was investigated, while 
the habit of making reference to the places 
where each variety of timber is found provided 
the necessary geographical unity. Should not 
this kind of teaching be extended with the aim 
of opening the minds of the young to the great 
possibilities of industrial activity, instead of cen- 
tering them, as we do now, on unproductive 
occupations? 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
4. Experiments in industrial education 
(a) In the kindergarten. A number of teachers, 
taking advantage of the existing resources in the 
school curriculum, have experimented with in- 
dustrial education. A beginning has been made 
in the kindergarten. Formal occupations like 
paper-folding begin to give place to industrial 
activities like basket-making. The conservative 
school, emphasizing play and imagination, looks 
askance at the industrial standard. The child in 
the kindergarten, it asserts, lives in the make- 
believe stage. His business is with symbols, not 
realities. The objection may be valid where the 
industrial work is unimaginative or inartistic, 
but not otherwise. There seems to be no reason 
why imaginative associations should not cluster 
as thickly about the making of a basket as about 
the laying of sticks in symbolic forms. If this be 
so, the rehabilitation of industry will affect the 
kindergarten. 
(b) In elementary manual work. A number of 
attempts have been made to bring manual train- 
ing into line with the real work of the nation. 
For example, one school in the South insists upon 
sewing from the girls, while the boys are allowed 
to choose between woodwork and printing. In 
32
-P-A-G-E-47
THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
this school there is also a brickyard; and the 
pupils make bricks and erect additional buildings 
for school purposes, often working throughout the 
summer vacation. A pupil-teacher planned the 
library building and superintended its erection 
by student labor only. It is remarked that in 
this school all the pupils are happy and the 
need of disciplinary measures never seems to 
arise. Other valuable experiments of the kind 
have been conducted at various centers. In one 
large city, manual training is now conducted 
on a most practical basis. Instead of accuracy 
and skill being made the object of the lesson, 
some practical article, from among several sug- 
gested by the instructor, is selected by the 
student and through his interest in the finished 
product the necessary discipline is acquired. The 
articles chosen may be things of use to the vari- 
ous members of the family or to the teacher, such 
as window-boxes, paper-weights, plant-stands, or 
book-shelves. Many of these objects are corre- 
lated with other studies. Above all, they are the 
result of a genuine industrial process. 
In one school in which the formal elements of 
manual training are to some extent subordinated 
to the significance of the industrial product, the 
pupils of the elementary and secondary grades 
33: 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
are required to spend at least one hour a day at 
shopwork under a competent instructor. The 
workshop is open every afternoon until six 
o’clock for those who may desire to spend addi- 
tional time upon the piece of work they have in 
hand. Many of the pupils take advantage of this 
permission to pursue their industrial activities 
after school hours. A turbine water-wheel was 
made by the boys of the seventh grade after 
several days had been spent in the mathematical 
class in estimating the horse-power. Two boys, 
in their work after school hours, constructed a 
working locomotive, others a model of an auto- 
mobile, others a steamboat. In the construction 
of these articles the character of the material and 
other considerations which affect the practical 
art of engine- and ship-building were taken into 
account. On one occasion the festival of Hia- 
watha was to be made the subject of a school 
celebration. The boys made the clubs and snow- 
shoes, while the girls designed, carried out, and 
decorated the costumes. In all these cases the 
shopwork was removed from the level of mere 
hand and eye training to the more advantageous 
ground of preparation for industrial activities 
and appreciation of the industrial life. 
(c) In instruction. Experiments have not been 
34
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
confined to manual training. Some teachers have 
attempted to give direct instruction in industry. 
Excursions have been made to factories in order 
that industrial processes may be studied in their 
own home. In this connection the evidence of a 
practical teacher may be quoted with advantage: 
“T am sure that there is nothing that will meet 
with quicker response from the children them- 
selves. Nothing interests them more than the 
commonplace, everyday things about them. To 
me as a child, the manufacture of pins and 
needles, glass and bricks was a most fascinating 
subject for study. And later, I found that all 
youngsters had the same interest in penpoints 
and pencils, chalk and bullets. A few copies of 
Industries that I placed in our class library at 
school were soon in great demand. I am certain 
that there is not a child who will not sit up and 
listen entranced to the tale of the making of 
granddaddy’s meerschaum or to the story of the 
construction of his mother’s dishmop. Truly for 
them, there is nothing old under the sun.” 
5. The need to expand our appreciations 
Industrial education is not a luxury, not a 
means of self-indulgence, still less a mode of per- 
verting the natural emotions of the heart. On 
35
-P-A-G-E-50
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
the contrary, it is a national necessity. Indus- 
trial operations suffer from nothing so much as 
the lack of intelligent men to carry them on. One 
hears that Germans, profiting by their eight 
years of industrial education, are taking the 
best positions in the commercial and industrial 
spheres, not only at home but abroad. Formerly 
the ablest minds were engaged in philosophy, lit- 
erature, or some branch of activity regarded as 
cultural in itself; at present the ablest minds are 
engaged in industry. It is even regarded as 
desirable for the common good that a greater 
number of minds should turn from professional 
to industrial occupations. Who disapproves of 
the following changes of vocation? A young 
woman who was a mediocre teacher, having some 
ability in cooking, increased her knowledge and 
interest in the art by a course at a cooking school, 
and is now a popular caterer at society functions. 
Another young woman, who might have become 
aclerk or a typist, preferred to increase her knowl- 
edge of flowers by a course in horticulture, and 
is now the proprietor of a flourishing violet farm. 
A certain young man, instead of becoming an 
indifferent lawyer, interested himself in the sub- 
ject of animal husbandry, studied it at college, 
and is at present a competent judge of live stock. 
36
-P-A-G-E-51
    THE PRESENT PROBLEM 
Is it not probable that the community has bene- 
fited more from the efficient caterer, flower- 
grower, and stock expert than it would have done 
from the mediocre teacher, clerk, or lawyer? We 
need to expand our appreciations by making the 
study of industry universal. 
The general problem may be illustrated by 
particular reference to the conditions which sur- 
round a certain public school in Brooklyn. In 
this school formal manual training and shopwork 
are prescribed for all boys after the third year, 
and cooking and sewing for all girls of similar 
grade. As might be expected, however, the man- 
ual and domestic training by no means serve to 
attract children to an industrial life, or even to 
prepare them for it. The boys become clerks or 
office-boys; the girls become unskilled hands in 
factories or serve behind the counters of depart- 
ment stores. These avenues of employment are 
consequently choked with applicants. It would 
certainly be desirable that the children should be 
given such ideas of skilled trades and more com- 
plicated industrial processes as might attract the 
energies of a number of them into more ambi- 
tious occupations. Very near the school the 
trades of carpenter, blacksmith, wheelwright, 
etc., are in operation, while neighboring factories 
37
-P-A-G-E-52
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
carry on the making of clocks, tablets, maltine, 
shoes, and shirt-waists almost within sound of 
the school classrooms. Within walking distance 
the children may find shipping, railroad trans- 
portation, wood-yards, paints, electric power- 
houses, construction in concrete, and the varied 
activities of the building trade. The neglect of 
these opportunities for a practical yet highly 
intellectual education is either the result of a 
narrow educational outlook, or of a false view 
of the place and value of industry in human expe- 
rience. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  IV 
THE NECESSARY RECONSTRUCTION OF THE 
SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
1. Review of the present place of industry in the 
curriculum 
(a) The lack of industrial purpose. Speaking 
exactly, one is compelled to admit that industry 
—jin fact, the whole economic life — is seldom 
directly represented in an elementary school at 
all. The alliance of art, manual work, and other 
subjects with industry is potential rather than 
active. There are several radical defects in the 
scheme of art and manual work which remove 
these subjects from the category of genuine indus- 
trial education. In the first place, they are not 
real but theoretical occupations. In some cases 
they are taught merely for discipline. They 
neither create things that society really wants, 
nor use the methods of contemporary industry. 
Knowing the unreality of the work upon which 
he is engaged, the pupil drops it on leaving school 
never to touch it again. In the second place, the 
39
-P-A-G-E-54
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
range of art and manual work in the schools is 
too narrow. Where work is done in wood, it is 
generally limited to certain lines of elementary 
cabinet-making. There is no reference to the 
other great wood industries. If there is work in 
clay, it is limited to modeling. One hears nothing 
of the great compressing industries, no word of 
brick or terra-cotta. Art-work in the schools 
seldom makes any pretense of industrial purpose. 
Pure art seems to be its aim, not artistic work. It 
seeks technical perfection rather than economic 
service. In short, neither manual work nor art 
develops industrial interests. 
(b) The disciplinary aim. Even with the limi- 
tations described above, however, it cannot be 
denied that the manual activities of the schools 
have a natural relation to industry. Work in 
wood, for example, fulfills the definition of indus- 
try, since it transforms natural objects into ideal 
forms. The trouble is that the industrial elements 
in the school curriculum are so specialized that 
they do not represent industry at large. They 
are whittled down to a negligible quantity by the 
theory that regards education as little more than 
a process of discipline. By way of illustration, 
let us consider the content of a first year’s course 
in woodwork. During the year, the pupil may 
40
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
learn to use certain tools, to plane a piece of wood 
truly, to square it on four sides, to construct a 
joint, and to make a picture frame embodying 
that joint. From a disciplinary point of view, 
this is enough work for one year. Technical per- 
fection is exacted, good habits are formed, a 
social atmosphere is enjoyed, hand and eye are 
coérdinated, and benefit is derived from the mus- 
cular exercise. These advantages may well be 
sufficient to justify the place of manual work in 
the schools. Our point is, they all belong to the 
field of general training and discipline. They do 
not include an insight into the nation’s work. 
Industrial knowledge is unrepresented. 
2. The need of a subject called “Industry” 
Only one solution of the problem promises to 
be satisfactory. The curriculum of the elemen- 
tary school must undergo a reconstruction. 
Industry must appear as a subject upon the pro- 
gram of studies. It must be given a local habita- 
tion and a name. This conclusion is logical, since 
the curriculum is supposed to represent all the 
fundamental branches of civilization. It is right, 
since industry has proved worthy of study. It is 
necessary, since only in this way can one be cer- 
tain that industry is studied by all. It is a duty, 
41 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
since the very possibility of general education 
depends upon the industrial efficiency of the 
people. Let no one say that the curriculum is 
overcrowded. Industry can be taught with little 
or no addition to the burden. The end can be 
attained by a process of reorganization. Manual 
work may be included wholly or in part under 
industry. Woodwork for boys, sewing and cook- 
ing for girls, will be treated in connection with 
the study of timber, textile and food industries. 
In this way manual work will be transformed, but 
not necessarily increased. The industrial section 
of geography and history can also become part 
of the new subject. A slight curtailment of other 
subjects may become necessary in order to pro- 
vide time for instruction about industries and 
for excursions to local factories. Time-tables 
differ so much that this problem must be left to 
the practical teacher or superintendent. 
3. The significance of the new subject 
The new subject will involve a change of con- 
tent. Disciplinary occupations will be mini- 
mized. The pupil will engage in modeling indus- 
trial implements and making industrial products. 
The necessary discipline will be obtained by the 
way. A class of pupils may codperate in con- 
42
-P-A-G-E-57
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
structing a model of a mill, each pupil making a 
part. Pupils will learn about the great national 
industries with which their work is connected. 
They will visit local works. Far from being a 
change in name alone, the introduction of the 
subject of industry into the elementary school 
curriculum may be expected to modify the entire 
character of instruction throughout the institu- 
tion. The proposed reform will make school work 
more practical, more independent of books, more 
interesting to the pupils, and more indispensable 
in the eyes of the community. 
4. Conduct of the subject 
The field of the teaching of industry in the 
elementary school may be divided into three 
parts, (x) instruction, (2) observation, and 
(3) manual action. Instruction will begin with 
the history and description of industries con- 
ducted near the school, and will extend to all the 
great national industries. It will thus include 
historical and geographical references. The 
maps of the district, of the State, and of the 
United States will be freely used in the study 
of this portion of the subject. Observation will 
involve excursions to farms, factories, or govern- 
ment works in the neighborhood. Manual work 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
     
   INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION ' 
will be necessary in order to prepare for instruc- 
tion and to fix its results, and will also serve to 
illustrate objects and implements that have been 
observed. 
5. Relation to manual action 
Believers in manual work may be inclined to 
resent the incorporation of that subject in an- 
other. Manual work has justified its place in the 
curriculum. It has exercised the bodies, trained 
the muscles, promoted the artistic taste, devel- 
oped the originality, and attracted the interest of 
school pupils. True, and there must be no retro- 
grade step. All these advantages will remain. 
Manual action to illustrate industrial processes 
will conserve them all, and add others. There is 
no going back. Not an hour need be taken from 
the time allotted to manual action. The pupil 
will not be less interested, but more, in modeling 
actual products and illustrating actual processes 
than he is in the more formal procedure of ordi- 
nary manual training. The subject of industry 
may even become the special property of the 
manual training teacher. In most schools, how- 
ever, the class teacher will do the work. It will be 
stimulating, because teacher and pupil are genu- 
ine co-workers. It will be informative, for few 
44 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
teachers know much about industrial enterprise. 
It will be attractive, because human nature is 
fascinated by action. The demand on the manual 
workshop to illustrate industrial operations will 
probably come from the children themselves. 
6. Relation to other subjects 
In the elementary school, domestic art and 
science are usually represented by cooking and 
sewing. These and similar occupations are parts 
of manual work, and will be embodied in the new 
subject of industry. For girls, industrial instruc- 
tion will center to a large extent about the foods 
and textiles, although there is nothing inappro- 
priate in a study of the metals, clays, and woods. 
What is usually neglected in domestic art and 
science is the connection of the processes per- 
formed by pupils with actual industrial condi- 
tions. The very name of the new subject will 
tend to remedy this defect. Girls will not only 
learn to make cakes and pocket handkerchiefs; 
they will also learn to understand the industries 
of baking, catering, and clothing. Geography 
and history will either surrender their industrial 
aspects to the new subject, or else supplement 
it by a definite treatment of those aspects. 
Again, if design is not already included in draw- 
45 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
ing, it ought to be embodied in the subject of 
industry. 
7. Relation to the theory of culture 
How does the teaching of industry accord with 
the standard of culture? According to the tradi- 
tional opinion, a study that is useful cannot also 
be cultural. Culture consists of philosophy, lit- 
erature, and the fine arts. We have traced this 
view to its origin in aristocratic prejudice and an 
obsolete psychological analysis. We need a new 
theory of culture. The old definition may be 
retained, — culture is the study of things worth 
while in themselves. It is the content, not the 
form, of the definition that must be changed. 
Things worth while in themselves include all 
great matters, whether useful for external ends 
or not. The industrial life is a great matter. It 
lies at the root of all civilization. It calls for the 
highest mental powers. It enriches the moral life 
with opportunities for the exercise of the eco- 
nomic virtues. If culture is the study of great 
things, it can no longer exclude industry. 
There are those who would define culture 
differently. Culture has nothing to do with con- 
tent, they say, but is simply an attitude. If so, 
it consists in the habit of viewing things in a 
46
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
large-minded way. This is precisely the attitude 
necessary for the study of modern industry. 
Pettiness has no place; the larger issues must be 
faced, and the whole of human nature is involved. 
Thus, however defined, culture includes the study 
of industry. 
8. Relation to primitive industry 
How far the primitive development of industry 
may be expected to furnish a clue to the educa- 
tion of children is an open question. Granted, 
primitive man lives like a child in the moment; 
like a child he cares only for the present, having 
no thought for the future; like a child he is 
self-centered; and above all, like a child he has 
comparatively little control over the natural phe- 
nomena about him. It is not necessary to sup- 
pose that the stages of industry through which 
the race may have passed are normally recapitu- 
lated in an identical serial order in the life of each 
individual. Even if it be true that every civilized 
people has passed through the economic stages 
of hunting, fishing, pasturage, and agriculture, — 
no very reliable generalization, —it is idle to 
imagine that the interests of a boy are definitely 
connected by nature in turn with hunting, fish- 
ing, herding, and tilling the ground. This form 
47
-P-A-G-E-62
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
of the theory of recapitulation is not to be 
taken seriously. Further, any form of the theory 
is open to the objection that nothing could be 
more different from the rigid customs of primi- 
tivism than the flexible manifestations of child 
nature. Children, however, are radically at one 
with primitive man in their lack of introspec- 
tive and critical power, and in the absence of 
an adequate control over their environment, 
whether in the direction of stores, tools, methods, 
or elimination of waste. 
In two respects the environments of the child 
and the savage are alike — they stimulate little 
thought and exact little foresight or control. Both 
the child and the savage as a rule live with little 
care, little foresight, and little industry. The 
environment of each is simple. Probably such 
similarities are sufficient to account for the large 
field over which the natural interests of children 
and those of primitive people appear to be iden- 
tical. There is no need to exaggerate the influ- 
ence of heredity, or to suppose, with the follow- 
ers of the culture epoch theory, that the pursuits 
of the race have not only been proportionately 
registered in the instincts of human beings, but 
even reappear as instincts in their original order. 
It is enough that two simple environments may 
48
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
be expected to be more alike than two complex, 
or one complex and one simple; and merely for 
this reason a certain resemblance between the 
interests of children and those of primitive man 
appears to be fundamentally involved. 
Because the respective environments are sim- 
ilar, then, the interests and occupations of prim- 
itive man furnish a clue to the interests and 
activities appropriate to the education of chil- 
dren. The curriculum itself, being dictated by 
the needs, the inheritance, and the interests of 
the present rather than by those of the past, 
need not be affected by primitive industrial con- 
ditions. In domestic art, children will not make 
primitive forms of headgear, but hats of the latest 
fashion; and if they should go to the length of 
constructing Indian baskets, it is chiefly because 
the baskets are as useful and beautiful when 
measured by modern standards as in their 
original social setting. It is not the course of 
study but the method of the elementary school 
that is likely to be advantaged by a knowledge of 
the conditions of primitive industry. No matter 
what primitive man did or needed to do in the 
distant past, the materials of a school curriculum 
cannot be rearranged in the light of his past 
activities. On the other hand, there is no corre- 
49
-P-A-G-E-64
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
sponding objection to the modification of method, 
while it is not difficult to show that there is 
greater logical necessity for such a modification. 
Society cares little in what manner the child is to 
be put in possession of his inheritance as long as 
the end is reached. Moreover, the fact that a 
child lives in some respects like primitive man 
has little to do with the materials, but much 
with the processes, of his intelligence and inter- 
ests. It follows that while there may be little 
gain in teaching children the things that primi- 
tive man has done, there may be much advan- 
tage in training them in the identical processes 
and methods by which humanity has been shaped 
and guided to its present condition.
-P-A-G-E-65

THE NECESSARY RECONSTRUCTION OF 
SCHOOL METHOD 
1. Instruction 
Let us now consider how to teach the subject 
of industry. The typical methods will be instruc- 
tion, observation, and action. At present teach- 
ers of manual work rely chiefly upon action. 
Observation of industries is seldom attempted; 
and instruction in the broad facts of industry 
is conspicuously absent. Too often the teacher 
fails to instruct where instruction is most appro- 
priate; that is, in connection with action. Con- 
sequently the first method to be insisted upon in 
the subject of industry, which is to include part 
or the whole of manual training, is instruction. 
Pupils must be taught the meaning of industry, 
the scope and importance of industrial enterprise, 
the value of labor not only in terms of coin, but 
in terms of feeling. They must become so 
familiar with industrial arts, that their minds, 
not being strange to such subjects, will not recoil 
5§t 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
from the thought of economic employment. 
Manual action alone cannot bring this about; 
and even the observation of industries, unsup- 
ported by instruction, falls short of the mark. 
We must instruct; but this does not mean that 
the teacher is to din his words into the ‘pupil’s 
ears and imagine that every word goes home. 
We must instruct scientifically. 
There is little need to describe an instruction 
lesson to teachers. We are all familiar with sev- 
eral forms of procedure. Let us suppose, however, 
that the month’s work is to be upon the paper 
industry. A period from 10.30 to 11 A.M. on 
Mondays, together with a period from 2 to 4 P.M. 
on Tuesdays, may have been set apart for the 
subject. In general, the former period will be 
given to intellectual, the latter to manual work. 
The distinction is relative, not absolute, but for 
purposes of analysis it may serve. On the first 
Monday the teacher gives an introductory lesson. 
He instructs the pupils about paper-making, and 
perhaps even the distribution and use of the 
product. He begins by finding out what the 
pupils already know about the subject. Should 
he discover in his class the child of a worker in 
the trade, he will make use of the opportunity to 
augment his own knowledge and that of the class. 
52
-P-A-G-E-67
    SCHOOL METHOD 
The next step may be to show photographs of the 
works to be visited, or other illustrative material. 
The next will probably be a description of the 
industry by the teacher, with the aid of map, 
diagram, or other illustration. The next may be 
drill, concluding with note-taking. 
2. Excursions 
The afternoon of the following day is devoted 
to a visit to the paper mill. The whole process is 
observed; and the children, having learned what 
to look for, may be expected to see more than 
would be apparent to the casual visitor. The 
objection is raised that the factories may close 
their doors to the children. In a few cases this 
will be so; but there are many hospitable facto- 
ries, and many manufacturers who realize that 
their works will benefit by the development of 
industrial interests and industrial knowledge. 
At least, let the difficulty arise before much is 
made of it. There are farms, bridges, and build- 
ings as well as factories to be visited; state, 
national, and municipal works as well as private 
enterprises to be observed. Even when a pro- 
gram has to be provided for several classes, it is 
not easy to believe in the impossibility of arrang- 
ing six or eight industrial excursions for each 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
class during the year. The excursion is the key to 
the method of the subject. Its value has been 
tested, and it is not impracticable. 
So central is the excursion in the scheme of 
industrial education that a practical illustration 
of its use may be helpful. A class of children, of 
the average age of only seven years, was taken to 
visit a great wool store. The children had talked 
about sheep, discussed pictures of them, sung 
songs about them, played games representing 
them, handled their wool, and had even drawn, 
modeled, and built such objects as sheep, sheds, 
shears, bales, and wagons. They had brought to 
school their own picture cards and scraps of 
colored wool; and had unraveled woolen gar- 
ments to show the weaving. Their parents read- 
ily consented to the excursion and provided the 
necessary fares. The cliildren walked in fours, 
the outside boy of each four being responsible for 
keeping his particular group up with the class. 
At crossings, the leaders waited for a signal from 
the teacher before advancing. Drivers of ve- 
hicles showed the children every consideration. 
Conductors and the public vied in assisting them 
to board and alight from cars. Arrived at their 
destination, the children gazed at great wagons 
laden with fleeces, bale after bale of which was 
54
-P-A-G-E-69
  SCHOOL METHOD 
being hoisted to the upper stories of the building. 
Having finished their task, the workmen entered 
into conversation with the children, whose hearts 
were completely won by the gift of fragments of 
wool. The building was entered, and the young 
visitors were shown by an assistant through the 
various rooms containing wool. Exclamations of 
surprise and pleasure broke from the children as 
they approached each article in the show room. 
Here were stuffed sheep with long, clean, well- 
combed wool. In the showcase was wool in all 
its stages, raw and dirty, washed and scoured, 
combed and wound in skeins. An animated dis- 
cussion, to which the bystanders lent their ears 
with amusement and interest, took place as to 
the relative merits of the prize sheep shown in 
pictures on the wall. Mounting a steep flight of 
stairs, the children came upon bales of wool, not 
wired like the skins, but surrounded by canvas 
bagging, and hoisted by means of an open ele- 
vator. In the far corner were open bales; and 
many were the estimates of the number of sheep 
required to furnish the wool of one bale. On leav- 
ing, each received a piece of clean wool. Having 
thanked their entertainers, they wound up with 
cheers and returned to school. 
55
-P-A-G-E-70
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
3. Manual action 
After the excursion, the three remaining after- 
noons allotted to industry during the month are 
devoted to the construction of models or such 
objects as lend themselves to concrete represen- 
tation. Thus three afternoons in the month are 
given to manual work. The models will be se- 
lected in accordance with what has been learned 
and seen. In general, different members of the 
class may be permitted to construct different 
objects. In some cases the codperative plan, by 
which each child makes a part of a large model, is 
best. The parts are put together, and the model 
becomes the property of the school, to be used in 
future lessons, or to be preserved in the school 
museum. In other cases it will be possible for 
each child to make a useful article which he may. 
keep; but the direct object of manual work will 
not be utility in this sense, but the illustration of 
genuine industrial operations. 
One danger should be guarded against. Unless 
the teacher maintains high standards of exe- 
cution, the disciplinary advantages of manual 
training may be unduly sacrificed. Manual work 
must continue to produce good habits. Care, 
accuracy, and neatness must still be cultivated. 
56 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  ‘SCHOOL METHOD 
The work must be as carefully planned and as 
conscientiously executed as when discipline was 
regarded as the sole end of manual action. Mis- 
takes must be corrected and the correct form 
practiced. The habit of skillful work is as pos- 
sible of achievement under the new system as 
under the old. 
4. Oral expression 
The first morning period of the series has been 
allotted to preparatory instruction. The second, 
since it follows the excursion, may be given up to 
a discussion of what has been seen and learned. 
The views of the children are expressed, and a 
comparison is drawn between what they had ex- 
pected and what they had actually found. The 
teacher’s part is chiefly to regulate the expression 
of opinions, and to write upon the blackboard 
the contributions that are worthy of such notice. 
The period may close by note-taking, based upon 
what has been set on the board. 
5. Study 
In the third week, the morning period may be 
given up to a study of the larger aspects of indus- 
try. In the case cited, the children will study 
books or articles bearing upon the paper indus- 
oF
-P-A-G-E-72
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
try. They may be encouraged to bring such 
materials to school. Perhaps a textbook may be 
employed; perhaps a copy of a magazine may be 
purchased and used. The subject of industry is 
too vital to remain long without its textbook; 
indeed, there are books in existence that would 
be found of great service. 
6. Written expression 
The final morning period of the series will 
probably be given to written composition on the 
subject of the excursion or on the industry in 
general. The pupil has something to say, and 
the process of committing his ideas to paper is 
one of the best means of securing their perma- 
nence. It is unnecessary to discuss the methods 
appropriate to the teaching of written expression. 
The method of conducting the subject of in- 
dustry for one month may be summarized as 
follows: —

  SCHOOL METHOD 
The above scheme is suggestive only. The pur- 
pose of this book is not to dictate the details, but 
to expound the principles of elementary indus- 
trial education. 
7. Suggestions from primitive industry 
We have observed that society cares more for 
the course to be studied than for the methods 
to be used in the schools. Accordingly, while the 
curriculum must be measured by present stand- 
ards, method may be influenced by other con- 
siderations. In the sphere of method, the teacher 
is warranted in accepting suggestions based on 
the correspondence between the interests of 
children and those of primitive mankind. In 
these pages, the term “primitive” is applied to 
tribal conditions in which civilization is reduced 
to its simplest elements. Primitive man lives in 
and for the moment. He is improvident, and 
is guided by instinct rather than reason. He is 
conservative in his customs. He prefers the 
decoration of his person and weapons to other 
forms of work. He is industrious only to acquire 
food. He thinks only under the pressure of novel 
circumstances; and, as a consequence, has little 
control over his surroundings. In most or all of 
these features there is a parallel to child life. As 
59
-P-A-G-E-74
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
one would deal with primitive mankind, so, to 
the extent of the parallel, does one deal with chil- 
dren. The child, like the savage, prefers immedi- 
ate to distant aims. When Governor Grey wished 
to get work done by Australian natives, he paid 
them sixpence in the middle of the day, and 
a shilling at the end. How like the method of 
encouraging children! For them, the teaching of 
industry should be related to current needs and 
interests. It is useless to tell a class that the day 
will come when they will appreciate it. Children 
seldom look forward so far. The teacher will 
illustrate his instruction by objects and proc- 
esses which interest the children now. In fact 
the production of things which the child himself 
possesses, or desires to possess, is the ideal start- 
ing-point for the study of national industry. 
From this beginning, the field of vision may be 
expanded until a liberal knowledge has been 
gained of the whole industrial arena. 
8. The new features in school method 
It will be seen that the new methods demanded 
by the subject of industry are two: (1) the excur- 
sion to industrial centers, and (2) the free use of 
instruction in connection with manual activity. 
These methods, of course, are only relatively 
60
-P-A-G-E-75
  SCHOOL METHOD 
new; but they are not generally adopted in the 
elementary school. Usually the excursion is con- 
fined to the field of nature-study, and instruction 
in connection with manual work is confined to 
the task in hand. The result of the new methods 
should be a new familiarity with industrial arts 
and a new interest in industrial processes and 
products. The excursion will make school work 
more real and up-to-date. Instruction will widen 
its scope. The former method will develop in- 
terest, the latter knowledge; and the two will 
interact in such a way as to remove traditional 
ignorance, banish traditional prejudices, and re- 
form traditional standards of culture.

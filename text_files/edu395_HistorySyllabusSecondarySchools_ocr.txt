  PREFACE 
Tuts syllabus is the work of a committee appointed by 
the New England History Teachers’ Association “to prepare 
+ +. areport on practical methods of teaching history, with 
such topical outlines, references, and bibliographies as shall 
help teachers to put into operation such suggestions for 
reform in history teaching as may be applicable to the con- 
ditions in the secondary schools.” After the outlines had 
been tested by several teachers with their classes, the report 
of the committee was presented to the Association in April, 
1go1. The general and special introductions with ample 
illustrations of the outlines were then printed and sent to 
all members as a preliminary report. After this had been 
tried in the schools and discussed by the Association at its 
meeting in October, 1901, the report was approved and 
ordered published. 
The original committee which prepared the preliminary 
report was composed of six members: Herbert D. Foster, of 
Dartmouth College, Chairman, Bernadotte Perrin of Yale 
University, Elizabeth K. Kendall of Wellesley College, Ed- 
win A. Start, then of Tufts College, Ernest F. Henderson, 
Walter H. Cushing, then teacher of history in the Medford 
High School and now Principal of the South Framingham 
High School. As the work advanced, it was found desirable, 
owing to the absence in Europe or the imperative engage- 
ments of several members, to enlist the codperation of four 
others: Charles H. Haskins of Harvard University, Sidney 
B. Fay of Dartmouth College, Everett Kimball of Smith

College, and Edith M. Walker of the Somerville Latin 
School. 
As the outlines progressed, they were tested in the class 
room by the three members of the committee engaged in 
teaching history in high schools and by a large number of 
other secondary teachers; they were also subjected to the 
criticism of professors, of history in eight colleges. To more 
than a score of such teachers and professors who have by 
their helpful suggestions aided in making this syllabus more 
teachable and adequate, we make grateful acknowledgments. 
The syllabus covers the four years’ course in history for 
schools recommended by the Committee of Seven of the 
American Historical Association, and attempts to take the 
next step by showing how the general recommendations 
of that committee may be carried out in the daily work of 
preparation and recitation. Three of the members of that 
committee have directly codperated with us. Professor Hart 
has given encouragement and counsel from the start; Pro- 
fessor Salmon has shared in the discussions of the com- 
mittee and prepared the appendix on special collections for 
historical study in American libraries (v. p. 361); Professor 
Haskins has served as a member of our committee through 
the later stages of its work. 
We have endeavored to express the consensus of opinion 
of specialists and of practical teachers in secondary schools ; 
to furnish the schools with a basis for preparation for college ; 
and give to such colleges as desire it, a basis for entrance 
requirements. But, above all, by means of the time saved 
and the clearness of view to be gained through the employ- 
ment of a printed outline in the hands of teacher and pupil, 
we have sought to make sane methods and the use of ade- 
quate material practicable in the ordinary high school.

  HISTORY SYLLABUS FOR 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
  GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
I. SPIRIT AND PURPOSE OF THE SYLLABUS 
AcTIvE thought and experimentation with material 
and methods during several years in the field of history 
teaching have opened a maze of possibilities which need 
to be formulated and organized in order that the best 
results of the experience of many teachers may be 
made tangible and brought into general use in second- 
ary schools. This volume, with separate pamphlets 
for pupils, issued under the auspices of an association 
of history teachers, is intended to meet this need. It is 
not offered as a final word, but must be subject to 
revision from time to time as new stages of the inevitable 
progress in history teaching are attained. Its merit is 
not in its originality, but in the fact that it gives a 
definite application of the work of previous committees 
of this and other associations, and in particular of the 
recommendations of the New England Associations 
of Colleges and Preparatory Schools (1895), of the 
7.  
-P-A-G-E-8
    
8 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
Columbia Conference of 1896, and of the Committee of. 
Seven of the American Historical Association. It has 
been prepared with the codperation of many teachers. 
A large amount of valuable work has been done by 
history teachers in the study of actual conditions and 
the putting forth of tentative theories and suggestions, 
and many practical results have been attained. If, 
then, we organize these results in a working plan, shall 
we not be so much nearer the attainment of the benefi- 
cent purpose contemplated when the new entrance re- 
quirements were first proposed, and so much nearer a 
sympathetic organization of the study of history in our 
schools, not according to a rigid system, but in harmony 
with a comprehensible idea, —namely, the development 
of the historic understanding in the young people who 
attend those schools? 
The working material of this guide is embodied in a 
syllabus for each of the four courses recommended by 
the Committee of Seven; this syllabus being accom- 
panied by some additional topics for individual and 
more detailed work by the pupil, and by carefully 
selected references to elementary, fuller, and source 
materials. This syllabus is intended to be used as an 
outline guide by both teacher and pupil, and as a 
guide in the preparation of examination papers by 
the colleges. It is hoped that the colleges will con- 
sent to include in their questions each year a cer- 
tain number of the various topics in the syllabus, 
thus securing for the schools some of the advantage 
accompanying work with a practical incentive. In 
the introduction, and occasionally in the outlines, are
-P-A-G-E-9
  
General Introduction 9 
practical suggestions, the intent of which has been to put 
in the hands of each teacher the tested results of the 
best experience of many, and make specific applications 
at definite points of the recommendations of the Com- 
mittee of Seven and others. On the other hand, it is 
not intended to prescribe any uniform system or to 
trespass in any way upon the prerogatives of the indi- 
vidual teacher. We do not want uniformity of teach- 
ing, but we do need uniformity of courses and a 
common policy in accord with the best methods of 
our day. 
The object to be kept constantly in mind is the indi- 
cation of a practical course that will meet the new col- 
lege entrance requirements; the development at the 
same time of courses that may be pursued with equal 
profit by the student who is not to have the advantage 
of a college course; and finally, the definite formulation 
on a working basis of the fair demands of the teachers 
of history for the recognition of the subject in the 
schools. 
Colleges which may so desire will be enabled to refer 
teachers and candidates to the syllabus for a fuller 
statement of their entrance requirements or for specific 
illustrations of desired methods and materials. They 
may also find it convenient and helpful to both college 
and school to base at least a part of the entrance exami- 
nation paper on the sections, topics, sub-topics, map 
work, etc., of the various outlines. The schools will 
find it helpful, in addition to the ordinary use of the out- 
line in any course, to make especial use of it either in 
reviewing for college entrance examinations, or in test-
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
ing the fitness of candidates preparing under the certifi- 
cate system. The syllabus is definitely planned to meet 
also the needs of pupils not preparing for college. It 
will also show the reasonableness of demands for ade- 
quate equipment and time. 
Il. THE PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
COMMITTEE OF SEVEN 
Because of the weight attaching to the opinions of 
the authors of the report of the Committee of Seven 
of the American Historical Association, and the long 
and careful study given by them to the question of 
history in secondary schools, the present volume is 
in a sense an illustration, elucidation, and practical 
application of that invaluable report. The principal 
recommendations which are accepted and followed in 
this syllabus are briefly summarized below. 
History should be a continuous study over a period 
of four years, and, except in rare cases, should be given 
at least three periods a week. ‘The acceptance of a 
two-hour course in history for entrance to college” is 
not approved. For the four-year course the following 
periods in the order here given are recommended : — 
(1) Ancient History, with special reference to Greek 
and Roman history, but including a short survey of the 
more ancient nations and closing about 800 A.D. 
(2) Medizval and Modern European History, from 
the close of the first period to the present time. 
(3) English History. 
(4) American History and Civil Government.

General Introduction Il 
If only three years can be given to historical work, 
an omission of one of the fields is better than a conden- 
sation of the whole. If, however, it is necessary to 
combine two years’ work into one, the committee advises 
either (1) combine English and American, or (2) teach 
| English History so as to include the more important 
| features of medizval and modern European history. 
The committee cannot, however, strongly recommend 
| courses covering the whole field in less than four years. 
| With reference to methods of instruction, the Com. 
mittee of Seven offers the following general sugges- 
tions : — 
(1) The teacher in most cases should use a text-book, 
as the topical method alone will, in a majority of cases, 
result in the pupils having unconnected information. 
(2) Material outside the text-book should be used in 
all branches and in all years of historical study. 
(3) Something in the way of written work should be 
done in every year, but teachers should take care not 
to make the work too difficult in the earlier years. 
(4) Written recitations are helpful, and often stimu- 
late a pupil who is slow in the oral part of the work. 
(5) Note-books should be kept containing analyses 
of the text-book, notes from talks in class and from 
private reading, and analyses of topics continuing 
through a considerable portion of the field. 
(6) Geography and History should be closely con- 
nected throughout the course. 
Sources should serve as an adjunct to a good text- 
book, to be used as part of the collateral reading and as 
a basis for written work; but the so-called “source   
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
method” of teaching is not approved. In selecting 
sources to vitalize the subject, they should, in the first 
place, be of unquestioned authenticity ; secondly, should 
be, not so much documents, as the more interesting 
material for pupils of this age, such as letters, diaries, 
travels, etc.; third, should have a literary value. 
For admission to college it is recommended that one 
unit of history be required in every case; and that two, 
three, or four units be accepted wherever the plan ot 
optional admission subjects will permit. By “unit” 
is meant either one year of history five times a week, 
or two years of history three times a week. As tests 
of the candidate’s power, it is suggested that there be 
questions requiring the grouping of facts in a different 
form from that in the text-book, and questions involving 
some power of discrimination. Comments on brief, 
carefully chosen selections from simple sources and 
modern works, and discussion of more extended pas- 
sages, are also recommended as tests of the development 
of the pupil’s historical sense. Finally, the candidate’s 
written test may be supplemented by the submission of 
work done in school and properly vouched for, and by 
a brief oral conference with an examiner. 
Ill. PURPOSE, METHOD, AND USE OF THE SYLLABUS 
The syllabus does not replace the text-book, but 
presupposes its use. It does not attempt, therefore, to 
cover all the facts in any course in history, but to (1) 
point out what subjects are worthy of especial study, 
(2) indicate in what connection these may be taken up, 
/
-P-A-G-E-13
  
General Introduction 13 
and (3) give a few carefully selected specific topics and 
references for additional reading, map and written work, 
which will supplement the text-book, train pupils in 
gathering and presenting material, and make some 
vital contribution to the daily recitation. 
To accomplish this, the syllabus for each course 
contains a general survey of the field, or table of 
contents, which divides the field into chronological 
periods and logically related sections, giving within brief 
space a clear suggestion to both teacher and pupil of 
what is to be studied and permanently retained, and a 
basis for the pupil’s review of the whole subject and 
for school and college entrance examination questions. 
The detailed syllabus follows this general survey. An 
explanation of its structure is given at the end of this 
introduction. The references are usually specific for 
each section and sometimes for each topic, and when 
feasible are classified as brief, longer, and sources. They 
are few, and selected with diligent care because of their 
real contribution to the interest and apprehension of 
the subject. A sufficient variety of references is given 
to meet the needs of the smaller as well as the larger 
library. The number of references to be used will be 
at the discretion of the teacher, and will vary with time, 
number of pupils, and extent of library. It is not in- 
tended, however, that every reference should be read 
in any one year. It is always desirable to recognize 
the preferences and methods of various teachers, and 
of pupils with varying tastes and needs. There will 
also be found topics for map work and charts for 
pupils; and subjects for special maps or charts, either
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
on blackboard, or outline maps large enough to be seen 
by all pupils, thus making ocular contribution to the 
work of the class room (e.g. Seceding States, 1861. 
Colonial Possessions of Philip II, 1580). 
For the recitations devoted to one of the sections, the 
topics will serve (1) as points upon which the pupil will 
endeavor to get information; (2) in the class room to 
keep the pupil’s mind active rather than passive, as he 
tries to gain additional information from others’ recita- 
tions and from reports on additional reading; (3) for 
the pupil’s preparation of daily review; and (4) as a 
basis for the teacher’s rapid fire of questions on daily 
review. These topics will further serve as material for 
general review by the pupil, for questions by the 
teacher at the end of the course, and for examination 
in school and college. 
Iv. HOW TO USE THE SYLLABUS WITH A 
TEXT-BOOK 
General Explanation. — The syllabus throughout pre- 
supposes the use of an accurate, modern text-book. 
The topics are selected because of their significance, 
the stimulating material available, their adaptability for 
getting pupils to reading, thinking, and writing, “and 
in general for the exercise of judgment as well as of 
memory,” and in some cases, particularly in European 
history, as giving an analysis of the subject. In Ameri- 
can history, such a topic as “ The Naming of America” 
is well treated in both Channing’s “ Students’ History ” 
and McLaughlin’s “ History of the American Nation.”
-P-A-G-E-15
  
General Introduction 15 
Voyages of the Northmen and early geographical ideas 
are adequately treated in Channing, pp. 22-28; and the 
European conditions at end of fifteenth century are dis- 
cussed suggestively in McLaughlin, pp. 6-10. But the 
latter topic is not treated at all in Channing, while 
McLaughlin gives no account of the “Land and its 
Resources.” This illustrates the necessity of supple- 
menting even such excellent text-books, on certain 
topics, and the needlessness of attempting to insist 
in these outlines on what is adequately treated in good 
text-books. 
The Daily Work. — For a given recitation, the teacher 
assigns so much of the outline as he may judge wise, 
following, if he chooses, the assignment of time sug- 
gested in the General Survey. For this portion of the 
subject he assigns to all pupils pertinent parts of the 
text-book, and to certain pupils some of the special 
topics and references in this syllabus for additional 
reading and report to the class. Some topics are 
marked as for all the class (eg. some map work 
and topics on civil government), and should be so 
assigned. Some other topics teachers may prefer to 
assign to all, or to several, pupils for general discussion, 
rather than for special report by individual pupils. In 
such matters of detail, the syllabus undertakes to make 
no prescription. The aim has been to present an out- 
line of the material to be handled, in such form that 
teachers may adapt the management of it to the meth- 
ods most congenial to them. 
The recitation may follow the order suggested in 
this syllabus, or that in the text-book, in either case
-P-A-G-E-16
    16 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
including in their logical place the especially assigned 
topics. 
1. If the syllabus is followed, the pupils have before 
their eyes a brief outline of the subject. Teachers who 
prefer a fuller analysis, explaining the syllabus, may 
put one on the board in some such form as may 
commend itself to them for graphic clearness (in some 
cases the syllabus gives a partial analysis): — 
2. If the text-book or other order is followed, it will 
be helpful to have some clear plan before the eyes of 
the pupils, so that they may see the logical relations of 
matters under discussion. Such outline should include, 
not only text-book work, but the special topics. 
Whatever the method used, the essential objects must 
always be that pupils keep their bearings, that they 
see what connection any discussion or report on a topic 
has with the main current of events as studied in the 
text-book, and that they get some definite and perma- 
nent result from each topic discussed. This should be 
tested on review. A good way to insure more satisfac- 
tory treatment of a topic is to assign it to several, and 
then select the best for presentation. It is not neces- 
sary that topics should always be written or formally 
presented by a pupil. If presented, some “brief” or 
set of headings for his topics should be prepared by the 
pupil, and, if feasible, looked over by the teacher before 
report is presented to class. 
Where the number of pupils is large, different refer- 
ences may be assigned to different pupils, and the strik- 
ing points or the differences referred to in each brought 
out very briefly by questions without a complete report
-P-A-G-E-17
  
General Introduction 17 
from each one. It is not intended that all the references 
should be taken. Sometimes teachers should assign, 
sometimes allow pupils to select, the reference. En- 
courage the pupil, if time allows, to compare and select 
as the course proceeds and he gains experience and 
judgment. It is believed that a school with a hundred 
recitations for advance can do something with all or 
nearly all the topics. Schools with less time must omit 
what seem less vital. Schools with two hundred recita- 
tions will find ample material for spending time profit- 
ably in the additional references and additional topics. 
The syllabus is planned to meet the situation in schools 
with varying amounts of time by thus providing an 
average amount which the hurried teacher can lessen, 
but with additional subject matter for the better schools. 
V. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
In General. — The suggestions embodied in this sec- 
tion are drawn for the most part from practical experi- 
ence, but it is impossible to prescribe any hard and fast 
rules for different teachers. When teachers can find or 
invent better methods, they should certainly do so; the 
mere fact that the teacher’s mind is busied with such 
problems will augur well for the success of the course. 
On one thing the committee does wish to lay stress; 
namely, on the fact that history, because of the broad 
field that it covers, is the most difficult of all subjects to 
teach, and that there is the greatest need of special 
training for the purpose. Not only should the teacher 
be well equipped in the beginning, but he should make 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
up his mind each year to do at least as much reading as 
he requires of his classes. He will soon discover that 
this is not drudgery, but the keenest sort of intellectual 
enjoyment; he will be on the lookout for new and inter- 
esting literature, and his own progress will be as much a 
matter of satisfaction to him as that of his pupils. His 
remarks to the class will grow freer and more indepen- 
dent every year, and he will finally gain that sense of 
proportion and perspective, that historical judgment, 
without which no one can be called a really good 
instructor. 
It is not expected or desired that all the devices here 
enumerated should be applied in each of the four years 
of the school course in history. Methods that can be 
pursued with advantage in the case of American History, 
and with boys and girls seventeen years of age, need not 
necessarily be applied to boys and girls of thirteen who 
are studying Ancient History. 
Practical Aims and Objects of Instruction. — These dif- 
fer according to the branch of history to be taught and 
Ancient the age of the scholar. They are more fully 
History. set forth in the special introductions to the 
outlines for the several fields. Ancient History, taught 
to boys and girls from twelve to fourteen years of age, 
should have for a main object to familiarize them with 
the persons and events they are to meet in their reading 
of the Greek and Roman authors. They should be 
taught to understand the mythology, the religion, and 
the manners and customs of the people, rather than 
learn the names of consuls, the details of conflicts, or 
the minutize of administration. The subject should not
-P-A-G-E-19
General Introduction 19 
be spoiled for them by too much insistence on method 
or on time-saving devices. Their study should be en- 
livened by photographs of architectural and sculptural 
remains and by visits to museums. Poems may be read 
or memorized. : 
As for Medizeval and Modern History, to be disposed 
of in three hours a week for forty weeks, inclusive of 
written exercises, reviews, and examinations, aygieval 
what can you hope to achieve? Manifestly ad Modern 
very little in the way of actual definite knowl- “"””: 
edge. Take the stirring period of European history 
from 1805 to 1807; if the boy reads all that there is 
about it in one of the recent and good text-books he will 
learn (we quote literally): “Ulm and Austerlitz forced 
Austria to retire. Prussia tried to take her place, but 
lost the battle of Jena and could not save Berlin. Then 
came the turn of Russia, which finally consented to the 
peace of Tilsit.” 
The fault lies not so much with the text-book as with 
the fact that you simply cannot, under the necessary 
limitations of a text-book, give any image or picture at 
all of so large a period of history. Where so much 
material has to be covered in so short a time, it would 
not be wise to spend too much time on map and chart 
work, on elaborate analyses or on written essays. It is 
indeed appalling to think of having to cover so much 
ground in, say, one hundred and twenty lessons, and 
the teacher must boldly face the problem of what he 
hopes to accomplish in that time. To know something 
of its relations to the history of antiquity and to that of 
to-day, in their larger aspects, is the object to be sought.  
-P-A-G-E-20

When we come to the third course, English History, 
considerably more can be expected of a boy. He is fol- 
English lowing one distinct national development, with 
History. —_ plenty of literature at his disposal and with a 
certain familiarity that every one acquires with the main 
personages and events. Here the teaching should be 
more consecutive, the pupil should learn more about the 
origin of institutions, social conditions, the diplomatic 
steps that led to wars and treaties, and, in general, 
about the causes of events. Fuller use may now be 
made of analyses, special reports, charts, tables, etc. 
A boy who has enjoyed these three years of careful 
historical training is in a position to make a thorough 
American ‘Study of the history of his own country —a 
History. _ study advanced and intelligent enough to be of 
great service to him, even though he never enter the 
doors of a college. He will have learned the in- 
terest of many topics that would otherwise be dull 
and meaningless; he will appreciate the seriousness of 
wars and revolutions, and will have followed the course 
of striking financial experiments. He will know that 
Frederick the Great came through the Seven Years’ 
War without incurring any national debt and without 
raising the taxes of his country; he will know that 
France within a period of nine years issued forty-five 
billion francs of bad paper money, and will follow with 
the more interest any legislation at home on the subject. 
And, best of all, he will have a better appreciation as to 
how his own country stands comparison with other 
countries, and whether this or that crisis has formerly 
had its counterpart. He will have learned to think and 
®,
-P-A-G-E-21

judge soberly and historically, and always with a firm 
basis of fact and a faithful array of evidence; what 
more can we hope for from school instruction in his- 
tory? 
How to occupy the Time in Class.— The old conven- 
tional “hearing” from the text-book must cease; the 
pupil’s mind should not be haunted by the dread that he 
has forgotten some isolated fact which may, after all, be 
of very little importance. A favorite method for the 
adequately trained teacher is to occupy a portion of 
each prescribed hour in furnishing new facts, new ideas, 
or new impressions. This may be done by the teacher 
delivering a short lecture or connecting narrative, which 
the pupil is to take down in his note-book, and for which 
he will be as strictly called to account as for the material 
in the text. This method is to be particularly recom- 
mended in the case of Course II (Mediaeval and Modern 
History), where the space of time intervening between 
two important events can thus be bridged over. The 
narrative should be clear, explicit, and interesting. 
This is a method universally in vogue in all grades of 
German schools, and it has the merit of establishing a 
confidential relationship between the teacher and the 
pupil. As the recommendation may seem somewhat 
startling to many teachers, it is worth while to dwell on 
what Miss Lucy Salmon, in her admirable paper in the 
Annual Report of the American Historical Association 
(1898, p. 519), says about its actual operation in Ger- 
many. ‘This method,” she says, “is in essence the same 
throughout the course; . . . in the second part” (she 
refers to those grades where the pupil is from eleven to
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
fifteen years of age) “it is pure narration. ... During 
the first of the hour the class is questioned on what has 
been narrated during the previous lesson; then comes 
the narration of fresh material. . . . The theory is that 
the boy learns best from the living voice, that thus his 
interest is aroused and maintained, and that history in 
this way becomes to him a living, life-giving presence.” 
It is scarcely necessary to hint to the teacher that 
these narratives or lectures should be enlivened as much 
as possible by throwing in little interesting details that 
may not be important in themselves, but that are apt to 
remain fast in the memory ; that, for instance, the dying 
William Pitt, when he heard the news of Austerlitz, 
pointed to a map of Europe, and said, “ Roll it up, it 
will not be needed these ten years”; that Napoleon’s 
coach, when captured at Waterloo, was found stuffed 
with diamonds which were thrown around among the 
soldiers; that the polite Charles II said to those sur- 
rounding his deathbed, “Pardon me, gentlemen, for 
being such an unconscionable time in dying”; that 
Martin Luther, when he came out from the celebrated 
hearing at the Diet of Worms, threw his arms above 
his head, with shouts of “I’ve got through, I’ve got 
through!” - 
As a further means of holding the interest of the 
class, it is well to show them facsimiles of handwriting, 
of seals, of medals, and of. coins, as well as portraits of 
distinguished persons; not nearly enough educational 
use is made of the material to be found in illustrated 
books in every large library. Portraits serve admirably 
to fix the different personalities in the mind. A useful
-P-A-G-E-23
  General Introduction 23 
occasional variation from the short narration or lecture 
is to read aloud, preferably from some original source, 
and to intersperse questions regarding matters that the 
pupil may be supposed to know. For this purpose let- 
ters and extracts from diaries and autobiographies are 
better than severer material. 
A portion of each hour should be devoted to a short, 
sharp quiz, and it is not a bad plan for the teacher to 
formulate his questions beforehand so that they shall be 
most telling and draw out longer and better answers. 
Those questions are the best which will force the pupil 
to combine what he has learned on previous occasions 
and in other connections. If you are dealing, for 
instance, with the quarrel of Philip the Fair and Boni- 
face VIII, ask suddenly, “What previous quarrels 
between popes and secular rulers can you call to 
mind?” 
An occasional variation of the quiz might be to 
occupy two successive periods in imparting information, 
and then to devote the whole third period to rigid ques- 
tioning on everything that has been gone over as well 
as on the required reading. At least every four weeks 
there should be a written test of the pupil’s knowledge ; 
but here, if necessary, the topic can be appointed before- 
hand. It is of peculiar advantage to have the essay 
that results passed upon both by the history and by the 
English department. This saves time, and trains the 
pupil at all times to pick and choose his words. At 
examination it is recommended that the pupil be re- 
quired to comment upon some passage from a history or 
an original source. This habit of explaining allusions
-P-A-G-E-24
24 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
as they occur conduces to good scholarship, and for it 
the reading aloud in class should furnish excellent prac- 
tice. Take a passage such as this from a letter of 
Gneisenau : — 
“ SENLIs, June 29, 1815. 
“The field-marshal orders me still to say that you shall explain 
to the Duke of Wellington that it had been the field-marshal’s 
intention to execute Bonaparte on the same spot where the 
Duke of Enghien was shot, but that out of regard for the 
duke’s wishes he would omit the execution.” 
This calls for explanation as to the occasion of its being 
written, as to the part played by Bliicher and Welling- 
ton in the capture, the murder of the Duke of Enghien, 
and Napoleon’s ultimate fate. 
Preparation for Class Exercises. — This is one of the 
most difficult problems with which the new method of 
history teaching has to cope, but it can and must be 
satisfactorily solved. The necessary reading takes a 
great deal of time and requires a great many books. 
Time, however, can be economized by making the work 
of one department serve also for another. For instance, 
an essay that has been systematically worked out in 
history may very well be presented as part of the work 
in English language and marked accordingly. Neither 
department will suffer in the least by the process; in- 
deed, every essay on any concrete subject should be 
worked out by the historical method (z.e. properly and 
logically arranged and with the aid of all available 
sources), while every contribution to history should be 
clothed in proper and correct language and made as 
telling and interesting as possible. Correctness of
-P-A-G-E-25
  
General Introduction 25 
detail is no bar to literary merit, and the reverse is 
equally true. 
When practical, special hours should be set aside for 
history preparation, at the very least one hour for each 
class exercise; and there should be an alcove or corner 
with a writing table and a case containing the necessary 
books. In order to avoid crowding, the same hour should 
be assigned to not more than three or four pupils. Of the 
more important books there should be two or more copies 
as needed, and individual pupils should be encouraged 
in every way to begin the formation of little private 
libraries of their own. Thus, in the case of Medizeval 
and Modern History, Emerton’s “Mediaeval Europe,” 
Seebohm’s “ Protestant Revolution,” and Fyffe’s “ Mod- 
ern Europe,” will be found most useful possessions 
covering nearly the whole scope of the course. Where 
pupils cannot afford individual books it often answers as 
well for small groups to purchase in common. By this 
we do not mean to absolve the schools from the duty of 
furnishing adequate libraries; indifference on this point 
often wrecks the teacher’s best efforts to introduce 
thorough and scientific methods. One of his chief aims 
is to instil a desire to keep up with the progress of 
historical investigation ; for this purpose the very latest 
and best book is only just good enough. A good lucid 
treatment of a period, like, for instance, Schouler’s 
volume on the Civil War, saves the pupil many hours of 
puzzling and labor, and leaves his mind fresh and eager 
for more. The teacher who is busy with the subject 
day after day can see how harmful, how deadening and 
dulling to the intellect, are certain treatments of a given
-P-A-G-E-26
26 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
subject, where to a school committee one book may 
seem as good as another and many books a reckless 
extravagance. In two books of average equal merit one 
and the same topic may receive very different treatment 
indeed. Take the instance above cited, where Adams in 
his European History devotes five lines and a half to all 
the events between the surrender at Ulm in 1805, and 
the peace of Tilsit in 1807. Myers, on the contrary, in 
his Medizval and Modern History devotes three pages 
to these events, and might very well have devoted more, 
seeing that they mark the culmination of the glory of 
the greatest subverter of nations that the Western world 
has ever seen. 
In order to perceive and appreciate such differences 
in books as this, it is warmly recommended that pupils 
take notes on all their required outside reading, and that 
such notes be in the form which will eventually prove 
of the greatest aid for the individual in preparation for 
reviews and examinations. These notes should be 
taken on pages of students’ note-paper with perforated 
edges; they can then be fastened in their proper place 
in the ordinary note-book which the pupil uses in 
class. This latter should always be an aggregation of 
such loose leaves, held together with a cover, so that it 
is possible to make constant additions without rewriting. 
A good student will take great pride in the growth of 
his note-book, which thus becomes the outward and 
visible sign of his progress. The benefit of this practice 
is to be found, not only in the actual acquisitions, but in 
the attitude of mind it requires of the reader. He is 
always seeking for something that will be of actual 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  General Introduction 27, 
definite use to him, something that he can formulate in 
black and white; it is a constant mental process of com- 
parison and selection. In this way he will learn accuracy 
of statement and power of arrangement, as well as 
definiteness of expression and justness of conclusion. 
Historical Geography and Map Work.— To correct the 
present lamentable ignorance of historical geography, 
it is essential that every pupil get at the very beginning 
‘of each course a clear picture of those physical features 
that form the permanent framework by which he will 
later determine changing political boundaries and move- 
ments. There should, therefore, be constant use of the 
atlas and wall maps, with frequent exercises in the fill- 
ing in of outline maps, which should show the chief 
physical features so essential to an understanding of the 
progress of history. Pupils should be told that they 
will be held responsible in later exercises for geographi- 
cal facts brought out in the class, and should be called 
on in reviews to go to the wall map and locate. The 
practice of the German schools is an excellent one, to 
have atlases or maps open on the desk.during every 
recitation, that descriptions may be followed with the 
eye on the map. 
In their own map work pupils should be trained, not 
merely to read maps and reproduce them, but to con- 
struct from written data a mental geographical picture 
and to fill in its details on outline maps. For example, 
from such data may be made maps showing the nations 
revolting from Rome in the sixteenth century, or the 
presidential elections in the United States. Topics and 
references for this work will be found in various sections
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
of the syllabus. Maps, charts, and drawings may be 
fastened in their appropriate places in the note-books. 
Historical Fiction. — History rightly studied gives to 
us the freedom of the past, making us feel at home 
in other countries than our own. But to secure this 
result the student must have gained a clear notion of 
how the men of bygone ages lived and felt and thought. 
Now, one of the greatest difficulties of the teacher of his- 
tory is to make real to the young student the times of 
which he is reading. Vividness is a quality natural to 
few, and the study of even the best text-books leaves 
the student in uncertain possession of a few dry facts 
and nothing more. Nor is the difficulty wholly met by 
carefully directed reading in the school library. The 
ordinary history concerns itself with politics rather than 
with society. Even if occasional chapters are devoted 
to customs and manners, these are generally so badly 
written that they no more reveal the life of the past 
than does the index show the spirit of the book. 
Here is the place of historical fiction. Literature of 
this class is well fitted to deal with the social aspects 
of past times, with the picturesque or familiar details of 
life and manners;, and the late Professor Allen went so 
far as to declare that its work was “hardly inferior 
in value, if well done, to that of genuine history.” It 
is true that historical fiction has its limitations. When it 
passes from a delineation of society to that of actual 
events and real personages, there is, to quote again 
from Professor Allen, “not merely a probability, but 
almost a certainty, that history will be falsified.” It is 
doubtless true that if a real enthusiasm for history can
-P-A-G-E-29
  General Introduction 29 
be awakened, it may be trusted to work itself clear from 
error as it goeson. Nevertheless, it is easier to learn 
than to unlearn, and hence the most desirable work of 
historical fiction is one that deals with conditions of the 
past rather than with the career of some historical per- 
sonage or the details of some great event. With this 
caution in mind the student may wisely be urged to give 
historical fiction a place in his voluntary reading, supple- 
menting, but not supplanting, text-book and history. In 
this way his interest is stimulated and his impressions 
are deepened, and at the same time he gains a truthful 
background against which history unrolls itself with 
force and vividness. 
Concluding Remarks. — History has so recently become 
a separate recognized branch of study that it may not be 
out of place to urge the teacher to inculcate a love and 
enthusiasm for it in every way. One establishes a new 
interest that will last a lifetime. Attention should be 
called to literature of every kind that bears upon the 
subject, to new biographies, and even to historical novels 
as they appear. Visits should be arranged to museums 
and to public libraries; every kind of illustrated mate- 
rial should be called into play, facsimiles of handwriting, 
of coins, of medals, of seals, shown to the class. Pupils 
should be encouraged to talk and to ask questions, so 
long as they are not irrelevant, and where possible per- 
sons who are doing important historical work should be 
asked to address the class on their own particular sub- 
ject. It is often a pleasure even for a hard-worked man 
to deliver addresses of this kind. And care should be 
taken to increase the library in every possible way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
Frank appeals to local and school authorities, and clear 
and definite explanation of needs, will bring a response 
more often than the teachers in their present pessimistic 
attitude would expect. Arrangements can be made with 
public libraries to loan those books that would be needed 
for a circumscribed period, or to place them on reserved 
shelves in their own reading rooms. In fact, interest in 
this matter as a means of education once aroused, the 
committee feels sure that only in the most benighted 
places will books of the right kind be lacking. 
The first and last word must be an insistence on the 
proper kind of training for the teacher himself. The 
standards of the day require something far above ordi- 
nary culture; nor is there any lack of opportunities. 
Those who cannot spare a whole year from their school 
work should at least attend the summer sessions at Har- 
vard, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, or some other col- 
lege. A portion of each summer should be spent in 
preparation for the work of the ensuing year. Thus 
and thus only can a teacher of history be true to his 
high calling; thus and thus only will he be following 
Dr. Arnold’s recommendation to his fellow teachers to 
draw from fresh water and not from a mud puddle. 
VI. METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE OUTLINES 
In the preparation of this syllabus it was early seen 
that each field had special demands of its own which 
must be recognized, and if duly recognized no such 
uniformity of treatment as had at first been contem- 
plated could be secured.
-P-A-G-E-31
  General Introduction 31 
In the outlines for Ancient History the enormous 
fields of Oriental, Greek, Roman, and early Medizval 
History had to be covered. Here the main aim of the 
general survey must be to unify the student’s concep- 
tions of these four grand divisions of history, and show 
how Oriental, Greek, Roman, and Medieval histories 
united at last in one and the same great stream of Euro- 
pean History. In the topical heads under the more com- 
prehensive sections and general groups the periods and 
processes of juncture must be emphasized. There are 
excellent historical text-books of Eastern, Grecian, Ro- 
man, and early Medizval History. The outlines must 
show how to use all these together and not separately, 
— how to blend them. 
In Medizval History proper, on the contrary, the 
makers of the outlines found no satisfactory text-books 
atcommand. The outlines, therefore, were constructed 
ona different principle, and were adapted for use under 
a different method of teaching. This principle and this 
method had to be more fully elaborated in directions and 
suggestions to teachers. 
In English History again, and in American History, 
the subject matter itself demanded a distinctive method 
of survey, though here ample and excellent text-books 
allowed much more condensation and precision of treat- 
ment, and more wealth of suggestion for supplementary 
and individual work when desired. 
Again, the different periods in the school, when, ac- 
cording to the recommendations of the Committee of 
Seven, these four fields of history are to be studied, 
rendered different treatments in outline absolutely neces-
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
sary. Ancient History is to be studied in the earliest 
high school year. The picturesque and narrative fea- 
tures in Ancient History must therefore predominate 
here, to the comparative exclusion of the philosophical 
and institutional features of ancient life. Mediaeval 
History, with its enormous ranges and difficult clews, 
must be made clear to second-year pupils, while English 
and American History are to be taught, not only to ma- 
tured pupils, but to pupils trained and informed by the 
two earlier courses, and already usually more familiar 
with the field. 
Under these circumstances, all outward uniformity of 
treatment in the outlines had to be abandoned, though 
it is hoped the long and searching discussions which 
have attended the work on the syllabus will secure a 
higher unity in spirit and aim. 
Of course, if the four fields are studied in a different 
chronological sequence from that recommended by the 
Committee of Seven, the particular outlines used for 
any given period can be reconstructed by the teacher 
along the lines suggested by those for any other body 
of outlines better adapted to the age and acquisitions of 
the pupils taking any course out of the chronological 
order originally contemplated. 
The outlines will, therefore, discourage, rather than 
encourage, the belief that all history must be taught 
according to some fixed method. Any period of history 
may be taught by any method according to the demands 
of the particular school and teacher. 
This does not mean, of course, that the Committee of 
Six is not, in the main, in harmony with the recommen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  General Introduction 33 
dations of the Committee of Seven. It is, and hopes 
that the sequence of study adopted as the basis for 
these outlines may ultimately become general in our 
schools. But at present the outlines must and may 
serve a wide range of varying needs. 
But while the treatment of the four fields varies in 
details, the general plan of notation and arrangement 
is uniform. In the teachers’ edition of the syllabus, 
each outline is prefaced by a brief discussion of the 
characteristics of the field with which it deals, and re- 
marks upon possible modes of treatment; a section in 
which books and other aids especially helpful to the 
teacher for personal study or class work are noted and 
commented upon; and a commentary on the groups 
or periods into which the outline is divided, their special 
characteristics and their relations to each other. A 
general survey of these groups precedes each outline, 
as a table of contents, and the proportion of class exer- 
cises to be assigned for each group is indicated in 
percentages. Thus, for schools having one hundred 
exercises for advance work, five per cent. would indi- 
cate five exercises; schools having two hundred exer- 
cises could allow ten; and teachers in schools with 
varying numbers can easily estimate the proportion 
practicable for them. 
The outlines of the syllabus are divided into groups 
or periods, indicated by black-faced type and Roman 
numerals; sections, indicated by capitals and small cap- 
itals, with Arabic numerals; topics, which are lettered 
with small Italic letters; and in some cases, where fur- 
ther analysis is desirable, sub-topics, marked by small
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 History Syllabus for Secondary Schools 
Arabic figures in parentheses. The references, indi- 
cated as brief, longer, and sources, follow each section, 
and in some cases, where specific references seem to be 
desirable, they are given in connection with each topic. 
Citations are made by a brief title, as Creighton, Papacy, 
large Roman numerals for the volume, small Roman for 
the chapter, and Arabic for pages, as: V, iii, 27-42. 
Where called for, topics for map work, with references 
for finding the necessary data, are next given. © 
There are provided, in connection with many of the 
sections, in addition to the regular topics, additional 
topics for advanced, essay, or individual work in classes 
where there is time and ability for this. 
The arrangement thus adopted makes it easy for teacher 
and pupil to obtain a conspectus of the year’s work, and 
the relation of its parts, and a carefully worked out ex- 
ample of constructive analysis of historical subjects will 
be at hand when the teacher wishes to instruct the pupil 
in that kind-of work. At points of contact between the 
different fields, the connection is indicated by the out- 
lines and the references, and the growing unity of the 
world’s history is thus shown. A striking example of 
such contact is the period of the Seven Years’ War.

INTRODUCTION 
TuE course in Ancient History from earliest times 
down to Charlemagne, as outlined by the Committee of 
Seven, seems at first thought too extensive and difficult 
for the first year of secondary schools. But if certain 
essentials are singled out for accomplishment in this 
course, and temptations to spend time on fascinating 
non-essentials are vigorously withstood, the enormous 
field may be satisfactorily and helpfully covered in spite 
of its great difficulties. 
To begin with, this course must be kept strictly distinct 
from the old course in Ancient History so long required 
for entrance to college, on which some college en- 
trance papers are still based. That course was almost 
wholly supplementary to the study of the Greek and 
Latin authors read in school and college. It naturally 
emphasized the earlier periods of classical history, and 
the periods when great authors lived and wrote, or, at 
any rate, the periods about which great authors wrote. 
Proportion and perspective were determined by literary 
considerations, and not by the processes of historical 
evolution. This was perfectly natural as long as the 
course consisted of a few lessons in a distinctively Greek 
39
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 Ancient History 
history of small dimensions and limited horizon, fol- 
lowed by a few more lessons in a distinctively Roman 
history of equal scope, all snatched from a crowded 
programme of studies— deemed more important—in the 
attempt to prepare students for college entrance require- 
ments, and given by teachers of the classics with no 
special training in historical methods or principles. 
Restricted fields of classical literature were thus pro- 
vided with appropriate historical setting. 
The new course in Ancient History is to be given by 
and for itself, before the reading of Caesar and the study 
of elementary Greek. It is designed to lay a broad and 
sure foundation on which the teacher of the classics in 
after years may add superstructure and detail. It will 
be of immense service to the teacher of the classics, in 
supplying the student who begins the study of the clas- 
sics, not with detailed historical knowledge, but with 
foundation and framework whereon to adjust the his- 
torical details as he collects them in his reading. And 
above all, the old separation of Greek and Roman his- 
tory, as though they were not parts of one great pro- 
cess, will be in some measure prevented, and a new idea 
of the continuity of history and the progress of human 
culture will be implanted in the student at the outset, to 
gain in vividness and significance with each additional 
year of study and maturity. The great processes of 
history will be first impressed on the student’s mind, 
and then the literary expressions along with the other 
important products of those processes. Literature as 
well as empire is a resultant. 
The unity and continuity of Ancient History may be
-P-A-G-E-41
  
Introduction 41 
impressed on a very young mind even, when it is shown 
how races of the North and races of the South have 
been contending with each other, from Sargon to 
Charlemagne, for the treasures lying between them 
in the Tigris-Euphrates river-valleys or the Mediter- 
ranean basin; and how the arts and sciences of men, 
originating in the deltas of the Euphrates and the Nile, 
were blended during this long contest, and transmitted 
successively to Hellenes, Romans, and Teutons, — from 
Babylon to Athens, Rome, and Aachen. The great 
Persian wars of the fifth century B.c., the Punic wars of 
the third, and the Mohammedan wars of the eighth cen- 
tury A.D. can be clearly shown to be successive phases 
of the same long contest. 
When the present Committee was appointed, in the 
spring of 1900, no one of the four one-year courses 
recommended by the Committee of Seven, unless per- 
haps that in Medizeval and Modern European History, 
was so difficult of adoption in the schools as the course 
in Ancient History. There were many good text-books 
in Greek History and in Roman History; while for 
Oriental History as a prelude to Greek History, and for 
early Medizval History as a sequel to the history of the 
Roman Empire, the teacher could make good text-book 
provision. But there was no good text-book treating 
the immense tract of history assigned to this course as a 
unit, —as one and the same story, to which perspective, 
proportion, and climax could be given. Hence the work 
of this Committee was thought to lie along the lines 
indicated on page 31 of its preliminary report (page 31 
of the General Introduction to this syllabus).
-P-A-G-E-42

Since the appearance of this preliminary report, how- 
ever, the situation has been completely changed by the 
publication of three excellent manuals expressly de- 
signed to meet the recommendations of the Committee of 
Seven for Ancient History. West’s “Ancient History ” 
(Boston, Allyn & Bacon), Botsford’s “ Ancient History for 
Beginners” (New York, The Macmillan Co.), and Wolf- 
son’s “Essentials in Ancient History” (New York, Amer- 
ican Book Co.), all appeared during the year 1902.1 All 
are good; each has marked excellencies of its own; 
and a class provided with any one of them and working 
under a teacher provided with all three, would be richly 
equipped — so far as text-books for the first-year course 
in Ancient History are concerned —for trying what 
many still regard as a doubtful experiment. Many are 
still sceptical as to the possibility of teaching success- 
fully to secondary school pupils of from twelve to four- 
teen years of age, in one year’s time, even the leading 
incidents of so vast and varied a sweep of historical life, 
much less the underlying and unifying principles of that 
life, or the changing aspects of culture and society. 
Pupils of that age and mental development, it is said, 
can be interested in personal detail and vivid incident, 
or in myth and legend of high literary form, when they 
have no capacity to grasp the deeper relations and 
meanings of history. 
This is doubtless true of many, but can hardly be 
true of all, or even of the majority, of such pupils. In 
1Since the above was put in type, Myers’s Ancient History (Boston, 
Ginn & Co., 1904) has appeared in a new edition, which likewise seeks to 
follow the recommendations of the Committee of Seven.

  Introduction 43 
spite of philosophical text-books and elaborate topical 
analyses, there will still be many teachers who feel 
compelled to interest the youngest pupils in our second- 
ary schools, when they take up the study of Ancient 
History, first of all in certain great military struggles, 
like the battle of Salamis, for Greek History, and the 
Second Punic War, for Roman History. From these 
crucial struggles, with their fascinating personalities, 
the young pupil can more easily be conducted back- 
ward and forward along the lines of historical develop- 
ment, until, possibly not till later years, but often and 
profitably during the latter part of the first year, he is 
led to group the details of ancient history with which 
he has become familiar under some large and compre- 
hensive scheme which shall bring home to him the 
essential unity of the vast field, and show him the logic 
of chronology. This is largely a matter of method, and 
the methods of good teachers are independent of text- 
books and syllabus. 
But whenever and wherever teacher and pupil are 
ready to unify their conceptions of Ancient History, it 
is hoped that the following syllabus will be helpful. 
And even in the initial stages of instruction with the 
youngest pupils it will be of assistance in suggesting 
the special episodes and tracts of history to be first 
explored, before familiar features are grouped together, 
as they soon should be, into one logically connected 
whole. The General Survey of the Field which is here 
submitted, in case the detailed syllabus is beyond the 
reach of the youngest pupils, may be used with any 
text-book of ancient history to bring into logical and
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 Ancient History 
chronological sequence events, institutions, or forms of 
culture and life which may at first have been selected 
more or less at random, for their power to attract, inter- 
est, and educate the most immature pupils. It may be 
found wiser, with some pupils and some classes, to 
work back gradually to Sargon of Agadé by way 
of Themistocles, Xerxes, Cyrus the Great, and Nebu- 
chadnezzar, than to begin at once with the shadowy 
personalities of the earliest civilizations. But a glance 
at the General Survey will show at once the historical 
relations between Themistocles and Sargon. 
A series of bibliographical notes and suggestions ac- 
companies the syllabus, although the three manuals of 
Ancient History referred to above abound in such notes 
and suggestions. The abundance is indeed so great 
that guiding hints may be welcome to the teacher; and, 
so emphatically true is it in these days that “of the 
making of many books there is no end,” certain new 
and excellent books which have appeared since the pub- 
lication of the three manuals can in this way be brought 
to the teacher’s notice. 
There is danger, after all, that many pupils and some 
teachers will become confused by the wealth of reading 
in history recommended to them, and fail to become 
thoroughly acquainted with the main road. Examiners, 
teachers, and thoughtful students must insist more and 
more on accurate and intelligent acquaintance with the 
main facts and principles of history, leaving it to later 
and maturer years to supply illustrative and ornamental 
details. 
It is to be hoped that before very long all colleges
-P-A-G-E-45
  
Introduction oa 
will set entrance examination papers based on such a 
general course in Ancient History as is here outlined, 
and that no more special acquaintance with distinctively 
Greek and Roman history will be demanded, even of 
classical students, than this course naturally supplies. 
The old style of entrance examination papers may, how- 
ever, still be set for such pupils as present the usual 
Greek and Latin authors, and have pursued the study 
of Greek and Roman history mainly in connection with, 
and as supplementary to, such authors. 
By the use of smaller type, this syllabus has been so 
constructed as to be easily adaptable to the needs of 
beginners in the first year of the High School or Acad- 
emy, or of pupils in later years preparing for college. 
Topics and references printed in fine type are not in- 
tended for first-year pupils, but for advanced pupils and 
candidates preparing for college entrance requirements. 
The “ Additional Topics ” may be used to some extent 
by first-year pupils (where the course has adequate 
time); but they are particularly adapted to more ad- 
vanced pupils, and for work in connection with the 
Classics and English. In the latter work they may 
often be used to advantage as subjects for essays. 
Many of these additional topics will prove useful for 
pupils preparing for college. 
For suggestions regarding the use of Sources and for 
further references to them, the teacher is referred to the 
report on “ Historical Sources in Schools” prepared by a 
committee of the New England History Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation (Macmillan, 1902).

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES AND 
SUGGESTIONS 
General Observations. — On the relative time to be given to differ- 
ent periods in the General Survey, there will be wide divergence of 
opinion. It is to be hoped that no teacher will be obliged to cover 
the whole ground in so few as one hundred exercises. Two hun- 
dred would be none too many, and this number can be had in a 
course of five hours per week extending through a school year of 
forty. weeks, or, in a course of three hours per week extending 
through two school years of thirty-three or thirty-four weeks each. 
For intermediate numbers, the proper proportion can be readily esti- 
mated for the different periods from per cents in the General Survey 
below, and change of emphasis can easily be secured. The period 
which most sorely needs more time and emphasis in the scheme as 
submitted is doubtless that of the later Roman Empire, Periods XI 
and XII. The lack of time here may be remedied for those who 
continue in Medizval and Modern European History, by a review 
of the Transition Period. See the first four sections of the Ouéline 
of European History. 
Notes on Section 1. Introduction. — Much of this is still debata- 
ble ground, and neither teacher nor pupil should expect to get any- 
thing more than a convenient working hypothesis. The history of 
those peoples is most valuable who have progressed most themselves, 
and most helped their successors to progress. Our attention may 
therefore be restricted to those peoples who have contributed to 
the stream of culture which we call European. 
Any classification of races will be more or less arbitrary; a con- 
venient one is into: Black (Africa); Yellow and Brown (eastern 
Asia) ; Red (America); and White (western Asia and Europe). 
The Caucasian, or White race, though probably composed of mixed 
races, from earliest times falls into two families, or groups of asso- 
ciated rather than kindred peoples, which may conveniently be called 
Aryans and Semites. 
Generally speaking, the earliest known homes of the Aryan peo-
-P-A-G-E-47
  Bibliographical 47 
ples are in the vast regions of Europe and Asia lying to the north 
of the Danube River and the Black and Caspian seas; those of the 
Semites are in the vast Arabian peninsula. The Aryans are con- 
stantly pressing southward, the Semites northward, in contention 
for the more attractive regions lying between them, — regions of the 
earliest known wealth and culture. In this struggle of the earlier 
peoples to maintain their wealth and culture, and of the intruding 
peoples to appropriate that wealth and culture, the earliest civiliza- 
tions at the mouth of the Euphrates and the Nile are assimilated, 
blended, and then diffused from East to West, from the Euphrates 
to the Rhine. The progress of culture and political power is from 
the East to the peninsula of Asia Minor; then to the Hellenic, or 
Greek peninsula; then to the Italian peninsula; then to the Ger- 
manic states of central and western Europe. 
Ancient History falls naturally, therefore, into (2) an Oriental pe- 
riod, when the culture which arose in the Tigris-Euphrates and the 
Nile valleys is swayed by an eastern power; (4) a Classical period, 
when this culture is dominated and advanced by political power 
having its seat first in the Greek and afterward in the Italian penin- 
sula; and (c) a Germanic period, when the control and further 
development of this culture passes into the hands of the Germanic 
peoples of central and western Europe. 
Bibliography for Section 1. Introduction. — After the abundance 
of material cited in the three manuals, a few references only need be 
given here, for the sake of emphasizing specially helpful works 
or excellent works which have appeared since the manuals were 
edited. Hoernes’s Primitive Man, and Haberlandt’s Ethnology, in 
the “Temple Primer” series (London, Dent & Co., 1900), are excel- 
lent pocket manuals. Bourne’s Teaching of History and Civics, in 
the American Teacher’s Series (N.Y., Longmans, 1902), is an in- 
dispensable companion for the teacher, and supersedes much older 
literature. Chapters i and v, on “The Meaning of History” and 
“The Value of History,” are specially helpful for this section. 
Notes on Section 2. Egypt.— Mariette’s Outlines of Ancient 
Egyptian History (translated and edited by Mary Brodrick, N.Y., 
Scribner, 1892), and Maspero’s Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria 
(N.Y., Appleton, 1892), are recent and excellent small manuals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
48 Ancient History 
Petrie’s History of Egypt (2 vols., 12mo, N.Y., Scribner, 1896) 
is an invaluable and authoritative collection of original source- 
material, profusely illustrated. Amelia B. Edwards’s Pharaohs, Fel- 
lahs, and Explorers (N.Y., Harper, 1891), and Sir Alfred Milner’s 
England in Egypt (London, Guildford, 7th ed., 1899), are helpful for 
modern conditions. Budge’s History of Egypt from the neolithic 
period to the death of Cleopatra (8 vols., Oxford, 1902) is the latest 
comprehensive work. 
Notes on Section 3. The Tigris-Euphrates Valley. — Myers’s East- 
ern Nations and Greece (also bound with Roman History in one 
volume as Ancient History, Boston, Ginn & Co.) treats the three 
states and their cultures separately, and with greater detail, than 
either West, Botsford, or Wolfson could allow themselves. 
Goodspeed’s History of the Babylonians and Assyrians (Histor- 
ical Series for Bible Students, N.Y., Scribner, 1902), and Sayce’s 
Babylonians and Assyrians (Semitic Series, N.Y., Scribner, 1899), 
and Hommel’s Civilization of the East (“Temple Primer” series, 
London, Dent & Co., 1900), are new and excellent small popular 
manuals. 
Rogers’s History of Babylonia and Assyria (2 vols., 8vo, N.Y., 
Eaton and Mains, got, 2d ed.) is the latest and best authoritative 
compilation, with full history of modern excavations. 
Monumental and costly illustrated popular works are Maspero’s 
Dawn of Civilization, Struggle of the Nations, and Passing of the 
Empires (3 vols., large 8vo, N.Y., Appleton, 1894-1900). An old 
standard work of monumental character is Duncker’s History of 
Antiquity (Evelyn Abbott’s translation from the German, 6 vols., 
8vo, London, Bentley, 1877-1882). 
Notes on Sections 4 and 5, Syria; and 6, Media and Persia. — For 
the physical geography and earliest inhabitants of Syria, Paton’s 
Early History of Syria and Palestine (Semitic Series, N.Y., Scrib- 
ner, 1901) is the best recent small manual. 
On the vexed question of the “ Hittites” and their “ forgotten em- 
pire,” the fairest statement of the latest knowledge may be found in 
the monumental work of McCurdy, History, Prophecy, and the 
Monuments (2 vols., 8vo, London and N.Y., Macmillan, 1894), I, 
Pp. 190-205.

For the Hebrews, Myers’s Eastern Nations and Greece, pp. 107- 
119, gives an excellent survey of political history; Hosmer’s Story 
of the Jews (Story of the Nations Series, N.Y., Putnam, 1886) con- 
tains also Jewish history since the dispersion, and is written in 
sympathetic and attractive style; Kent’s History of the Hebrew 
People (Vol. I, The United Kingdom; Vol. II, The Divided King- 
dom. Historical Series for Bible Students, N.Y., Scribner, 1896, 
1897), and Kent and Riggs’s History of the Jewish People (Vol. III 
of the same series, The Babylonian, Persian, and Greek Periods, 
and Vol. IV, The Maccabean and Roman Period, 1899, 1900), are 
convenient and lucid small manuals. McCurdy’s great work, re- 
ferred to just above, is the best extended treatment of the subject. 
On the Phoenicians (section 4), Rawlinson’s Story of Phoenicia 
(Story of the Nations Series, N.Y., Putnam, 1889) is excellent and 
authoritative for longer reading than the manuals afford, and Mc- 
Curdy, History, Prophecy, and the Monuments, I, pp. 42-47, gives 
a discriminating statement of the political principles of the Phceni- 
cians as compa‘ed with other Semites. 
The Lydians (section 7) receive rather stepmotherly treatment in 
the three manuals. Myers’s Eastern Nations and Greece, pp. 128- 
132, at least devotes a short separate chapter to the subject. 
Hommel’s Civilization of the East (see Notes on 3), Chs. vii and 
viii, gives excellent condensation and arrangement of material for 
this section, and Wheeler’s Alexander the Great (Heroes of the 
Nations Series, N.Y., Putnam, 1900), Ch. xii, is a peculiarly vig- 
orous and graphic survey of the civilization and resources of the 
Persian Empire under Darius. Maspero’s Passing of the Empires 
(see Notes on 3), pp- 323-328 and Chs. v and vi, gives admirable 
extended reading on the subject. For longer reading on Pheenicia, 
see Sayce, Ancient Empires of the East (N.Y., Scribner, 1884), or 
Maspero’s Passing of the Empires (see references on section 3), 
Ppp- 323-342, and Ch. v. Herodotus (Rawlinson’s translation), Bk. 
I, Chs. 6-94, shows what impressions this people made on the lively 
fancies of the Greeks.

  50 Ancient History 
Thirlwall’s History of Greece is the best of the older and larger 
histories, and is complete to the Roman conquest; indeed, is most 
valuable for the periods following the ascendency of Macedon 
(American ed. in 2 vols., N.Y., Harper, 1860). 
Grote’s monumental work is less impartial and accurate than 
Thirlwall, and holds a brief for Athenian democracy ; but it is still 
unsurpassed in many portions, always presents the literary evidence 
fully, and often has great literary power. It ceases to be so valuable 
when it treats the career of Alexander, with whose period it closes 
(4th English ed. in 10 vols., London, Murray, 1872. American ed. 
pub. by Harper. Also various cheap editions). 
Curtius’s History of Greece is especially strong in its appreciation 
of the artistic genius of the Greeks in all the forms of expression, 
but it is often visionary and does not include that most important 
period of Greek history which follows Philip of Macedon (Ward’s 
translation from the German, 5 vols., Scribner, 1871-1874). 
Among the later and larger histories of Greece, Evelyn Abbott's 
(as yet only three volumes have appeared, bringing the subject down 
to the Fall of the Thirty Tyrants) contains the results of the latest 
and best scholarship arranged with sound and independent judg- 
ment (N.Y., Putnam, 1888-1900). 
Holm’s masterly work is now translated from the German in four 
volumes (N.Y., Macmillan, 1894-1898), and is the best general and 
complete history of Greece in any language, bringing the subject 
down to the Roman imperial period, and exhibiting the sources fully 
and critically in appendices to the several chapters. Both Abbott 
and Holm contain the results of that careful criticism of sources 
which distinguishes the best historical study of recent years. 
The best recent history of Greece in a single volume is that of 
Bury (N.Y., Macmillan, 1900). It is intended for general use, and 
is not therefore hampered by the restrictions of a school manual. 
It is attractively written, advanced and often daringly radical in its 
views, freely and helpfully illustrated. It closes, however, with the 
conquests of Alexander. A new and somewhat enlarged and revised 
edition in two volumes is also published (N.Y., Macmillan, 1902). 
Harrison’s Story of Greece (Story of the Nations Series, N.Y., 
Putnam, 1888) is based on the Greek historians, as far as possible,
-P-A-G-E-51
  
Bibliographical St 
avoiding modern criticisms and speculations, and is a vivid, dramatic 
narrative of the chief events down to the battle of Cheroneia (338 
B.C.) as the Greeks themselves understood them. 
Recent manuals of Greek history for school use, of varying 
methods and excellencies, and often supplementing each other de- 
sirably, are, in the order of their publication, Oman’s (Longmans, 
1891), Myers’s (Ginn & Co., 1895), Brownson’s (Smith’s Smaller 
History of Greece revised, Harper, 1897), Botsford’s (Macmillan, 
Igor), and Morey’s (American Book Co., 1903). Botsford is par- 
ticularly helpful in its incorporation of illustrative Greek literature, 
its lists of ancient sources and modern authorities, its specimens of 
outlines and topical surveys, and its chronological table. 
An excellent and authoritative pocket manual of Greek history, 
embodying the results of the most recent and advanced scholarship, 
is that of Swoboda, in the “ Temple Primer” series, translated from 
the German (London, Bent & Co., 1900). This gives full notices 
of the ancient sources. 
For study of the ancient sources, then, Holm, Botsford, and 
Swoboda are most helpful of the works now mentioned which are 
devoted especially to Greek history. The three manuals of Ancient 
History, however, by West, Botsford, and Wolfson, which these out- 
lines are designed to accompany, all incorporate more or less ex- 
tended notices of and extracts from the ancient.sources. The 
report of a special committee of the New England History Teachers’ 
Association on Historical Sources in Schools (N.Y., Macmillan, 
1902), and especially Part IJ, on Ancient History, will be found 
helpful in this connection. Fling’s European History Studies, 
Vol. I, Greek and Roman Civilization (Ainsworth & Co., Chicago), 
present excellent source materials. 
In the matters of bibliography, additional topics to stimulate 
reflection, further study, search or even “research” on the part of the 
pupil, suggestions for geographical study and map work, etc., etc., 
the three manuals of Ancient History mentioned above, and also 
Botsford’s History of Greece, Goodrich’s Topics on Greek and 
Roman History (N.Y., Macmillan, 1gor), and Bourne’s Teaching of 
History and Civics, Chs. xi-xiv, will all be found of great service to 
teachers and enterprising pupils.

52 Ancient History 
It has not been sete necessary or advisable to make references 
in the Syllabus to all available manuals. Many are out of date and 
are wholly superseded by successors, and many lack authority. It is 
hardly worth while to read the same story over and over again in 
slightly varying phraseology. The best apparatus to accompany the 
school manual is really not extensive. Swoboda’s primer, Bury’s 
single-volume history (in spite of all its daring), and Holm’s four- 
volume history, are all authoritative in their way, fresh and original 
in their treatment, and ample in their scope. 
As companion volumes of moderate size, recent appearance, and 
authority for the study of Greek mythology, literature, art, political 
institutions, and private life, the following manuals may be men- 
tioned: Steuding, Greek and Roman Mythology (“Temple Primer” 
series, London, Dent & Co., 1901); Fowler, History of Ancient 
Greek Literature (N.Y., Appleton, 1903) ; Tarbell, History of Greek 
Art (N.Y., Macmillan) ; Greenidge, Greek Constitutional History 
(N.Y., Macmillan, 1895); Gulick, Life of the Ancient Greeks (N.Y., 
Appleton, 1903) ; Jebb, Greek Literature (Primer, American Book 
Co.) ; Mahaffy, Old Greek Life (Primer, American Book Co.) ; 
Gardner, Ancient Athens (N.Y., Macmillan, 1902). 
Sanborn’s Classical Atlas (Boston, Benjamin H. Sanborn & Co., 
1902) is a recent and excellent addition to our school apparatus. 
Notes on Period VII. Empire of Alexander.— Brief Readings: 
West, pp. 214-224, has little incident and anecdote, but is specially 
good on the results of Alexander’s work, defending and exalting his 
motives and character; Botsford, pp. 233-240, is less analytical and 
philosophical, and gives more incident, with a marked tendency to 
depreciate Alexander’s motives and character; Wolfson, pp. 205- 
215, has a well sustained and even narrative of Alexander’s career, 
holding a safe middle course in the estimate of motives and character ; 
Swoboda, pp. 129-139, is a more colorless but minutely detailed 
account of Alexander’s achievements. 
Longer Readings: Any one of the special school manuals of Greek 
History (p. 51); Mahaffy’s Survey of Greek Civilization (Mead- 
ville, Pa., Flood & Vincent, 1896, new ed., N. Y., Macmillan, 1899) ; 
Wheeler’s Alexander the Great (Heroes of the Nations Series, N.Y., 
Putnam, 1900).
-P-A-G-E-53
  
Bibliographical 53 
Extended Readings: Bury’s and the larger histories of Greece 
(p. 50) ; Freeman’s Alexander (a review of Grote’s last volume), in 
Historical Essays, Vol. 11; Hogarth’s Philip and Alexander of 
Macedon (N.Y., Scribner, 1897); Dodge’s Alexander the Great 
(Great Captains Series, Boston, Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1890), 
from the standpoint of the student of military history. 
For the Graeco-Oriental world of Alexander, and Hellenistic Cul- 
ture, Holm’s fourth volume is indispensable for extended reading. 
Sources: Except in the case of inscriptions, the contemporary 
accounts of Alexander’s career —such as the history of Callisthenes, 
the memoirs of Ptolemy and Aristobulus, the letters of Alexander 
himself, and the journals of his court —are preserved for us only as 
later writers have used them and given them to us. Most careful in 
his selection of authorities is Arrian, in his Anabasis of Alexander 
(a literary imitation of Xenophon’s Anabasis), and Indice (both in 
Chinnock’s translation, Bohn’s Library, London, Bell, 1893). Far 
more voluminous in his citations, and on the whole reasonably 
critical in what he accepts as true, is Plutarch in his Alexander. 
His Phocion and Eumenes also contain much authentic material 
bearing on the career of Alexander. 
Notes on Periods VIII-XII. Rome and the Transition to the 
Medieval Empire.—On standard histories of Rome in English 
(Niebuhr, Arnold, Lewis, and especially Mommsen), see Freeman’s 
Historical Essays, II, pp. 284-317. 
The most comprehensive, and at the same time most popular in 
its character, of the larger histories of Rome is that of Duruy, in six 
large and profusely illustrated volumes, extending from the earliest 
times to the death of Diocletian (313 a.D.), translated from the 
French, and edited, or rather introduced, by Mahaffy (London, 
Kegan Paul, 1883-1886, and in a cheaper American edition, Estes 
& Lauriat). As regards the method of this work, it aims to follow 
that of Niebuhr and Arnold; 7.e. it uses the legendary material in 
Roman history as suggestive aid in reconstructing a coherent account 
of the early periods. 
In a similar spirit, though more critical and scholarly in its execu- 
tion, is the work of Ihne, in five volumes, extending from earliest 
times to the death of Sulla (78 B.Cc.), a history of the Republic 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 Ancient History 
(London, Longmans, 1871-1882). Merivale’s History of the Romans 
under the Empire (down to the death of Marcus Aurelius, 180 A.D.) 
is the natural continuation of the work of Ihne (8 vols., London, 
Longmans, 2d ed., 1890). It closes at the point where the monu- 
mental work of Gibbon (see below) begins. 
Long’s Decline of the Roman Republic (from the destruction of 
Carthage in 146 B.c. to the death of Julius Cesar in 44 B.c.) is a 
valuable complement to the closing volumes of Ihne and the opening 
volumes of Merivale (5 vols., London, Bell & Daldy, Geo. Bell & 
Sons, 1864-1874). 
Mommsen’s History of Rome (translated from the German, 5 vols., 
N.Y., Scribner, new ed., 1895) extends to the “ military monarchy” 
of Julius Cesar, and is therefore a history of the Republic only, 
but it is supplemented by two volumes on The Provinces from 
Cesar to Diocletian (N.Y., Scribner, 1887). This is a work of the 
profoundest and most varied scholarship, and of deep insight, and is 
written with spirit and power. It rejects the legendary material 
entirely, except as it may be corroborative of deductions from 
historical institutions, gives few proofs or authorities for its posi- 
tions, and is a partisan of monarchy. 
For the later Empire, Gibbon’s classic The Decline and Fall of 
the Roman Empire, covering the period from 180 to I500 A.D. 
(edited last and best by Bury, in seven volumes ; London, Macmillan, 
1897-1903), is still authoritative, as well.as a monument of historical 
style and method. But Bury’s Later Roman Empire, treating the 
period from 395 A.D. to 800 A.D., is an able and sufficient successor 
to Gibbon (2 vols., London, Macmillan, 1889), so far as it goes. 
Hodgkin’s Italy and Her Invaders (8 vols., Vol. I in two parts, 
Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1879-1899, Vols. I-IV in a new edition, 
1892-1896) is exhaustive and monumental for the period from 240 
to 814 A.D. 
Among smaller works on Roman History, two should be especially 
mentioned here because of their comprehensiveness: Merivale’s 
General History of Rome from the foundation of the city to 476 a.p. 
(N.Y., Appleton, 1875), and Pelham’s Outlines of Roman History, 
covering the same period, each in a single volume. The latter cites 
authorities, ancient and modern, and is admirably adapted to the
-P-A-G-E-55
  
Bibliographical 55 
wants of the special student (N. Y., Putnam, 1893). Two other con- 
venient manuals are: How and Leigh’s History of Rome (to the 
death of Caesar; London, Longmans, 1896); and Shuckburgh’s 
History of Rome (to the battle of Actium; N.Y., Macmillan, 1894) ; 
but they do not cover the period of the Empire, and are not so 
authoritative as Pelham. 
Among the many handbooks of Roman History prepared especially 
for use in schools and colleges, both. in England and this country, 
the more recent, of varying methods and excellencies, and often 
supplementing one another desirably, are, in the order of their publi- 
cation ; W. F. Allen’s Short History of the Roman People (to 476 A.D. ; 
Boston, Ginn & Co., 1890) ; Wells’s Short History of Rome (to the 
death of Augustus ; London, Methuen, 1896, 2d ed., 1898) ; Myers’s 
Rome: Its Rise and Fall (to 476 A.p.; Boston, Ginn & Co., 1900) ; 
Botsford’s History of Rome (to the Empire of Charlemagne, 800 A.D. ; 
N.Y., Macmillan, 1g01); Morey’s Outlines of Roman History 
(American Book Co., 1901); Fairley’s Seignobos’s History of the 
Roman People (to the Empire of Charlemagne; N.Y., Holt, 1902). 
An excellent and authoritative pocket manual, corresponding in 
method and character to Swoboda’s Greek History, is Koch’s Roman 
History (to 476 A.p.; “Temple Primer” series, London, Dent & 
Co., 1900). 
The best brief manual for the period from 476 to 800 A.D. is 
Emerton’s Introduction to the Middle Ages (375-814 A.D.; Boston, 
» Ginn & Co., 1888). Oman’s Dark Ages covers the period 476- 
g18 A.D. (Periods of European History, N.Y., Macmillan, 3d ed., 
1898). 
Quite recent, but very brief on the period before 800 a.D., are 
Robinson’s Introduction to the History of Western Europe (Boston, 
Ginn & Co., 1903), extending to 1902 a.D.; and Munro’s History 
of the Middle Ages (N.Y., Appleton, 1902), extending to 1300 A.D. 
As companion volumes of moderate size, recent appearance, and 
authority for the study of Roman Mythology, literature, art, political 
institutions, and private life, etc., etc., the followines manuals may be 
mentioned : — 
Abbott, Roman Political Institutions (Boston, Ginn & Co., 1901) ; 
Greenidge, Roman Public Life (N.Y., Macmillan, rgor) ; Steuding,
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 Ancient History 
Greek and Roman Mythology (see p. 52); Fowler, History of 
Roman Literature (N.Y., Appleton, 1903); Reber, History of 
Ancient Art (N.Y., Harper, 1882); Granrud, Roman Constitu- 
tional History (Boston, Allyn & Bacon, 1902) ; Johnston, Private 
Life of the Romans (Chicago, Scott, Foresman & Co., 1893) ; Preston 
and Dodge, Private Life of the Romans (Boston, Sanborn, 1893) ; 
Lanciani, Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome (Boston, 
Houghton, Mifflin, 1897). There is no manual of Roman art 
corresponding to Tarbell’s History of Greek Art. 
There are no contemporary sources for the early period, like the 
Homeric poems for the monarchical period in Greek history, but 
legends and traditions thrown into attractive literary form by Livy, 
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Diodorus Siculus, and Strabo, all writers 
of the Augustan period. Book I of Livy’s History of Rome, Books 
I-IV of Dionysius’s Antiquities of Rome, and Books V and VI of 
Strabo’s Geography, show what the Romans of the Augustan age 
liked to believe about their early history. Livy’s first book has an 
undying charm,.and is woven into the thought and literature of all 
succeeding ages. Plutarch’s Lives of Romulus and Numa contain 
the legends of these kings in a somewhat different and sometimes 
earlier form than that which Livy gives them, but for the most part 
no earlier than the generation before Livy (Varro and Valerius 
Antias), and never earlier than the third century B.c. (Fabius 
Pictor); for these writers would seem to have been the chief 
sources of Plutarch when he did not use Dionysius himself. Mac- 
aulay’s Lays of Ancient Rome cast some of the early Roman legends 
into popular poetical form. 
Convenient collections of extracts from the sources will be found 
in Botsford’s Story of Rome as the Greeks and Romans Tell It 
(N.Y., Macmillan, 1903) ; in Munro’s Source Book of Roman His- 
tory (Boston, Heath, 1904); and in Fling, Studies in European 
History, I, Greek and Roman Civilization (Chicago, Ainsworth).

INTRODUCTION 
Tuis field presents peculiar conditions. The period is 
so vast, so full of life and movement, that the historic 
picture must be drawn in free and bold outline, in clear 
perspective, and with strong emphasis upon striking per- 
sonages and events, if the young pupil is to retain any 
impression of it that is worth having. Covering a period 
of eleven hundred years, and the history not only of all 
the great powers except the United States and England, 
but also of that period of national expansion which 
brought Europe into the closest contact with the new 
world of the West and the old world of the East, it is 
occupied with large social and institutional movements, 
and with the complex questions of international politics. 
As compared with a national history, like that of England 
or of France, it is much more comprehensive; as com- 
pared with Ancient History, it is much more complex and 
involved. It is, therefore, a period of peculiar difficulty 
from the standpoint of the teacher. It is, nevertheless, 
important that an apprehension of the main features of 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
l 
118 Medieval aed Modern European History 
its life be possessed, because of their bearing upon all 
the affairs of the world. They are facts of which every 
person of the most ordinary education ought to know 
something. There is, therefore, a justification for plac- 
ing it in the secondary school curriculum ; and if placed 
there it should follow Ancient History, thus giving due 
emphasis to the sequence of development. 
The task of any teacher or of any guide through this 
labyrinth is one of simplification and coérdination of 
things that are seemingly diverse and divergent, but are 
really closely related. There is not at present any text- 
book at once simple and comprehensive and giving that 
thorough grasp of the subject which is essential to make 
the study of it really valuable. Those of Adams and 
Myers have some merits, but neither meets the demand 
for a guide at once simple and scholarly for second-year 
students in the high school. 
There are two methods of studying this field, each of 
which has its advocates, — one by grouping the study 
around the great movements which divide it into nat- 
ural periods, the other by the use of some national 
history, as that of France, for a central core. These 
methods are well discussed in the report of the Com- 
mittee of Seven, and it is not necessary to recapitulate 
the argument here. The former has the advantage 
of presenting a better perspective and a juster pro- 
portion; while the latter has the larger opportunity 
for detailed and connected treatment, and hence for 
enlisting the interest of the young student, always more 
readily attracted by concrete facts and the deeds of 
persons than by the discussion of movements so broad 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  Introduction 119 
as to seem abstract and lacking in personal interest; but 
it has the serious disadvantage of distorting the histori- 
cal perspective, a true sense of which is one of the most 
important ideas to acquire in this study. A way may 
be found, in the suggestions that follow, to overcome 
the common objections to a general treatment. If the 
specialized method is preferred, the syllabus may be 
used to the greatest advantage to avoid the danger just 
mentioned. 
It seems possible to combine to a certain extent the 
merits of both methods by means of a syllabus based in 
its general plan upon the large movements of medizeval 
and modern Europe; showing how the peculiar institu- 
tions of the former were related to those of antiquity, of 
which the student is supposed to have a knowledge; 
what great forces (Christianity and the Germanic peo- 
ples) caused the characteristic changes of the period ; 
and how in its shadowy recesses were forged the in- 
struments which opened new worlds and a new historic 
era. In the same way the pupil should be led to see 
the Reformation as something more than a debate over 
doctrines or a quarrel over church administration — as 
the outcome of the irrepressible conflict between the Ger- 
man and the Latin idea; he should have some idea of 
the significance of the growth of the idea of nationality 
with its profound influence on modern history, of what 
is meant by the balance of power and its use in Euro- 
_ pean politics; he should understand the changes pro- 
duced in the world by epoch-making inventions, the 
advance of industry revolutionizing life for millions of 
people, the effect of the opening of the new world upon
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 Mediaeval and Modern European History 
Europe itself; and finally the meaning and importance 
of modern democracy. These are some of the funda- 
mentals, the real things of human life, without which the 
history of medizeval and modern Europe might as well 
not be studied. The problem is how to put them before 
the boy of fourteen or fifteen so as to hold his interest 
and attention. This can be done by putting human 
interest into the study of each topic, and it seems possi- 
ble to accomplish this result by utilizing the biographi- 
cal element, or by putting in the foreground the 
nationality most prominent for the time being. 
Thus the first Otto is a striking and typical figure in 
the founding of the new medieval empire; Frederic 
Barbarossa may be taken as typical of flood-tide medi- 
zevalism, with some churchman risen from the ranks to 
illustrate the other great force of the Middle Ages. It 
is easy enough to find human interest in the Crusades. 
The human side of the Renaissance can be made real 
through carefully selected sources ; and in the Reforma- 
tion Luther and Zwingli, Calvin and Loyola, and others 
can be used each in his turn, to give to the study of the 
period an interest which a mere general narrative would 
not possess. Spain will appear as the nation of chief 
prominence in the era of discovery, and through Motley’s 
fascinating pages the pupil may be led to an understand- 
ing of the reasons for the decline of Spanish power. 
France, with Henry IV and Louis XIV, may head the 
line in the study of the growth of nationality, and the 
French Revolution brings that country to the front again 
in the study of the beginnings of modern democracy. 
It is possible to follow this idea from 800 A.D. to 1900,
-P-A-G-E-121
  Introduction 121 
bringing the larger lessons of elementary politics and 
society into close relation with the lives of individual 
men and peoples. 
In this connection the committee warmly recommends 
to teachers the perusal of Diesterweg’s article on “In- 
struction in History” in Stanley Hall’s “ Pedagogical 
Library,” Vol. I (Ginn, 1883). Diesterweg is in favor of 
insisting on the few culminating points of history and 
letting everything else go. His idea of the proper title 
for a text-book would be: ‘‘ Stories of the most remarka- 
ble events.” It is hopeless to strive for completeness in 
regard to matter and uniformity of detail, to attempt to 
“distil the labor of historical minds during fifty years 
into the concentrated experience of five hours.” “The 
reading of history,” Diesterweg goes on, “must be 
stataric (2.2. must revolve round fixed points) before we 
pass over to cursory reading.” And Diesterweg is only 
unhappy because in five hundred lessons he can teach 
so little of German history. Woe to us with the history 
of all Europe and one hundred and twenty lessons! 
Diesterweg’s conclusion that the first instruction in 
general European history should deal with “ culminat- 
ing points,” unquestionably suggests the proper method 
for first instruction in this most difficult subject, not to 
impart knowledge as if it came from an encyclopedia, a 
dictionary, or a table of contents, but to dwell on the 
points of the most far-reaching importance, those that 
are most dramatic, most interesting, and most familiar to 
cultivated persons in the world at large. Better that 
the pupil should read ten pages about the peace of 
Tilsit than all that the text-book has to say on the whole
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 Medieval and Modern European History 
period. In that way the boy will be introduced to the 
chief personages of the preceding campaigns, and his 
natural common sense will lead him to ask what monstrous 
defeats could have led to this cruellest of all treaties that 
France ever signed. A little oasis will have been formed 
in his mind from which he will be constantly and in- 
stinctively reclaiming more and more of the arid waste 
around. By this treatment it is possible to establish a 
number of little points of vantage from which the pupil 
can look around over the whole field. These are to be 
Ais topics, and all his life long he will be interested in 
adding to and readjusting his knowledge concerning 
them. Let him look back from the execution of Louis 
XVI to know what was happening in the months just 
preceding; let him be introduced to the struggle of the 
popes and emperors by reading at /ength of the dramatic 
scene at Canossa. This period of wonderful variety 
lends itself peculiarly well to such a picturesque, graphic 
treatment. In this lies its salvation as a school study. 
It is well understood that the residuum of actual knowl. 
edge left in the mind of the pupil is comparatively 
small. We can, from a judicious treatment of the 
period, leave strong and, as far as they go, correct im- 
pressions, which will be of great value in future reading 
and study and in the general understanding of civiliza- 
tion. With such incidental treatment and the use as 
illustrations of simple and easily appreciated extracts 
from contemporary accounts and significant documents, 
the pupil may come from the year’s work with some 
appreciation of what the Middle Ages mean in history, 
and we can ask for little more.
-P-A-G-E-123
Introduction 123 
Particularly in this second year of his course the boy 
should acquire considerable training in historical methods 
and ways of thinking, and should become familiar with 
a considerable amount of literature. He should learn 
to distinguish good, scholarly books from bad, super- 
ficial ones, and it should be pointed out to some extent 
how history books are written: that we have not merely 
been copying one from the other from the. days of 
Charlemagne down, but that large masses of absolutely 
contemporary evidence, even for periods as distant as 
that of Charlemagne, still exist, and are constantly being 
worked over anew. It is quite possible, even at this 
stage of instruction, to impart an appreciation of the 
fact that historical knowledge is advancing; that when 
legends like that of William Tell being the founder of 
Swiss independence are abandoned, it is on good grounds 
and on careful sifting of evidence. The pupil can also 
be shown how to handle books, how to find what he 
wants in the table of contents or in the index. In work- 
ing out his topics he can be taught how to select and to 
group his facts, as well as to express his results in con- 
cise and correct language. Above all, his imagination 
and his appreciation of what is really interesting and 
significant may be quickened, strengthened, and dis- 
ciplined. Remember his age and his natural interest 
in stirring episodes and in great men. The history of 
medizeval and modern times falls naturally into connec- 
tion with his ordinary reading, with Scott’s novels, 
and even with the Henty books. This connection 
should be constantly played upon, as also that with 
the ordinary geography lessons of this age. He is as 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
       124 Medieval and Modern European History 
  yet too young for a coherent, philosophical system of 
history. 
The Periods of European History. —In the grouping 
of subjects for this course, its special characteristics 
and difficulties of treatment have been kept in mind. 
Ten groups or periods have been made. These are 
to a certain extent chronological, but their motive is to 
be found in sequence of development rather than of 
time. They therefore frequently overlap each other. It 
will be noted that in the suggested division of time by 
exercises stress has been laid upon the modern period 
(since the beginning of the Reformation). This is done 
because it is as a rule easier to interest a class in those 
periods which can be constantly related to and illustrated 
from our modern life, and also because of the greater 
complexity of modern history and its increasing impor- 
tance. It is necessary, if the best results are to be 
attained, to consider especially the quality of interest in 
the teaching of history of that which is foreign and 
remote. 
In the first group, the Carolingian Empire and Rise of 
Feudalism, the pupil is brought face to face with that 
Germanic reorganization which wrought such great 
changes in the constitution of Europe, with the anarchy 
of the ninth century, and the adoption of a new system of 
society and law, rudely adapted to rude conditions. This 
is prefaced by introductory sections dealing with the rise 
of the Papacy and Empire, 325-800 a.p. These sec- 
tions may be omitted, or used only for a rapid review in 
those schools which carry the course in Ancient History 
through to 800 a.p. Close study of institutional details

is manifestly impossible for the secondary school pupil. 
A broad, general view of the structure of feudalism, and — 
an idea of Charles the Great and other dominating 
figures, together with a picture of the disorder of the 
ninth century, which enforced new adjustments, is as 
much as can be expected. The pupil may obtain a clear 
apprehension of the life of Europe in these stormy 
centuries from reading Scheffel’s “Ekkehard,” and 
the impression thus gained will be more valuable 
to him than much exact knowledge more painfully 
acquired. 
In the second group, a short time is found for noting 
the new imperial régime that followed the downfall of 
the Carolingians and the beginnings of the medieval 
church. In it the first Otto stands as the conspicuous 
and dominating figure. This is hardly more than a 
preface to this large group, in which the somewhat diffi- 
cult subject of the Empire and the Church, upon which 
all medizeval history hinges, is studied. The technical 
questions involved may be left out of consideration, as 
only.to be grasped by far older students, but Henry and 
Hildebrand and their associates may tell thetr own story 
in a way to vividly impress the pupil’s mind, and gradu- 
ally work out into true proportions if he pursues his 
studies in later years. Within the same group, the 
questions introduced in the preceding part find further 
illustration and development, and in Frederic Barba- 
rossa, Bernard, Frederick II, and a host of others, is 
ample material for a brilliant story picture, attractive to 
any young person, in which mediaeval Europe will be- 
come real in spite of himself.

  126 Medieval and Modern European History 
The Renaissance, important as it is, is, like most tran- 
" sition periods, somewhat intangible. It is best studied 
through its typical personalities, Dante, Petrarch, Boc- 
caccio, Savonarola, Macchiavelli, Erasmus, and many 
others, whose lives will readily suggest themselves as 
broadly illustrative of the period. If possible, its fun- 
damental, intellectual idea, and its relation to feudal 
Europe, the Church, and the Reformation, should be 
sufficiently developed to make its place in history and 
its contribution clear in a general way to the pupil. 
With the next group, the Protestant Revolution, we 
come to a period interesting, important, modern, and 
strongly human. It is very difficult, especially in public 
schools, to treat Reformation history in a way that will 
not give offence to the convictions of Protestants or of 
Roman Catholics. Is it out of place to suggest that the 
attitude of the teacher of history is one of strict im- 
partiality and rigid adherence to the established facts of 
history? The story may be simply told. The critical 
questions that have divided peoples are not to be threshed 
out in the secondary school. It is only the facts that 
made history that are the subject of school work. 
The effect of the Protestant Revolution and of race 
and geographical divisions, in emphasizing the spirit of 
nationality and bringing about the rise of modern 
nations (notice in this connection the peace of West- 
phalia and the German revolt against Swedish suprem- 
acy), advances our study rapidly into the widening field 
of international relations, and this suggestion is further 
developed in the eighth period, in which the wars of 
the eighteenth century, culminating in the Seven Years’
-P-A-G-E-127
   Introduction 127 
War, with its world-wide consequences, require careful 
study and will not puzzle the pupil overmuch. He will 
find delight in the campaigns of Marlborough, Eugéne, 
and Frederic, and will be glad to know what came from 
them when he knows how profoundly they affected the 
life of to-day. The growing solidarity of mankind, and 
the consequent complication of international relations, 
should be impressed in a simple way at this point, and 
the thread thus taken up may be followed with interest 
and profit. Time must be found also to indicate the 
direction of the great current of eighteenth-century 
thought. We cannot make our secondary school pupil 
a philosopher, but it will not be difficult to show him 
how rapidly the Western world moved toward new 
things during the years in which Voltaire and Rous- 
seau and the great German writers and thinkers 
flourished. 
The French Revolution, rich in graphic literature, 
intense, dramatic, and rapid in action, with its culmina- 
tion in Napoleon, is always an easy period to which to 
draw and hold the attention of a class, and from which 
to teach many important primary lessons in history and 
politics. 
It is to be hoped that the full allotment of time can 
be given to the study of the growth of nationality and 
democracy in the nineteenth century. The teacher 
should show here how all the great tendencies and 
movements have culminated and worked themselves out 
in this most recent period, out of which has come the 
life of to-day. The heritage from Charles the Great 
to William I or Victor Emmanuel II is not very difficult

to show after a year of graphic study on the lines here 
indicated. Throughout the year stress should continu- 
ally be laid upon culminating points, and the lives of 
typical men and women. An attempt has been made 
to suggest possibilities in this direction in connection 
with the different sections and topics.

It will be seen that this and the following section do not fall within the 
limits of the period under consideration (A.D. 800-1900), yet a knowledge of 
them is absolutely essential. Many teachers may prefer to impart this knowl- 
edge by an informal lecture or talk; and once more attention is called to the 
fact that an oral narrative sometimes gives the best possible supplementary 
material. Ora review may be made of sections 61, 65, and 66 of the Outline 
of Ancient History.

has also written a séries of excellent studies on Russia in

of Russia. Voltaire’s Charles XII is interesting and a 
classic in literature. Motley, Peter the Great. Schuyler, 
Peter the Great. Rambaud, History of Russia. Morfill, 
Story of Poland. For the first partition of Poland the 
best short account is that of Perkins, France under Louis 
XV, Ch. xxi (same article in American Historical Review, 
October, 1896). Frederick the Great, Reflections on the 
Character and Military Talents of Charles XII (Works, V, 
London, 1789). This is doubly interesting as showing 
what the greatest ruler of the eighteenth century thought 
of Charles XII, and also as giving an interesting side-light 
upon Frederick’s own character.

REMARK. — The histories of Napoleon and his time are innumerable ; the 
best short bibliography is that in Fournier's Napoleon the First, 745-788. 
This is also the most satisfactory biography of Napoleon for school purposes. 
Lanfrey’s history of Napoleon I (translated into English, 4 vols.) is the standard 
French biography, but is written in a spirit hostile to Napoleon. J. H. Rose's 
Life of Napoleon I (2 vols.) and W. M. Sloane’s Life of Napoleon Bonaparte 
(4 vols.) are the standard biographies in English; the latter is sumptuously 
illustrated, and is also accessible in the Century Magazine. Ropes’s The First 
Napoleon is rather a series of essays on special topics; military matters are 
better dealt with by him than any one else; it is written in a spirit very friendly 
to Napoleon ; teachers will therefore find it a suggestive exercise to have pupils 
compare the accounts of Lanfrey and Ropes. Seeley’s Napoleon the First is 
particularly valuable for its suggestiveness and for its philosophic analysis of 
Napoleon's rise and fall; it is better adapted for maturer students. Johnston's 
Napoleon is a brief but good sketch. 
The memoirs of Bourrienne, Ménéval, Pasquier, Rémusat, and Talleyrand 
have been translated into English. Special references to them may be found in 
Historical Sources in Schools, § 44.

Bonaparte was given the command; how he encour- 
aged his soldiers; how the French army differed from 
the Austrian and Sardinian armies ; battles of Lodi and 
Arcola; siege of Mantua; fate of Venice; treaty of 
Campo Formio, 1797; the Cisalpine Republic; Bona- 
parte’s reception on his return to Paris. 
6. The Egyptian expedition: its purposes and the causes 
of its failure; how it illustrates Bonaparte’s character 
and plans.

REMARK. — In the nineteenth century the nations of Europe have come into 
closer contact with each other, and their history becomes more and more inter- 
woven; this is partly the result of the introduction of railroads, steam vessels, 
the magnetic telegraph, and the daily newspaper. This fact has led some histo- 
rians (Robinson, Fyffe, and Phillips) to treat the nineteenth century chrono- 
logically, showing this close interrelation; this method is perhaps more scientific 
and scholarly, but also more difficult. It is simpler and easier for young stu- 
dents to follow the development of but one nation at a time. This topical 
method is the one followed in this outline; it is also that of Myers, Seignobos, 
and Andrews.

ENGLISH HISTORY 
  INTRODUCTION 
THE paramount interest in the study of the history of 
England is found in its constitutional aspect. It was 
in England that certain important governing principles 
were first realized in successful practice. Self-govern- 
ment, the ideas of representation and local control, were 
first tested by the English people, and to-day the Eng- 
lish constitution is more or less the model of all existing 
free constitutions. Moreover, the institutions of a people 
are the truest expression of national life and character, 
and their study affords the best training for the right 
understanding of present conditions. This is especially 
true of the study of English constitutional history. 
England’s constitution is the slow growth of many 
centuries, consequently it is more expressive of the 
character and development of the people than is that 
of any other nation. No broad gap separates Eng- 
land’s present from the past. From the fifth cen- 
tury until now there is no break; each step in the 
development is connected with the preceding. ‘There 
has been such a continuity of life and development that 
hardly one point in its earliest life can be touched with- 
out the awakening of some chord in the present; scarcely 
a movement now visible in the current of modern life 
air 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 English History 
but can be traced back with some distinctness to the 
early Middle Ages.” A national development, unbroken 
by great revolutions, and characterized by uniform and 
progressive growth, must bring home with unusual force 
the essential connection between the past and the pres- 
ent, the sense of organic unity. Precedent is the life 
and soul of the English constitution. How typical of 
this is the famous scene in Parliament in 1688. The 
king has fled; William and a foreign army are encamped 
near London; Ireland and Scotland are on the point of 
revolt. Parliament, summoned to face this situation, 
spends hours in unearthing and examining the four 
centuries-old records of Richard II’s deposition that 
revolution may be carried out with due regard to 
precedent. 
For these reasons stress should be laid upon the 
constitutional aspect of each period in English history. 
This forms the chief difficulty of the course, for institu- 
tions do not lend themselves to picturesque treatment ; 
the personal element is in abeyance, and the details are 
often obscure and complicated. Fortunately the con- 
tinuity of English development is of great service here. 
Since English constitutional history presents itself as an 
orderly, unbroken chain of events, each linked to each, 
the student is easily led to note the relation of cause 
and effect. Moreover, this closeness of connection be- 
tween the past and the present is full of picturesque 
suggestion. A party struggle of the nineteenth century 
has a new interest when we read that a leader who 
abandoned his side in a critical division is taunted by 
the newspapers with the treachery of his ancestor on
-P-A-G-E-213
Introduction Pie 
Bosworth Field; or when, in the debates over a fran- 
chise bill, the freedom of Saxon times is called to mind, 
and the constituencies are bidden to “look to the rock 
whence we were hewn, and the hole of the pit whence 
we were digged.” 
The simplicity and directness of England’s develop- 
ment constitute at the same time a great advantage and 
a serious danger. The work of instructor and student 
is much. easier because of the fact that there is but one 
thread to follow, because the English have worked out 
their history with far more independence of external 
influences than is true of any other European people. 
But just because English history is less interwoven with 
the general history of Europe there is danger in this 
course of losing sight of the essential unity of history. 
As Ranke truly says: “ There was but one church, one 
science, one art, in Europe; one and the same mental 
horizon enclosed the different people ; a romance and a 
poetry varying in form, yet of closely kindred nature, 
was the common possession of all. The common life of 
Europe flowed also in the veins of England.” In spite 
of this, English history is often taught and studied as 
though it had no more connection with the general 
development of Europe than with the life of the Amer- 
ican continent ten centuries ago. The Norman Con- 
quest is treated as though it were an isolated occurrence, 
and not simply one aspect, though the most important, 
of a great movement which profoundly affected Europe ; 
the discussion of the contest between Henry I and An- 
selm gives no hint of the larger controversy of a like 
nature which divided the continent.
-P-A-G-E-214
214 English History 
This most unhistorical detachment is especially marked 
in the ordinary treatment of France. As an English 
teacher has wittily said: ‘“‘The French kingdom comes 
into existence solely for the sake of being conquered 
by Edward III and Henry V and then sinks back into 
oblivion. It has a temporary resuscitation to enable 
Henry VIII to be present at the Field of the Cloth 
of Gold, and hibernates once again until Charles II 
requires the financial assistance of Louis XIV. After 
that comes another blank until the outbreak of the 
French Revolution; then after a fitful existence un- 
der Napoleon it finally expires with the battle of Water- 
loo.” It is true that the brief time allotted a course in 
English history affords small place for the teaching of 
contemporary history. But an occasional word of re- 
minder, where students have already had a course in 
European history, or, where this is not the case, a few 
brief summaries, will keep the class in mind of the larger 
history of which the story of England is merely a part. 
England's connection with the New World must not 
be overlocked. In the case of American students there 
is less danger of this, but the importance and dramatic 
interest of this subject claim for it especial attention. 
Another aspect of this course is more likely to be neg- 
lected. English history is often studied with entire dis- 
regard of Scotch and Irish history, and yet a knowledge 
of these is essential to the comprehension of the first. 
Moreover, each has its special value and interest, which 
must not be ignored. From time to time there should 
be a careful consideration of the state of Ireland or of 
Scotland, showing the course of development and the
-P-A-G-E-215
  Introduction 21 
forces at work. Especially should the interplay of 
influences between the different kingdoms be made 
plain. The points of contact between the different 
divisions of the British Isles in early history should be 
dealt with at length. 
While there is no sharp break in English history there 
are clearly defined divisions. The following outlines 
have been arranged with regard to the special signifi- 
cance of each period in the history of the English nation. 
Formerly it was said that English history began with the 
Norman Conquest. Then six centuries were added, and 
the tale began with the coming of the Angles and Sax- 
ons. Now, whatever the final decision as to the de- 
gree of Celtic survival or the importance of the Roman 
occupation, it is recognized that the beginning of Eng- 
land cannot be understood without some knowledge of 
the character of the country and of the people that 
the English conquered. The Celtic characteristics, the 
Roman influence, are essential elements in the story of 
the Conquest. : 
Following upon this comes the more detailed study of 
the Saxons, their characteristics and institutions, the new 
life now begun on British soil. The forces, whether in- 
ternal or external, making for union should be carefully 
considered. In the ninth and tenth centuries the social 
and ecclesiastical disorder resulting from the long contest 
with the Danes, the growth of feudal tendencies, and the 
superficial union of England under the West-Saxon kings 
are features to be noted. Also it should not be forgotten 
that from the withdrawal of the Romans to the eleventh 
century England’s international relations, forced or vol-
-P-A-G-E-216
    216 English History 
untary, were chiefly with the northern and backward 
portions of Europe. 
The Danish conquest and the reign of Cnut, followed 
by the hardly less foreign rule of Edward the Con- 
fessor, form a logical introduction to the Norman Con- 
quest. ‘Henceforth England might be conquered but 
not divided.” Between Senlac and the Treaty of Wall- 
ingford intervenes a period of extraordinary interest. 
Under Norman rule provincial distinctions are almost 
effaced, while class divisions are deepened and embit- 
tered through the presence of two races, one governing, 
the other governed. England is again united with the 
other states of western Europe, but is still free to work out 
the great medizval problems of the relation of church 
and state and of crown and nobles under her peculiar 
local conditions. To this period the reign of Henry II 
forms a fitting conclusion. Under the hard and equal 
rule of the Angevin, Norman and Saxon are welded to- 
gether to form the English nation. As representing two 
foreign policies, one doomed to failure because artificial, 
the other based on natural conditions, Henry’s efforts to 
build up an Anglo-Angevin empire, and the almost acci- 
dental beginning of the conquest of Ireland, should be 
clearly brought out. On the constitutional side, interest 
centres in the final success of the crown in the long 
struggle with the feudal baronage and in the development 
of the administrative machinery as the basis of a strong 
monarchy. The great issue between church and state is 
vividly shown in the contest between those two interest- 
ing personalities, Henry II and Archbishop Thomas, 
one facing forward, the other still looking backward. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  Introduction ZY, 
Following with dramatic swiftness upon the triumph 
of the king over the nobles comes the uprising of the 
new nation against the tyranny and misrule of John 
and Henry III. The century of Magna Carta and the 
Model Parliament is of paramount importance in its 
constitutional aspect; but a period which opens with 
the loss of Normandy and closes with an attempt to 
carry out the British idea, z.c. the union of the British 
Isles under one rule, is full of interest in its foreign 
policy. Nor should the architecture of the age be over. 
looked, for it is here that the creative spirit of the new 
nation finds splendid expression. 
During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the 
efforts of Edward III and Henry V to conquer France 
are of controlling interest; every phase of national life 
hinges on the Hundred Years’ War and its aftermath, 
the War of the Roses. The story of these struggles 
furnishes many stirring and picturesque incidents, and 
there is some danger of allowing them to obscure the 
great constitutional and social importance of the period. 
The growth of parliamentary government, the Lancas- 
trian experiment, the Yorkist despotism, are marked 
stages in the political growth of the English nation, 
paralleled on the social side by the steps which led to 
the disappearance of villeinage in the fifteenth century. 
The age of the Tudors forms a clearly defined period. 
The new monarchy, while holding down the people, 
holds it together, and makes possible the rapid growth 
which characterizes the century. The Renaissance, the 
Reformation, so far as it is a popular movement, the 
maritime and commercial development, are all expres-
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 English History 
sions of a national revival, having a counterpart only in 
the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries. At the same 
time, Scotland, under the influence of the Reformation, 
undergoes an extraordinary social transformation. The 
crisis of the century comes in the reign of the great 
queen, with the struggle of the English nation against 
the Spanish monarchy, a struggle for independence, not 
for empire. England’s foreign ambitions are shown in 
the revival of the British idea, in the drawing together 
of the northern and southern kingdoms, and in the com- 
pletion of the conquest of Ireland. 
With the seventeenth century the situation changes. 
The controlling force is the Puritan movement, Eng- 
land’s real religious reformation. The sympathetic des- 
potism of the Tudors gives place to the selfish and 
short-sighted tyranny of the Stuarts. On the other hand, 
the people, strengthened by the intellectual, religious, 
and economic development of the preceding hundred 
years, and disciplined in the hard school of Tudor rule, 
feel ready to take up the task of self-government. The 
inevitable political struggle, confused and intensified by 
religious division, ends in the Great Rebellion and the 
Commonwealth. This is a period rich in great men, 
and the various aspects of the contest may be made clear 
through a study of typical personalities more easily than 
in any other way. 
At the Restoration all that had been gained by a 
struggle of half a century seems lost; but underneath 
the reaction against Puritan rule is plain a determination 
to place definite checks upon the royal prerogative. 
The political situation is again confused by religious
-P-A-G-E-219
  
Introduction 219 
division, this time between a Roman Catholic ruler and a 
Protestant people. The beginnings of political parties 
should be carefully noted. Finally the Revolution of 
1688 secures to the nation all the liberties for which it 
is ready, aristocratic rule under parliamentary forms, 
and religious toleration. Throughout the whole century, 
as aresult rather of individual effort than of royal or 
national policy, a colonial and commercial empire is 
growing up in the East and in the West, whose impor- 
tance is realized only in the next period. 
The eighteenth-century contest with France for em- 
pire culminates in the great war with Napoleon, a con- 
test which Seeley has aptly named the “ Second Hundred 
Years’ War.” In politics, interest centres in the working 
out of the results of the Revolution with the development 
of party and cabinet government, broken only by the 
disastrous attempt of George III to revive the power 
of the king. The Acts of Union of 1707 and of 1800 
bring the British Isles at last under one rule; but while 
Scotland easily finds her place in the United Kingdom, 
the relations between England and Ireland show no 
improvement; the reasons for this difference should be 
considered. The importance of the industrial changes 
in the latter part of the period should be clearly brought 
out, although their full effects are not realized until the 
next century. 
In 1815 England emerges from the contest with 
France the foremost industrial and colonial power in 
the world. Industrial progress inevitably brings demo- 
cratic development, embodied in the Reform Acts of 
1832, 1867, and 1884-1885. Efforts to settle the Irish

question are summed up in a long series of Land Acts, 
and Coercion Acts, and Home Rule Bills, culminating 
in the great Land Act of 1903. Throughout the cen- 
tury the building up of the British Empire goes quietly 
forward, and the influence of Greater Britain is shown 
in the fact that foreign relations are determined chiefly 
by colonial and commercial interests.

AMERICAN HISTORY 
  INTRODUCTION 
American History in the last year of the high school 
demands somewhat different treatment from that of the 
previous courses, as has been suggested in the conclu- 
sion to the general introduction. The pupil is more 
familiar with the field both by previous study and be- 
cause it is his own country. He is within two or three 
years of citizenship and needs to know, not merely facts 
of development, but methods of government and his 
share in it. He is therefore ready because of interest, 
preparation, and obligation to examine somewhat more 
in detail special subjects, particularly those relating to 
government, its origin and methods of administration. 
The treatment in the accompanying syllabus recognizes 
this, and is somewhat less analytical and comprehensive 
in its topics than is the case in the previous courses in 
history. 
Furthermore, the field is more limited, and excellent 
text-books, like Channing’s “ Students’ History of the 
United States,” and McLaughlin’s “History of the 
American Nation,” give an excellent narrative and fur- 
nish a basis for more detailed study. The syllabus is 
therefore more free to mark out for especial empha- 
269
-P-A-G-E-270
  270 American History 
sis certain formative events, and to indicate topics 
that will call for comparison and other exercising of 
the judgment, and for the understanding of institutions 
and constitutional questions somewhat more fully than 
was possible in the other courses. 
The instruction in Civil Government, which should 
form a considerable part of the course in case there is 
no separate class in the subject, should seek to empha- 
size, not only development, but actual existing methods, 
the spirit as well as the letter of the Constitution. The 
boss, the machine, and the “third house” should be 
made as clear as the more formal phases of election and 
legislation. As these subjects are usually omitted in 
text-books on Civil Government, the teacher must be- 
come the main guide. An excellent way to furnish 
practical experience in government, and to arouse at 
the same time an interest in public questions, is to organ- 
ize in the school a Congress, similar, for example, to the 
Boston Young Men’s Congress. To accomplish its pur- 
pose it should be a permanent affair, and conducted 
strictly according to parliamentary rules. Visits to 
legislative bodies are of some assistance, but need to 
be repeated very frequently and intelligently supervised 
to convey much distinct information. 
In the detailed syllabus specific topics and references 
are given on this part of the subject; it is sufficient 
here to suggest such sections as 17 (Confederation and 
Constitution), 18 (Organization of the Government), 28 
(Political Reorganization), 37 (Political Problems); and 
current events: e.g. caucuses (September), conventions 
(October), elections (November and December), inaugu-
-P-A-G-E-271
Introduction 271 
rations (January), and proceedings of legislative bodies 
‘during most of the remaining months of the year, all of 
which furnish a basis for instruction in civics. For the 
whole subject Bryce’s ‘ American Commonwealth” is 
indispensable. 
The relation of American History to that of Europe 
and England should be given adequate attention and the 
pupil taught to see, both in colonial and national history, 
the factors outside this country that have helped in deter- 
mining events. This is briefly suggested in a subsequent 
“Characterization of Periods,” and more specific illus- 
trations will be found in the syllabus of topics and ref- 
erences: eg. sections 2 (European Conditions in the 
Fifteenth Century), 4 (Reasons in England for Early 
Failure and Later Success of Virginia), 10 (Dutch), 13 
(Second Hundred Years’ War), 23 (Napoleonic Wars). 
Wherever possible use should be made of the refer- 
ences in the syllabus of European or English History 
in order to utilize previous work in history. 
The importance of a knowledge of the geography of 
one’s own country in order to understand its history is 
happily too generally recognized to demand discussion.! 
There is in this course more time and opportunity than 
in the ‘early courses; ¢,g. the first period may well 
be treated geographically, colonial boundaries, lines of 
treaties, 1763, 1783, 1846; status of slavery, accessions 
of territory, area of succession, military campaigns, 
etc., areas of natural products, lines of transportation.

Graphic representations of facts not strictly geographi- 
cal will naturally come under this head. Inexpensive 
small outline maps, such as the Morse Company or the 
McKinley Company publish, permit of the pupils doing 
much of this work, and a few done each year on a large 
scale serve as a nucleus of a growing series of graphic 
illustration. The subject of geography and maps is 
treated in Channing and Hart “ Guide,” pp. 48-54. 
The Periods of American History.— An understanding 
of the growth of the American nation must rest upon 
study of the physical characteristics of the land which 
made it suitable for colonization and expansion. The 
character of the people and the reasons for discovery 
and exploration can be understood only by some study 
of European conditions in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries, which produced adventurers, but not founders 
of states in the new world, exploration but not perma- 
nent colonization. This first period is full of dramatic 
power and human interest; the oppressive monopoly of 
Spain was checked by England and Holland, and a way 
made for expansion of free institutions instead of abso- 
lutism ; but it is a period of preparation rather than of 
accomplishment on this side the Atlantic. 
But the scene changes with the opening of the seven- 
teenth century. A new Europe is now able to trans- 
plant itself toa new world. The sea rovers have done 
their work, the new ideas of Renaissance and Reforma- 
tion have won a foothold in Europe, and seek a wider 
and freer foothold for their logical development in a 
more untrammelled environment. The new generation, 
more numerous, better organized, and depending on
-P-A-G-E-273
  Introduction 273 
companies rather than on one man alone, more serious, 
successfully transfers to a virgin soil, not merely the best 
ideals of Europe, but many of her best leaders and ele- 
ments of population. In this period of successful col- 
onization the first group is the Southern Colonies. In 
the typical Southern colony, Virginia, after painful ex- 
periments and threatening extinction under the old 
adventurous ideas of the earlier period, the more sane 
and sturdy Englishmen of the seventeenth century de- 
velop permanent homes and population, and a consti- 
tutional government. 
Into the Puritan exodus to New England, our next 
group, enter some of the best elements in England, not 
merely a devotion to religious principle, but a sound 
and far-sighted statecraft which bases successful and 
populous colonies and federation on self-government 
and economic self-sufficiency. The history of New 
England is the history of the American nation in 
miniature. It is almost a biological study of the devel- 
opment of American institutions, for the original 
records are still preserved, and some of them are in 
print and accessible and adapted to the interest and 
powers of a high school pupil. In the story told by 
the founders themselves he almost sees before his eyes 
the growth of local self-government, expansion, repre- 
sentative institutions, written constitutions, indepen- 
dence, federation, public schools. 
The next group, the Middle Colonies, are the link 
between New England and the South, politically and 
economically, as well as geographically. New York 
and Pennsylvania are the typical colonies, and emphasis
-P-A-G-E-274
  274 American History 
of these two gives a clear-cut picture, and relieves of 
unimportant details by treating with these two the 
smaller and less formative colonies. In the failure of 
the Dutch feudal aristocrats and servants dependent 
on a far-removed commercial company and its agents, 
and in the success of the more self-governing English 
communities, are seen again steps which have made 
America what it is. The noble “Quaker Experiment 
in Government,” like the Puritan state, shows the 
successful transplanting of ideals across the Atlantic, 
but with a larger measure of tolerance and gentleness, 
two generations later, and under less difficult circum- 
stances. 
The fifth period, the colonies in the eighteenth cen- 
tury to 1760 (or between the revolutions of 1689 and 
1776), demands more time and thought than is ordi- 
narily given it, to bring out the significance of “this 
forgotten half-century,’ and show that ‘the colonies 
were not dormant, but were growing in strength and 
vigor and a capacity for self-government.” A study 
of the political and economic development, rather than 
a cataloguing of the quarrels with governors, brings out 
the significance of the growth of those “principles of 
government and of a social and economic system” 
for which the colonists stood so successfully in 1765 and 
1776. The period takes on dramatic interest and brings 
out the significant contrast in the results of two systems 
of colonization, as the self-governing, self-supporting 
communities of English homes and commonwealths 
come into conflict with the scattered camp-fires and 
trading posts of French and Indian, hampered and
-P-A-G-E-275
  
Introduction 275 
made dependent by French absolutism. The period 
takes on further significance as it is seen to be a part 
of the struggle for mastery of North America, between 
England and France, and at last of. the world-wide 
struggle of the Seven Years’ War. The significance 
of the struggle has been suggestively treated in Seeley’s 
“Expansion of England”; and parts of the masterly 
narrative of Parkman can hardly fail to stimulate inter- 
est and an appreciation of good historical literature in 
even the pupil who usually cares little for history. 
Having followed the separate development of the 
three groups of colonies to the close of the French and 
Indian War, it is necessary to pause before the Revolu- 
tion and “make a cross section,’ so as to observe, not 
merely growth, but also condition at one point of time. 
The contrasts in social and economic conditions and 
methods of government show the results of the varying 
environment and historical conditions previously studied, 
the diversity so important in the later development of 
the nation, and make a stimulating field for the exer- 
cise of powers of comparison and judgment. 
The sixth period shows the winning of independence 
and the development of union under pressure from 
without. The common institutions developed in all 
the colonies, and the fundamental differences between 
colonies and England in 1760, explain the inevitableness 
of revolution when George III tries to set the clock 
back, and with his subservient ministry to impose a 
vexatious control that violated the best things for 
which the best English blood on both sides of the 
ocean had stood. The Revolution is a contest between  
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 American History 
two conceptions of government and life, each with its 
brighter and darker side, and the study of the struggle 
from a genuinely historical point of view leaves the 
pupil with a broader, sounder patriotism. The details 
of military campaigns are passed over rapidly to leave 
him time to appreciate the justification of the object of 
the Revolution, and the obligation of the future citizen 
of service to the country won by such skill and devotion. 
But the Revolution had brought independence, not 
unity. As soon as the pressure from without is re- 
moved, the obstacles to union become apparent, while 
foreign nations eagerly await the speedy disruption of 
the country. The “Critical Period” from Yorktown 
to the inauguration of Washington shows the balance 
trembling between one nation and thirteen. It is a 
period when civil government and history go hand in 
hand, and the former takes an increased interest as its 
growth makes it seem a thing of life, and the Constitu- 
tion not a mere document but the embodiment of the 
best the English-speaking race had stood for. 
The carrying into execution of the ideas of the Con- 
stitution, the translation of words into acts, is the work 
of the Federalist party during its twelve years’ su- 
premacy (1789-1801). It is the period, also, of the 
establishment of a general foreign policy and of the 
organization of two great political parties. With 
the general lines of the country’s future policy marked 
out, the Federalists go down to defeat in the “ Revolu- 
tion of 1800,” and the advent of Jefferson marks a new 
period in American history. Enormous expansion, the 
gradual adoption by the Republicans of broad construc-
-P-A-G-E-277
   Introduction 277 
tion in spite of their theories, and the struggle for 
neutral rights mark this important period. 
The end of the War of 1812 and the fall of Napoleon 
bring domestic questions into prominence, and the period 
from 1817 to 1829 is one of reorganization after the 
disturbed conditions of the previous ten years. Its 
key-note is the development of the West with its social 
and economic results, its thrusting into prominence of 
the slavery question, and its great political triumph in 
the election of Andrew Jackson. 
From 1829 to 1844 National Democracy is in the 
saddle, and exhibits its power and abounding life as 
well as its incompetency and folly in questions of 
administration which demand training and _ insight. 
The country is already marked off into two sections, 
one half free, the other half slave; the early method 
of compromise has been carried on, but the South is 
being outstripped by the expansion of free labor, and 
is angered by the antislavery agitators of the North. 
The next period, 1844-1859, marks the desperate 
attempt of the South to gain new territory for slavery, 
first by an unjustifiable war with Mexico, and then by 
breaking down the policy of compromise which had 
obtained for thirty years. It is a period of rapid devel- 
opment, that stirs the blood till one is prepared for the 
crisis when the strongest feelings of the two sections are 
at white heat. The growing opposition to the further 
extension of slavery has taken practical form in the 
Republican party, and the triumph of Lincoln over the 
broken ranks of the Democracy marks the climax of 
this dramatic period.     
   
                 
         
-P-A-G-E-278
            278 American History 
It is no longer a question of slavery in the territories, 
but of the Union; and the principles of free labor, diversi- 
fied industries, development, and nationality triumph over 
slavery, narrow economic life, and sectionalism. The 
pupil will not remember military detail, but he can be 
led to understand the general strategy of the war, and 
will admire the heroic sacrifices of both sides in the field 
and in the home, since both are his fellow-countrymen. 
All wars are disturbers of existing conditions; and 
this is particularly true of a civil war over a funda- 
mental constitutional and economic question. The 
period since 1865 has been almost entirely concerned 
with the solution of the problems growing out of the 
civil war: The restoration of the Southern states to 
their proper place in the Union, the reéstablishment of 
a sound financial system, the adjustment of business te 
the conditions of peace, the future of the negro, and the 
economic reorganization of the South are some of the 
questions that have pressed for solution. 
If the plain facts have told their own stirring story, 
the pupil has learned something of his national govern- 
ment and howit has come to be. Its future is in his own 
hands.

14. CONDITION OF THE COLONIES IN 1760 (OR 1765), POLITI- 
CAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC; COMPARISONS BETWEEN 
THE THREE SECTIONS. 
“Between them [the New England colonies] and Virginia was the contest 
for supremacy, while the great Middle colonies held the balance; and the his- 
tory of that conflict of ideas is the history of the United States " (Lodge, Colo- 
nies, 475). This suggestive sentence may stimulate discriminating discussion. 
a. Economic Conditions. 
(1) In the Southern colonies (Virginia, the typical 
colony): occupations; means of communication.

xiv. Eggleston, in Century Magazine, 1883-1885 
(illustrated) ; see especially Vol. 27, “ Husbandry.” + 
(2) Contrast between economic conditions in the 
South and in New England. Compare accounts in the 
preceding sub-topic with Lodge, Colonies, in Ch. 
xxii. See also Fiske, Old Virginia, II, 29-35. De- 
tails may be found in Weeden, Economic and Social 
History of New England, 2 vols.; and in Bruce, Eco- 
nomic History of Virginia in the Eighteenth Century, 
2 vols. 
(3) Comparison between economic conditions in 
New England and the Middle colonies. (Pennsyl-

8. Social conditions. 
(1) In Southern colonies: classes; slavery; planta- 
tion life; religion, churches, and church services; 
education; amusements. (Virginia, typical colony.)

15. CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 1760-1783. 
a. Underlying causes of the Revolution: fundamental dif- 
ference in ideas and conditions between England and 
the colonies in 1760. 
(1) In social conditions (including religion). 
(2) In economic conditions. 
(3) In political ideas and conditions: two kinds of 
“representation”; the English view as to the govern- 
ment of the colonies; the view in the colonies —ex- 
amples in the Writs of Assistance and the Parson’s 
Cause. 
Brief Accounts: Channing, United States of America, 
1765-1865, 25-40. (This portion and the whole “book

read: (1) Lecky, American Revolution (being chapters

  322 American History 
from his History of England in the 18th Century), 38- 
52, for a discriminating view of the political and com- 
mercial relations between colonies and mother country ; 
(2) Trevelyan, American Revolution, Part I, 44-99, 
for a brilliant picture of the contrast between life in 
England and America, very appreciative of the American 
ideals. .Otis’s arguments in connection with the Writs 
of Assistance and Patrick Henry’s in the Parson’s Cause 
may serve as examples of the American theory: well 
treated in Channing, Student’s History, and his U.S. A., 
1765-1865 ; Parson’s Cause, more fully in Tyler’s Patrick 
Henry, Ch. iv; Otis on Writs of Assistance, American

APPENDIX 
A List or Some American LIBRARIES CONTAINING SPECIAL 
Contecrions oF HisrorIcAL MATERIAL SERVICEABLE TO 
TEACHERS OF HisTORY 
Prepared by Lucy MAyNarpD SALMon, Professor of History, and ADELAIDE 
UNDERHILL, Reference Librarian, and Cataloguer, Vassar College, 
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
The information contained in the following list has been sought 
through blanks sent to fifty libraries that apparently have unusual facilities 
for historical study. The libraries were selected from “Notes on Special 
Collections in American Libraries,” prepared in 1892 by Mr. W. C. Lane 
and Mr. C. K. Bolton, supplemented by the lists contained in the “ Libra- 
ries of Greater New York” issued by the New York Library Club in 1902, 
and by personal information. In a few cases no replies were received 
from the libraries from which information was asked, and in a few others 
the replies were so general as not to be serviceable. In some instances 
where no direct information was received from the libraries themselves, 
facts in regard to their equipment were obtained from university cata- 
logues. These statements are made to explain the noticeable gaps that 
appear in the list. 
The libraries selected are for the most part connected with universities, 
colleges, and state historical societies. College and university libraries are 
usually strong in collections of public documents, both American and Euro- 
pean. They have also often been made the repositories of collections 
on special subjects made by those actively interested. Johns Hopkins 
University, for example, has the collection of works on slavery and the 
negro race made by General William Birney, and Cornell has the price- 
less collection of works on the French Revolution and the Protestant 
Reformation collected by ex-President-Andrew D. White. The libraries 
of state historical societies usually contain quite complete collections of 
works on state and local history, genealogy and biography, and of the 
361
-P-A-G-E-362
  362 Appendix 
newspapers of the state. They often also make a specialty of the his- 
tory of the section in which they are located; the State Historical Soci- 
ety of Virginia, for example, gives particular attention to the history of 
the South. They are also strong in the publications of other historical 
societies. Several collections have been included that are numerically 
small but of great importance on account of their character. The Charle- 
magne Tower collection of 942 volumes of colonial laws is of greater value 
than collections numerically larger but duplicated in many libraries. 
A number of libraries in the list are not open to the public, but permis- 
sion to use them may, as a rule, be obtained by students properly intro- 
duced. It has not been intended to include in the list the name of any 
library where this permission would be refused. 
It has been difficult to prepare a statement in regard to special collec- 
tions of historical material that would be serviceable to teachers of history, 
and that would be at the same time one at which special students of his- 
tory would not look askance because of its incompleteness. But it is 
hoped that this attempt may prove of some slight service until it is super- 
seded by a more exhaustive study of the subject. 
It would not have been possible to send out this list without the codp- 
eration of the librarians that have given their assistance. To our own 
gratitude for this assistance must be added that of those who may find the 
list useful.

  PREFACE 
This book is the outgrowth of the author’s experience in 
teaching educational psychology during the past seven years. 
It is an attempt to present in outline form the leading facts and 
problems of educational psychology that are of vital impor- 
tance in teaching. The material is chosen and organized from 
the point of view of the student who is just beginning to pre- 
pare for teaching as a profession. This means that the 
facts and principles are presented in terms of the classroom 
experience of the teacher in the public schools. 
This work is planned so that it may be used either as a 
syllabus in connection with any elementary textbook in edu- 
cational psychology or as an outline of the course in place of 
a text. E 
The references for reading are given at the beginning of 
each chapter. In general, these references include the 
standard works that give the most adequate treatment of the 
topics under discussion. Preference is given to the newer 
books that are generally available in the libraries of colleges 
and normal schools. The lists of readings are by no means 
complete, but should be supplemented by other references 
that the teacher may recommend. The author has been 
governed in his choice by the library facilities available to his 
own classes. It is not expected that every student read all 
the references, but that all the students will read some of 
them. 
Following the outline of each chapter there is a group of 
problems. These problems are a necessary part of the work 
of the student. They are chosen to illustrate the principles 
set forth in the chapter and to supplement and complete the 
development of many of the topics suggested in the outline. 
No chapter is complete without a full discussion of the 
problems.

  6 Preface 
The author suggests that the students keep their notes 
on the classroom discussions on the blank pages provided; 
but write out their discussions of the problems and hand them 
in to their instructor for careful criticism. 
The author wishes to express his indebtedness to the many 
writers in the field of psychology, especially those whose works 
are included in the reference lists. He is especially indebted 
to Professors W. H. Pyle and E. L. Thorndike for information 
and inspiration.

1. The two persistent problems in education are: (1) What 
to teach; and (2) How to teach. 
(a) In different periods of history the emphasis has been 
first upon one and then upon the other of these problems. 
(b) A science of education must put proper emphasis upon 
both problems.

2. Education and Psychology 
Education is the process of improving responses to given 
situations. 
(a) This process involves working changes in the nervous 
system. 
(6) “Improvement”? from the biological point of view 
means greater speed, accuracy, and ease in the response. 
From the social viewpoint it means changing the 
response so that it is in harmony with social ideals. 
. Psychology has been defined in many ways. The follow- 
ing definitions are representative of the leading points of 
view that have been held by psychologists: (1) Psychology 
is the science of the soul; (2) Psychology is the science of 
the mind; (3) Psychology is the science of consciousness; 
(4) Psychology is the science of behavior; (5) Psychology 
is the science of consciousness and behavior. 
(a) It furnishes the facts about the nature of children 
and the principles governing the learning process which 
are essential to education. 
(b) The solution of the problem of how to teach is depend- 
ent upon a knowledge of the learning process. Teach- 
ing is helping the pupil to appreciate and control the 
values of life. 
. Educational psychology is that branch of psychology which 
undertakes to organize and explain the factors involved in 
learning and to apply them to education. 
(a) It is not within the scope of educational psychology to 
determine what to teach. This problem can be solved 
only through a knowledge of the ideals and purposes 
of society as revealed by a study of the social sciences.

(b) Educational psychology. undertakes to lay the founda- 
tion for the solution of the problem of how to teach. 
PROBLEMS 
As a high school student, for which did you feel the greater 
need: better teaching or better subject-matter? 
. On what basis do you judge the value of the content of your 
high school course? 
. Name six things that you do frequently in which you see a 
need of improvement. 
. Compare the improvement in doing things you have learned 
in school with the improvement in things learned out of 
school. For example, playing tennis with working algebra 
problems. 
. Criticise each of the definitions of Psychology given above. 
. Name four things you expect to get from the study of 
Educational Psychology that will help you as a teacher. 
. How can a teacher know what responses should be 
developed? 
. Name five instances in which improvement depends on 
breaking down responses instead of developing them.

1. Development is one of the fundamental ideas that govern 
modern thinking. 
(a) In the field of science this is expressed in the doctrine 
of evolution. 
(b) In common, every-day, experience this idea is expressed 
by such terms as “progress” and “growth.” 
(c) All sciences have become dynamic, growing sciences. 
They are no longer concerned chiefly with the dis- 
covery and classification of facts; but seek to discover

Mental and Physical Development 
the laws and principles that explain tendencies and 
movements and the forces that are working in the 
world. 
(d) Education is essentially a process of growing. 
. Mental development is dependent upon physical develop- 
ment. : 
(a) The most important relationship between the mind 
and the body is that between the mind and the nervous 
system. 
(6) In general the more complex the nervous system is, 
the greater the possibility of mental growth. 
. The term “mind” is here used as meaning the functioning 
of the nervous system which involves or may involve 
cerebral activity. 
(a) This relationship of mind to brain is analogous to the 
relation between a moving object and its motion, or 
to the relation between a bar of iron and its weight. 
(b) The separation of mind and brain is an abstraction. 
That is, you may think of them as being separate, but 
you cannot actually separate them. 
. The mind is the sum total of one’s conscious experiences, 
both actual and potential. 
(a) The actual conscious experiences are those of which 
one is aware at any given time.  
-P-A-G-E-15
  
Teacher’s Notes
-P-A-G-E-16
18 Mental and Physcial Development 
(b) The potential conscious experiences are those that may 
be ‘‘called to mind” through the association of ideas 
and memory. For example, two people may be asked 
the significance of the year 1763. One may at once 
have come into consciousness ideas about the close 
of the Seven Years’ War, while the other one, being 
wholly ignorant of history, would have no such ideas. 
These ideas were a part of the mind of the first person, 
even before they were brought back into consciousness. 
They were not a part of the mind of the person who 
knew no history. 
5. The development of the mind is dependent directly upon 
the development of the brain. 
(a) 
(0) 
(c) The brain can have full normal development only 
through the normal development of the whole body. 
The development and functioning of the sense organs 
is of special importance to brain development. 
All knowledge of the world comes through the sense 
organs.: Without the senses there is no sense. 
6. The importance for education of a sound body should be 
fully appreciated by every teacher. 
(a) Good light, heat, ventilation, and comfortable seats 
are as valuable as good teachers, good books, and 
good apparatus.

  Mental and Physcial Development 
(b) The teacher should appreciate the importance of 
detecting and correcting defective vision, hearing, 
and other sensory and physical defects. 
(c) A teacher should know the value of good general 
health and how to develop it. 
PROBLEMS 
. If physical development is a condition of mental develop- 
ment how can you explain the fact that many people with 
weak and deformed bodies have great minds? 
e 
. How do you account for the fact that many good athletes 
are very poor students? 
. What pupils should have the most physical training? 
. How can a person born blind learn about color? How 
does his knowledge of color differ from that of people with 
normal vision? 
. If a person could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel, how 
could he learn anything? 
. How do you get ideas of such things as goodness, honor, 
or space? 
. How do the motor and association centers of the brain 
aid in learning? 
. If a child needs eye-glasses and his parents refuse to 
buy them, what should the teacher do about it? 
. If the state compels a child to attend school should it 
also compel parents to have a child’s adenoids and 
defective tonsils removed when advised by a competent 
physician?

10. If the state furnishes free textbooks, should it also furnish 
free food? 
11. Try to formulate a principle to guide in deciding just 
how far the state can justly go in assuring good physical 
development to every child. 
12. Try to find out what physical defects you have that 
interfere with your mental development.

1. The possibility of development depends on a condition of 
incompleteness or immaturity. 
(a) As a condition of growth, immaturity is a positive 
factor of great value. 
(b) A normal child is immature not because he lacks some- 
thing, but because of the plastic condition of the nervous 
system.

  Period of Infancy 
2. Plasticity is the outstanding characteristic of the period of 
infancy. 
(a) Plasticity is that quality of the nervous system of a 
1) child which makes it yield to stimuli, but not yield all 
at once. 
One may continue to learn so long as his nervous system 
is plastic, but learning becomes more difficult after the 
age of 25 or 30. But the period of learning is much 
longer than commonly supposed. 
3. In terms of plasticity there are three types of responses. 
() 
(0) To a given stimulus the organism may react with a 
ready-made, well-organized response. For example: 
A chick will peck at a little red bug with a high degree 
of accuracy the first time it makes the attempt. In 
this case the chick is not plastic. It yields to the 
stimulus, but yields at once. 
To a given stimulus an organism may at first react with 
an unorganized, and indefinite, response, which grad- 
ually becomes organized and definite through repetition. 
A baby six months old may respond to the stimulus 
“a little red bug” in a great many ways. He may 
ery, or reach for the bug, or mash it with his hand, or 
put it in his mouth. After years he may learn to 
respond to the “little red bug” by calling to mind a 
large group of biological facts about the bug. The 
nervous system of the child is plastic. He responds to 
the stimulus, but at first, in an indefinite, unorganized 
way. Gradually the response becomes organized and 
definite.
-P-A-G-E-25
  
Teacher's Notes 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  
  28 Period of Infancy 
(c) To a given stimulus an organism may react with a 
wholly random and irrelevant response which does not 
improve with practice. For example, to the stimulus 
“(X + Y)? = ” a dog may respond with barking or 
scratching, or running to and fro, but it will never 
respond with any movements involving a knowledge 
of the expansion of a binomial. The dog is not plastic 
as regards learning algebra. 
4. The physical basis of plasticity is a nervous system with 
relatively few ready-made connections, but with a great 
number of possible connections. 
(a) The lower animals have relatively a greater number of 
inherited, well-organized connections but fewer possible 
connections than the human infant. 
(b) The superiority of the human infant in the number of 
potential connections in his nervous system accounts _ 
for his greater ability to learn. 
(c) The apparent helplessness of the human infant is in 
fact his greatest source of power for learning. 
(d) Other things being equal, the longer the period of 
infancy the greater the native intelligence. 
PROBLEMS 
1. Why is it necessary for a person to begin to study music 
early in life in order to become highly skilled as a musician? 
2. The adult idiot has about the same intelligence as the 
normal three-year old child. Explain the difference 
between the arrested development of idiot and the 
immaturity of the child.

10. 
  Period of Infancy 
Should education undertake to prolong the plastic period? 
If a child walks and talks at an unusually early age, is it 
evidence of superior intelligence? 
In solving a mechanical puzzle two children made the 
following records: Child A: Ist. trial, 10 minutes; 2nd. 
trial 7 minutes; 3rd. trial, 8 minutes; Child B: Ist. trial, 
20 minutes; 2nd. trial, 9 minutes; 3rd. trial, 2 minutes. 
Which child was the more plastic? Why? 
Suggest some qualities of the nervous system other than 
plasticity that are important in learning. 
Is slowness in learning evidence of plasticity? 
. What is the relation of plasticity to speed in learning? 
Does an infant dog learn faster than a human infant? 
Why does learning become slower with increase in age?

(e) Original Nature 
Mental heredity is a term applied to the resemblance 
of the mental traits of the offspring to his ancestry. 
In so far as it applies strictly to heredity it means 
nothing more than the physical inheritance of the 
nervous system and certain glands that affect 
consciousness. 
Social heredity is, strictly speaking, not heredity at all. 
2. There are three general classes of original responses. 
(a) 
(0) 
(©) Reflexes are the least complex in nervous structure and 
the most definite in response of the original tendencies. 
They are little affected by education. For example: 
sneezing, coughing, batting the eye-lid. 
Instincts are more complex in nervous structure than 
the reflexes and less definite in response. They may be 
greatly modified by education, but rarely inhibited 
entirely. For example: fighting, mating, parental 
behavior. 
Origi: abilities are the most complex in nervous 
structure and least definite in response of the original 
tendencies. They are so greatly affected by education 
that they may never function without training. For 
example: the ability to talk, or to learn mathematics, 
or play a violin, or write poetry. 
8. There can be no clear and definite separation of these three 
classes of original responses. 
(a) The early influence of learning makes it difficult to 
classify a particular response. For example: eating.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
Teacher's Notes 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  36 Original Nature 
(b) Only the more decidedly different responses can be 
unmistakably distinguished, as sneezing and fighting, 
or fighting and writing poetry. 
(c) The classification is helpful in that it throws light on the 
nature of the original tendencies. 
4, Education cannot be successful without taking into account 
certain facts learned from the study of heredity. 
(a) Human beings are more alike than they are different. 
This is the basis of successful class organization and 
teaching. 
(6) Small individual differences are of great importance. 
Social progress depends largely upon the way in which 
children of slightly inferior or superior original ability 
are treated in school. 
(c) Education can never make a genius out of a born 
imbecile, but it may save him from becoming a social 
delinquent. On the other hand the born genius may 
be crushed into mediocrity by wrong education. 
(d) Three things education must do: (1) Save as many as 
possible of the subnormal from becoming social 
burdens; (2) Give normal children the opportunity 
for natural and healthy development; (3) Give the 
superior child opportunity to develop to his full 
ability. 
5. The question of the elimination of the physically and 
mentally unfit is not within the scope of psychology. 
(a) This question must be decided in the field of social 
science.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
Teacher’s Notes
-P-A-G-E-36
38 Original Nature 
(6) There is much useful work that can be done by people 
of low-grade intelligence, who will do it more cheerfully 
and happily than those of normal intelligence. For 
example: cleaning streets, or hauling garbage. 
(c) The contribution to society of some one who is physi- 
cally defective may be greater than that of thousands 
of physically normal individuals. For example: one 
hunchback may give to the world more than all the 
pugilists of his generation. 
PROBLEMS 
. Make a list of the facts about the heredity of a child that 
would be helpful to his teacher. 
Try to work out a practical plan for getting such infor- 
mation. 
» Point out the difficulties of making use of a knowledge of 
the laws of heredity in actual teaching. 
Name examples of the inheritance of traits or physical 
characteristics that have a bearing on the education of the 
persons concerned. 
Which individual is better fitted for parent-hood, the one 
who is physically defective but of superior intelligence, or 
the one physically normal but of low normal intelligence? 
. If a boy who has strong interest in medicine belongs to a 
family that has produced many successful lawyers, should 
he be advised to study law or medicine? Why? 
. In what respects do boys and girls differ in original nature 
because of sex difference? 
. Is co-education wise? At what ages? Why?

1. The term “instinctive behavior” is used to describe all the 
relatively definite and complex forms of inherited response 
to definite stimuli. 
(a) Instincts are so easily modified by training that it is 
difficult to define them in unmistakable terms. 
(b) The differences among investigators and writers in the 
enumeration and classification of instincts grow out 
of this fact that instincts are so greatly affected by 
training. :

1) Instinctive and Emotional Behavior 
A good working definition is: an instinct is a relatively 
definite and complex inherited response to a definite 
stimulus. 
. 2. Instincts are transitory. 
(@) 
(0) 
0) 
@) Instincts are dependent upon the physical structure 
of the organism. 
They are, therefore, all potentially present in the 
germ plasm. 
They gradually develop, function for a time with 
maximum activity, then gradually decline. 
Some instincts, such as suckling, have reached a high 
plane of activity at birth. They are the dominant 
activities of early infancy, but gradually become 
overshadowed in importance by other instincts that 
develop more slowly. However, they persist, though 
less active, even through old age. 
3. Instincts are said to be periodic. 
(a) 
(0) Many instincts, as mating or migration, are seasonal. 
They wax and wane and wax again in activity. 
This general fact of periodicity is better explained as 
recurring changes in the stimulus, frequently involving 
internal bodily changes as well as external environ- 
mental changes, than by assuming that the response 
itself is periodic,
-P-A-G-E-43
  Teacher’s Notes 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
46 
  Instinctive and Emotional Behavior 
4. Instincts tend to become specialized. 
(a) 
) When the organism reaches the stage of development 
in which a given instinct is ready to function, it may be 
called into activity by any one of a number of similar 
stimuli; but having been the response to one particular 
stimulus it is more likely to follow that stimulus the 
second time than any other, provided the result is 
satisfying. 
In some cases, after an instinctive response has been 
evoked repeatedly by one particular stimulus, it can 
then be evoked by no other stimulus. For example: 
a chick following a particular moving object; or a baby 
nursing a particular type of bottle; or mating among

(0) Emotions are so easily modified by training that 
it is often difficult to discover the purely inherited ele- 
ments in emotional response. 
While instincts are essentially the functioning of definite 
organized connections in the nervous system, emotions 
are the expression of conflicts in tendencies to respond, 
due to lack of definite organization in the nervous 
system. 
If the conflicts in tendencies to respond can be removed 
by the development of a definite reorganization of the 
nervous system, the emotion vanishes.

6. The nature of the emotion depends upon the nature of the 
tendencies to act that are in conflict. 
(a) 
(0) 
) 
@ If the instinctive fighting responses are in conflict, the 
emotion that arises is anger. The successful fighter 
with a well-organized attack, who is not checked by his 
opponent does not become angry. The affective tone 
of his activity is highly pleasurable. 
If the instinctive protective responses, such as crouch- 
ing, hiding, running to cover, watching the exciting 
object, are in conflict, then the emotion that arises is 
fear. A person running from a mad dog not only runs 
instinctively, but instinctively turns back to watch 
the dog. When these two tendencies come into 
play at the same time a “wave of fear’”’ sweeps over the 
person. 
All other emotions, as remorse, joy, pity, are due to 
conflicts in definite groups of tendencies to act. 
Emotions are quite distinct from the normal satisfying 
affective tone of instinctive behavior. Emotions are 
essentially annoying in affective tone. This is true 
to a marked degree if the emotional condition is 
prolonged.

nature of instinctive and emotional behavior.

Make a list of instinctive acts you perform frequently and 
point out in what respect these acts are modified by 
training. 
. Write down as many different definitions of instinct as 
you can find and try to classify them. 
It is said that if an instinct is inhibited at the time most 
favorable for its functioning that it will reappear later in a 
perverted form. Collect evidence to prove or disprove 
this statement. 
. Explain what is meant by saying instincts are transitory. 
Then show how these facts should be used in teaching. 
Suggest four ways in which periodic instincts could be used 
effectively in school work. 
How do you account for the fact that certain games are 
more prevalent at one time of the year than another? 
For example, playing marbles, spinning tops, baseball. 
What is the educational problem that grows out of the 
fact that instincts tend to become specialized? 
Point out the limitations of the recapitulation theory as 
a guide to the teacher in dealing with the instinctive 
development of a child.

1. The non-social instincts may be described as those which 
function to adjust the individual to his environment with- 
out reference to the welfare of others or his dependence 
upon them. 
(a) Some non-social instincts are responses primarily to 
the physical environment. For example, food-getting. 
(6) Other non-social instincts are responses to other 
individuals, but do not function for the welfare of 
others. For example, teasing. . 
(c) The non-social instincts of special importance to edu- 
cation are: (1) migration, (2) collecting, (3) fighting.

2. Migration is the tendency to respond to an annoying envi- 
ronment by moving out of it. 
(a) 
(0) 
1) 
(a) This tendency is relatively stronger in boys than in 
girls. Girls endure irksome physical and_ social 
conditions that drive boys out. Runaways and truants 
are much more frequently boys than girls. 
The school environment is more likely to be annoying 
and evoke the ‘‘moving out’’ response in the case of 
the dull, backward, and physically under-developed 
children than in the case of normal children. 
Migration in the form of truancy is due largely to 
dislike of school and to a desire to be out of doors. 
Dislike of school is due to inability to do the work and 
the desire for out of doors is fundamentally a need for 
more fresh air for under-developed lungs. Truants 
are generally under-sized and with low vital index. 
The school work should be within the ability of the 
pupil and related to his interests. Adequate physical 
training and occasional trips taking the school out of 
the building will do more to overcome truancy than a 
truant officer. 
8. Collecting is the tendency to respond to attractive objects 
by gathering them together and hoarding them. 
(a) This instinct is probably related to food-getting. 
In lower animals and sometimes in man it becomes 
specialized as regards food.

  Non-social Instincts 
Collecting is almost a universal instinct. Few people 
have not made one or more collections. Amassing 
fortunes, filling museums, collecting libraries are 
common expressions of this instinct; but it may become 
specialized as regards almost anything. Birds’ eggs, 
stamps, tobacco tags, marbles, paper-dolls are but a few 
of the numberless things that children and adults collect. 
The school should make great use of the collecting 
instinct. 
. Fighting is essentially an instinctive tendency to respond 
to interference or opposition with resistance. 
(a) 
1) 
(©) 
@) Historically, this instinct has played a great part in 
the development of civilization. 
The fact that the emotion of anger so generally 
accompanies the fighting instinct makes it difficult to 
distinguish the two types of behavior. Bothare accom- 
panied by, or involve as part of them, certain marked 
bodily changes, such as increase in the activity of 
certain glands, rapid breathing, increased circulation 
of the blood, a general tenseness of the muscles. 
Successful fighting tends to dissipate anger. Fighting 
without anger is usually more effective than with it, 
but there is frequently a feeling that the opposite is 
true. 
The fighting instinct can and should be directed along 
social rather than anti-social lines. Children should 
be trained to fight for the rights of others rather than 
for their own; to fight with ideas rather than with 
fists and weapons.

PROBLEMS 
1. Truancy is more common in the spring than in the fall 
and winter. What is the explanation for this and what 
should be done about it? 
2. In some schools the children are frequently taken on trips 
to local places of interest, such as the city light plant, 
water-works, or flour mill. Some people think this is a 
waste of time and a detriment to the work of the school. 
Gather evidence on this point and state what conclusion 
you reach.   3. A certain thirteen year old boy in the fifth grade is dull 
in his school work, smaller than the average boys of his 
age, relatively inactive on the playground. He frequently 
plays truant and spends his time loafing around a radio 
shop. What should be done in his case? 
4. In a certain consolidated school the children have been 
working for three years on collecting specimens of the plant 
and animal life of the community for a school museum. 
All available space is now taken. Suggest a plan for 
further use of the collecting instinct. 
5. Work out a practical plan for the use of the collecting 
instinct in the grade school which you attended. 
6. A certain boy habitually teased and bullied the smaller 
boys. One day, at the suggestion of one of the older 
boys, three of the little fellows made a surprise attack 
on the bully and whipped him. Fighting was against the 
rules of the school. How should the case have been 
handled by the principal?

  Social Instincts 
The social instincts of special importance in education 
are (1) gregariousness, (2) kindliness, (8) display, and 
(4) the mating instinct. 
2. Gregariousness is the tendency to seek the companionship 
of one’s own kind. 
(a) 
(0) 
(°) 
(d) The earliest manifestation of this instinct is satisfaction 
shown by babies at the presence of other human beings, 
especially little children or other babies. As early as 
the fifth or sixth year this instinct may become special- 
ized into chumming. , 
The gang is the usual expression of this instinct in the 
pre-adolescent and early adolescent years. The gang 
may be good or bad. The solution of the problem is 
in sympathetic direction, as exemplified by the Boy 
Scout Movement. 
A common and pernicious form of ganging is the high 
school, secret social fraternity. Other student organ- 
izations, such as athletic teams and debating clubs 
should be encouraged. The evils inherent in high 
school fraternities need not be a part of the college 
fraternity. Under proper control, the college fraternity 
is a valuable social force. 
The school cannot ignore or neglect gregariousness. 
This tendency should be turned to good account in 
social and intellectual training. 
3. Kindliness is closely related to the tendency to be satisfied 
with the companionship of one’s own kind. 
(a) Kindliness and the emotion of sympathy are the basis 
of good will.

(b) Education should give full and adequate encourage- 
ment to the development of this tendency. 
Display is a tendency to seek the approval of one’s fellows 
by “showing off.” 
(a) The tendency to display frequently functions in con- 
nection with rivalry and the sex instinct. 
(b) Display is so closely related to fighting that it very 
readily takes non-social forms of expression. 
(c) In general the school should inhibit this tendency or 
direct it along lines of group activity. If properly 
directed it may serve as a powerful motive in 
education. 
The mating instinct is the original tendency to mate with 
one of the opposite sex. 
(a) This tendency frequently appears in a rudimentary 
form in children not older than nine or ten years. 
(b) This instinct is the biological foundation of the family. 
(c) Every child should have wholesome and sympathetic 
teaching by mother or father concerning the develop- 
ment and function of this instinct. 
(d) Adolescence is the crucial period in the development 
of this instinct. This is the time when parents and 
teachers should see that the instinct is directed along 
normal and sane channels.

1. Many theories have been developed to explain play. Chief 
among these are the following: 
(a) The recapitulation theory of play explains play as 
the rehearsal in childhood of the past activities of the 
race. Children play with bows and arrows because 
their ancestors once used bows and arrows. Those 
who hold to this theory do not explain why the play 
of childhood rehearses the adult activities of the race

rather than the activities of children of past generations. 
This theory is related to the “culture epoch theory” 
which is equally unsound. 
(b) The practice theory of play looks forward rather than 
backward. It explains play as being an instinctive 
form of activity of childhood, the function of which is 
to prepare the child for the serious business of adult 
life. Little girls play with dolls to prepare for mother- 
hood, for example. Whatever truth there is in this 
theory is better explained as imitation. 
(c) The excess energy theory explains play as being random 
movements and activities that serve as a means of 
expressing excess energy of childhood. The criticism 
of this theory is that there is no excess energy. A 
child needs all the energy he has for normal growth. 
(d) The recreation theory explains play as being an 
inherited means of recreation. It is based upon the 
false assumption that change of activity is rest. The 
fact is it is simply a process of getting tired in another 
place. 
(e) The biological theory explains play as being the 
physical expression of the developing and functioning 
instincts. This theory is in harmony with all the 
known facts and is not open to the adverse criticism 
that may be brought against the other theories. 
2. The nature of play is so generally misunderstood that it is of 
great importance that teachers know the following funda- 
mental facts concerning play. 
(a) The outstanding characteristic of all play activities 
is that they are pleasurable. In general, any activity

that is a normal expression of an instinct is satisfying 
in affective tone. Supervision frequently crushes out 
this spontaneous, instinctive, pleasurableness of play 
activities. 
Play and work are not opposite terms. Work is a term 
borrowed from physics or economics; but it is not a 
psychological term. Play and drudgery are psycholog- 
ically opposite terms. Digging a ditch may be both 
work and play to one person and work and drudgery 
to another. 
Play is not necessarily economically useless activity. 
There may be more genuine play spirit in the activities 
of a high-salaried professional baseball player than in 
those of a boy compelled to take part in a baseball 
game in which he has no interest. 
Play is not necessarily an activity that is an end in 
itself. The deciding game of baseball in the world 
series is no less play because its outcome means more 
than a thousand dollars to each of the players, in addi- 
tion to the mere winning or losing of the game. 
Play is not an instinct, but any activity which gives 
normal, adequate expression to a functioning instinct 
is pleasurable and is essentially play. This is equally 
true of the mud-pie making of early childhood and the 
money-making of late adulthood. 
8. The development of play parallels the mental and physical 
growth of the child. 
(a) More than one-third of the brain has motor functions. 
Early childhood is a period of rapid brain growth. Asa 
consequence play takes the form of strenuous physical 
activity.

  Play and Education 
As the instincts develop and change in their relative 
importance, play changes in form. The games of 
childhood are essentially individualistic, such as tag, 
prisoner’s base, hare and hounds, tops, and marbles. 
Those of adolescence are co-operative team games, 
such as baseball, football, and basket-ball. But since 
the non-social instincts are still active, they frequently 
manifest themselves in the tendency to sacrifice team 
play for individual glory. 
The play of adults is less active than that of youth. 
There is a tendency for adults to confine play to the 
serious business of life. As a consequence they fail 
to escape their burdens and responsibilities and fail 
to get needed exercise and mental relaxation. Bridge 
whist, chess, and- golf are typical play activities of 
mature adulthood. 
4. Play, properly used, is one of the most valuable factors in 
education. 
(a) Since play is the expression of the instincts it furnishes 
one of the most powerful motives for learning available. 
School work that is done as play is usually done well 
and the learning highly effective. 
There is no form of activity that affords so good an 
opportunity for moral training as play. Fair play and 
good sportsmanship are the very foundation ideals of 
character. To ‘‘die game” is the ideal of the savage 
and the martyred saint alike. No other activity 
develops this quality of character to such a degree as 
clean sport.

(c) Play brings out the best and worst. It reveals to the 
observing teacher not only the moral and spiritual 
needs of the child, but also sources of power that may 
be used in his development. 
(d) That education is most effective that involves doing. 
There are many forms of play that afford excellent 
opportunities for putting into action the things learned 
in school. 
(e) A properly developed spirit of play will function 
throughout life. It is not necessarily dangerous to 
look upon life as a game. The best work of the world 
is done by men and women who find joy in “playing 
the game” hard. The spirit of play is more valuable in 
education than either a mere sense of duty or discipline. 
The spirit of play is the spirit of eternal youth; grown- 
ups should never “grow up”—completely. 
PROBLEMS 
Which of the theories of play best accounts for your own 
play? Explain why you think so. 
A certain ten-year old boy, who was a member of a boys’ 
recreation club, seemed to enjoy being with the other boys, 
but he was unable to play any game well. As a conse-

others. He was an only child, somewhat spoiled, and 
inclined to be a “sissy.” What could have been done to 
help this boy? 
A certain boy, who was a good baseball pitcher, almost 
invariably lost his temper and quit the game before the 
finish. He became a member of a Sunday School class 
baseball team. How should he have been treated when 
he became angry and quit playing?

1. Imitation is the inborn ability to repeat more or less 
accurately the acts of another or of one’s self. 
(a) Imitation is not an instinct because it is not a definite 
inherited response to a definite stimulus. 
(b) Imitative repetitions are usually very inaccurate, 
especially in the case of children. For example, it 
is only after much practice that students imitate 
accurately a teacher’s pronunciation of the words 
in a foreign language. A boy learning to whistle, 
improves gradually through repeating his own more 
successful trials.

(c) There is no original tendency to repeat every act 
perceived. Exercise and effect and other factors deter- 
mine what acts will be imitated at a given time. A 
person who is thirsty, seeing some one else drinking, 
may have a tendency to drink; but a mother, seeing 
some one mistreating her baby, has no tendency to 
mistreat the baby also. 
(d) Imitation is usually directed by suggestion. This is 
especially true in cases in which the imitative act is 
performed with little attention, as standing up when a 
crowd rises. 
Suggestion is an indefinite term that has been defined in 
many ways. It may be described as the process of re- 
sponding to an external stimulus without the habitual or 
normal deliberation. For example, a person enters a 
store and sees a crowd buying soap ata bargain. Without 
hesitation, he immediately buys soap. Later he remem- 
bers that he really doesn’t need the soap. 
(a) A person is especially suggestible along the lines of 
activity that give expression to instincts or habits. 
(b) A person is more suggestible when stimulated by 
friends than when stimulated by those he dislikes. 
Genuine fr’endship between teacher and pupils is one 
of the most potent factors in education. 
(c) There is no such thing as contrary suggestion. Every 
stimulus has a tendency to produce some response. A 
command not to do a thing actually suggests doing the 
thing, and no other response is suggested. For exam- 
ple, if a child is told not to put a bean in his nose, the 
only act suggested is putting a bean in his nose.

  Imitation and Suggestion 
3. Imitation and suggestion are closely related to the ideo- 
motor theory of action. 
(a) 
(0) 
() Some psychologists believe that the idea of a movement 
tends to evoke the movement involved in the idea and 
would do so if there were no inhibition. For example, 
if there comes into consciousness the idea of putting 
one’s finger in his eye, there is at once an incipient 
movement to perform the act and that the finger would 
actually be stuck in the eye if no inhibiting idea, such 
as the thought of the pain, came into consciousness. 
The facts do not support this theory. 
If the idea is of a movement which is satisfying, there is 
a tendency for it to call forth that movement or some 
other that will produce a similar satisfying effect for 
sensation. This latter movement may be wholly differ- 
ent from the one involved in the stimulating idea. For 
example, an advertisement in a drug store may call up 
the idea of eating ice cream, which in turn may evoke 
the movements involved in walking to a table, sitting 
down, and drinking a glass of lemonade. 
Idea of movements, like all other stimuli, tend to go 
over into response; but the exact nature of the response 
depends upon instincts, habits, and the condition of 
the individual at the particular time. The idea of 
eating pie would very likely evoke the pie-eating 
response on the part of a hungry boy, but if the boy had 
just eaten six or eight pieces of pie that idea would be 
more apt to evoke some other response. 
4, Imitation and suggestion are of fundamental importance 
in education. 
: Nearly all of the learning of infancy and early child- 
hood is by means of imitation.

  92 Imitation and Suggestion 
) Not only children, but adults, can. always learn more 
easily when shown how to do a thing than when merely 
told how to do it. 
(c) Imitation through dramatization is an excellent means 
of self-expression. A boy playing the part of the hero 
in the story of John Smith and Pocahontas may learn 
very little history that is true, but he will have a much 
better development of his own ideas and feelings 
than would be possible if he simply read the story. 
(d) The readiness with which children imitate makes it 
imperative that the social environment of the school 
be the best possible. The teacher should at least be 
physically, mentally, and spiritually normal. Feeble- 
minded children and those with serious physical defects 
that tend to make normal children morbid should be 
segregated, if at all practical. This is especially impor- 
tant in the lower grades. 
5. Moral training is most effective when proper use is made of 
imitation and suggestion. 
(a) Children are highly suggestible, and especially so, when 
influenced by one they admire and respect. 
(b) Normally the parents are the child’s first ideals of 
manhood and womanhood. 
(c) Great characters of fiction and great men and women 
of history furnish an abundance of patterns for imita- 
tion. The Sunday School and other forms of religious 
education have the greatest wealth of inspiration in 
the Bible.

  Imitation and Suggestion 
(d) Contemporary great men and women should also be 
presented sympathetically to the child as patterns to 
follow. Too often children come to believe that all the 
fore-fathers were great and that greatness died with 
them. 
(e) High ideals are the surest foundation on which to build 
character through habit formation. 
PROBLEMS 
. Name six things you do through imitation. Explain why 
you do each of them. 
. What method would you use in teaching a child to count?

pulling pickets off the school-yard fence. How could 
suggestion be used effectively in dealing with this 
situation? 
. Describe an effective use of imitation or suggestion in 
dealing with some group of children that you have 
observed. 
. Describe a case in which a negative command led to the 
doing of the thing prohibited. Show how the situation 
could have been dealt with effectively. 
. Illustrate how imitation may be used wisely in any three 
subjects taught in the sixth grade. 
. Should a school board employ a teacher who uses tobacco? 
Give the reasons for your answer. 
. In a certain school the members of the athletic teams were 
taught how to violate the rules without being detected.

  1. Attention can be better understood by knowing some of 
the things it is not. 
(a) Attention is not a power of the mind. 
(b) Attention is not a faculty of the mind. 
(c) Attention is not a something that an individual 
“gives” or ‘pays,’ or thrusts into consciousness or 
forces upon the mind. 
2. Attention is a functioning of the mind. “Attention” and 
“consciousness” are but different terms applied to the 
same experience. 
(a) Attention cannot be understood apart from the fact 
that the cortex of the cerebrum functions as a unit.

(c) 
(a) Attention and Interest 
At any given time some part of the cortex is stimu- 
lated more than other parts. This explains the fact 
that consciousness is always selective. For example, 
if one looks at a plain, white card he sees some part of 
it more clearly than the rest; or if one hears a wagon 
rattling down the street, he hears certain of the sounds 
more distinctly than the others. 
Attention is the term that expresses this fact that 
at a given time some things are clearer in consciousness 
than others, either on a sensory or ideational basis. 
Sights, sounds, odors, tastes, pain, memories, images, 
ideas, and so on may all be present in consciousness 
at a given time, but never all with exactly the same 
degree of clearness: 
The thing that is clearest in consciousness at a given 
time is said to be in the focus of attention. More 
exactly, it is the focus of consciousness. 
3. Attention is of three types. 
(a) 
(0) Involuntary attention is an arrangement of the field 
of consciousness brought about by a stimulus so intense 
that it is the clearest in consciousness regardless of the 
desires or effort of the individual. For example, if the 
ceiling were to fall on my head it would gain the focus 
of attention regardless of whether I so willed it or not. 
Non-voluntary attention is an arrangement of the 
field of consciousness that involves no consciousness of 
effort or strain. It is illustrated by one’s attentiveness 
to an interesting story, or by the condition of mind 
of a boy wholly engrossed in a game of ball.

  Attention and Interest 
Voluntary attention is an arrangement of the field 
of consciousness that involves a consciousness of effort 
in maintaining it. For example, while a student is 
studying, the idea of stopping may become momen- 
tarily focal in consciousness. The idea of study may 
then regain neural supremacy and the work proceed 
until some other stimulus becomes stronger than 
study. This fluctuation in the field of consciousness is 
the determining characteristic of voluntary attention. 
4, There is no such thing as inattention. 
(a) 
0) So-called inattention means attention to some other 
than the things supposed to be in the focus of attention. 
The pupil most inattentive to the teacher may be 
highly attentive to planning a fishing trip at the very 
moment. 
Dispersed attention describes the condition of one’s 
mind when drowsy or just before going to sleep. Noth- 
ing is very clear in consciousness, but so long as there is 
consciousness some things are clearer than others. 
5. Interest is a term used with a variety of meanings. 
(a) 
(0) Interest may mean an attitude of mind or a mere liking. 
For example, one may have an interest in music or 
politics or sport. 
Interest may mean a share in a business or a property 
right. For example, one may have an interest in a 
bank.

| 104 Attention and Interest 
(c) Interest as related to attention means a feeling of 
: value for a thing or a feeling of satisfaction with 
a situation. One is interested in food when hungry 
and also interested in eating. 
6. Interesting things are stronger stimuli than uninteresting 
things and therefore. more easily hold the focus of 
attention. 
(a) Any activity that is an expression of an instinct is 
interesting and therefore very readily becomes the focus 
of attention. A fight will always attract attention. 
(b) Anything that satisfies a conscious need is interesting, 
and therefore gains the focus of attention with relative 
ease. A man in need of work is readily attentive to 
“help wanted” advertisements. 
(c) Whatever fits in with one’s habits is interesting and of 
high attention value. A rare stamp at once becomes 
focal in the mind of a stamp collector. 
7. Without interest and attention there could be no education. 
(a) Education must start with the interests of the child. 
(6) Education must broaden the interests of the child in 
order to develop non-voluntary attention to tasks that 
are not naturally interesting. A boy who otherwise 
would quit, will struggle through high school mathe- 
matics if inspired by an interest in becoming an 
engineer. 
(c) Education must take into account the fact that range 
and span of attention increase with age and adapt the 
work of the school to the ability of the pupil.

i 
2. (d) Attention cannot be prolonged unless the physical 
conditions are favorable. Good health, sound bodies, 
comfortable seats, good air, light, and heat are all 
necessary for attentive work. 
(e) Training in attention is essentially the process of 
forming habits of action and thought which arouse 
interests which will lead to prolonged non-voluntary 
attention to the useful activities of life. This training 
is a necessary part of the education of every successful 
man or woman. 
PROBLEMS 
. Tabulate the definitions of attention you have found in 
your reading. How many types of definitions do you find? 
How do you explain these differences in definition? 
. Illustrate from your own experience the selective nature 
of attention. 
. Give an example of each of the three types of attention 
from your own experience in any half hour of study of your 
most uninteresting subject. Suggest a method whereby 
you can develop non-voluntary attention to this subject. 
Try it. 
a, Plan an experiment to find out what effect conversation 
Ss: in the room or other distractions have upon the efficiency 
of your study. 
Find out by experiment, if you can develop the habit of 
attention to your work when distracting noises are present. 
Make a list of the interests of a ten-year old boy that could 
be used effectively in teaching arithmetic. 
Name four interests of a fifteen-year old girl and show how 
they could be used effectively in teaching her history.

1. All learning is a process of forming bonds in the nervous 
system. 
(a) Some bonds are predominantly motor connections. 
For example, such bonds as those involved in learning 
to write, to play a piano, or to make bread. 
(6) Some bonds are predominantly connections that 
involve ideas. For example, such bonds as those | 
formed in learning history or geography or literature. 
2. Habits are definite, acquired, responses to definite stimuli. 
(a) In structure and function habits are like instincts. 
They differ in that instincts are inherited and habits 
are acquired.

112 Habit Formation 
(b) There are two kinds of habits: those of skill, and 
knowledge habits. It is important that the learner 
know the exact nature and function of a habit before 
trying to form it. 
3. Habit formation increases efficiency. 
(a) Physically, the habitual response is made with greater 
speed, accuracy, ease, endurance and certainty. 
(6) Mentally, as a response becomes habitual it is made 
with less attention, greater feeling of satisfaction, with 
less fatigue, and with greater feeling of confidence. 
. Three factors necessary for habit formation are repetition, 
attentiveness, and satisfaction. 
(a) Without repetition no habit can be formed. Excep- 
tions or variations in repetition work against habit 
formation. 
(b) To be most effective each repetition should be on a 
high level of attention. A clear understanding of the 
habit aids in holding it in the focus of attention. 
Repetition without understanding and attention is 
of little value. 
(c) Repetition that is satisfying or pleasurable strengthens 
the bonds involved. Annoying or disagreeable repe- 
titions weaken the bonds and therefore work against 
forming the habit. Pleasurableness increases interest 
and attention and therefore makes repetition more 
effective.

  114 Habit Formation 
5. A practice curve measures only part of the results of habit 
formation. 
(a) Practice curves usually show only increase in speed 
and accuracy. 
(b) They do not show changes in ease, endurance, certainty, 
or changes in the mental factors, attention, satisfaction, 
and confidence. 
(c) Plateaus in the practice curve are probably apparent 
rather than real. If the increase in ease, endurance, 
and certainty were taken into account the curve would 
continue to rise. There is no reason to think that 
under similar conditions some repetitions make for 
improvement and others do not. 
(d) If practice becomes highly annoying the practice curve 
may show a decrease in efficiency. ‘Going stale” 
in athletics illustrates this fact. 
6. Drill is necessary for habit formation in school work. 
(a) The physical conditions under which drill is carried 
on should be the best. The room should be comfort- 
able and quiet. 
(b) The learner should be in good physical and mental 
condition. He should be rested, alert, and interested. 
(c) Drill periods should be short enough to make it possible 
to maintain high degree of interest and attention. 
(d) There should be no variation in the performance of 
the habit in drilling on it.’ The habit may be used in a

variety of situations, but always with exactness. 
For example, a child may be drilled on “5 X 7” in 
many situations, but it must always be “5 X 7 = 35” 
never “5 X 7 = 36.” 
7. There is no transfer of training. 
(a) Habits are definite responses to definite stimuli. 
They are specific. 
(6) A habit may function in many situations but the 
same neural bonds are active each time. Facts about 
George Washington may be learned in history and 
carried over and used in the study of literature, but 
the same bonds are used in both cases. 
(c) Even moral habits do not transfer. A person may 
as a matter of habit be honest as regards money and 
yet steal a ride on a street car or a train or steal a 
grade in class. 
(d) Training in forming some habits may interfere with 
the functioning of other habits. For example, the 
habits of investigation in chemistry may interfere with 
the study of sociology or history. 
PROBLEMS 
i Make a list of habitual acts you perform frequently. 
Which are skill habits and which are knowledge habits? 
2. Work out a plan for measuring the increase in efficiency 
due to habit formation in connection with learning 
psychology. Try the plan and record your results.

  Habit Formation 
Describe a case, within your own experience, in which 
you gained confidence through habit formation. 
. The story is told of a boy who habitually said “I have 
went.” His teacher made him stay after school and write 
on the board “I have gone” five hundred times. The 
teacher was gone when he finished, so he wrote on the 
board the following: ‘‘Dear teacher, I have went home.” 
What was wrong with the teacher’s method? Suggest 
a method of correcting the boy’s bad habit. 
Frequently the last rehearsal of a play is a very inferior 
performance, yet the final presentation of considerable 
merit. How do you explain such cases? 
Plan drill work for learning the multiplication combina- 
tions for children just learning them. 
Work out in detail just what you would do in teaching 
children how to do subtraction. 
. A little girl five years old habitually sucks her left thumb 
and at the same time twirls a lock of her hair with her 
right thumb and fore-finger. Her mother has bandaged 
the thumbs, put quinine on them, and tried other devices 
for breaking the habit without success. Suggest a 
method of breaking the habit that would likely succeed. 
Make a study of the habits involved in driving a Ford 
car and those involved in driving a car with the standard 
gear-shift. If a person learned to drive a Ford first, 
which habits thus acquired would be useful in learning 
to drive a ‘‘standard shift” car and which ones would not? 
Work out a plan for doing your daily routine work 
whereby you would make the best use of your habits and 
eliminate waste by improving your habits of work.

. There are two general methods of solving problems, 
namely, (1) trial and error, and (2) reasoning. 
(a) The trial and error method is frequently employed in 
solving mechanical puzzles. It is the method generally 
used in solving problems involving primarily sensori- 
motor activity. This is especially true in dealing with 
problems which demand activities the outcome of which 
cannot be foreseen. For example, if one should come 
to a fork in the road with no clue as to which fork to 
take, trial and error would be the method used in 
solving the problem. 
(b) Reasoning is a method rarely used. It involves the 
process of using ideas to establish mentally between

elements in different situations relations that do not 
exist in fact. This is a process of abstraction and 
synthesis. Ino other words, it is a process of separating 
in thought things that_cannot_be separated in fact, 
and—putting things together in thought that are Rott 
together in fact. For instance, one may in thought 
separate a cup and its water-holding qualities, then 
unite these qualities with a piece of folded paper 
and thereby be enabled to make a paper cup and get a 
drink.

process of referring a particular difficulty to some 
general principle already known. One might discover 
how to operate the gear-shift of an automobile by a 
careful examination of the parts of the transmission and

physics. 
The formal steps in the process of deduction are (1) 
consciousness of the problem, (2) attempts to discover 
the exact difficulty-eausing the problem, (3) attempt.to

solve the problem through the process of association of 
ideas, (4) verification by trial of the suggested-solution 
that appears to be the most likely to succeed: 
Induction and deduction are not two wholly distinct 
processes of reasoning. The solution of almost every 
problem involves the use of both. 
5. Children have less ability to reason than adults. 
(a) 
(0) They have not had as much experience. Experience _ 
is the basis of reasoning. 
They do not use ideas as well as adults. Their con- 
sciousness embraces many images, but relatively few 
ideas or concepts. It is by the use of ideas and con- 
cepts that one carries on the process of establishing 
relations, which is necessary in reasoning. 
6. Training in problem solving or practical reasoning consists 
in three things: 
(a) 
(0) 
(c) In getting broader experience which is the basis 
of associations of ideas. 
In developing a critical attitude towards problems. 
This means an attitude that leads one to pause long 
enough before action to try to locate the difficulty 
and discover a solution through thinking rather than 
resorting at once to the method of trial and error. 
In perfecting a method of dealing with problems. 
This should include collecting adequate data, careful 
analysis of the situation in order to locate the diffi- 
culty, testing the suggested solutions in thought, in 
order to select the best one, before trying any one in 
action, verifying by application, the solution that 
offers the greatest probability of solving the problem.

1. Memory or remembering is the process of reinstating 
past experience in consciousness. There are two kinds of 
memory. 
(a) Conscious memory is the recall of a past experience 
with the additional consciousness that it is a past 
experience. Such a recall is relatively rich in imagery 
which makes it stand out as a definite experience that 
occurred in the past. For instance, one may recall 
with great exactness of detail his breakfast of this 
morning with the additional consciousness that he is 
recalling an event that actually took place at a definite 
time in the past.

130 Remembering and Forgetting 
hh Organic memory is the recall of past experience without 
this additional consciousness that it is a particular 
past experience. For example, one may recall the 
fact that nine times eight is seventy-two, but have no 
awareness of any particular past experience with 9 X 
8 = 72. 
(c) Remembering is a process of habit formation: a 
process of making definite connections in the nervous 
system. The first .stage of this process involves 
conscious memory. When the habit is definitely 
fixed it becomes organic memory. 
Ye The difference between “remembering” and “know- 
ing” is essentially the difference between conscious 
and organic memory. One remembers the name of 
the stranger he met this morning, but he knows his 
own name. 
) There is no faculty of memory, or memory ability; 
but there are many memories. 
% Memorizing is aided by the following factors : 
(a) A clear understanding of the subject-matter. Mean- 
ingful material is always more readily recalled than 
meaningless material. 
(b) Attentive repetitions. Memorizing is a process of 
habit formation, and attentive repetitions are neces- 
sary to habit formation. 
(c) Making many associations. Recency, frequency, and 
mental ‘set’? determine what will be remembered at 
any given time.

  132 Remembering and Forgetting 
(d) The use of many senses in the presentation of the 
material, but especially of the sense organ through 
which the particular individual learns most easily. 
Other sense impressions aid in building up associations. 
\ The use of rhythm aids in memorizing. 
3. The ability to learn, retain, and recall improves with age. 
(a) Adults have a greater span for immediate memory 
than children. 
(6) Adults memorize more rapidly than children. 
(c) Retention is about the same as regards the amount 
learned in children and adults. That is, in proportion 
to what is learned children and adults forget about 
the same amount. 
(d) Adults are superior to children in memorizing because 
of better habits of learning and wider experience, which 
furnishes a better basis for association of ideas. 
4. Girls surpass boys in memory work. 
(a) Girls do better than boys in logical memory tests. 
(6) Girls do better than boys in rote memory tests, using 
abstract words. 
(c) Boys do about as well as girls in rote memory tests, 
using concrete words.

134 Remembering and Forgetting 
(d) A possible explanation of the superiority of girls over 
boys is the fact that girls develop earlier than boys, 
physically. At the same biological ages girls do not 
show so much superiority over boys. Adult men and 
women show practically no sex difference in memory 
work. 
5. In general, it is more economical to learn material as a 
whole rather than in parts. 
(a) Verbal material should be learned by the whole 
(0) 
(©) 
(a) 
(e) 
Q) 
(9) method. That is, it should be memorized in units as 
large as can be read at one sitting with high attention. 
The first few repetitions should certainly be by the 
whole method. 
After the material is nearly learned, certain parts 
may present special difficulty. It is then economical 
to do extra drill on these parts to remove the difficulty. 
The final repetitions should _be by the whole method. 
The whole method avoids making any false associa- 
tions. This greatly increases the accuracy of recall. 
The length of the drill periods should be short enough 
to insure a high degree of attention throughout the 
period. 
Permanence of retention is increased by ‘“over”- 
learning; but practice over several days is more effec- 
tive than the same amount of practice in one day. 
Twenty hours of practice spread over two months 
would be more effective for permanent retention than 
if spread over a week.

6. Forgetting is the process of weakening through disuse the 
bonds in the nervous system to the point where the given 
stimulus will no longer evoke the response connected with 
it in these bonds. 
(a) Forgetting is useful in that it removes from conscious- 
ness ideas that are no longer needed: A child may 
forget how to say the rule for working certain arith- 
metic problems, but continue to be able to work the 
problems. 
(b) Forgetting is rapid immediately after learning and then 
slow. One forgets within an hour after learning more 
than half of all he will forget in days or even weeks. 
(c) Excessive forgetting is due to wrong methods of 
learning. 
(d) Whatever is learned on a basis of organic memory 
may persist throughout life. Those things that remain 
on a conscious memory basis are more easily forgotten. 
It is probably true that one never forgets what he 
knows, but only forgets what he remembers. 
PROBLEMS 
N. Select two pages of prose of as nearly equal difficulty as 
you can find. Divide one page into four sections and 
commit it to memory section by section, keeping a count 
of the number of repetitions for each section. Commit 
the other page to memory as a whole, counting the 
number of repetitions. Which is the more economical 
method? S 
2. Get some one to make for youa list of fifty unrelated words 
and a list of five sentences of ten words each. Commit 
each list to memory separately, counting the number of 
repetitions. Which was the more difficult? Why?

. Ina certain geography class the pupils commit to memory 
the names of the countries and of their capitals. To 
many of them this is a very disagreeable task. Is this a 
good practice? Explain your answer. 
A certain high school English teacher requires her students 
to memorize a great many poems. Many of the pupils 
dislike the course because of this requirement. Is the 
teacher justified in requiring so much memory work? 
Explain your answer. 
Since girls are better at memorizing than boys, which 
should make the better grades in school? Gather data 
on this point. 
Work out a method of study for high school pupils for 
committing to memory the important facts of American 
history. 
If you were teaching the multiplication tables to a class of 
children how would you take into account the fact that 
some of them learn better through the eye, others through 
the ear, and others through motor activities. 
Plan the drill work for the study of verbs in a foreign 
language for a high school class. Work out your plan in 
detail to cover at least two weeks. 
A certain girl works very hard trying to learn history, 
but has great difficulty in doing so. Her quiz grades are 
always low because she cannot remember what she has 
studied. Her work in other subjects is satisfactory. 
What should she do to improve her work in history?

1. Intelligence is a term that is used in a great many different 
ways. The outstanding characteristic of intelligence is 
the ability to profit by experience; that is, the ability to 
learn. 
(a) Among the more common conceptions of intelligence 
are these: intelligence is the ability to comprehend a 
complex situation as a whole; intelligence is the power 
of independent, creative elaboration of new products 
out of the material given by memory and the senses; 
it is the ability to avoid errors and to surmount diffi- 
culties; intelligence is the general capacity of the 
individual consciously to adjust his thinking to new 
requirements; intelligence is a ‘‘common central 
’ factor” which participates in all kinds of mental 
activities.!

(0) Intelligence 
According to Binet, intelligence involves three things, 
(1) a tendency to take and maintain a definite thought 
process; (2) the capacity to make adaptations for the 
purpose of attaining a desired end; and (3) the power of 
auto-criticism. 
2. There are many grades of intelligence, each shading into 
' another with no clear line of demarcation between them. 
A helpful classification based upon the Stanford Revision of 
the Binet scale, is as follows: 
(a) 
(0) 
(0) 
@) 
() 
ff) 
(9) 
(h) Very superior intelligence; approximately only 5% 
of school children have this grade of intelligence. 
Superior intelligence; approximately 15% of school 
children have this grade of intelligence. 
Average intelligence; approximately 60% of school 
children have this grade of intelligence. 
Dull normal intelligence; approximately 15% of 
school children have this grade of intelligence. 
Very dull normal intelligence; approximately 5% of 
school children have this grade of intelligence. This 
is the lowest grade of normal intelligence. 
Morons (high, middle, and low); intelligence of grades 
that in adult life reaches levels ranging between 
normal seven-year and eleven-year intelligence. This 
is the highest grade of feeble-mindedness. 
Imbeciles (high, middle, and low) ; intelligence of grades 
that in adult life range between normal three-year and 
seven-year intelligence. 
Idiots (high, middle, and low); intelligence of a grade 
that in adult life range below normal three-year 
intelligence.

  144 Intelligence 
3. The most satisfactory method for the determination of 
general intelligence is to measure it in terms of mental age. 
(a) 
(0) 
(0) 
@) Mental age is a statement of the general mental 
ability of an individual at a given time, as compared 
with the mental ability of normal children of different 
ages. The basis of comparison is a scale made up of 
tests graded by years, so selected that normal children 
of a given age will score a mental age equal to their 
chronological age. For example, normal ten-year-old 
children will score 10 as their mental age. This is 
called the ““M. A.” 
If a child’s mental age is less than his chronological 
age, he is mentally inferior. If his ‘‘M. A.” is greater 
than his chronological age, he is above the average in 
mental ability. 
The Intelligence Quotient, or “I. Q.,”’ is the ratio of 
the mental to the chronological age, or ““C. A.”, of an 
individual. M. A. + C. A. =I. Q. For example if 
a child is six years old his “C. A.” is 6. If when tested 
he makes a mental score of six years, his M. A. is 6. 
Then M. A. 6+C. A. 6=1.00. This “1.00” is 
his I. Q. 
An I. Q. less than 1.00 indicates that the individual 
is mentally below the average: if his I. Q. is more 
than 1.00, it indicates that he is mentally above the 
average. 
The I. Q. remains relatively constant. As a conse- 
quence, it can be used to predict the rate of mental 
development of the child.

  146 Intelligence 
4. Intelligence is inherited ; it is not acquired. 
(a) Accident or disease may impair native intelligence, but 
it is affected very little or none by training. 
(b) The basis of intelligence is the structure and function- 
ing of the nervous system. Intelligence is, therefore, 
fundamentally an inherited trait. 
5. There are certain factors of general intelligence that are 
not accurately measured by general intelligence tests. 
(a) The emotional qualities of behavior are certainly 
mental and a factor in general intelligence, but general 
intelligence tests do not measure emotions except indi- 
rectly. For example, a highly emotional child, work- 
ing under test conditions may make a much lower 
score than a child who is calm and self-possessed. The 
difference in score may be due to the emotional differences 
in the children, but the records in the test do not show 
this factor. 
(b) Tact and the ability of working with people are factors 
in intelligence, but they are not measured by the tests. 
(c) Moral qualities, such as honesty and dependability, 
which certainly are important factors in intelligence, 
are not measured by general intelligence tests. 
6. Sound educational practice will take into full account all 
the important facts that grow out of the study of general 
intelligence. 
(a) Education should give full recognition to individual 
differences. The most important individual differences 
are differences in intelligence.

148 Intelligence 
(6) Education must take into account the fact that intelli- 
gence is uneven. In some abilities a ten-year old child 
may be at a seven-year level and in others he may be 
at a twelve-year level. This is especially true of the 
feeble-minded child. 
(c) School achievement depends upon general intelligence. 
The I. Q. is the best index of the probable outcome of 
a child’s educational career. 
(d) Vocational success depends largely upon general intelli- 
gence. Adequate vocational guidance must take into 
account the intelligence of the pupil. 
(e) General intelligence is the determining factor in making 
moral and social adjustments. Education along these 
lines should be founded upon this fact. 
PROBLEMS 
1. A certain girl, thirteen years old, has been in the first grade 
for three years without making progress. An intelligence 
test reveals the fact that her I. Q. is 50. What should be 
done with this girl? 
2. A boy, sixteen years old, is a freshman in high school. He 
failed in all his work the first semester. His I. Q. is 88. 
What should be done in his case? 
3. A pupil who is 10 years and 8 months of age has an M. A. 
of 11 years and 9 months. What is his I. Q.? What will 
be his mental age when he is twelve years old? 
4. A girl fourteen years old is in the fourth grade. She is 
one of the poorest pupils in the grade. What do you advise 
doing in this case?

group in school work? Or would you use the M. A. as a 
basis of grouping? 
8. Should separate classes be made for dull children and 
bright children? Give reasons for your answer. 
9. From the point of view of general social welfare, are there 
some types of work that can be done more efficiently by 
people of low grade intelligence than by those of superior 
intelligence? If so, what are they? What factors do you 
take into account in reaching your conclusion?

1. Standard tests and measurements have been developed 
to meet the need for scientific accuracy in place of mere 
opinion in evaluating school work. 
(a) Studies of the accuracy of teachers’ marks as measures 
of achievement reveal their great unreliability. 
(b) Standard tests are the basis of knowledge as to the 
relative value of work in different schools. 
(c) Tests and measurements also reveal individual differ- 
ences and are therefore valuable in the diagnosis of 
cases of failure.

2. There are four general types of tests that are valuable in 
education : 
(a) Physical tests to determine the physical condition of 
the child. 
(b) Psychological tests that measure special mental func- 
tions such as memory, association, attention, imagi- 
nation. 
(c) General intelligence tests to measure the general mental 
ability of the child apart from school training. There 
are two types of these tests: (1) individual tests and 
(2) group tests. 
(d) Instruction tests to measure achievement in the par- 
ticular school subjects, as arithmetic, spelling, reading, 
geography. 
3. The physical examination of children should be a part of the 
routine of every school system. 
(a) The sense organs, especially the eyes and ears, should 
be examined, and defects reported to the parents. 
(b) The lung capacity of every child should be measured 
and the vital index (the relation of lung aa’ to 
weight) determined. 
(c) A general physical examination by a physician should 
be given every child, with special reference to the 
condition of the heart, lungs, and tonsils.

. The tests of specific mental functions are of special value 
in dealing with abnormal children. 
(a) They are of no great significance in connection with 
regular school work. 
(b) In cases of failure, backwardness, or delinquency, 
careful use of these tests of memory, association, and 
other mental functions is valuable. 
. General intelligence tests are of value in all grades of 
school work. 
(a) They furnish the best basis for classification of pupils. 
(b) They are essential to scientific diagnosis of individual 
cases that are causing trouble. 
(c) They are valuable as basis of prediction of the future 
progress of the pupil. 
(d) They are indispensable to scientific vocational guidance. 
(e) In measuring the relative teaching efficiency of a school 
system by the use of standard instruction tests the 
results are unreliable unless supplemented by the use of 
general intelligence tests. 
. Instruction tests and scales should be used regularly in 
every school. 
(a) They are the most reliable source of knowledge as 
regards progress and achievement in classroom 
instruction.

(b) When used in connection with general intelligence tests 
they are the best basis on which to rate the teaching 
ability of a teacher. 
(c) Such tests must be used with great caution, for they 
measure progress only in the thing which is being 
tested. They throw no light on the value of the 
subject-matter. 
. Tests and measurements are of little value unless they are 
properly used. 
(a) The results must be thoroughly understood. 
(b) There is a dangerous tendency to over-estimate the 
value of any school subject, the teaching of which 
can be accurately measured. 
(c) The results of tests must be properly organized by the 
use of statistical methods, whenever applicable. 
(d) School practice must be modified in the light of the 
facts revealed by the-use of tests and measurements or 
there is no reason for using them. 
PROBLEMS

girl is near-sighted and therefore needs eye-glasses very 
badly. Her parents object to having her wear glasses 
because of her youth. What should be done about this 
case?

tonsils and adenoids. His parents do not ‘‘believe in oper- 
ations.’”’ What should be done in this case?

1. Education is something more than merely learning of 
school subjects. 
(a) Education affects the whole person. 
(b) It is the process of growing a personality and character. 
2. Personality and character are terms used to describe 
different aspects of an individual. They both refer to the 
completeness and unity of the self. 
(a) Personality is intangible and indefinable; but, neverthe- 
less, it is very real. It refers especially to the affective 
tone of other peoples’ judgments of a person. For example, 
one’s personality may be described either as pleasing or 
disagreeable; as strong or weak; as winning or repellent.

  164 Personality and Character 
(b) Character refers to the moral qualities of a person. 
One may have a good character, yet be disagreeable in 
personality. 
. Many factors enter into the building of a personality. 
Some important ones are: 
(a) One’s general attitude. Self-reliant, stubborn, aggres- 
sive, cheerful, morose, considerate, are a few of the 
characteristic types of attitudes. 
(6) Emotional factors. To illustrate one may be excitable 
or calm; quick-tempered or slow to anger. 
(c) Physical factors. Good health makes for a pleasing 
personality; ill health works against it. Small stature 
predisposes one to be aggressive; large stature pre- 
disposes one to be easy-going. 
(d) Intelligence. Other things being equal, the greater 
one’s intelligence, the higher the quality of personality 
he may develop. 
Character is the sum total of one’s habits of thought and 
action. 
(a) Habits of thought determine one’s ideals and purposes. 
These are the motives of action. 
(b) Morality is essentially a matter of habit formation. 
(c) From the viewpoint of morality, right action is more 
important than right ideas about conduct.

5. Moral training, the purpose of which is to develop good 
character and personality, should be in accord with the 
following facts: 
(a) Morality is the outcome of habit formation. 
(b) Habits are specific. 
(c) General principles of conduct are not sufficient. They 
must be supplemented by the building” up of a large 
number of definite and sure responses to a large number 
of situations. 
(d) Ideals, purposes, attitudes, emotional behavior, and 
the other factors that affect character and personality 
may all be improved through habit formation. 
(e) The habits that affect personality and character are 
more important in education than those which are 
formed in learning subject-matter in the classroom. 
(f) A person with a well-developed personality and char- 
acter is one who habitually acts in accord with high 
ethical ideals. 
PROBLEMS 
. Make a list of six traits which you think are necessary in a 
well-developed personality. Write the names of the five 
students with whom you are most intimately acquainted. 
Now rank these five students from highest to lowest (1, 
2, 3, 4, 5) as regards each of the six traits. Using the 
five as a scale, rate yourself in these six traits. 
. Explain the relation of religious belief to moral conduct. 
. Acertain girl entered college with a good record as a student 
in the high school. Within a week she became discontented 
and gave up altogether the purpose of going to college.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
THE superintendent of schools occupies a unique po- 
sition among American public officials. Few pub- 
lic servants exercising his great influence and power 
are as little hampered by partisan political consid- 
erations. As compared with other employees in the 
service of government whose expert training is no 
greater, his recompense is favorable. His tenure and 
opportunity for continuously effective service is usu- 
ally greater. 
This favorable condition surrounding the office of 
superintendent or supervising principal is an evolu- 
tion of the last twenty years. It is a direct product 
of the converging and strengthening of several im- 
portant traditions in American life. One of these is 
the growing belief that the success of popular gov- 
ernment depends upon the efficacy of widespread 
education. Another, that the schools should be in- 
dependent of the passions and changes which accom- 
pany the rise and fall of parties and factions in the 
general government. 
These widespread doctrines of a democratic peo- 
ple have been made effective in recent years through 
the organized codperation of teachers, parents, and 
other citizens possessing a deep interest in the train- 
v

ing of children. Everywhere parent-teachers’ asso- 
ciations, mothers’ congresses, child-welfare leagues, 
public school associations, and other similar civic 
societies constitute a body of protecting opinion 
which has made the schools, like the courts, a fun- 
damental and unpartisan institution in our Ameri- 
can life. They have created a medium between the 
teachers and the general public which increases the 
educationalist’s capacity for determining the general 
public policies as well as the specific educational poli- 
cies under which the schools operate. 
Where the superintendent was once compelled to 
accept such interpretations of the public will with 
regard to education as the board of education might 
lay down, intelligently or arbitrarily, he is now ina 
position to create the very public appreciations and 
depreciations which the school trustees register. He 
has added to the powers of teacher, administrator, 
and executive the additional one of leader of the 
educational mind of his community. 
The office of superintendent has thus become an 
intricate one, which brings within its range many 
diverse functions. It calls for more varied powers 
than most of the professional functions in govern- 
ment. Only the chief executive of the general po- 
litical government, such as the mayor or governor, 
finds larger variability in his tasks than the principal 
officer of the school system, large or small. 
The manager of schools must have an organized

scheme of work and must execute it in a systematic 
way that leaves little room for avoidable omissions 
and delays. Time and energy must be disposed in a 
manner that leads to the economical and effective 
performance of the thousand definite small tasks and 
the hundred large and diffuse services which make 
up his total responsibility. As season follows sea- 
son, imposing a different emphasis to his ever-present 
problems, he finds that his alternating attentions to 
duty take on a definite sequence. 
To a considerable degree, the problems and duties 
of the State superintendent of public instruction have 
been analyzed and given orderly arrangement. The 
same is true of the responsibilities of the superin- 
tendent of our great city systems of schools, to which 
students of educational administration have given 
the major part of their thought. Even rural-school 
management has had extensive thought and publica- 
tion given toit. On the contrary, the administration 
of the smaller systems of schools in towns and villages 
has been largely overlooked by the scientific stu- 
dents of education, and little has been published on 
this field for the guidance of those who are charged 
with their direction. 
The need of an intelligent handbook on this field 
of educational service is the greatest, not merely be- 
cause the field has been neglected, but for another 
and more trenchant reason. It is in the supervision 
of the smaller school systems that the careers of 
vii

school superintendents usually begin. It is their 
first transfer from the classroom teaching or the di- 
rection of a single school to the administration of a 
system of community schools. The change is a sud- 
den one, a plunge into a new kind of educational work, 
when guidance from some authoritative source must 
be the substitute for a personal experience which the 
beginner does not have. 
In the face of this obvious need, the author of 
the volume here presented has drawn widely and 
thoughtfully upon his own varied experience in sev- 
eral small school systems and prepared a handbook 
for the guidance of his less experienced fellows which 
is unique in its thorough helpfulness. In addition, he 
has with rare discretion drawn from the literature of 
school administration in general those applicable in- 
formations and techniques which have a direct bear- 
ing on his own particular problems. It is such a 
book as the editor may present to the profession with 
a sense of great service rendered.

PREFACE 
THERE has Tuere has _been_very little_professional literature 
written ‘written with 1 the small school system in mind. A 
large quantity of books, dissertations, reports, sur- 
veys, and magazine articles dealing with the city 
school has appeared within the last few years. Most 
of this material is not available to the man or the 
woman employed in a village or small city school, yet, 
speaking generally, these are the ones who need help 
most. The writer offers this book as a pioneer at- 
tempt to bring to those in the smaller schools some 
of the results of a rather extensive study of educa- 
tional literature as well as a considerable experience 
as teacher, principal, and superintendent in small 
school systems. No claim for originality is made. 
The student of education will recognize the sources of 
many of the ideas set forth herein. It is written in 
the hope that it may prove helpful to those prepar- 
ing for administrative and supervisory positions in 
small school systems as well as to those already at 
work in this field.

THE MANAGEMENT OF 
SMALLER SCHOOLS 
I 
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS 
A new profession 
Tue administration and supervision of public schools 
is a new profession. In 1870 but twenty-seven city 
superintendents of schools were employed in the 
United States. These early superintendents did a 
pioneer work and blazed many trails for their succes- 
sors. They were without special training for their 
task and were compelled to follow the trial-and-error 
method, overcoming obstacles as best they could, and 
paying for their mistakes with their positions. Con- 
ditions have changed greatly. The public now ex- 
pects much more of a modern school executive than 
was expected of his early predecessors. The new 
superintendent of schools is a specialist, with the best 
training afforded by modern colleges of education. 
The methods of scientific investigation have been 
taught tohim. He knows how to make a careful sur- 
vey of his school system and community, locate his 
particular problems, and set to work in an intelli- 
gent way to solve them. People expect him to be an 
I
-P-A-G-E-12
  ‘“ MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
expert in school supervision, with the ability to train 
his teachers in service, to use standard tests to pro- 
mote efficiency of instruction, and to classify chil- 
dren properly with the aid of intelligence tests. The 
principles underlying a modern course of study are 
familiar to him, and he is relied on to develop, with 
the assistance of his teachers, such courses as may 
be suitable for his own community. In the field of 
school administration the new superintendent must 
be an expert. Problems involving the school law of 
his State confront him every day. When additional 
school facilities are needed, it is to the superintendent 
that the board of education and the public look for 
a definite program. They expect him to know the 
standards which determine good school building. If 
bonds are to be voted, it is the superintendent who 
must supply facts, arguments, and publicity. The 
preparation of the budget is turned over to him, and 
if taxes mount too high, he is the one held responsi- 
ble. In short, the person who would manage suc- 
cessfully the public schools of a village or city must 
be a rare combination of student, teacher, lawyer, 
business man, architect, physician, and a dozen other 
individuals. By means of his expert knowledge, 
technical training, executive ability, and good com- 
mon sense he secures the codperation of the school 
children, the teachers, the board of education, the 
parents, and the community as a whole. No other 
person in his locality possesses such great power for 
2  
-P-A-G-E-13
THE SUPERINTENDENT 
good or ill. All this knowledge and power he uses, 
not for his own individual glorification, but that the 
boys and girls under his care may develop into the 
best men and women possible. To be the superin- 
tendent of schools in a modern American city is a 
real man’s job. 
General and technical preparation required 
It must be evident that such a superintendent of 
schools needs careful and definite professional prep- 
aration. The young doctor formerly learned medi- 
cine by studying in the office of a successful practi- 
tioner, but to-day he is a graduate of a modern school 
of medicine. Likewise the young superintendent of 
schools, who hopes for the largest usefulness and the 
greatest success, needs the training which can be 
given only in a modern college of education. The 
successful school manager of the present day needs a 
full four-year college course. He should lay a broad 
foundation and develop permanent interests in litera- 
ture, history, sociology, economics, music, art, science, 
and the welfare of humanity in general. His future 
work will be largely with people of affairs, and for 
his own peace of mind and self-preservation he must 
have this broad foundation. He will be expected to 
associate with leaders of busiriess, of society, of civic 
affairs of every de8tription. He will be asked to ad- 
dress Chambers of Commerce, Rotary Clubs, Wom- 
en’s Clubs, Civic Improvement Societies, church 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
organizations, patriotic meetings, and educational 
gatherings. Opportunities to develop ability in pub- 
lic speaking should be accepted, as should also oppor- 
tunities to develop skill in writing. The superintend- 
ent of schools will have much occasion to use both 
these arts in the practice of his profession. Without 
a broad general college education, supplemented by 
constant study even in the later years of his career, 
he cannot hope to measure up to the task that will 
confront him. In addition to this general education 
there will be need for technical training in educa- 
tional theory, history, administration, and super- 
vision. There is even now a demand that the super- 
intendent of schools shall have at least one year 
of graduate study in the field of education at some 
good teachers’ college. : 
Growth during apprenticeship 
It must not be understood, however, that all this 
preparation will eliminate the need for a period of 
apprenticeship and practice. Such preparation as 
described will materially shorten the time which one 
must serve in a subordinate position, but no young 
superintendent should get the idea that all this splen- 
did preparation will enable him to step right out of 
college into a large position. Few men can hope to 
avoid a period of five or six years of apprenticeship. 
Just as the young lawyer goes through a “period of 
starvation” in order to reach the larger rewards of his 
4

THE SUPERINTENDENT 
profession, so must a young school man pass through 
a series of positions as teacher and principal before 
he can hope to be in line for the larger positions. It 
is well to set a series of goals each to be definitely 
reached at a given time; a principalship at twenty- 
five, a small superintendency at thirty, a large super- 
intendency at forty. 
During the years of apprenticeship time must be 
found for the study and reading of professional liter- 
ature. No matter how intensive are the demands 
of outside interests, the young man, who looks for- 
ward to an important position in education at forty, 
must not allow these other affairs, whatever they 
may be, to monopolize his time. The habit of reserv- 
ing at least one hour each day for careful teading and - 
study of professional literature is one which should 
be developed early. Some very successful superin- 
tendents have used the plan of making an exhaustive 
study in some one particular field of education for one 
year. During this year every effort is directed to 
master the field. Every address, so far as possible, is 
built around the central idea. All of the professional 
reading is concentrated on this one subject. To- 
ward the end of the year the material accumulated is 
carefully organized, the main ideas developed are as- 
sembled, and the results are embodied in a written ar- 
ticle of some length, which may be made to serve as 
the basis for an address on that topic for a number 
of years to come, provided, of course, one keeps the 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS ; 
subject-matter up to date as he goes along into other 
fields. The next year a different field is studied in the 
same manner. This plan, if followed intelligently 
over a period of years, will give one a reserve fund upon 
which he will be able to draw in those years of mid- 
dle life, when, in a large position, he will find it dif- 
ficult because of the press of many duties to do reg- 
ular and systematic reading, and to prepare new ad- 
dresses for each occasion which arises. In the early 
years of his professional career a good working pro- 
fessional library should be accumulated. The books 
which go into this library should be selected with great 
care, and not one should find a place there which 
is not helpful. It is better to buy a book or two as 
needed and as there is time for immediate study, 
rather than to assemble a large number of books at 
one time, many of which will not be read, as newer 
material comes on the market. The practice of read- 
ing a few well-selected educational periodicals should 
be established early. Here again it is better to con- 
fine one’s attention to two or three journals that give 
a definite broad treatment of educational topics than 
it is to scatter one’s energies over too wide a field. 
In these early years school duties which broaden 
one’s experience should be eagerly sought. Toomany 
young men come into a school system and resent every 
task assigned them which seems to be somewhat 
out of the line of their regular duties. One does not 
grow in this way.

THE SUPERINTENDENT 
"The apprentice should avoid “going to seed” along 
his own line. He must read general magazines, biog- 
raphy, some fiction, and keep thoroughly informed on 
all subjects of local and national significance. Time 
should be found also for mingling with the business 
and professional men of the community, as by this 
means much information may be secured which will 
serve the superintendent in later life. The practice 
of avoiding ‘‘shop talk” in the presence of such men 
is to be strongly urged. The school man should 
early develop the art of getting the other man to talk 
about the activities and problems in which the other 
man is interested as well as about topics of general 
and current concern. 
Personal qualities needed 
Besides the careful preparation and the experience 
which has already been indicated, the superintendent 
of schools who makes the greatest success will need to 
have a number of personal qualities which will work 
to his advantage. Cubberley + summarizes them as 
follows: i 
The man who would be a superintendent of schools — 
the educational leader of a city — must be clean, both in 
person and mind; he must be temperate, both in speech 
and act; he must be honest and square, and able to look 
men straight in the eye; and he must be possessed of a 
high sense of personal honor. He needs a good time-sense 
* Public School Administration, pp. 137-38. 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
to enable him to save time and to transact business with 
dispatch, and a good sense of proportion to enable him 
to see things in their proper place and relationship. He 
must have the manners and courtesy of a gentleman, 
without being flabby or weak. He must not be affected 
by a desire to stand in the community limelight, or talk 
unnecessarily about his own accomplishments. He must 
avoid oracularism, the solemnity and dignity of an owl, 
and the not uncommon tendency to lay down the law. A 
good sense of humor will be found a means of saving 
grace here, and will many times keep him from taking 
himself too seriously. He must be alert, and able to get 
things done. This demands a good understanding of 
common human nature, some personal force, and some 
genuine political skill. He must know when and how to 
speak, but especially when and how to keep silent. He 
must know when and how to take the public into his con- 
fidence, and when not to tell what he desires or intends to 
do. He must know how to accept success without vain- 
glory, and defeat without being embittered. He must 
keep a level head, so as not to be carried away by some 
new community enthusiasm, by some clever political 
trick, or by the great discovery of some wild-eyed re- 
former. He must, by all means, avoid developing a 
“grouch” over the situation which confronts him, for a 
man with that attitude of mind never inspires confidence, 
and is always relatively ineffective. 
Nature of the work 
The work of a superintendent of schools is threefold 
in its nature. He is a supervisor, an executive, and 
an organizer and leader. As supervisor he is brought 
8
-P-A-G-E-19
THE SUPERINTENDENT 
into close relations with teachers and pupils. He 
leads by reason of his superior knowledge and his 
ability to coérdinate all the forces about him rather 
than by his authority. As executive, he is brought 
into close relations with the board of education. He 
must ever bear in mind that, without the support of 
his board, he can accomplish little. It becomes nec- 
essary, therefore, that he keep them well informed 
concerning the needs of the schools, that they under- 
stand the reasons which lie behind his recommenda- 
tions. He must never expect to get everything he 
asks without some opposition, but he can and should 
avoid considering this opposition as personal. His 
policy must be always positive, never negative. He 
must take a firm stand for what he advocates, but 
never too firma stand. After all, wisdom does not 
reside exclusively in the superintendent of schools, 
and sometimes it may be necessary for him to right- 
about-face and go in the other direction. In such 
cases, few though they may be, he is much more 
likely to hold the confidence and respect of his board 
if he has not been too positive and overzealous in sup- 
porting his own position. This does not mean that the 
superintendent is to be a weak-kneed, spineless crea- 
ture. It does imply that he will have sense enough 
to distinguish between courage and aggressiveness 
on the one hand, and arbitrary usurpation of power 
ontheother. The policy of ‘either accept my recom- 
mendation or my resignation,” which is sometimes 
9
-P-A-G-E-20
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
assumed by superintendents, is nine hundred and 
ninety-nine times out of a thousand a serious mistake. 
Anything worth while can be accomplished by other 
means, even if it takes longer. Between a board of 
education and a superintendent of schools there must 
be a feeling of mutual trust and confidence. It is the 
business of the superintendent to see that this feeling 
is not destroyed by some thoughtless act or word 
of his. 
As an executive, there are hundreds of matters that 
he must decide and act upon without consulting 
the board. They are busy men of affairs and will cer- 
tainly become disgusted with a manager who must 
run to them with every trivial detail. The superin- 
tendent is employed as an educational expert to man- 
age the schools. If he knows what he is doing, and 
uses reasonably good judgment, he will have the sup- 
port of his board. On the other hand, there are ques- 
tions of policy which should never be decided by the 
superintendent without consultation with the board. 
The fundamental distinction between the duties of 
the board and those of the superintendent is that the 
former are legislative and the latter are executive. 
With this distinction kept in mind at all times, there 
is little occasion for friction to arise. 
Asan organizer and leader of educational affairs, the 
superintendent works with the board, the teachers, 
and the community. Those business enterprises are 
most successful which have a definite goal and a def- 
Io
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE SUPERINTENDENT 
finite plan to reach that goal. The business of edu- 
cation is no exception. Out of his superior train- 
ing and experience, the superintendent will soon see 
many things in any school system to which he may 
be called that ought to be changed. He will see many 
opportunities for increasing the efficiency of the 
schools, and will realize, as does no one else in the 
community, the steps which must be taken to attain 
these ideals. He must evolve a definite program for 
accomplishment based upon an adequate study of 
conditions. His stakes must be set ahead one, two, 
three years ormore. Butit is equally important that 
he remain silent about many of the things he has dis- 
covered and also about the things he hopes to accom- 
plish. He will find that the board of education, the 
teaching corps, and the community lag far behind his 
ideals. New plans should be announced only about 
as fast as these three groups can keep up with them. 
This will necessitate education of all concerned or the 
plans will fail. With the board the superintendent 
must be constantly alert to find little opportunities to 
drop a word here and there which will help to educate 
them to his ideals. Many times he must adroitly 
lead a conversation in the direction he desires so that 
the opening will come naturally and without any 
suspicion being developed that the conference was 
sought with this particular purpose in mind. At 
other times it will be necessary to make special ap- 
pointments to discuss definite items. If the superin- 
II 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
tendent tries to accomplish things no faster than he 
can educate the public to them, there will not be 
serious opposition to his proposals. The important 
thing to remember is that tact, good judgment, thor- 
ough preparation, accurate and complete informa- 
tion, and a knowledge of human nature, together with 
patience and persistence, make all things possible 
of accomplishment. For the man who can do these 
things the new profession of school administration 
offers large possibilities, financially as well as other- 
wise.
-P-A-G-E-23

WHAT TO DO BEFORE SCHOOL OPENS 
A good start is fundamental 
THE importance of getting a good start cannot be 
overemphasized. Wise forethought will reduce the 
chances for failure toa minimum. With every detail 
carefully planned, there is little chance for a serious 
emergency to arise. The school will start off like a 
well-oiled piece of machinery. There will be no de- 
lays, no confusion. Teachers and pupils will know 
what to do. Parents will recognize the application 
of system, and will comment favorably on the good 
start. Confidence in the superintendent will be es- 
tablished ‘and every one concerned will be happy. 
The experienced superintendent will have learned 
what needs to be done in advance. This chapter is 
written with the new and inexperienced superin- 
tendent chiefly in mind. 
Establishing community contacts 
If he is moving to a new location, it is of the ut- 
most importance that the new superintendent arrive 
in town several weeks before school begins. If he is 
a married man, he will need to find a house in which 
tolive. Time will be required to move into it and get 
13
-P-A-G-E-24
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
settled. This should be done three or four weeks 
before school opens in order that home affairs may 
not occupy time which should be given to his school 
work. If he is unmarried, the new superintendent 
needs to be especially careful to choose a comfortable 
rooming-place in a home not likely to cause him em- 
barrassment later. The selection of a bank with which 
to transact his financial affairs is an item of greater 
importance than most school men realize. It is one 
of the first decisions which a new superintendent has 
to make, and once made it is likely to stand as long 
as he is a resident of the community. Sometimes the 
choice is complicated or limited because of the pres- 
ence of a banker on the board of education. In towns 
in which the denomination of the superintendent’s 
choice maintains a church, this problem is quite 
easily solved, but quite often in the smaller places the 
church, of which the superintendent is a member, is 
not represented. In such a case the selection of a 
church home is a very important matter, and there 
are many considerations which enter into the final 
decision. The question of finding satisfactory trad- 
ing places is one that needs to be settled quite early. 
Many invitations will come to the new school man 
and his family to join social clubs, to sing in the church 
choir, to teach a Sunday school class, and to partic- 
ipate in the life of the community in many ways. 
Some of these invitations need to be politely but 
firmly declined, others may be temporarily postponed 
14
-P-A-G-E-25
  
BEFORE SCHOOL OPENS 
until after one has his school organization well in 
hand, and a very few others ought to be accepted. 
None of these decisions ought to be made too rapidly. 
In the work incident to becoming settled in his 
home, many of the businessmen of the town will be met. 
A few days at a local hotel are usually necessary. 
Here his first acquaintance begins. The banker, the 
postmaster, the drayman, the railroad station agent, 
the grocer, the butcher, the dairyman, the furniture 
dealer, the local repair man, the hardware merchant, 
the editor of the newspaper, the insurance agent, the 
coal dealer, and a host of others are soon added to his 
circle of acquaintance. Each individual met is a po- 
tential friend or a potential enemy. By the exercise 
of courtesy and good business sense practically all 
of these potentialities may be converted into friends. 
Each man will go home with the comment that he has 
met the new “professor” and the opinion there ex- 
pressed will largely mould the attitude of the children 
who are to attend the school. These August contacts 
are among the most important factors the new super- 
intendent has to face. 
Getting the school plant in shape 
When affairs at home have progressed to the point 
where a man is no longer required to assist with the 
work of putting the house in order, an intensive study 
of school conditions should be undertaken. First 
on this list should be a thorough examination of the 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
entire school plant. Every detail of it should be 
brought under survey. The physical equipment de- 
termines to a very great degree the possibilities of the 
school system. In some towns the plant has been 
kept in good repair, in other places the plant will re- 
quire much attention to put it into shape for good 
school work. If repairs are needed, the attention of 
the board of education should be called to it at once. 
It is best, however, unless conditions are really bad, 
that the new superintendent should take the equip- 
ment furnished him and use it to the best possible 
advantage. When it is necessary to secure an altera- 
tion of present conditions, the superintendent should 
handle the subject in such a manner that the board 
will recognize the correctness of his diagnosis of the 
situation and the desirability of the solution pro- 
posed. By wise management it is usually possible 
to remedy conditions by taking one thing at a time. 
This does not arouse opposition and, in addition, each 
time the board acts favorably upon a recommenda- 
tion of the superintendent, his prestige is increased. 
x1 Before school opens, the buildings should be thor- 
oughly cleaned, broken window panes should be re- 
placed, outside toilets, if any, should be put into as 
sanitary and respectable a condition as is possible, all 
clocks should be cleaned and regulated, and, if the 
drinking-water is not supplied from a city plant, the 
well should be pumped out and put in good condition. 
The heating plant ought to be examined by a man 
16
-P-A-G-E-27
  BEFORE SCHOOL OPENS 
who knows his business and the boiler should be 
tested if one is used. 
Will the teachers be ready? 
In most localities the teaching staff has been em- 
ployed before the end of the last term of school, but 
frequently resignations come during the summer. 
The superintendent should make sure that all posi- 
tions are filled and that the teachers will be ready for 
duty at the appointed time. If new teachers are 
coming, the superintendent should have on file at his 
office a list of desirable rooming and boarding places, 
as new teachers usually look to their superintendent 
for guidance in these matters. Great care should be 
taken to prevent new teachers from securing rooms 
in wrong places. Asa rule the teachers should reach 
the town not later than Wednesday or Thursday of 
the week before school opens. This gives them time 
to locate rooms, to become familiar with the course 
of study, and to hold informal conferences with their 
superintendent before school opens. 
Are there sufficient textbooks im stock ? 
The superintendent should make sure that a suf- 
ficient number of textbooks are on hand to start the 
class work. Itis better to have half a dozen books 
of a kind in reserve for unexpected enrollments than 
to be short. All new books should be unpacked, 
stamped, numbered, and properly recorded in the 
17 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
book register or card catalogue. Some small sys- 
tems use a central book room where all textbooks are 
stored when not in use. This is a very good plan, as 
the books can then be arranged by grades on shelves 
and can be charged out to teachers conveniently. In 
other places there is a book closet in each classroom. 
A record of all books is indispensable. A very satis- 
factory record can be kept in a card-index box, with 
a separate card for each series of books. Each card 
should contain the title of the book and its distin- 
guishing number, if any; the name of the author, the 
name and address of the publisher, the cost price, the 
number purchased, the date purchased, the total 
number of usable copies on hand, the number of cop- 
ies destroyed or discarded, and any other data which 
may be desired. In systems having more than one 
school building, provision must be made for showing 
where any given set of books is at any particular time. 
Such a book record is worth a great deal more than 
the clerical labor necessary to maintain it, as it will 
save a great deal of time and a great many steps in 
the course of a single year. 
Are the instructional supplies on hand? 
The superintendent should ascertain if sufficient 
supplies are on hand to start the year’s work. When 
times are normal and prices are steady, it is best to 
purchase in May or June a supply of each article 
sufficient to last the entire school year following. 
18
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  BEFORE SCHOOL OPENS 
The supply houses will then have a number of weeks 
in which to fill the order. This makes it possible to 
assemble it and ship it by freight at a considerable 
saving in cost to the purchaser. It can be sent to 
arrive at its destination about August 1oth, and 
thereby prevent exasperating delay in starting any 
particular work. Some of the instructional supplies 
commonly furnished include pens, penholders, pen- 
cils of several sizes and kinds, crayons, blackboard 
erasers, notebook paper and covers, scratch tablets, 
special penmanship practice paper, drawing paper, 
book covers, paints, clay, crayolas, and various kinds 
and colors of paper for kindergarten and primary 
work. Each special department, as music, man- 
ual training, domestic science, or commercial, will 
have special supplies for which provision ought to be 
made in advance if costly delays are to be avoided. 
Have the janitor supplies been provided and the 
fuel stored ? 
There are a number of supplies furnished to jani- 
tors which should be provided in time for him to get 
the building ready. He should be furnished fourteen- 
inch floor brushes, radiator brushes, wall brushes, 
mops, brooms, scrubbing soap, cleaning powder, liq- 
uid soap, paper towels, toilet paper, floor oil or wax, 
sweeping compound, chemically treated dust cloths 
(not feather dusters), disinfectant, rubber tips for all 
movable chairs, dustpans, waste-baskets, and door- 
a9
-P-A-G-E-30
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
mats. If there is electricity in the building, he 
should be provided with a good electric eraser cleaner. 
Fuel is usually purchased in the early summer. It 
should be delivered early in August so that the coal 
dust will not come after the building has been cleaned 
and so that the noise of unloading coal will not inter- 
fere with school work. The writer once taught in 
a community where class work was disorganized for 
a week on account of the noise and dust resulting 
from a September coal delivery, which could have 
been made just as well in August if those in charge 
had thought of it. 
Starting the teachers right’ 
The next matter to occupy the attention of the 
superintendent should be that of getting the teachers 
started right. He should plan to hold a general 
teachers’ meeting on the Saturday before school 
opens, at which time he will explain in detail all of 
those matters which all of the teachers should know 
before school starts. Plans for the year should not be 
discussed at this first meeting because there is such a 
mass of material to present that teachers are likely 
to become confused and forget just what has been 
said. If itis possible to supply teachers with mimeo- 
graphed sheets containing a summary of the instruc- 
tions given at this time, it will be helpful to do so. 
Some one is almost certain to misunderstand or to for- 
get some of the many directions necessarily given. A 
20
-P-A-G-E-31

printed list, which can be referred to again and again, 
will go far to eliminate these errors. Among the items 
for consideration at this first meeting, the following 
are suggested:

2. 
3. a The assignment of teachers. 
Checking up their certification. 
Explanation concerning the course of study, the 
textbooks to be used, the general plan for pro- 
grams, time allotments, the teacher’s daily plan

struction. 
. Lists of pupils belonging in each grade. 
. Detailed plans for playground, hall or basement 
duties. 
. Definite statement of the hours when teachers are 
to be on duty. 
. Attendance and scholarship records.

Method of dismissal.

Uniform methods, such as headings for written 
work, standing to recite, and other pupil habits to

In small schools it is desirable for the superintend- 
ent to hold an informal conference with each teacher 
before scliool opens. At this conference the work of 
2r
-P-A-G-E-32
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
the particular grade or subject to be taught should be 
gone over and the teacher fully informed as to what 
she is expected to accomplish. She can also use this 
opportunity to make inquiry about those matters 
which have been doubtful in her mind. 
Are the necessary printed forms ready? 
Another duty, which the superintendent should 
perform before school opens, is to see that all printed 
blanks and forms necessary to the opening of school 
areon hand. These vary greatly with each individ- 
ual system and superintendent. Some schools use 
almost none, while others have a very elaborate sys- 
tem. Some of these printed forms are letter-heads, 
envelopes, enrollment cards, requisition blanks, pro- 
gram blanks, excuse slips, attendance reports, and 
book record cards. The larger the system the more 
profitable it is to use printed forms. 
The benefit of wise planning 
Ifthe preliminary work has been well done, the 
superintendent will find his time free on the first day 
of school to meet pupils and parents, to go into each 
room for a minute or two just to see if things are 
going right, to assist teachers in starting things 
properly, and to answer questions and meet emergen- 
cies bound to arise in spite of all efforts to solve every 
problem in advance. But what is more essential, 
his school will move forward from the time the bell 
22

rings, pupils will notice that system prevails and will 
so report at home, teachers will feel the inspiration 
of a year well begun, and the superintendent will have 
taken one more step toward that entrenchment in 
the community without which no success is possible.

PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
The school census 
Provision is usually made by State law for an enu- 
meration of all children of school age in the district. 
In a number of the States this census is taken during 
the early summer. An enumerator takesa blank book 
and goes from house to house listing all the children. 
In the past there has been a common practice of look- 
ing over the last year’s record and striking therefrom 
the names of children known to have removed from 
the district and adding names of those known to have 
moved into the district. No great effort is made to 
secure an accurate accounting. This record has usu- 
ally shown the name of the parent, the names of the 
children, and their respective birthdays. When this 
information has been obtained, the book has been 
turned in to some member of the board or to the super- 
intendent’s office. Here it is allowed to rest in peace. 
Such a handling of the census, while very common, 
is not inkeeping with the best practice in progressive 
school systems. 
Uses of the census record 
A school census record has three prominent uses. 
It is frequently made the basis for the distribution of 
24
-P-A-G-E-35
  SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
State school funds. In the past this has constituted 
the principal use made of the record. It should also 
be used as a means of aiding in the enforcement of the 
compulsory education law. Still another use of it, 
which is becoming recognized more and more, is to 
assist in the organization of the school, including the 
distribution of teachers, the location and erection of 
new buildings, and the placing of district boundaries: 
The census record must be accurate 
In the past, school officials have not been greatly 
concerned in regard to the taking of the census. In 
a number of places the task of taking the enumera- 
tion has been awarded to some petty politician as a 
means of paying a political debt, or to some poor 
widow as a matter of charity. Perhaps this did not 
matter greatly as long as the old idea of the census 
record prevailed. But, with the changing concep- 
tion of the importance of the record in school admin- 
istration, superintendents ought to insist that the 
only argument for employing a particular individual 
to make the enumeration is that it will be done ac- 
curately and painstakingly. It should be taken in 
larger communities under the direction of, and prob- 
ably by, the attendance officer of the district. In 
smaller schools it should be under the direction of 
the superintendent of schools, and can well be taken 
by the principal of the high school or an elementary- 
school principal or teacher. At any rate, the one 
25
-P-A-G-E-36
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS | 
doing the work should know the importance of a 
complete, accurate, and systematic census and make 
every effort to secure it. Ifit is paid for at the rate 
of five or six cents a name, a competent individual 
can be secured to handle it. 
Loose-leaf blanks recommended 
The old blank book which has been used in the past 
should be discarded in favor of the more advanta- 
geous loose-leaf record blank. This blank contains 
space for the following information: name of child; 
date of birth — year, month, day; age at last birth- 
day; whether boy or girl; birthplace of child and of 
his father; names of father and mother; the residence; 
kind of school the child attends — public, private, 
parochial; employment record including name and 
address of employer; and information regarding any 
special defects, such as blindness, deafness, or any- 
thing else likely to interfere with his attendance or 
progress at school. A very satisfactory blank for this 
purpose is found in the Strayer-Englehardt School 
Record Card Series. 
Using the block map 
Before the enumerator begins his work, a map of the 
city showing every street and house in the city should 
be prepared, and if there is outlying territory in the 
district this should be included. The blocks of the 
city may be numbered and this indicated along with 
26
-P-A-G-E-37
  SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
the residence, as it is frequently desirable in planning 
for building accommodations to know just exactly the 
number and character of families residing in any given 
part of the city. When these data have been trans- 
ferred to the Permanent Census Card, described later, 
it will be possible to sort the information out in a very 
short time. The enumerator can go up one side 
of the street and down the other. Note should be 
made of any place where people are not at home, and 
the data secured from such places later. 
Difficulties encountered with non-English-speaking people 
In almost every community the enumerator will 
encounter a few difficulties, and he should endeavor 
to provide against them as far as he can. If the dis- 
trict contains non-English-speaking adults, it will be 
found best to have an interpreter accompany him, in 
case he does not speak their language himself. Cer- 
tain groups of foreigners do not understand what the 
census is, and feel that it is an attempt of the govern- 
ment to find out something about them which will 
cause trouble. The result frequently is that they re- 
fuse to give any information at all, or make it so dif- 
ficult to get the tiniest fragment that it consumes 
an unreasonable amount of time. Another difficulty 
found, especially among foreign people, but also to 
some extent among others, is that the name given the 
enumerator by the parent is not the name used by 
the child at school. Some common nicknames are 
27
-P-A-G-E-38
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
readily translated, such as “Katie” for “Kathryn”; 
but when such “home” names as “Charlie” become 
“Stanislaus” at school, the difficulty is readily ap- 
parent. The enumerator must take special care to 
spell the family name correctly. Especially with 
foreign people is there need for caution. In one case 
which came to the writer’s notice the name “‘Korgie” 
appeared on the census record, but when the child 
was finally located in a parochial school, his name 
was found to be ‘ Kolodziej.” There is a tendency 
on the part of parents of children reaching the end of 
the compulsory school period to give the ages of their 
children as a year or two older than is actually the 
case. This is one of the reasons why the enumerator 
should always indicate the authority for the child’s 
age. If possible he should see the birth certificate, 
the passport, or even the family Bible record. 
Permanent School Census Card 
The data secured by the enumerator should be 
transferred to a Permanent School Census Card, 
which should be filed in the superintendent’s office. 
If the card used is 5 X 8 and one card is used for each 
child living in the city, the information needed to 
keep the record “alive” can be easily put upon it. 
At the top of the card should appear the child’s name 
with the last name first; the native country of himself 
and his father; the names of his father and mother or 
guardian; whether boy or girl; his date of birth, year, 
28
-P-A-G-E-39
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
month, day, and the authority for this date; whether 
he is of the white, black, or yellow race. Below this 
there should be a sufficient number of lines to contain 
his record throughout his school career. This part of 
the card should show his age in years and months on 
September 1st; his residence; the school attended; 
grade; month and day he entered; cause of non- 
enrollment or late entrance; times absent during the 
year; chief cause of absence; month and day of his 
withdrawal and the cause thereof. The card found 
in the Strayer-Englehardt School Record Card Se- 
ries is quite adequate. The back of this card con- 
tains a record of the child’s employment upon leaving 
school. It is unnecessary in this day to argue the ad- 
vantages of a card-index system of record of this na- 
ture. The cards can be sorted into any type of data 
required and restored to their original form in a 
very short time. This feature alone makes the card- 
index superior to the book record, even if there were 
not a number of other points in its favor. 
Keeping the record “alive” 
After the record is once established, it is important 
that it be kept “alive” by frequent revision. It 
should be checked over with the new census each year 
before school opens and brought up to date as far as 
possible. During the school year, whenever a new 
pupil enters from another city, or when one leaves 
for some other town, the census card should be ad- 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
justed to correspond. Arrangements can be made 
with transfer companies to report to the school 
authorities all changes in residence of families moved 
in their vans. 
Check enrollment against census 
In communities fortunate enough to have only a 
public school system, the problem of keeping children 
in school is greatly simplified. In such places the list 
of children likely to attend each room can be made 
out before the opening of school in the fall. But 
where there are parochial schools or private schools, 
it will be necessary to wait until after school opens be- 
fore completing the check. Just as soon as possible— 
probably the second day — after school opens, the en- 
rollment cards should be checked against the census 
cards. With two people working on this, it should be 
completed before the beginning of the second week or 
earlier. 
In a small city having about two thousand names 
on the school census, it was discovered through such 
a check that there were two hundred ‘and seventy- 
four names of children of compulsory school age on 
the census record which were not upon the en- 
rollment records of either the public or parochial 
schools. There were a number of children enrolled 
whose names were not on the census record. Such a 
condition will probably be found in any community 
of seven or eight thousand inhabitants. 
3°
-P-A-G-E-41
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
Investigation of non-atiendance 
As soon as the check is completed, the names of 
children of compulsory school age who are not in 
school should be listed and an investigation begun to 
ascertain the cause of non-enrollment. If there area 
large number of names, it is best to send a postal card 
or circular letter to the parent of each such child, 
politely calling his attention to the fact that the rec- 
ords do not show his child is enrolled in school, that 
the compulsory education law requires the attend- 
ance of the child, and asking him either to cause the 
child to enroll at once or consult the superintendent 
(or the attendance officer in larger communities) if 
there is any proper reason why his child should not be 
required to attend school. Usually the results of this 
letter will dispose of a number of the cases. The 
names remaining on the original list may be investi- 
gated by telephone where possible, or a truant officer 
may be sent to look them up. He should make care- 
ful memoranda on all cases handled by him and turn 
them in at the office, where they will be helpful in dis- 
posing of cases which have to be handled later. 
Worthy exemption claims 
This procedure will bring in most of the absen- 
tees except those who make claim to an exemption. 
These persons should present their claims to the 
superintendent (or attendance officer). After a care- 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ful inquiry into the facts in each case, it is usually 
possible to distinguish the exemption claims which 
are worthy and those which are not. The State law 
generally makes provision to exempt those children 
who find it necessary to support themselves or their 
families, provided the child has reached a certain age; 
those who are physically or mentally incapacitated; 
and sometimes one or two other exemptions are al- 
lowed. The chief difficulty comes in the first class of 
cases. The superintendent must ascertain the actual 
facts in each case, which should be supported by 
affidavits. 
Unworthy exemption claims 
The unworthy claims for exemption are most dif- 
ficult to handle. Asa rule the parent does not make 
the request for exemption until after one or two visits 
from the truant officer. There seem to be about four 
general classes of unworthy claims. First, there is 
the individual man of means who cannot see past the 
dollar. One instance which once came to the atten- 
tion of the author is typical. The father owned three 
hundred and twenty acres of land worth at least two 
hundred dollars per acre. His daughter was an in- 
telligent girl of good size, who had made good prog- 
ress in her school work in the rural schools. When 
the family moved into town, she had nearly a year 
left before reaching her limit of the compulsory school 
age. She secured a job in a produce establishment 
32
-P-A-G-E-43
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
candling eggs at two dollars per day. The father, 
after being interviewed by the truant officer, came 
to the office to claim exemption on the ground that 
labor was scarce and the girl’s help was needed. The 
matter was placed before the council of defense 
which advised that the girl should be sent to school. 
The father refused to do this. A complaint was 
filed in the juvenile court. The father employed one 
of the best attorneys in the county to defend the case, 
and, only when the court decreed that the girl must 
attend school and threatened to prosecute the father 
on the charge of contributing to his daughter’s delin- 
quency, did he consent to allow her to enter school. 
A second class of unworthy claims are those advanced 
where the parent or child thinks the school has 
nothing to offer which will do the child any good. 
This charge is too often true. If we are to compel 
the attendance at school of all children, school au- 
thorities must see to it that the curriculum con- 
tains an equal opportunity for all children. Wher- 
ever the curriculum is rich in content and vitalized in 
method, it will be possible to place the child in work 
adapted to his individual needs. The third class of 
unworthy claims are those in which the child involved 
is within a few months of the compulsory age limit. 
Where there is enough time to make the instruction 
at all worth while, school authorities must insist upon 
the child’s attendance. Any other course will lead to 
complications and unnecessary difficulties in enforc- 
33 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ing the law in other cases. There is a fourth class 
of cases in which the parents are unable to agree on 
the child’s attendance; one parent insisting that the 
child attend while the other parent takes the oppo- 
siteposition. Oftenseveral of these factors are present 
in the same case. The only thing the superintendent 
can do is to handle each case on its merits, keeping in 
mind all the time that he is the representative of so- 
ciety and the State, which desires to keep every child 
in school just as long as possible within the limits it 
has laid down. 
Enforcing the compulsory attendance law in the courts 
When all other means have failed, the superin- 
tendent must either yield the point or go into the 
courts to enforce it. If the court officials are in sym- 
pathy with the school, the superintendent who has a 
good case may feel certain of support. It happens 
too frequently that the court officials are more con- 
cerned about politics than about school. In such 
cases the enforcement of the law is almost out of the 
question. 
The attendance officer 
After all the children of the community are either 
enrolled in school or are legally absent, the attend- 
ance problem shifts from getting the children into 
school to keeping them there after they are once in. 
Nearly every school has a truant officer of more or 
34  
-P-A-G-E-45
TSS OE: Ce en Oe oS Toke egy er aoe pig cs ae 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
less efficiency. It is difficult to find a man who com- 
bines all the qualities needed in such an officer. He 
should be a man of good standing in the community; 
one who has tact, judgment, firmness, and sympathy 
with education; he must possess the ability to do 
a thing well and without delay; he must have the 
physical ability to get around quickly, and a thorough 
knowledge of the geography of the community is 
indispensable. In the larger towns the attendance 
officer who is on full time may perform these duties. 
Where the city is not large enough to justify the em- 
ployment of a full-time attendance officer, one should 
be employed for part time either at a fixed compen- 
sation per month or by the trip. When paid by the 
trip, thirty-five to fifty cents is the price frequently 
paid. It should always be kept in mind that a truant 
officer who is efficient prevents many cases of delin- 
quency from arising at all, as well as handling those 
individuals who do require his services. 
Handling truancy complaints 
A school system should have a simple and effi- 
cient system of handling truancy complaints. Most of 
the cases will be reported from within the system, al- 
though occasionally reports will come from policemen 
and interested citizens. A teacher should check the 
attendance of the room in her charge immediately 
after the session of school opens. Within the first ten 
minutes all suspicious cases should be reported to the 
35    
-P-A-G-E-46
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
principal of the building. The principal should at 
once investigate these cases by telephone, by inquir- 
ing from other members of the family in attendance 
at school, and in other ways which local conditions 
will suggest. Cases still nendent attention should 
be reported to the superinten: ent’s office before the 
end of the first half-hour of the session. Complaints

daily at these hours. In handling these complaints 
the use of a 3 X 5 card similar to the one shown in 
Fig. 1 will make it easier to keep track of the cases. 
After the case is investigated, the truant officer 
makes his report on the bottom of the card. Wher- 
ever it is possible, the truant officer should compel 
the truant to accompany him back to his schoolroom. 
Where parents are at fault, as is frequently the case, 
the viewpoint of the school should be definitely and 
firmly presented to them. In last resorts, it may be 
necessary to resort to the juvenile court to insure 
constant and uninterrupted attendance.

THE COURSE OF STUDY 
‘A common method used in making courses of study © 
Aw observing member of a board of education in a 
small town, where the superintendent changed every 
year or two, once defined the course of study as that 
thing which every new superintendent found it neces- 
sary to revise immediately after his arrival upon the 
scene of action. When he had obtained the necessary 
permission from the board of education — for boards 
of education in small places are usually extremely 
jealous of their authority in these important matters 
— the first thing the newly arrived superintendent 
did was to send out to New York, Chicago, Boston, 
and all the more important cities in his section of the 
country, for copies of their courses of study. After 
these had been received, the new superintendent 
would spend sometimes as much as a week in looking 
over them to see which one contained the best ideas 
according to his notion of what a school should be. 
Then for a number of days this dignified and impor- 
tant school executive would busy himself laboriously 
copying a little from this source and a little from that. 
At length — like all bad dreams — this process came 
to an end, and lo! Squash Center had a new course 
38

of study, hand-made, and guaranteed to be all wool 
and a yard wide! Ifthe district had a surplus in its 
treasury, the local printer got a job, and in a few 
more weeks several hundred copies of this wonderful 
document were ready for distribution to the “fac- 
ulty” —of perhaps eight or ten teachers — and to 
distinguished citizens of the community. 
The ‘‘course of study” produced by this method 
After admiring the picture of the school building 
printed on the bright red cover, and after studying 
the half-tone reproduction of the likeness of the new 
school administrator on the first page, the teacher of 
grade six would turn over a few pages to see what 
work was assigned to her grade. There she would 
discover helpful information which appeared usually 
in about this form: 
Sixth Grade

Reading. . . .Killum’s Sixth Year in Reading. 
It goes without saying that such a course of study 
is practically worthless so far as concerns assisting 
the teacher to organize her instruction around prob- 
lems of vital significance to the children in her charge. 
It does not help her to decide upon what topics the 
39 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
emphasis should be placed. It gives her no clue as to 
methods which other teachers have successfully used 
in presenting sections of the material to be studied. 
There is nothing to indicate where she may find refer- 
ence books and illustrative materials which will be 
valuable to her and her class as the year’s work pro- 
gresses. 
The modern course of study 
The modern course of study is a very different 
thing. It not only indicates the scope of the work 
for the grade, but it enumerates the topics to be 
studied and indicates a method of approach to them. 
It suggests problems for study. Outside readings 
are listed. Local associations are given. The rela- 
tive value of each topic is shown by the indication of 
the amount of time it is to be given. A number of 
lesson plans are included. These plans represent the 
most successful lessons that former teachers have 
been able to conduct. All pupils are not expected to 
do the same amount of work. A minimum amount 
is prescribed which is low enough that any child with 
anything like normal intelligence can reasonably be 
expected to do it in a satisfactory manner. Other 
matter is listed as optional which may be assigned to 
pupils able to do more than the minimum amount 
of work. In other cases alternatives are indicated 
which the teacher may substitute for certain topics. 
All of the topics listed for study have been carefully 
40 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
THE COURSE OF STUDY 
selected with the needs of the child in mind. The 
teacher is allowed large liberty in meeting the in- 
dividual needs of pupils and in following out special 
lines of interest. She is not expected to follow the 
course of study in an unthinking, slavish fashion. 
She is expected to motivate the class work, to see that 
the children are presented with real problems, to re- 
quire them to think for themselves, to remove the 
emphasis from mere memory work and place it upon 
thought. Under such conditions no teacher can de- 
generateintoa mereautomaton. The course of study 
ought also to prescribe the time allotments for the 
several subjects. These should not be in the nature 
of absolute requirements, but should be flexible 
enough to permit of variation whenever a reasonable 
need appears. Some modern courses of study suggest 
a maximum and a minimum amount of time for each 
subject and leave it to the teacher and the principal 
of the building to work out the exact time for any 
given subject within these prescribed limits. The 
course of study has been built for the particular com- 
munity in which it is to be used. It is not the work 
of one “master” mind, but is the product of the en- 
tire teaching corps. 
Dr. McMurry’s criteria for making and judging 
curricula 
In the Teachers College Record for September, 1915, 
Dr. F. M. McMurry states the following five work- 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ing principles for guidance in making and judging 
curricula: 
x. The subject-matter for a curriculum should be se- 
lected from among those experiences that are re- 
lated to life and are likely, owing to their intrinsic 
nature, to appeal to the pupils directly as worth 
while. 
2. At the present time the form of organization most 
worthy of emphasis for subject-matter that is pri- 
marily intellectual — and this covers at least the 
more significant part of each branch of study in the 
curriculum — is that of the problem accompanied 
by such data as are necessary for its solution. The 
desirable basis of organization for subject-matter 
involving for the most part the emotional element 
or motor activity, is some specific need or want; but 
it is a kind of want or need that makes us less 
conscious of the facts or intellectual processes that 
meet it than does the problem proper. 
3. The relative importance of subject-matter, deter- 
mining its final admission into the curriculum and 
its relative prominence there, must depend mainly 
upon its relative importance in social life, and the 
pertinency of its relations to the purposes of the 
school. 
4. The curriculum should make important provision for 
easy control over knowledge on the parts of pupils. 
5. Since every child differs more or less from every 
other in native endowment, past experience, and 
present environment, the curriculum should be so 
arranged as to be in the highest degree adaptable to 
each pupil. 
42
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 
The modern course of study is prepared by the 
superintendent and his teachers 
Modern courses of study are the result of a hearty 
codperation between the superintendent and his 
teachers. In very small schools it is likely best to 
have the entire corps work on one subject at a tim 
under the immediate direction of the superintend- 
ent. In larger school systems it is customary to have 
this work done by committees of teachers appointed 
by the superintendent or elected by the teachers. A 
committee of this kind should number about seven 
or nine, since this makes it large enough to secure 
different points of view and it is small enough to sit 
around one table and work out problems together. 
In selecting members for such a committee, the su- 
perintendent should try to secure representation of 
as many elements as he can. It is usual to have a 
teacher of each grade or department, a principal, a 
subject-matter expert, and some one who is especially 
strong on the method side placed on the committee. 
Preparing teachers for this work 
A superintendent should not expect to take a corps 
of teachers who have never done work of this sort and 
start them out on such a plan without previous train- 
ing. In one school system the new superintendent 
devoted the general teachers’ meetings for over five 
months to developing the point of view he wished the 
43
-P-A-G-E-54
  
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
teachers to have. He directed the professional read- 
ing of the corps, he brought in experts from the out- 
side for lectures along the line he wished to emphasize, 
he placed material in the hands of teachers showing 
what other schools of the same class had done along 
this line. By these means he gradually led up to the 
appointment of the committees. But his work did 
not stop there. He met the committees for the first 
few times as they began their work. He supplied 
them with typewritten suggestions, with reference 
material bearing directly upon the subject in hand, 
with outlines of the work they would have need to 
consider. Only after these efforts did he allow the 
committee to go at their problem alone. 
A concrete illustration of the new method

he placed the following typewritten outline in the 
hands of the members of the committee:

The committee was asked to read the books indi- 
cated, copies of which were placed in the Teachers’ 
Library. The outline then formed the basis for dis- 
cussion at the next two meetings of the committee 
and the superintendent. A general agreement was 
reached on each of the points under discussion. 
When this had been accomplished, the chairman of 
the committee took charge of the work. The com- 
mittee secured copies of the best courses of study in 
geography and examined them carefully in the light 
of the ideals set up in the preliminary meetings. 
These were analyzed and reported upon to the com- 
mittee. A survey of the community was undertaken 
to ascertain what geographical materials were at 
hand. When all of these data had been assembled 
and worked over, the several members of the com- 
mittee were each made responsible for some particu- 
lar feature of the work. These statements, outlines, 
plans, and what-not were debated by the committee 
and reduced to a final form. When the entire course 
of study had thus been completed, it was typewritten 
on loose-leaf sheets and supplied to the teachers for 
trial. Careful check was kept on the work during the 
first year of its use. Toward the end of the year the 
committee made necessary corrections and revisions. 
It was again put up in loose-leaf typewritten form so 
46
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 
that from time to time parts of it might be changed 
without destroying the whole work. In larger sys- 
tems the copies might be mimeographed to advantage. 
The superiority of this method 
What is the value of such a method of making a 
course of study? First, it increases the efficiency of 
the teaching force by securing the thoughtful partici- 
pation of teachers in the work and responsibility in- 
volved. No teacher can go through such training for 
a year without learning many things which were 
unknown to her before. It quickens her mind. It 
brushes away the cobwebs. It stimulates her think- 
ing. Asa result of these things she is a better teacher. 
The chief business of the superintendent of schools is 
to improve the quality of instruction. Measured by 
this standard, the type of work suggested is abun- 
dantly worth while. In the second place, it brings 
about team-work between the superintendent and his 
teachers, and among the teachers themselves. One 
may reasonably expect to see favorable results follow 
any well-directed effort toward codperation. It goes 
a long way toward establishing mutual confidence and 
good-will. 
Standards by which local courses of study may be 
checked 
In the paragraphs immediately following will be 
found a brief treatment of present tendencies in each 
47
-P-A-G-E-58
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
of the several subjects usually found in courses of 
study. A superintendent who finds his course of 
study in harmony with these statements may feel 
reasonably sure that he is headed in the right direc- 
tion. 
a. Reading. Reading is now taught largely for the 
purpose of putting the child in possession of a tool 
with which he may continue his education. He is 
taught to get meaning from the printed page, since 
nearly all of the reading he will do in the future will be 
for this purpose. He must learn to do this with speed 
and accuracy. It follows that large amounts of si- 
lent reading must be done by the child. He should 
secure an acquaintance with leading authors, his vo- 
cabulary should be enlarged, he should learn how to 
read for the pleasure there isin it. No single type of 
school reader should find exclusive place in such a 
program. Wide variety increases the social view of 
the pupil. Literature, history, science, travel, ad- 
venture, biography, politics, and social relations may 
well find place in a modern course of study. Each 
grade should have a dozen or more sets of supple- 
mentary readers. Unless adequate provision for 
practice is made, the necessary skill in rapid, thought- 
ful reading cannot be developed. The traditional 
amount of oral reading should be greatly reduced, 
especially from the fourth grade up. 
6. Language. Formal grammar as such has no 
place in the modern course of study in elementary 
| 48
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 
schools. Language is another tool subject. The aim 
is to enable a child to speak and write English in a 
clean-cut, interesting manner. Common errors of 
speech are weeded out by drill which is thoroughly 
motivated. Correct speech is a matter of habit. It 
is governed by the same psychological laws as any 
other habit. Oral work lies at the foundation, and 
must precede written work. Teachers must insist 
that children speak in clean-cut short sentences, 
loudly enough that the boy in the back seat on the 
far side of the class may hear easily every word 
which is uttered. In written work no child in the 
elementary school should be asked to produce at one 
time more than one paragraph of not over twenty 
lines. Very few technicalities should be taught. 
In the lower grades probably the use of capital 
letters and the period should be all the technical items 
treated. The important thing to keep in mind is that 
we have been trying to teach too much in the past, 
and as a result have taught nothing well. In both 
oral and written work a premium should be placed 
on the thought side. Figurative language, original- 
ity, color, vividness, life, imagination are the things 
which should be sought. The average teacher will 
entirely neglect these things in her mad search for 
such mechanical elements as commas, quotation 
marks, and the exclamation point. Composition sub- 
jects should be so chosen as to make impossible the 
common habit of “cataloguing” a series of common- 
49 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
place events in chronological order. A great step 
forward will be taken whenever the course of study 
succeeds in convincing the classroom teacher that 
content is always dominant and form always subor- 
dinate. 
c. Spelling. Spelling may be combined with the 
language work. It is important that the course of 
study shall limit the required list of words to those 
which the pupil will likely have some occasion to use 
in his written English. There are probably not more 
than three thousand or four thousand such words; 
some authorities believe there are even less than 
these numbers needed. Absolute mastery of these 
words must be secured. The course of study should 
make plain to teachers that the teaching of the spell- 
ing lesson is the important part of it; the testing is 
merely incidental. It is especially necessary that 
the course of study contain the very best sugges- 
tions possible as to methods of teaching this subject. 
Teachers need to greatly improve their technique of 
teaching spelling and the course of study ought to 
lead them in the right direction. The final test of the 
effectiveness of spelling teaching is also found in the 
daily work of the pupil rather than in the regular 
spelling period. The course of study should make 
provision for instruction in the use of the dictionary. 
d. Handwriting. Handwriting is also a tool sub- 
ject. Its aim as a subject in schooi is to enable a 
pupil to write a neat, legible hand at a rapid speed 
5°
-P-A-G-E-61
THE COURSE OF STUDY 
which nevertheless can be maintained indefinitely 
without fatigue. It is not intended that the school 
shall undertake to turn out people who can write 
cards on a little table at the county fair. It is im- 
portant that the course of study in handwriting 
shall set up certain definite standards of attainment 
for each grade in both quality and speed. The test 
of the effectiveness of the teaching of this subject is 
found, not in the formal writing period, but in the 
type of work habitually dashed off by the pupil in the 
preparation of his daily lessons. Whenever a pupil 
reaches the prescribed standards on this daily work, 
the course of study may well allow him to be excused 
from the formal writing exercise so long as the satis- 
factory daily work continues. 
e. Arithmetic. Arithmetic is a tool subject and 
must be taught as such. The course of study should 
keep in mind that the aim of this subject is to enable 
the child leaving the elementary school to solve the 
mathematical problems of everyday life with speed 
and accuracy. This means that when he has mas- 
tered the four fundamental operations in the use of 
whole numbers and fractions, common and decimal, 
he has mastered the essentials of arithmetic. Beyond 
this the only work in arithmetic that is desirable in 
the elementary school is a practical understanding of 
that form of decimals known as percentage with its 
business applications. All such time-honored topics 
as Troy Weight, Apothecaries’ Weight, Annual In- 
51 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS ' 
terest, Compound Proportion, Greatest Common 
Divisor, Least Common Multiple, Partnership, Re- 
duction, Cases in Percentage, Longitude and Time, 
and a score of others either should be eliminated en- 
tirely or touched upon merely in an informational 
manner. On the other hand, many progressive 
courses of study are now dealing in the upper grades 
with such informational topics as business at a bank, 
building and loan associations, life insurance, saving 
and investing money, the marks of a good invest- 
ment, and other similar subjects. 
f. Geography. ‘Geography is the study of the 
earth as the home of the occupations of man.” 
(Dewey.) In the best schools geography is no longer 
taught largely from the standpoint of location. The 
modern stress is upon the relationship. No school 
subject has a content more rich than geography. 
The traditional method of prescribing the work in the 
course of study by specifying certain pages in a text- 
book must be abandoned in a modern course of study. 
Geography is so much bigger than any textbook, and 
so much more local in its application than any text- 
book could possibly be, that its greatest value to the 
child is found, not in memorizing the pages of a text- 
book, but in giving opportunity for the child to im- 
agine, think, and act. The course of study that is 
based upon the child’s personal needs and present in- 
terests will be found to be a stimulating one. Geog- 
raphy should be presented largely in the form of 
52 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE COURSE OF STUDY 
problems. ‘‘Where did my breakfast come from?” 
“Should the United States intervene in Mexico?” 
“What nations, from the standpoint of material re- 
sources, are capable of producing another world war?” 
“What makes the wind blow?” All these and many 
other problems are vital to the child. The course of 
study should make liberal provision for the use of 
supplementary books, the use of stereographs, lantern 
slides, pictures, the sand table, excursions, victrola 
music, and all kinds of experiences. The subject is 
so broad that it must be worked out carefully with 
the community in which it is to be taught clearly in 
mind. Even then the teacher should be granted 
large liberty in the selection of her materials for study. 
g. History and Civics. Like geography, history is a 
subject filled with social problems, and these should 
predominate. There is no longer any excuse for mem- 
orizing unrelated and unimportant facts of history. 
History should be presented as a series of problems 
for pupils to solve. It must be changed from a mem- 
ory subject to a means of making social analysis. 
The past merely as past is of no significance whatever. 
The past as an explanation of the present is of vast 
importance. The course of study should emphasize 
the social aspect of history. It should lead to an 
appreciation of American ideals and institutions. It 
must be made dynamic. Much elimination from the 
old traditional topics is noticeable in modern courses 
of study. The aim of history is to enable the pupil to 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
appreciate the values of social life. All else must be 
subordinated to this purpose. 
Civics in the elementary schools aims to provide 
the pupil with essential civic knowledge, to help him 
form certain civic habits and attitudes, and to de- 
velop his civic skills through practice in citizenship. 
It is most satisfactory when, by selection of problems 
nearest at hand, it is made a concrete laboratory 
study. Actual vital civic problems and movements 
of such character as the child can understand are 
made the starting points, and through these the 
fundamental civic principles are taught. Much ob- 
solete and useless material, formerly included in 
courses in civics, is now eliminated. Among these 
topics may be mentioned the theory of bicameral 
legislation, the formal study of the constitution of the 
State and of the United States, and all abstract politi- 
cal theory that has no direct connection with civic 
virtues and conduct. 
h. Hygiene. ‘The modern course of study deals 
with hygiene rather than with physiology. The dis- 
tinction between these terms represents the changed 
conception of the character of the subject-matter to 
be presented. No longer do we require a pupil to 
memorize the names of all the bones in the body while 
at the same time we leave him free to sleep with all 
the windows of his bedroom closed without protest. 
Hygiene must be taught in such a way as to become 
functional. The premium is put upon habit for- 
54
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 
mation. If the course of study runs in this direction 
it is on the right track. 
t. Music and Drawing. Music is an appreciation 
subject. For this reason the course of study should 
make liberal provision for cultivating this side of a 
child’s life. The public elementary school is not the 
place to give a finished education in the technique of 
music. The course of study should lay the emphasis 
upon developing a love for the better things of music 
rather than attempt to insist that the child acquire 
a mass of useless technical knowledge. Provision 
should be made for “listening” lessons, as well as the 
usual type of singing. A victrola and an adequate 
library of well-selected records should be in every 
school. 
Drawing, or art, is taught because through it the 
child develops the ability to express himself, cultivates 
good taste in color and design while producing beauty 
in both, and finds an interest in and appreciation of 
the beauty all about him in nature and in the accom- 
plishments of artists, whatever mediums have been 
used by them to accomplish their self-expression. 
The course of study should make possible the realiza- 
tion of these aims. 
j. Manual Arts. Manual training in the case of 
smaller schools means principally woodwork for 
boys, although here and there some work in metals, 
leather, printing, or electricity may be offered. Its 
primary aim is to give the boy an appreciation of the 
55 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
materials, processes, and products of a large section 
of adult industry. It also aims to give him a certain 
sense of reality as to the nature of work. Wood of 
many kinds should pass through his hands, as should 
also many other materials such as oils, varnishes, and 
paints. Boys are expected to acquire a facility in the 
use of tools. Every project should take some useful 
form. 
k. Household Arts. This course should give a 
survey of the whole field of household arts, placing 
the emphasis upon the topics of food, shelter, and 
clothing. Care must be taken to keep the instruc- 
tional material of such a character that the girls can 
profit by its use. The value of the course lies largely 
in the experimental opportunities provided. An ap- 
preciation of the home should be cultivated, and girls 
should be prepared to be more efficient home-makers. 
A considerable body of knowledge regarding foods and 
textiles should be taught and definite instruction rela- 
tive to purchases should be included. The subject- 
matter of this course will vary widely as it is still too 
new a field for standardization.

NV 
CLASSROOM VISITATION AS A MEANS 
OF SUPERVISION 
Its high value is not always appreciated 
Wirnovt doubt classroom visitation of the right sort is 
the most important and far-reaching single agency of 
supervision available to a superintendent of schools. 
It is one of the most difficult features of a superin- 
tendent’s work to perform well. It is often perfunc- 
tory. It is much easier for one to become an office 
superintendent, a building superintendent, or a busi- 
ness superintendent. One can easily contrive to busy 
himself on easy tasks in the office which occupy his 
time so fully that he has little time left for visiting. 
In such cases he frequently finds it possible to drop 
into a classroom for only a few minutes at a time and 
separated by long intervals. If all seems to be going 
fairly well, he quietly slips out and shortly forgets all 
about it. The teacher is left to work out her own sal- 
vation. The superintendent forms his judgment of 
her work as good or poor on his general impression 
without any very careful analysis, and if she sinks be- 
low a certain vague level of performance, the teacher 
is usually dropped at the end of the year without very 
much warning. This type of “supervision” has been 
all too common in the past, even in many of our so- 
called better school systems. 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
Supervision should be constructive 
The purpose of this chapter is to indicate how class- 
room visitation may be made a really effective means 
of improving the quality of the instruction offered by 
the teachers of a school system. It is assumed at the 
beginning that the purpose of all supervision is con- 
structive. A superintendent is not a detective, a 
judge, or an inspector. He is there to render much 
more valuable service. He is there to improve the 
teaching. If he visits a teacher with only a critical, 
dictatorial attitude, he cannot hope to see her best 
work. His attitude must be one of sympathy and 
leadership. He must be master of the situation, and 
mastery comes only by knowing and understanding 
all the factors involved. He must know the psychol- 
ogy of childhood, the present-day standards of good 
teaching, and the principles which underlie these 
standards. A reasonable amount of the subject- 
matter under observation, and the best methods of 
teaching this to children should be known. Most 
superintendents are likely to fall short on some of these 
points. Only by being a constant student of educa- 
tion can a superintendent hope to keep himself in- 
formed along all of these lines. It is imperative that 
he keep in touch with the recent literature as found in 
professional magazines, books, and surveys. Besides 
these points, the superintendent must form the habit 
of practicing professional classroom visitation at all 
58
-P-A-G-E-69
  CLASSROOM VISITATION 
times. Every recitation witnessed must be analyzed 
and a judgment of its merits formed. Failure to do 
this will lead to the habit of being content with a 
general impression, and this is fatal to good super- 
vision. 
A plan for visiting is necessary 
Authorities are in general agreement that the su- 
perintendent of a small school system should devote 
at least one half of all his time to constructive super- 
vision. This means that he will have some plan of 
work so that he really gets out of his office and into 
the classrooms a good part of the school day. Some 
successful superintendents plan to devote Tues- 
day, Wednesday, and Thursday to classroom visita- 
tion and Monday and Friday to office work. This 
plan is varied enough to avoid the impression that 
supervision is always confined to these days. No 
hard-and-fast rule can be laid down for any of these 
matters. The superintendent is expected to have 
ordinary common sense and to use it.   
      
Frequency of visits 
How often visits should be made to each teacher 
depends entirely upon circumstances. In a school of 
fifteen teachers or less, visits will likely be more fre- 
quent than in a system employing fifty teachers. A 
good rule to keep in mind is that visits should not be 
so frequent as to give rise to a panicky feeling among 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  " MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS | 
the corps. On the other hand, when some special 
problem is being studied, it may be wise to visit the 
same class several days in succession. Some teachers 
will require more attention than others. 
The superintendent's manner in the classroom 
The superintendent in visiting a classroom will find 
it best to face the class so that he may note their re- 
actions. Sometimes it is well to remain behind or at 
one side of the class, in order to know if pupils speak 
so that all members may hear the discussion. A 
classroom should be entered quietly so that no un- 
necessary distraction of attention will occur. Asa 
rule the superintendent should not take notes in the 
classroom. This is usually noticed by the teacher 
and frequently disconcerts her, making the remainder 
of her work poor. It is likely to be noticed by pupils, 
and they will almost always draw the conclusion that 
the superintendent has noted something wrong. The 
best plan to follow is to make a mental note of the 
points involved, and as soon as the superintendent 
leaves the class he may make the proper record in his 
visiting book. If it should be absolutely necessary to 
make notes during the visit, it should be done incon- 
spicuously. 
A record of visits is advisable 
It is well for the superintendent to keep a visiting 
book in which he may make a record of the visits, the 
60
-P-A-G-E-71
CLASSROOM VISITATION 
procedure noted, points worthy of commendation, 
suggestions, and physical conditions of the room. 
There should be room to note what follow-up efforts 
have been made and the reaction of the teacher to the 
suggestions. A convenient form for such a record is 
shown below on pages 62 and 63. 
This is printed on loose-leaf notebook paper of a 
size which can be carried in the pocket conveniently. 
After the superintendent has made a series of visits, 
he can remove the leaves from his book, review their 
contents, and possibly find some topics which can be 
treated in bulletins. Other topics will call for per- 
sonal conferences. A general group meeting may be 
necessary to discuss certain other topics. These rec- 
ords should be carefully filed. When a superintend- 
ent plans to visit a certain teacher, it is desirable to go 
over the sheets dealing with previous visits to her 
class. Many little points will thus be called to mind 
and the superintendent may keep them in mind while 
making the visit. By keeping a carefully entered 
“follow-up” on these sheets there will be available at 
all times a complete record of the supervision given 
to each teacher. If one notes that a certain specific 
criticism has been made on a particular teacher’s 
work on repeated visits, and these criticisms have been 
discussed with the teacher, it is evident that she is fail- 
ing in the item under consideration. The teacher 
may be confronted with the record and asked what 
she intends to do about it. Finally, it may become

necessary for the superintendent to recommend that 
she be not retained for the next year. Quite reason- 
ably the board of education would have a right to ask 
wherein the teacher had failed and what efforts had 
been made by the superintendent to improve het 
work. Sucharecord of visits with the follow-up would 
go a great way toward convincing the board as to 
the justness of the recommendation. Such a record 
might not be required once a year for the purpose 
indicated, but when that one time does come, it 
would certainly be worth all the trouble to have a 
clear-cut record of the whole matter. It oftens hap- 
pens in systems having several elementary-school 
buildings that the superintendent does not have a 
good opportunity to discuss a visit with the teachet 
for several days after the lesson is taught. Where a 
number of recitations are visited each day, it is quite 
likely that many of the details will have escaped the 
superintendent’s memory, and, when the teacher 
comes to discuss it, such a record will prove invalu- 
able to the superintendent by enabling him to refresh 
his memory as to what happened and his comments 
on it. 
The length of a visit 
The common practice of a superintendent coming 
into a classroom, standing around for five or ten min- 
utes, and then quietly slipping out without any anal- 
ysis of what is going on, does not constitute real su- 
64
-P-A-G-E-75
  
CLASSROOM VISITATION 
pervision in any sense of the word. Sometimes such 
visits are justifiable on other grounds, but they do not 
frequently result in improving the quality of the in- 
struction. The period for observation should usually 
be not less than one whole lesson unit. Often it is 
desirable to remain for several lesson units in succes- 
sion. Occasionally visits of an hour or even an entire 
half-day should be made in one room. In any event, 
after the lesson is finished the superintendent should 
determine its one or two strongest points and its 
weakest point. These, when carefully analyzed, will 
furnish adequate material for a conference with the 
teacher. 
Physical conditions to be observed 
Just what the superintendent looks for in his class- 
room visitation will depend largely upon the purpose 
he has in mind in visiting the class. If he is at work 
on some special problem, he will center his attention 
on that phase of the work. In general, however, he 
should form the habit of noting as he enters the gen- 
eral situation. Is the room well ventilated? What 
is the temperature? Is the teacher’s management 
of the light satisfactory? Are the floors, desks, win- 
dows, and the room in general clean as far as the 
janitor is responsible? Are they clean as far as the 
teacher is responsible? Is the room cheerful and at- 
tractive? Is the teacher’s desk neat and in order? 
Are the pupil’s desks neat and in order? Is the writ- 
65 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ing of the teacher on the blackboard neat and of sat- 
isfactory quality? Have the pupils written neatly 
and with satisfactory quality? Are the pupils clean 
and neat in their personal appearance? This may 
seem to be a formidable list of questions, but the ex- 
perienced superintendent will size up the entire situa- 
tion in one glance. 
Questions to consider in judging worth of recitation 
There will be dozens of questions which the progres- 
sive superintendent will have in his mind for observ- 
ing the class recitation. He will want to know if 
there is real teaching going on, or if the class is just 
reciting. He will want to know if the teacher or the 
pupils do the talking. He will observe the questions 
asked to learn if they seek facts, explanations, or 
reasons. He will observe if they are thought-provok- 
ing, if they suggest the answer, if they can be an- 
swered by yes or no, if they are relevant to the topic 
being considered, and if they are clear-cut and def- 
inite. In considering the subject-matter of the rec- 
itation, he will ask if it is such that it can be of pres- 
ent use to the pupils in their business and social life, 
or if it is likely to be of any use to them in later life. 
Is the material of the recitation confined to the text? 
Is it within the comprehension of the pupil? Is it 
worth while? Does it challenge the effort of the en- 
tire class, or do some of the pupils regard it with in- 
difference? The method of the recitation will also 
66
-P-A-G-E-77
CLASSROOM VISITATION 
come in for due consideration by the superintendent. 
He will ask if the teacher had a definite aim which 
can be justified by modern standards, if the pupils 
acted and thought on their own account, if they were 
engaged in solving a concrete problem which satisfied 
a real need, if memory work was being permitted when 
the exercise should have involved thinking and judg- 
ing. Were the games, devices, and drill calculated to 
meet the real needs of the pupils? Did the teacher 
make provision for the individual differences of the 
members of the class, by planning the work so that all 
could answer some of the questions, but that at times 
the superior pupils were challenged to their best ef- 
fort? Did she use lesson summaries at frequent in- 
tervals to preserve its unity? Were the experiences 
and needs of the children the starting-point? Was 
the assignment made well? Did it stimulate children 
to better work? Was it suited to the varying needs 
of strong and weak pupils? Are the pupils self- 
reliant, testing their own solutions, and acting and 
thinking on their own account, or are they entirely 
dependent upon the teacher? Do they differenti- 
ate between essentials and non-essentials? Do they 
organize their material? Do they seem well grounded 
in their previous work? Do they give evidence of 
ability to recite intelligently, continuously, and with 
ease upon some part of the lesson? Can the boy in 
the back seat understand every syllable uttered by 
the boy in the front seat? Does the teacher ask too 
67
-P-A-G-E-78
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
many questions? Do the pupils manage their reci- 
tation largely without the assistance of the teacher? 
Does the teacher waste time? Were all the pupils 
participating actively and thinking during the entire 
period? Has there been genuine progress during 7 
the recitation? For each particular subject observed 
there are a number of special questions which the 
superintendent would need to ask himself in forming 
his judgment of the recitation. 
The conference between superintendent and teacher 
At some convenient time after the recitation there 
should be a conference between the superintendent 
and the classroom teacher. This conference is a vi- 
tal part of the program of supervision. The superin- 
tendent should make careful preparation for it. He 
should make a very careful analysis of the recitation 
and be reasonably sure that his analysis is correct, 
that he has taken into account all the various factors 
entering into the question. He must be able to sup- 
port his position by reference to the recognized edu- 
cational authorities. He should be able to apply as 
tests of excellence the basic principles of education. 
The most difficult task is now before him. He will 
need to meet the teacher in a manner that will at once 
put her at ease. She should feel that there is to be 
the fullest and the frankest discussion. At the same 
time she should have sufficient confidence in the su- 
perintendent to know that his sole aim is sympathet- 
68  
-P-A-G-E-79
  : CLASSROOM VISITATION 
ically to assist her in becoming a better teacher. She 
should recognize in him a man who knows his busi- 
ness. The superintendent must strive to use a 
method for convincing the teacher of her needs that 
will cause her reaction to be an intelligent realization 
of her needs and a desire to make a determined effort 
to increase her skill in teaching. A good way to ac- 
complish this is to show generous appreciation of the 
strong points of the lesson, acknowledging the able 
grasp of the teacher of those educational principles of 
which good use was made. This may be followed by 
questions skillfully put, which will lead the teacher to 
discover and to admit the major weaknesses of her 
lesson and_to find the principles of teaching which 
were violated in producing these results. Such a 
process is of great value to the teacher herself as a 
means of growth, and has great advantage over hav- 
ing her faults pointed out to her by her superin- 
tendent. Through the entire conference only the 
. kindest and most professional spirit should obtain 
The teacher should be led to suggest better methods 
of accomplishing her purposes. The superintendent 
will be able to add suggestions. He may place in her 
possession magazine articles and books which will as- 
sist her in discovering basic principles for future use. 
The conference should not close without the teacher 
feeling her needs and without the superintendent 
knowing that his suggestions have been constructive 
in their effect upon her future work. Petty details 
69
-P-A-G-E-80
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
of class procedure, such as whispering without per- 
mission, disorder, and misspelled words, have no 
place in such a conference. Its function is to deal 
with much bigger things. When the superintendent 
reaches the place where his teachers will analyze their 
own efforts and think intelligently about their work, 
he will have realized his highest aim. One visit to a 
recitation followed by an analysis and a conference 
such as has been described is worth a score of ordinary 
superficial visits. 
Three types of teachers 
There are three principal types of teachers repre- 
sented in nearly every corps. There is the exceptional 
teacher who has a vital interest in her work and a 
thoughtful attitude toward it. This class would do 
good work with no supervision or even in spite of poor 
supervision. This group need most the encourage- 
ment and loyal support which a superintendent is able 
to give. Only a small percentage of teachers fall in 
this class. The second class, which comprises a large 
majority of the teachers, are those who do a fairly 
creditable piece of work. They are conscientious, 
but fall short of the first group because of a lack of 
initiative. The superintendent must give them fre- 
quent encouragement and inspire them to keep con- 
stantly striving for better results. The third class 
are the poor teachers. Sometimes there will be 
found a teacher in this group who has some ability, 
qo
-P-A-G-E-81
  CLASSROOM VISITATION 
but who has no interest in her work. Also in this 
class is found the teacher who is weak in disci- 
pline, scholarship, or some other fundamental factor. 
Sometimes a superintendent can secure a fair grade 
of work from this group of teachers by the expendi- 
ture of sufficient effort, but in scores of cases it is 
likely best to see that these persons are eliminated 
from teaching at the first opportunity. This does 
not mean that the superintendent should allow this 
class of teachers to drift along until election time and 
then be unceremoniously dropped without warning. 
On the contrary, he should use every effort to develop 
them until he is convinced that further effort is use- 
less. In any case the teacher is entitled to repeated 
warnings and the chance to do better.
-P-A-G-E-82
VI 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
Some criticisms of teachers’ meetings 
NEarLy every superintendent feels called upon to 
hold teachers’ meetings from time to time throughout 
the school year. It isa matter of common knowledge 
among teachers that probably more often than other- 
wise these meetings are regarded as a pest, and are 
attended by teachers merely because attendance is 
compulsory. The purpose of the present chapter is 
to consider some of the reasons for the unpopularity 
of teachers’ meetings, and to point out some ways in 
which they may be made worth while in the super- 
vision of the school. One of the first criticisms laid 
at the door of the superintendent in regard to teachers’ 
meetings is that they are dull and exceedingly tire- 
some. Another criticism is that teachers carry away 
little that is of either temporary or permanent value 
to themselves. It is often asserted that the superin- 
tendent calls a meeting to consider some problem and 
then spends all of the time talking himself, perhaps 
without any adequate preparation. The topics fre- 
quently selected for discussion belong exclusively to 
one group of teachers. High-school teachers feel 
that the meetings usually center around the problems 
72  
-P-A-G-E-83
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
of the elementary school. Some one may contend 
that a really professional teacher will be interested 
in problems that concern others than herself. While 
this may be true from a theoretical point of view, the 
fact remains that most teachers are human and are 
subject to the same limitations that the rest of us are. 
To hold the interest of the entire corps, it is necessary 
to consider in general meetings only those topics 
which are common to the entire group, and reserve 
for special meetings those other problems which con- 
cern only a limited number of the teachers. 
Methods of conveying routine information 
to teachers 
As a rule, the general teachers’ meeting should be 
used as a means of developing a major idea or plan of 
work, or to get at some common condition. It should 
never be used for anything which can be handled in 
other ways. Every school of any size at all should 
have at hand some means of preparing duplicate cop- 
ies of notices, plans, and other things. In small sys- 
tems a hectograph will serve the purpose. In schools 
of from twenty teachers up, there should be a mimeo- 
graph, or duplicator of some kind. Dozens of mat- 
ters of general information can be duplicated on one 
of these machines and a copy placed in the hands of 
each teacher. Such items as the action of the board 
of education in fixing the length of the Christmas va- 
cation, the announcement that the semester will end 
73
-P-A-G-E-84
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
on acertain day, that a certain report is desired at 
a specified time, and scores of other similar things 
ought never to burden a teachers’ meeting program. 
The use of the bulletin will make it entirely unneces- 
sary. In school systems which occupy only one or 
two buildings, a number of superintendents use the 
“pass” as a means of spreading information and di- 
rections. The “pass” is a notice written on a sheet 
of paper. After it is read by a teacher, she places 
her initials on the sheet and hands it to some other 
teacher near her. When all teachers have read it, 
the paper is returned to the office, where it may be 
filed for future reference should occasion require. In 
larger systems many superintendents provide a loose- 
leaf notebook cover for each teacher in the corps. 
Bulletins are run off on a mimeograph on paper which 
will fit the notebook cover. Teachers are required to 
file each bulletin in the cover as soon as it is received, 
and the entire file is kept in the teacher’s desk where 
it may be referred to at a moment’s notice. In ad- 
dition to items of information, the bulletin is useful 
as a means of furnishing teachers with discussions of 
professional topics, lesson plans, summaries of con- 
clusions reached by teachers’ meetings, and many 
helpful suggestions. 
Preparation for the meeting 
It ought to go without saying that no superintend- 
ent should ever undertake to conduct a teachers’ 
74
-P-A-G-E-85
  TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
meeting without the most complete and painstaking 
preparation possible for him to make. He should be 
entirely familiar with the professional literature on 
the subject. He should have thought the matter 
through from beginning to end and considered it from 
allits angles. In calling the meeting, he should send 
out very carefully prepared assignments. If the 
meeting is one for which teachers are expected to do 
considerable reading, the assignment should contain 
definite references to books or magazines. These 
references should be made available to teachers in 
reasonable quantities. Sufficient time should be 
allowed for the teachers to do the work required. 
Teachers usually prefer to have a week-end elapse be- 
tween the assignment and the meeting, as this gives 
them more time for properly doing the work. Ten 
or twelve carefully planned questions will assist very 
much in focusing the teachers’ thinking upon the im- 
portant points. 
Methods of conducting the general meeting 
In conducting the meeting, the superintendent 
may well follow the same type of teaching which he 
expects his teachers to use with their classes. If 
the teachers are working with the socialized recita- 
tion, the superintendent should endeavor to use this 
method in conducting his meetings. In some meet- 
ings topics may be presented by individual teachers, 
after which follows a general discussion. Occasion- 
aS 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
Rey Sratnreay enna aera 
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ally the superintendent may present the main topic 
in a short talk which is followed by questions and dis- 
cussion. Round-table meetings are profitable once 
in a while, provided the group is not too large and the 
topic such that extemporaneous discussion will result 
in benefit to the school. Some schools are so located 
geographically that at a small expense men and 
women of prominence from colleges, normal schools, 
or other public schools may be brought to a general 
meeting for the discussion of some subject in which 
the speaker is recognized as more or less expert. In 
any event, the general teachers’ meeting should begin 
on time and end on time, and should not last too long. 
Usually one hour is long enough, and this is especially 
true if the meeting is held after school. 
The general meeting before school opens 
It is customary for the superintendent to hold a 
general teachers’ meeting on the Saturday afternoon 
before school opens in the fall. At this meeting 
it is too early to expect general discussion from the 
teachers, especially if the teachers are new to the 
system and the topic presented one which is quite 
unfamiliar to them. For these reasons the superin- 
tendent will likely find it advisable to occupy the 
major portion of the time. Too many new and un- 
familiar ideas should not be presented at this time, 
as it will lead to confusion. It is much better for one 
to limit himself to a few carefully selected points and 
76
-P-A-G-E-87
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
see that these are fixed clearly in the minds of his 
corps of teachers as the year’s work begins. Then at 
later meetings the various sub-topics may be given 
more detailed consideration. At this first meeting of 
the year, the superintendent should give such informa- 
tion to the teachers as will enable them to begin their 
duties without loss of efficiency or waste of time. 
Some of the things that should be placed in their hands 
at this time are the following: 
I. The list of assignments to grades or classes 
2. A copy of the entire course of study. 
3: 
  To. Special outlines for work in subjects as they are 
used. 
. Time allotment sheets with one or two sample pro- 
grams which have worked well previously. 
. A list of the pupils belonging to each teacher’s 
room. 
. A list of all text and reference books and supplies 
available for her use, together with full directions 
for obtaining these. 
. Copies of the schedules of special teachers. 
. Definite directions for plan books, methods of grad- 
ing, management of recess, dismissals, fire drills, 
playground and hall duties, and any other duty of a 
routine nature. 
. Samples of record cards, report blanks, and other 
forms used in the system. 
Definite instructions as to uniform headings, meth- 
ods of instruction, and other features peculiar to the 
school.

MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
The general meetings 
The general teachers’ meetings held throughout 
the year should aid in (z) developing and carrying 
out the year’s policy, or (2) meeting some special 
problem which has arisen and which is of general 
interest to all teachers. It cannot be urged too 
strongly that topics considered in general meetings 
are justified only when they vitally affect each and 
every teacher’s work. 
As a means of illustrating how the general meeting 
may be used to develop and carry out the year’s pol- 
icy, the following paragraphs are given. These as- 
signments have actually been used successfully in one 
system of schools. They are not presented as ideal 
or perfect. Probably no two superintendents would 
use exactly the same way of getting at the same prob- 
lem. Nevertheless, it is believed that concrete illus- 
trations of what has actually been done, even if they 
are imperfect, are much better for the purpose of this 
book than any academic discussion, no matter how 
philosophical it may be. The superintendent using 
these assignments had determined upon the socializa- 
tion of the school as his major professional probler 
for the year; in fact, he had planned to carry the 
work over at least three years. The school was an 
ordinarily good school of the traditional type. The 
teachers had exercised little influence in shaping the 
policies of the school. They had not previously done 
78
-P-A-G-E-89
  
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
very definite professional work. The work of the 
school was highly mechanical. The problem con- 
fronting the superintendent was to change all these 
things, and yet do it so gradually that it would be 
evolution rather than revolution. His task was com- 
plicated by a number of minor local conditions which 
in the aggregate made the process of more than or- 
dinary difficulty. 
In the first meeting of the year before school 
opened, the superintendent gave a part of his talk to 
a discussion of the problem in its most general aspect. 
The first real work was done in preparation for the 
September meeting which came at the close of the 
third week of school. During the early part of the 
second week the following assignment was sent out: 
The regular September teachers’ meeting will be held at 
the High School building at 3.30 o’clock Friday after- 
noon, September 20. The subject to be considered is 
“Socializing the School.” A few questions are listed to 
guide your thinking on this topic. The books referred to 
are in the Teachers’ Library at the office. If it is not too 
much work, please write out your answers to the ques- 
tions, as this will insure more accurate thinking on your 
part.

education? 
2. What do you consider to be the chief purpose of the 
school? 
3- How many phases of social efficiency must the 
school keep in mind? What are they? 
79

4. What psychological elements are essential to social 
efficiency? 
5. How will the traditional school curriculum be af- 
fected by socialization? 
6. Formulate a concise statement which will serve as a 
criterion for measuring educational values. 
7. Apply this criterion to the subjects you are teach- 
ing. What changes do you find necessary to make 
in your practice? 
8. How will socializing the school affect present stand- 
ards of (a) discipline and control? (b) attainment in 
work? 
9. How will it affect present methods of management 
and teaching? 
ro. How may we know if the socialized school secures 
results which approximate the ends set up for reali- 
zation?

Subject-Matter of the Socialized School.” The 
following was the assignment: 
80

1. What criterion is to be used in determining the sub- 
ject-matter of the socialized school? 
2. Select any subject you prefer and show what 
changes are required in its content to increase to a 
maximum its social values. Make your answer 
clear by specific illustrations. 
3. Give two or more illustrations each of desirable 
school experiences whose chief values are found 
respectively in (a) information derived; (b) habits or 
attitudes established; (c) appreciations cultivated. 
4. What are the most marked weaknesses in the usual 
textbook treatment of subjects from the standpoint 
of social values? What do you suggest as means 
for removing these weaknesses and still make use of 
textbooks? 
5. In enriching the social content of school subjects in 
which “tool” or mechanical elements are promi- 
nent, as arithmetic or language, how is the neglect 
of developing efficient mastery of mechanical ele- 
ments to be avoided? 
6. In how far do you think that certain emergencies 
confronting us as a result of the war might have been 
largely avoided by an appropriate socialization of 
the school courses of the present adult and rising 
generations? Give reasons for your answer. 
7. What specific, concrete steps do you expect to take 
this year in the direction of socializing the subject- 
matter which you teach?

were issued:

Following an agreement made at this meeting, the 
superintendent appointed from the teaching corps 
three committees to undertake the preparation of a 
modern course of study in arithmetic, language, and 
reading. The January meeting was in the form of a 
city institute with lectures given by men and women 
from outside the system. The subjects of these ad- 
dresses were along the line of thought involved in 
the socialization of the school. An opportunity was 
given for round-table discussion of topics by the out- 
side speakers and the teachers.

  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
The subject of the next general meeting was ‘‘So- 
cializing the Recitation.” The following questions 
formed the basis for the discussion: 
I. What criticisms are urged against the traditional 
recitation? Show that these will be overcome by 
socializing the recitation. 
. In what ways are the purposes of the socialized 
recitation different from those of the traditional 
recitation? 
. What part ought the teacher to play in a socialized 
recitation? 
. Suggest a plan for trying out the socialized recita- 
tion in your classroom. 
. What faults are likely to arise in a socialized recita- 
tion? How may these mistakes be avoided? 
. Show how the recitation period in each subject 
listed may be socialized. History, Arithmetic, Read- 
ing, Geography, Language, Music, Art, Spelling. 
. If you have attempted to socialize any of your reci- 
tations, has your experience been satisfactory or 
otherwise? Please explain in detail.

Group Meetings 
In addition to the general meetings, there should 
be held meetings of all the teachers of a grade or of a 
84
-P-A-G-E-95
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
department. These meetings are likely to be most 
successful if there are not too many teachers present. 
From twelve to fifteen teachers are the maximum for 
small school systems. Eight or ten teachers make a 
better number, as then it is possible for the group to 
sit around a large table and discuss matters with less 
formality. Some of the topics which may be consid- 
ered at these group meetings are listed here in the 
hope that they may prove suggestive of what may be 
done at meetings of this type. 
  1. Definite statement of the aims to be accomplished in 
each subject and each grade. 
2. Formulation of standards for each subject and each 
grade. 
3- Discussion of results of standard tests. Suggested 
remedies for improving the weaknesses revealed by 
them. 
4. Examination of new textbooks. 
5. Reports on recent pedagogical books accompanied 
by an application to local conditions. 
6. Discussion of methods of teaching specific topics. 
7. Demonstration teaching, followed by discussion. 
8. Discussion of proposed changes in textbooks, meth- 
ods, curricula, and other items. 
9. Study of how best to use illustrative material. 
to. Formulation of plans for circulating library material. 
The aim of these group meetings is to make the in- 
struction offered in the school system better. They 
are not an institute, nor a normal-school class, nor a 
. vaudeville performance. Nothing but the problems 
85
-P-A-G-E-96
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
and difficulties of instruction as encountered in the 
school system should be considered. These problems 
may be suggested by the superintendent, the prin- 
cipal, or the teacher. The teacher always has some 
of them in mind. One plan which has been followed 
successfully is to have the teachers state the problem 
as they see it and invite volunteer replies. For the 
superintendent to attempt to settle it “authorita- 
tively” will usually result in disaster, at least so far as 
the spontaneity of the meeting is concerned. In the 
discussion it is best to get as many different points of 
view expressed as possible. Try to locate advantages 
and disadvantages. Some teacher who has worked 
out the problem especially well may be asked to give 
her co-workers the benefit of her studies and labors. 
Questions may be asked and answered. The aim 
here is to promote a truly professional spirit and atti- 
tude toward the problems which arise. Every one 
should be a willing and a generous participant. 
Building meetings 
In systems large enough to have several buildings 
each containing five or six teachers or more, building 
meetings will be found necessary at times. Many of 
these will be left to the building principal to conduct, 
but at times the superintendent will observe some 
problem which concerns only the building in ques- 
tion. The same general principles apply to this type 
of meeting.

  VII 
MEASURING THE EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 
The standard test has supplanted the examination as 
a means of measuring the efficiency of instruction 
UNTIL recent years no scientific method of measuring 
the efficiency of the instruction given in a school ex- 
isted. The whole matter was one of opinion. No def- 
inite standards existed as to how much work should 
be expected of any given group of pupils, nor was 
there anything to indicate how well this work should 
be done. Periodical examinations were given, it is 
true; but these were wasteful and unsatisfactory, and 
really did little toward evaluating the efficiency of in- 
struction. Experiments have proved that teachers’ 
marks are unreliable; the same teacher will grade 
the same paper with widely different marks if it is 
done at a different time. No two teachers will rate 
a given paper as having the same value. Work 
which entirely satisfies one teacher will be rejected by 
another. Since no definite standard exists, there 
must necessarily be wide variability. Because of the 
lack of uniformity in standards of different schools, 
it has been impossible to compare the results of one 
system with another. Again, no two teachers agree 
as to the proper value to place upon the various ele- 
87
-P-A-G-E-98
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ments of the work to be graded. If the answer is cor- 
rect, but the method wrong, what grade shall be 
given? Should neatness, spelling, handwriting, con- 
tent, and a dozen other elements enter into the grad- 
ing of an arithmetic or a history paper? It is quite 
evident that if the efficiency of instruction is to be 
measured and the results compared with those ob- 
tained in other school systems, there must be some 
uniformity of agreement in all these things. The 
standard test has been developed as a measuring in- 
strument, and, because it sets up certain conditions 
which must be met in giving the test, a uniform basis 
of comparison is obtained. It is not claimed that the 
standard test is perfect, nor that it is infallible. It is 
maintained that it is an advance step over the com- 
mon present-day practice, and as such it is entitled 
to due consideration until something better and more 
suited to our needs is discovered. Enough progress 
has been made in developing such tests to con- 
vince any reasonable person that the standard test 
will reveal excellences or defects of a school system 
and afford a basis for discussion of means of improve- 
ment. As school administrators and supervisors 
become more familiar with the tests now in use, and 
as improvements are made in them, the usefulness of 
the standard test will increase. The purpose of the 
present chapter is to indicate how an untrained super- 
intendent may use tests to advantage in his own sys- 
tem of schools. 
88

  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 
The measurement of handwriting 
Handwriting is one of the easiest subjects for an 
untrained individual to test. It is a good place to 
start for this reason. Handwriting is usually one of 
the most poorly taught subjects. Asa matter of fact, 
it is not taught at all in many schools; pupils are sim- 
ply expected to put in the time making flourishes 
on paper. There are two types of scales in this sub- 
ject; one measures the product for speed and qual- 
ity, while the second type is diagnostic. To the 
former group belong the Thorndike and Ayres scales. 
Freeman’s scale is an example of the latter. When 
the test is given for the first time in a school system, 
it is better to use either the Thorndike or Ayres scale. 
The Thorndike scale considers quality as made up of 
three characteristics — beauty, legibility, and general 
merit. A large number of competent judges evalu- 
ated the several samples and the consensus of opinion 
of these judges determined the value assigned to 
the specimen. Quality 4 is just barely distinguish- 
able as handwriting and quality 18 represents un- 
usual merit. The Ayres scale contains three types 
of handwriting — vertical, semi-slant, and full slant. 
Eight degrees of quality are represented, and these 
are assigned numerical values of 20, 30, 40, up to go. 
It is believed that the inexperienced supervisor will 
find the Thorndike scale a little more satisfactory. 
In giving the test, a selection is made for the pupils 
89 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
to write. It should be something which the pupils 
know and can write without hesitation. Some inves- 
tigators have had the words “‘one, two, three, four, 
five, six,” etc., written as far as the pupil has time to 
go. Others have used some simple poem which all 
the children know. The Gettysburg Address has been 
used. It really does not matter what the children 
write. The only caution to keep in mind is that it 
should be well known so as not to slow up the child’s 
speed. Children are supplied with unruled paper of 
a uniform size. They all start together at a given 
signal and write for exactly two minutes. This 
makes it easy to determine the speed of writing. All 
that is required is to count the number of letters and 
divide by two, which will give the speed in letters per 
minute. In evaluating the quality of the specimen, 
it is best for three judges to be chosen. Each judge 
should rate the entire set of papers independently. 
The papers may be designated by number and the 
score of each judge set down on a piece of paper, so 
that one of the judges will not know what rating an- 
other judge has given. If any two of the judges as- 
_ sign the same mark to the paper, that is the final 
score. If all three use different marks, then the mid- 
dle mark is taken; e.g., if the specimen is rated 8, 9, 11, 
by the judges, the quality assigned to it would be 9. 
In rating the specimen, the judge slides it along 
the scale until he reaches a point where he can say 
with certainty, “This specimen is better than this 
90
-P-A-G-E-101
  ' MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 
quality.” This is the starting-point. He slides the 
specimen back until he can say with certainty, “It is 
not as good as this quality.” Somewhere between 
these two points the score will fall. The judge then 
determines which sample on the scale the specimen 
most nearly resembles. This is his rating of quality. 
This judgment may be at fault at times when the in- 
dividual paper is considered, but the superintendent 
is interested chiefly in the median performance of a 
class, and on a group of this sort he will quite likely 
rate as many too high as he does others too low, and 
the median will be fairly accurate. 
When all the papers of a class have been rated, the 
median should be determined. By the term ‘‘me- 
dian” is meant the middle point. It is that point on 
a scale above which and below which there appears an 
equal number of cases. An easy way to determine 
this is to arrange the papers bearing the scores in 
such a way as to place the lowest score on top and 
continuing in order with the highest score on the bot- 
tom. If there is an odd number of papers in the pile, 
the median will be the score found on the middle pa- 
per; if there is an even number of papers, the median 
will be the average of the two most central scores. If 
such a pile of papers contain thirty-one scores, the 
middle score is the sixteenth score; if there are thirty 
papers in the pile, the median score is halfway be- 
tween the score on the fifteenth paper and the score 
on the sixteenth paper. 
gr 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  ’ MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
Tables should be prepared showing the distribution 
of scores for quality of handwriting and for speed. 
Other tables should show the median score made by 
each grade of the school being measured together 
with the standard median, or the score which is ex- 
pected, and also the median score made by other 
school systems where the same test has been given. 
The measurement of spelling 
* Another subject which is easily tested is spelling. 
This should be the second subject measured by the 
inexperienced investigator. Words should be se- 
lected from the Ayres scale. It is best to choose a 
list of words where the expected score is not too high. 
If one is chosen upon which a number of pupils will _ 
make roo per cent, the test will fail to measure the 
ability of those pupils. It is suggested that twenty- 
five words be selected from list ““L”’ for grades 3 and 4; 
twenty-five words from list ““Q” for grades 5 and 6; 
and twenty-five words from list ‘‘U” for grades 7 and 
8. The test should be given without previous study. 
Pronounce each word distinctly, but do not syllabi- 
cate, or give phonetic sounds. Immediately after 
you have pronounced the word, use it in a seatence. 
In scoring the papers, mark all misspelled words. All 
words which are written over are counted wrong. 
Mark the number of words correct in the upper right- 
hand corner of each paper. The teachers can correct 
these papers as well as the superintendent. When 
g2
-P-A-G-E-103
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 
they have finished, they should arrange the names of 
the children alphabetically on a sheet of paper and 
place the score earned after each name. This sheet 
and all papers should then be forwarded to the super- 
intendent’s office. A table should be prepared show- 
ing the distribution of pupils’ scores according to the 
number of words correctly spelled. Another table 
may show the number and per cent of children who 
spelled as well or better than the Ayres expected 
average. 
The measurement of reading 
In reading, there are several phases which may be 
measured. It is believed that inexperienced investi- 
gators should start with a test which measures the 
most important phase of reading, the ability to get 
thought from the printed page. The Kansas Silent 
Reading Test is recommended for the first trial be- 
cause it is simple and easily given and scored, and 
because it has been widely used, and therefore there 
are reliable standards and data for comparisons. 
There are really three tests in the series. Test I is 
prepared for grades 3, 4, and 5; Test II is for grades 6, 
7, and 8; and Test III is for use in the high school. 
Complete directions for giving and scoring the test 
come with the sheets. The teachers will be able to 
score this test and to prepare the summary sheets. 
The superintendent should prepare tables showing the 
distribution of scores and the comparison with those 
obtained in other places where the test has been given, 
93
-P-A-G-E-104
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
The measurement of arithmetic 
There are a number of tests which can be given in 
arithmetic. Probably the best known and those 
most easily given by an untrained superintendent are 
the Courtis Tests, Series B. These test the ability of 
pupils to perform the four fundamental operations . 
with speed and accuracy, and, having been widely 
used, have reliable standards determined. It is 
customary to give the Stone Reasoning Test to test 
reasoning ability whenever the Courtis Tests, Series 
B, are used. For diagnostic purposes the Woody 
Scales, Series A, are recommended for use in grades 
three to eight inclusive. 
The measurement of English composition 
The quality of Engiish composition may be meas- 
ured by means of the Nassau County Supplement to 
the Hillegas Scale. In giving this test, the children 
are asked to write upon some topic of interest for 
twenty minutes and are informed that not over one 
page is expected. A subject used by Trabue, and 
which has been widely used by others, is “What I 
should like to do next Saturday.” The papers are 
rated in much the same fashion as the papers in hand- 
writing. Tables should be prepared showing the dis- 
tribution of scores by grades and making the compar 
ison with other school systems. 
94
-P-A-G-E-105
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 
The use to be made of these data 
These do not begin to constitute all the tests which 
are available, but for an untrained superintendent in 
a small school system they represent about all he 
should attempt to do in any year. In fact, if his ob- 
ject is more than to become acquainted with the sys- 
tem, he had better confine his efforts to not more than 
three subjects. All of these tests are comparatively 
simple and inexpensive. A superintendent who goes 
into a new community will find it a very satisfactory 
method of becoming acquainted with his school sys- 
tem if he can begin giving these tests the third week 
in September, carrying them over into October if 
necessary. A careful study of the results of these 
tests will show up the strong points and the weak 
spots in the school. His future administration of the 
school can be shaped intelligently and with reason- 
able certainty that he is on the right track. By giv- 
ing the tests again in the latter part of April or the 
first of May he can measure the progress that his sys- 
tem has made during the year. 
Conditions likely to exist 
More than likely, if the tests have not been used in 
the school before, rather discouraging results will be 
found. The new superintendent should not use this 
fact to criticize the administration of his predecessor 
or to condemn the teachers of the corps. In all prob- 
95
-P-A-G-E-106
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
ability the former superintendent had just as good a 
school system as he was able to secure under all cir- 
cumstances, and one may be sure that, in spite of all 
his efforts, when he leaves a system of schools, his suc- 
cessor will find a number of points open to equal con- 
demnation. On the other hand, a new superintend- 
ent should not make much of a display in giving these 
tests. They should be given quietly without much 
discussion and merely as an incident in the everyday 
routine of the school. When the results are finally 
tabulated and analyzed, they may well be made the 
basis of discussion at teachers’ meetings with the 
idea of noting the weak places and finding the way to 
improve them. If teachers feel that the tests are 
given for the purpose of checking them up, they will 
resent it and the final outcome will not be desirable. 
On the other hand, if they will enter into the matter 
with the proper spirit, the tests will help them more 
than any one else. In all the tests it is quite likely 
that the school will be below standard. This is to be 
expected from the fact that standards have shown 
such variability in the past that a teacher was satis- 
fied whenever her grade reached the mark she had set 
for them in her own mind. In handwriting, the qual- 
ity is likely to be somewhat below standard and the 
speed considerably below. Generally speaking, it will 
be found that the rapid writers are those who rank 
comparatively high in quality. In reading, the rapid 
reader is likely to be the better reader. In arithmetic, 
also, speed and accuracy seem to go together.
-P-A-G-E-107
VIII 
THE ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL * 
Types of elementary-school principalships 
GENERALLY speaking, there are about three types of 
elementary-school principalships. The first type in 
the small school system of two or three buildings, the 
second type in systems having from three to eight or 
ten buildings, and the third type in systems of more 
than ten buildings. The duties of the elementary- 
school principal vary with the type and even within 
the type. In the third group mentioned above, the 
principal is practically the final authority on nearly 
all questions of administration and supervision which 
arise. He does no regular teaching and is often sup- 
plied with more or less adequate clerical help. The 
scope of this book does not deal with this class of 
schools, and for this reason the discussion of the duties 
of a principal in systems of this size will be omitted. 
In the small school system of but two or three 
buildings the superintendent of schools usually has 
his office located in the high-school building. He 
teaches from one to four classes in the high school 
each day. Often he is in actual practice the real 
principal of the high school, and frequently performs 
many duties which could well be passed over to the 
97
-P-A-G-E-108
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
individual regularly elected to this position. Much 
of the remainder of his time is occupied with admin- 
istrative duties. He gives what time he can to class- 
room visitation, but this is usually the least of his 
cares. It follows that in such a system the principal 
of an elementary school is a highly important part of 
the administrative.and-supervisory-machinery. Usu- 
ally such principals hold their positions for long peri- 
ods, changing much less rapidly than do superintend- 
ents in the same system. Frequently such a prin- 
cipal is a “home” girl whose only qualification for the” 
position is the fact that ahe-has been a good teacher __—in the system for a number of years. Perhaps, due to 
the fact that her father is a member of the board of 
education or a distinguished citizen of the commu- 
nity, she was elevated to the educational leadership of 
the ward school. It is freel ceded by all writers 
on the subject Uist tae iene ee , elementary-school prin- 
cipals are untrained for the duties of the position and 
that often there is no conception of the larger respon- 
sibilities involved. Finding such a situation as this 
in his school system, the first duty of the superintend- 
ent is to begin systematically to develop in his prin- 
cipals the professional outlook which the position re- 
quires. This may be done by individual conferences 
or group meetings, where there are several elementary 
principals. Professional books and magazines bear- 
ing upon the work of the principal may be placed in 
the hands of these individuals to read. The princi- 
98
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
pals may be urged to take suitable courses in summer 
schools. In any event, as soon as one new profes- 
sional idea is carried over, the superintendent should 
provide means and opportunities for the principal 
to put the plan into action. When this has become 
an established condition, it may be followed by put- 
ting another idea into practice. The principal in 
such a system of schools is in a position to assist or 
hinder the plans of the superintendent to a great de- 
gree, and for his own protection the superintendent 
must see that the principal has the opportunity to 
grow professionally. 
In the second type of school systems, where there 
are from three to eight elementary-school buildings, 
the superintendent is relieved from all teaching duties, 
and he frequently has clerical assistance in his office 
to handle many of the matters of routine, thus free- 
ing a large part of his time for constructive supervi- 
sion as well as the general organization and admin- 
istration of the school. This type of organization 
naturally frees the building principal from many 
matters of administrative routine. Nevertheless, the 
principal of this type of building will have many 
teaching duties left to perform. Since the superin- 
tendent is able to make more frequent visits to the 
classrooms than he could under the first type of organ- 
ization, he is not so dependent upon the principal for 
carrying out his plans as he is under the former ar- 
rangement. Because the work of the principal under 
99
-P-A-G-E-110
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
the second type is not so diversified, she is likely to 
have more of a spirit of coéperation with the super- 
intendent. For these reasons, the second type of 
school system presents the best opportunity of any 
for developing distinctive duties for both the princi- 
pal and the superintendent. There will be more or 
less overlapping of some duties, but this will be found 
more desirable than otherwise. On the other hand, 
there is a sufficiently large number of duties for each 
official to prevent any useless overlapping of the kind 
which frequently develops friction. 
General administrative duties 
It is generally agreed that the duties of all principals 
fall under the two main heads of inistrati 
pedagogical activities, It is convenient to think of 
the administrative duties as coming under three prin- 
qttency of performance. Certain duties need to be performance. Certain duties need to be 
performed only once or twice during the year. 
Once during the 
year, either at the close or the beginning, it becomes 
the duty of the building principal to make a report 
to the superintendent covering the various items of 
equipment and supplies that will be required for the 
coming year’s work. Usually this report is accom- 
panied by an inventory of the materials on hand. All 
textbooks and supplementary books, reference works, 
maps, charts, globes, art materials, report blanks, in 
100 .     
   
-P-A-G-E-111
  
THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
fact everything which is to be used during the coming 
year ought to be listed on this report. It is much less 
work for a superintendent or a committee of the board 
of education to pass upon all these items at one sitting 
than it is to be annoyed every little while with a re- 
quest for an expenditure of funds. Besides, it is nec- 
essary to know about what is to be purchased during 
the year in order to make a satisfactory budget. In- 
dividual items in a general requisition are much more 
likely to be approved when submitted altogether than 
when submitted separately. The principal will use 
the lists from last year as a starting-point for the new 
requisition. She will also estimate the materials on 
hand. Teachers will be consulted. She must know 
the probable enrollment of each class in her building 
for the following year. The janitor will need to be 
asked in regard to the supplies required for his use. 
To make this report accurate — and it is valueless if it 
is not — will require a good many hours of the prin- 
cipal’s time, and ought not to be left until the last day 
or two of the school year, if it is to be submitted at 
that aR — 
b. otion, non-promotion, and transfer of pupils. 
The matter of promotion, non-promotion, and trans- 
fer of pupils is another important duty which should 
be assigned to the principal to perform. Where 
there is more than one section of a grade in a building, 
the placing of pupils in homogeneous groups is a mat- 
ter that calls for considerable planning and study.

  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
At the close of the school year the principal and the 
teacher should go over together any doubtful cases 
and reach a decision in the light of the best educa- 
tional thought on the subject as to which pupils are 
to be “failed” or “conditioned.” The principal 
should file in the superintendent’s office a statement 
showing the exact reasons for the action taken. A 
copy of this statement should be left in the principal’s 
office for reference. Frequently during the summer 
vacation the superintendent is called upon to promote 
a pupil whom a teacher has “‘failed.” Unless such a 
statement is on file where he can find it easily, he 
hears but one side of the case, and sometimes he will 
be led to make a decision which would not have been 
made had he been in possession of all the facts in the 
controversy. At the beginning of a new school year, 
a parent frequently makes such a request of a new 
teacher or principal, and for this reason the record 
should be available for them. Sometimes there is an 
unexpectedly large enrollment at the opening of a 
school. Adjustments of this kind will need to be 
made promptly, and the principal should be respon- 
sible for doing just as much of this as she can without 
consulting the superintendent’s office. In aggra- 
vated cases the superintendent and perhaps the board 
of education will need to be consulted, but the respon- 
sibility for marshaling the facts and the recommenda- 
tion lies wit! 1.

ning of the year and after school has been in session, 
new pupils present themselves for admission to the 
school. Another duty of the principal is to assign these 
individuals to the proper classes. Very often these 
pupils come without a report card or any other official 
information as to their standing. Under such cir- 
cumstances the principal must resort to such means 
as standard tests, written and oral examinations, or 
otherwise determine the group to which the pupil is 
to be assigned temporarily. After a period of trial, 
it will be necessary for the principal to check up the 
newcomer and, if deemed necessary, make a new as- 
signment for him. 
d. Records and reporls> Practically all progressive 
school systems now keep a permanent record of all 
pupils in some form or other. Sometimes this is 
simply the regular register kept in the teacher’s desk, 
or it may be.a card-catalogue system maintained 
in the principal’s office. The principal should be re- 
sponsible for seeing that these records are kept up-to- 
date, and she will need to make sure that the entries 
are accurate. The principal is usually required to 
make a number of reports to the superintendent’s . 
office in addition to the one of equipment and supplies. 
Among these the most common are: the summation 
sheets containing the data on enrollment, attendance, 
and progress of pupils; reports on the success of 
teachers, recommendations for promotion, transfer to 
different grades of work, dismissals, vacancies to be 
103
-P-A-G-E-114
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
filled; cost reports; record of teachers’ meetings held, 
patrons’ meetings, and general conditions of the 
school. _These reports must be accurate and reliable. 
Principals should be assigned the 
duty of arranging schedules, these, of course, being in 
harmony with the general administrative policy of the 
system. Among the most important schedules are 
found the following: schedule of convening, inter- 
missions, and dismissal of the several rooms; schedule 
of duties assigned to each teacher, such as play- 
ground supervision, hall supervision, and classroom 
duties before school convenes, during recesses, and at 
dismissals; schedule of classes; schedule of special 
teachers, as music, writing, drawing, manual training, 
physical education, home economics, and the like; 
schedule of examinations and issuance of report cards; 
schedule of assembly exercises; schedule of regular 
teachers’ meetings; patrons’ meetings. 
Gf. Public exercisesyIn schools having graduation 
or promotion éxércises from the elementary schools, 
the principal should see that the program is prepared; 
that the diplomas, certificates, and other credentials 
are prepared and signed; and that suitable arrange- 
ments have been made for handling the crowd at the 
auditorium. 
Routine administrative duties 
a. Inspection of grounds and buildings. The second 
class of administrative duties which the elementary- 
104
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
school principal should be charged with performing 
are those duties connected with the daily routine of 
the school. The principal may use a reasonably def- 
inite plan to save time and energy in these matters. 
Upon arriving at the school in the morning, the prin- 
cipal should make a brief yet careful inspection of the 
school grounds to see that they are in a fit condition 
for use during the day. Some school grounds are af- 
fected by storms and rendered unfit for use. Some- 
times trash and obstructions are left on the grounds 
during the night by some one desiring to play a prank. 
Along with the inspection of the grounds, the external 
condition of the building should be noted, as storms 
sometimes loosen the metal work around cornice and 
gables. After heavy snows, thawing often results in 
huge snowslides from the roof. If these slides occur 
at a time when that portion of the playground is oc- 
cupied with children, there might be very serious con- 
sequences. Frequently the walls of the building or 
the sidewalks have been defaced with obscene or 
other writing or drawing. These should be removed 
by the janitor before pupils arrive. After reaching 
the inside of the building, the principal should go over 
every part of it in daily use to make sure that the jan- 
itor has performed his duties in such a way as to place 
the building in proper condition for the day. The 
best janitors will sometimes miss pencil marks, dust 
on pictures, ink spots on desks, dirt upon radiators, 
- and even neglect the blackboard if no check is kept 
105°
-P-A-G-E-116
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
on them. Such things as locks, window shades, and 
apparatus are frequently out of order, and prompt 
repair will render them serviceable and save need- 
less repair bills later. Teachers should not be per- 
mitted to allow their own desk or the pupils’ desks to 
be keptinan untidy condition. The temperature and 
humidity of the classrooms also require attention. 
b. Control of pupils outside classrooms. The prin- 
cipal should be held responsible for having a definite 
organization of the teachers in her building for the 
management of the pupils during the periods before 
school convenes, at intermissions, and at dismissals. 
Provision should be made for wholesome recreation 
and systematic movements. The principal need do 
none of the actual supervising of these activities, but 
she should be around frequently enough to know that 
her plan is working the way she expects it to work. 
c. Exclusion of pupils from school. Another impor- 
tant duty of the principal is the exclusion of pupils 
from her school. Often pupils come to school when 
they have been exposed to some contagious disease. 
Sometimes pupils come to school when not in a phys- 
ical condition to permit good school work. At other 
times pupils need to be sent home for some other 
reason. Whenever the principal finds it necessary to 
take this action, the parents should be communicated 
with at once either in writing or by telephone. 
d. Attendance. The principal is responsible for the 
regular and punctual attendance of the pupils in her 
106  
-P-A-G-E-117
ee ne 
THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
building. Within a few minutes after school is called, 
the principal should be furnished by the teachers with 
the names of pupils who are not present. The prin- 
cipal should then take steps to communicate with the 
parents of these children to learn the cause of the ab- 
sence and to secure their codperation in taking the 
right action to meet the situation if circumstances 
demand action. The truant officer must be notified 
as promptly as possible of the cases which he is ex- 
pected to investigate. Quite often principals have all 
tardy children sent to them, and in such cases, by 
communicating with the parents, verify the state- 
ments made by the children. 
e. Discipline of the building. The principal is also 
responsible for the entire discipline of her building. 
She should determine the general policy to be used 
and organize the necessary machinery for carrying it 
out. Those offenses which occur outside of the reg- 
ular classroom are cases for the principal to handle 
rather than the classroom teachers. Teachers should 
be able to manage the ordinary cases of discipline 
arising within their own classrooms, but sometimes it 
is necessary for the matter to be referred to the prin- 
cipal for final disposition. Under ordinary conditions 
no case in discipline should ever go beyond the prin- 
cipal to the superintendent. The superintendent 
should let the principal know that he holds her re- 
sponsible for the discipline of her school and that he 
will stand back of her to the limit of his authority 
107,
-P-A-G-E-118
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
in all the reasonable decisions which she makes. 
When the superintendent maintains this position, it 
does not take very long until the pupils and their par- 
ents understand that appeal from the decision of the 
principal is useless, except in the most aggravated 
cases where the principal has been clearly unjust in 
her handling of the case. If the principal takes the 
position that she will give the same sort of support 
to her teachers, the cases of discipline to reach the 
principal will be greatly reduced. But whenever a 
pupil discovers that he can secure more lenient treat- 
ment by appealing his case, either from the decision 
of the teacher or from the decision of the principal, 
appeals will be the usual thing for every trifling of- 
fense. Occasionally there will arise a problem in dis- 
cipline which neither the teachers nor the principal 
can settle, either because it is beyond their author- 
ity or because it is too difficult to handle without as- 
sistance. These cases will be few and far between, 
but when, they do arise, they should be passed along 
promptly to higher authority. 
Occasional administrative duties 
G. General school activities. The third type of ad- 
ministrative duties which the principal is asked to 
perform may be grouped under the term “miscella- 
neous” or “occasional.” Among this class will be 
found the activities of the pupils outside of the reg- 
ular school work. Nearly every school finds it advis- 
108 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
able to organize a number of general and special ac- 
tivities, such as debating, athletics, entertainments, 
and various types of community work. All these 
things are very much worth while, and a real live 
principal will find time to promote their organization. 
In many school systems some form of patrons’ meet- 
ings are conducted. These are splendid agencies for 
securing the codperation of parents with the school, 
provided they are well organized and managed. The 
principal should always keep her finger on the organ- 
ization, however, as frequently some one misunder- 
stands the purpose of the club and attempts to secure 
action which would disorganize the entire school sys- 
tem. It is well for the principal to arrange the pro- 
grams for the meetings and to secure the principal 
speaker for the occasion. 
b. Teachers’ meetings. The principal should plan 
to conduct meetings with her teachers as often as cir- 
cumstances seem to require. These may come at reg- 
ular times during the year. The topics discussed 
should be of common interest to all teachers attend- 
ing. Professional books may be read and reported 
upon. Special problems of school work may be dis- 
cussed. Proposed changes in the curriculum may be 
suggested and worked out. This is an important 
phase of the work of the elementary-school principal 
and demands industry, initiative, experience, train- 
ing, and leadership. 
c. Exhibits. School exhibits of the regular work 
109
-P-A-G-E-120
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
done in a building are worth while both as a means of 
keeping the parents in touch with the work of the chil- 
dren and also as a means of professional growth on the 
part of other teachers in the system who come to see 
what other buildings are doing. These exhibits may 
come toward the close of the year or may be planned 
for special times during the year, as just before a vaca- 
tion or a special holiday. The principal should de- 
cide upon the nature of the exhibit and the general 
plan for it. She should arrange for giving publicity 
to it and to caring for the visitors after they have 
reached the building. 
d. Fire drill. Still another important miscellaneous 
duty for which every principal should be held respon- 
sible is the organization of the fire drill. These drills 
should follow a carefully worked-out plan which will 
enable all the pupils to leave a building with a mini- 
mum of confusion, crowding, and disorder in the 
least possible time. Definite plans should be made 
for the children to reach a place of safety outside the 
building and for their orderly return to the building 
after it is determined that it is only a drill and not a 
real fire. These drills should be held at least once a 
month throughout the school year, and in the fall 
during the nice weather they may be held even more 
frequently so that each pupil will move automatically 
to the place of safety. After the first few drills, no 
one but the principal should know when the drill is to 
take place.

  THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
From all that has been said in the foregoing para- 
graphs of this chapter, it must be apparent that 
there is a field of work which the principal may fill 
without encroaching upon the prerogatives of the 
superintendent in the least. In fact, if the superin- 
tendent attempts to perform any of them, he will 
find his time burdened with numerous details which 
will keep him from doing the real things which he is 
paid to do. 
Pedagogical duties 
” There is still a second important division of the 
duties of the elementary-school principal which may 
be designated as pedagogical duties, These include 
first of es, for it is as- 
sumed that, in schools of the class for which this book 
is written, not many schools will employ only super- 
vising principals. In nearly every case the principal 
will be responsible for considerable teaching on her 
own account. This will vary with the size of the 
building, It is doubtful if any principal of a twelve- 
teacher building should be expected to do much reg- 
ular teaching. In buildings smaller than this, the 
principal will probably be expected to have regular 
teaching work, and in small buildings it is quite likely 
that she will be expected to teach most of her time. 
In spite of this fact, principals should make a genuine 
effort to keep in touch with the instruction which is 
being given in their buildings. Early in the year the 
IIL
-P-A-G-E-122
  " MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
principal may well train her own pupils to carry on 
their i ji Were ac- 
tually present-im-the-room. This will make it pos- 
sible for the principal to get away at suitable intervals 
to observe instruction elsewhere in her building, and 
it will also provide for those emergencies which are 
bound to arise when the principal will be called out of 
her room for urgent matters. The same principles 
which govern the superintendent in his classroom vis- 
itation should also govern the principal in her visi- 
tation. She must secure the confidence of her teach- 
ers and show them that she can be of real service to 
them. 
One of the things which a principal can do in any 
school is to give standard tests and to analyze t! - 
sults with a view-to-improving the weak places dis- 
covered. She can give such tests more frequently 
than the superintendent can, and she can carry out 
special investigations and follow them up in a way it 
would not be possible for the superintendent to do. 
These tests will furnish a basis for studying the modi- 
fications necessary in the course of study. They will 
furnish evidence upon which a better classification of 
pupils can be made. They may bring to light com- 
munity conditions which will be worth the study of 
the teachers and the principal in an attempt to reach 
a final result. 
Where the building is not so large as to make it 
clearly impossible, the principal of a building should 
112
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL 
know every childin the school. She should know the 
parents. She should become familiar with all the 
forces of the neighborhood. She should exercise a 
real educational and moral leadership in the com- 
munity. .

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
The importance of the position is often not recognized 
Most high-school principals in small school systems 
are like Topsy — they “just growed”! They are 
without professional training and have rarely much 
experience. Boards of education have often felt it 
desirable to have a man-teacher in the high school, 
just as a sort of specimen of the species, and, since 
it requires a larger salary to secure a man than it does 
a woman, the man has been placed in the position 
which carried the higher salary regardless of his abil- 
ity to fill it with the greatest satisfaction. This state- 
ment explains, if it does not justify, the situation. 
Because of this lack of training and experience, super- 
intendents of small schools have hesitated or refused 
to assign to the high-school principal duties other 
than mere routine. This practice has continued un- 
til custom has fixed it as a policy of school adminis- 
tration. The superintendent has made little effort to 
train his principal for larger service as a professional 
leader of the high-school group, and the principal, not 
having a vision of the greater possibilities of the prin- 
cipalship, has drifted along in a blind trial-and-error 
fashion. This situation is unfortunate for all parties 
concerned. 
114
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
Routine duties of the position 
The purpose of this chapter is to stimulate superin- 
tendents and principals to a recognition of some of 
the larger aspects of the high-school principalship, as 
well as to call attention to the items of school routine 
which belong to the position. Among these latter 
items may be mentioned: (1) the keeping of attend- 
ance and scholastic records; (2) making the schedule 
of classes; (3) general, but not necessarily active, 
management of all high-school student activities, 
such as athletics, literary and debating societies, and 
social affairs; (4) arranging for assembly, or opening 
exercises; (5) responsibility for the general discipline 
of the high school; (6) responsibility for overseeing 
the janitor service; and (7) the codrdination of all the 
many activities of his school. Some of these items 
may, at times, rise from the list of routine affairs into 
the realm of real educational and professional prob- 
lems. In addition, he has definite supervisory and 
pedagogical duties to perform. 
The larger duties 
C. O. Davis, of the University of Michigan, reports 
in the School Review for May, 1921 (pp. 337-50), a 
study of the “Duties of High-School Principals” 
made by the Commission of Secondary Schools of the 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools. The following quotation from this article 
II5
-P-A-G-E-126
re A ee ee RS Oe, 
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
summarizes the real duties of a high-school principal 
thus: 
I. To formulate a vision and a policy for the school 
over which he presides and to communicate this 
vision to his entire staff of assistants. 
. To lead in the formulation of ways and means for 
realizing their vision and policy. 
. To supervise instruction, inspire teachers and pu- 
pils, codrdinate and articulate efforts, and secure 
unity of spirit and practice. 
.. To serve as the school’s accredited agent before the 
public and to enlighten and advise the public in re- 
spect to what the schools are undertaking, what they 
are achieving, what are their needs, and what edu- 
cation truly signifies. 
. To share confidences with his teachers and pupils, 
capitalize their intelligence and enthusiasm, dele- 
gate to them as large and as many responsibilities as 
circumstances permit, and integrate and unify the 
work of the entire school. 
Specific professional preparation needed 
Vision and leadership come through natural abil- 
ity and specific training. The part played by natural 
ability is much smaller than is usually believed. It 
is true there must be a certain amount of it before any 
considerable training is possible, but given a reason- 
able amount of it, the ordinary individual who falls 
heir to a small high-school principalship can acquire 
by specific training a high degree of both vision and 
ability to lead. This training should be begun ina _ 
116
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
college of education before the individual begins to 
perform professional duties, and continued in gradu- 
ate study after he has had sufficient practical experi- 
ence to make such advanced work meaningful. But 
however fine this may be in theory, the fact remains 
that wenow have hundreds of people holding positions 
as high-school principals who have not had such train- 
ing and in the very nature of the case many of them 
cannot hope to secure it. For such, whatever is done 
to improve their training must be done in service. 
Fortunately, this can be done. Superintendents in 
many places are constantly engaged in training their 
teachers in professional matters. It is just as much 
the business of the superintendent to continue the 
professional training of his high-school principal as it 
is to continue the professional training of his teachers. 
The character of the training 
What professional training should a high-school 
principal have? Since he is directly concerned with 
the instruction of boys and girls, he should possess a 
sound educational psychology. Applied practically 
to a high-school situation, this means that the princi- 
pal will know enough about the laws of learning to 
tell when the instruction of his teachers hits the mark 
and when it goes far over the heads of the pupils. It 
means that he knows the principles of supervised 
study and can tell when teachers are getting right 
results from it. The high-school principal needs a 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
sensible educational philosophy. This means that he 
shall know aims and outcomes to be expected of his in- 
stitution. What are the purposes which underlie the 
several subjects of the curriculum? Are they con- 
tributing to health, practical efficiency, training for 
citizenship, wise use of leisure, or social service?, And 
finally, the high-school principal needs to be: well 
grounded in the principles of efficient school adminis- 
tration. This means he will know how to construct 
his program on a scientific basis to the end that the 
teaching load may be properly adjusted, that the pu- 
pils may wisely choose their subjects, that no money 
may be wasted through an unnecessary teaching staff 
or in the improper distribution of work. It means 
that he knows how to secure high efficiency from his 
teachers, that the number of failures will be kept at a 
minimum, that equipment will be put to a maximum 
use, and that educational and financial wastes of all 
descriptions will be eliminated to the greatest possible 
extent. 
The superintendent’s responsibility 
The superintendent of schools can see that the prin- 
cipal is brought into the right contacts, that he is pro- 
vided with proper professional literature, and that he 
is allowed adequate professional opportunity to grow. 
The high-school principal needs the encouragement, 
guidance, and inspiration, which a real live progres- 
sive superintendent can give. Too often itis the su- 
118
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
perintendent’s fault that the principal is without vi- 
sion, without a sense of the significance of his position, 
and without an adequate sense of the relative impor- 
tance of his duties. Just so long as superintendents 
of small schools insist on usurping the prerogatives 
of the high-school principal and in crushing whatever 
initiative and sense of responsibility the principal 
may have, just that long may we expect to find the 
high-school principal in the small school exactly what 
he is now in most places — a classroom teacher with 
a few clerical and routine duties added. 
One method of professional growth 
But granted that the high-school principal has the 
opportunity and the desire to improve his professional 
standing, what can he do to accomplish his purpose? 
Right here is where most professional literature breaks 
down. It fails to offer concrete constructive help 
with definite details. The following suggestions are 
offered as one solution of the problem. 
Let him begin his study by asking the question, 
‘What are the specific objectives of secondary educa- 
tion?” He should not be satisfied with a statement 
of generalities. Let him look into each field which 
secondary education touches. What are the specific 
objectives in the field of health, in service, in moral- 
ity? It is clear that these objectives must be very 
numerous. There are probably a good many hun- 
dred of them. The road to a clear and accurate 
119
-P-A-G-E-130
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
vision of secondary education lies through just such 
aproblem. When the principal develops this vision, 
he will find that its elements are much more social 
than academic. High-school teachers as a class do 
not have this vision. They see the subjects taught, 
not as a means to an end, but as an end per se. When 
the principal has acquired an accurate view of the 
total series of outcomes expected from the institution 
over which he presides, he has taken the first step to- 
ward successful and efficient leadership. His next ef- 
fort will be to develop and maintain in all members of 
his teaching corps a similar vision of the purposes to 
be accomplished. His staff must be taught these 
aims and the methods of reaching them so thoroughly 
that each one could travel the same road without the 
principal’s personal guidance. This may be accom- 
plished through personal explanations, directed read- 
ing, lectures, observation, participation, round-table 
conferences, and other ways. When they have ac- 
quired the vision, the initiative should be left largely 
with the teachers, leaving for the principal the final 
decisions as to policies. The principal’s next step 
will be to master the detailed processes involved in 
reaching each of the various objectives. When this 
is accomplished, he should see that his teachers come 
to an understanding of these detailed processes. 
This does not mean that he is to impose his particular 
method upon the teacher. It rather means that he 
should stimulate the teacher to exercise her initiative 
120
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
in planning while he retains the responsibility of pass- 
ing on the feasibility of the detailed plan. 
Many minor duties should be delegated to others 
Very early in his professional career the principal 
should learn to pass just as many details as possible 
on to other people. It is not his task as principal to 
do these minor things. His business is to get them 
done by people who have specialized in doing that 
sort of work. He should know how to do a good job 
of sweeping, but it is the janitor’s task to do the work. 
He should delegate not only such routine work, but 
also much of the thinking and planning necessary to 
the successful administration of a school. The one 
thing he cannot delegate to others is his responsibility 
to the school authorities and to the public for the ac- 
complishment of the purposes for which the institu- 
tion exists. Hence, he must retain his own vision and 
judgment and use it as a standard for correcting the 
shortcomings of those to whom the work was assigned. 
The principal must also see that the work delegated 
to others to do is actually performed and performed 
economically with regard to time, money, materials, 
and labor. The plan may be exceptionally outlined, 
but until the desired results appear it has little value. 
Suggestions in other chapters apply to the high-school 
principal also 
Many of the points mentioned in other chapters of 
121
-P-A-G-E-132
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
this book are applicable to the high-school principal 
and his work. When he supervises classroom teach- 
ing, his methods should be much the same as the su- 
perintendent would use. When he conducts teachers’ 
meetings, he should make use of the principles out- 
lined in the chapter dealing with this subject. Like- 
wise, the chapter on “The Elementary-School Prin- 
cipal” contains many items which are just as true 
with respect to the high-school principal as they are 
of the elementary-school principal. Repetition of 
these items here is unnecessary. ,

THE SCHOOL NURSE 
Health work is a new school function 
Heatru work is one of the most recent additions to 
the functions performed by schools. Nevertheless, 
in those communities where the problem has been 
given serious attention, and where the work has been 
organized carefully and developed in a tactful man- 
ner, it is safe to say that the public has come to regard 
it as one of the most essential of the many school ac- 
tivities. The conservation of child life is bound to 
be considered one of the major purposes of public 
education. In the large cities elaborate health de- 
partments have grown up with a complete staff of 
medical directors, physicians, nurses, dentists, and 
specialists. Open-air schools have been organized. 
Undernourished children have been fed. Free clin- 
ics have been established. But in the smaller com- 
munities no such organization is possible or necessary. 
These communities need to be educated to the impor- 
tance of health work, and therefore whatever is begun 
must be started in a small way. As the community 
comes to a full appreciation of the value of school 
health work, proper expansion may be made. The 
purpose of this chapter is to suggest how health work 
123  
-P-A-G-E-134
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
in the smaller schools may be started and what prob- 
lems are likely to be encountered. 
The school nurse as the solution of the problem 
Wherever the community is large enough to justify 
the employment of a full-time school nurse, that is 
probably the best way to begin. If there are eight 
hundred to a thousand children or more in the school 
district, the employment of such a nurse will be found 
profitable. In school districts where less than this 
number of pupils live, the district should join with a 
neighboring district and secure between them a full- 
time school nurse. In some places the county school 
nurse has been a very satisfactory solution of the prob- 
lem. Such a nurse, if she is competent and well- 
trained, will do more for the improvement of health 
conditions than any other influence. She will actu- 
ally save the community in cold cash many times the 
amount expended for her annual salary. 
Essential qualifications 
The difficult problem is to find the right person for 
this important position. Any ordinary nurse will not 
do. The qualifications required are many and im- 
portant. As with a teacher, the fundamental quali- 
ties are a fine personality, a complete technical train- 
ing, some experience, and a missionary spirit. She 
must know how to dress appropriately for her work 
— neatly, smartly, but plainly. The very best tech- 
124 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
THE SCHOOL NURSE 
nical training, in a children’s hospital if possible, in 
addition to at least two years of private practice, 
should be required before her final six months’ train- 
ing in school nursing. She must have actual ability, 
sound judgment, keen observation, and good sense. 
Her ideals must be high, her character positive and 
without flaw. She needs more than all else a deep 
love for children, a love that embraces the dirty as 
well as the clean, the repulsive as well as the attrac- 
tive, the dull as well as the bright. She must possess 
tact to the highest degree, as without this virtue her 
work will fail. She must be able to secure codpera- 
tion from children, parents, teachers, physicians, 
welfare workers, and the public generally. These 
and many other necessary qualities are difficult to 
find-all combined in one individual, and yet they are 
not so rare as one might imagine. If the community 
is willing to pay $1500 to $1800 a year for such serv- 
ice, a school nurse with satisfactory qualifications can 
be secured. 
Getting the work started 
In order to get this work started in localities where 
it is not already under way, the American Red Cross, 
under certain conditions, will assist financially. 
Other financial help may be obtained from the State 
Tuberculosis Association. In small communities the 
nurse may take over the work of the census enumer- 
ator and the truant or attendance officer, as is now 
125

being done in a number of places. This arrangement 
will release the funds ordinarily paid for such service 
and will still further reduce the cost of beginning the 
health work without reducing the efficiency in the 
least. In fact, the chances are that the nurse will 
make a better attendance officer than the janitor 
or some person of similar type such as one ordinarily 
finds in the smaller towns. The work of the attend- 
ance officer is educational and this fits right into the 
work of the school nurse. It is customary to employ 
the school nurse twelve months and allow her four 
weeks’ vacation during the summer. 
Health supervision in the schools 
Health inspection includes tests of vision, hearing, 
nose, throat, teeth, palate, cervical glands, skin, hair, 
nutrition, and any other apparent symptoms of dis- 
ease. In the schools health inspection and supervision 
has had three definite purposes. First, the discovery 
of early symptoms of contagious disease as a protec- 
tion to the child and to prevent decrease in school at- 
tendance. Second, the discovery of physical defects 
which may, and in a very large percentage of cases do, 
handicap the child in his physical development and 
retard his progress in school. Third, the cultivation 
of health by the early formation of health habits, 
especially among the younger children. Once each 
year a thorough inspection of each pupil is made. 
Classroom inspections of the pupils are made regu- 
126
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE SCHOOL NURSE 
larly and frequently, and where the room has been ex- 
posed to contagious disease such inspection is made 
daily. Children showing symptoms of any conta- 
gious disease are excluded from school and referred to 
the family physician. Children who are absent, es- 
pecially after exposure to disease, and cannot be ac- 
counted for, are visited in the home by the school 
nurse to ascertain the cause and see if the necessary 
care is provided. The nurse also visits the homes for 
the purpose of discussing with the mothers the gen- 
eral health of the children and suggesting remedial 
measures such as correct diet, proper outdoor exercise, 
and hygienic conditions in the home. On discovery 
of any physical defect, the parents are notified in writ- 
ing with a recommendation to take the child to the 
family physician, oculist, or dentist. In many cases 
especially urgent, this notice is followed up by a per- 
sonal visit of the nurse to the home to explain the 
reason for medical or dental treatment. Much atten- 
tion has been paid to the matter of undernourish- 
ment. Each school is equipped with a scale having a 
measuring-rod attached. All children are weighed 
regularly, and the under-weight children frequently. 
Monthly weight charts are used in each classroom and 
the children are interested keeping their weight as 
near their standard as possible. 
The follow-up work of the nurse 
In one year the school nurse in one of the smaller 
127 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
Middle West schools made over nine hundred visits 
to the homes of school children to consult with par- 
ents about defects discovered through her inspection. 
In this community the following percentage of defects, 
which required treatment, were found in addition to 
others not listed here.

The school nurse secures better results than the earlier 
medical inspection by physicians 
These visits secured in most cases proper attention 
to the defects. For a number of years before the em- 
ployment of the school nurse in one community, the 
local physicians had made a casual inspection of the 
children once a year and printed notices had been 
sent home with the children calling attention to any 
defects discovered. Practically no attention was 
paid to these printed notices by the parents, and very 
little had been done to correct the defects. With the 
coming of the school nurse, all this changed. Re- 
ported defects were now followed up. Parents were 
visited and the nature of the treatment required was 
explained. The effects of failure to correct the de- 
fects were stated. Probably eighty per cent or more 
128
-P-A-G-E-139
THE SCHOOL NURSE 
of these defects now received proper attention. In 
those cases where the family was unable to pay for 
needed treatment, the school nurse found physicians 
and specialists who were willing to provide whatever 
was necessary without charge for their services. 
The school nurse and the community 
The school nurse in this small city carried on a 
campaign of health education by means of talks to 
mothers’ meetings and to parent-teachers’ meetings, 
by timely articles of advice printed in the local pa- 
pers, as well as by her personal individual contacts 
with parents, teachers, and pupils. Absence from 
school was materially reduced through her activities. 
At one time a diphtheria epidemic was threatened. 
The school nurse, by means of cultures taken from 
the noses and throats of school children, was able to 
locate the “carriers” and exclude them from contact 
with other children through the codperation of the 
local board of health. Under former conditions these 
carriers would have been allowed contact with other 
children, and in the end the schools would have been 
closed for a period of weeks, many cases of diphtheria 
would have developed, and doubtless a number of 
children would have died. Considered entirely from 
a financial standpoint the work of the school nurse in 
this single emergency saved the community in dollars 
more than enough to pay her salary for twenty-five 
years.

EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE 
The disposition of one’s time 
TuE purpose of this chapter is to discuss the elements 
involved in personal and in office efficiency. In one 
respect all human beings are equal. Each one has 
twenty-four hours a day at his disposal. How he 
manages this time determines his success or failure. 
The superintendent of schools must be a careful stu- 
dent of the question of the wise use of his daily time. 
The first step to take in studying one’s time consump- 
tion is to make a careful record over a period of per- 
haps a week of the exact disposition of one’s time. A 
convenient way to do this is to use a 3 X 5 filing card 
for each day, and record upon it the exact minute a 
task is begun and completed. A separate record 
should probably be made for time consumed during 
the working hours and for one’s leisure time. When 
this record of time consumption is completed, the 
next thing to do is to examine carefully the records 
for irregularities, for excessive time consumed on cer- 
tain things, for possible changes and combinations. 
The classification of one’s duties 
Before attempting to draft a schedule of time con- 
sumption, it is well to classify all of one’s duties. Ifa 
130
-P-A-G-E-141
   EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE 
large sheet of paper can be ruled in three columns, the 
duties which must be performed every day may be 
listed in the first column; those items which require 
occasional attention may be placed in column two; 
and in the third column may be listed the opportu- 
nities one has for making professional advancement. 
The first two columns should be carefully studied to 
ascertain if the superintendent is performing any du- 
ties which could just as well be performed by a sub- 
ordinate; perhaps by an office girl, a teacher, or a jan- 
itor. The first rule for a superintendent to adopt is 
this: “ Never de what anybody else can do.” More than 
half of the telephone calls, correspondence, and other 
routine matters can be handled just as effectively by 
the office girl as by the superintendent. It is poor 
business policy for the highest salaried individual in 
the system to do these routine duties which can 
be performed by much lower salaried individuals. 
The superintendent’s time should be free for doing 
those things which require training, experience, and 
knowledge not possessed by any other individual in 
the corps. 
Arranging a time consumption schedule 
A knowledge of certain fundamental laws of psy- 
chology will assist one to arrange his time schedule 
after he has pruned off all those items which can go to 
subordinates. Most people reach the point of maxi- 
mum mental output about 10 A.M., while the mini- 
131 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
mum occurs about 4 or 5 P.M. One’s thinking, plan- 
ning, organizing should be done between 8 and rr. 
Minor details and mechanical work should be rigidly 
excluded from these hours. The last half-hour of the 
day at the office may be used to plan in detail the 
work for the next day. 
After the superintendent has eliminated those 
items not requiring his personal handling, he should 
study his habits and his duties, as revealed by the 
records before him in the light of modern psychology 
and with the idea of planning the schedule of time 
consumption which he intends to follow. All duties 
which occur regularly should be assigned a definite 
time on the schedule, in the morning if possible, and a 
reasonable time allowed for completion of each task. 
Some efficiency specialists recommend that each 
working hour from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. be divided into 
five-minute periods and that each be systematically 
filled. In order to take care of unavoidable interrup- 
tions, the last five minutes of each hour or a half-hour 
late in the afternoon may be left without definite as- 
signment. It is desirable to plan for a few minutes’ 
relaxation once or twice a day, and late in the after- 
noon the program should include an hour of exercise 
and recreation in the open air. The first schedule 
will necessarily be tentative, and more or less experi- 
menting will be necessary before one finally reaches 2 
program which is entirely satisfactory. Such a pro- 
gram ought to insure a clean desk at the end of the 
132
-P-A-G-E-143
  EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE 
day, with every task completed without undue hurry 
and with no waste of time. The important thing is to 
have a schedule of time consumption based upon a 
study of one’s needs and the conditions of his work, 
and then to follow it religiously, permitting interrup- 
tions only for unusual circumstances, which cannot 
be met in any other manner. As an illustration of the 
general scheme in mind the following schedule is 
submitted: 
Time Schedule for Superintendent of Schools 
8.00 A.M. 
8.00- 8.30 
8.30-10.30 
I0.30-12.00

Brief conferences with teachers. Look over 
morning’s mail. 
Three days each week these hours are re- 
served for special thinking and planning, 
and for the study of large educational prob- 
lems connected with the local field. Two 
days each week the time after g o’clock is 
devoted to classroom visitation. 
Supervision of instruction at least three 
days each week. Office work one or two 
days each week. 
Luncheon hour. 
Three days each week given to supervision 
of instruction. One day each week the 
time is reserved for reading of current pro- 
fessional magazines. One day each week 
the time is used for administrative duties. 
General office hour, daily. People met 
without previous appointment. 
Reserved for conferences with teachers, 
133
-P-A-G-E-144
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
pupils, patrons, and others, usually by spe- 
cial appointment. Also plan to-morrow’s 
work during last fifteen or twenty minutes 
of the hour. 
5.00 Leave the office. 
The schedule and interruptions 
No schedule can be framed which will not be 
broken into at times by unexpected callers, the tel- 
ephone, and in other ways. However, this is no 
excuse for not operating on a schedule. Railroads 
maintain a schedule for their passenger trains. Some- 
times a wreck occurs. Sometimes there is an un- 
usually large amount of baggage to load. Some- 
times the engine does not function properly. All 
these and other causes delay the train. Sometimes 
it is hours late. But, and this is the thing of real im- 
portance, just as soon as possible every employee con- 
cerned makes every possible effort to get the train 
back on schedule time. The writer was once travel- 
ing on a Michigan Central train from New York City 
to Chicago. Somewhere in central New York engine 
trouble developed. The train reached Buffalo three 
or four hours late. The train to which the Pullman 
cars should have been attached had departed on 
schedule time via Niagara Falls. The railway em- 
ployees took the Pullman cars from the delayed train, 
put an engine ahead of them, and ran them as a 
special train at a high rate of speed from Buffalo to 
134
-P-A-G-E-145
  EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE ~ 
St. Thomas, arriving at the latter station just three 
minutes ahead of the regular train. The Pullman 
cars were attached to the proper train and the jour- 
ney to Chicago was made on schedule time. The 
same principle is to be applied to a time consumption 
schedule after a delay has occurred. Get back to the 
schedule as fast as possible. If a little tact is em- 
ployed, teachers and the public soon learn what hours 
are most acceptable to the superintendent for confer- 
ences. A courteous and tactful office girl can usually 
manage to postpone most of the commercial visits to 
the general office hour. The superintendent himself 
should cultivate the art of courteously but firmly pre- 
venting any visitor from consuming more of his time 
than the importance of the visit justifies. 
The use of one’s leisure time 
Thus far, consideration has been given mostly to 
the working day. No superintendent can afford to 
neglect the systematic organization of his leisure 
time. One’s leisure hours are by far the most impor- 
tant. They ought to be used just as wisely as the 
hours spent on the job. Self-improvement is the 
key-word. A wise combination of recreation, serious 
study, exercise, and social life will keep an individual 
fit for the larger position just ahead of him. Study 
your habits and your interests. Plan a schedule 
wisely and then follow it just as you would one for the 
regular working hours of the day.

  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
Office equipment 
The equipment in the superintendent’s office has a 
great deal to do with his efficiency. Every item of 
equipment found there should serve a useful purpose. 
The standard articles required for a superintendent’s 
office in a small school system include, among others, 
the following: 
1. A large flat-top desk, “sanitary” type. 
2. A filing cabinet containing letter-size drawers, a 
5 X 8 card section, a 4 X 6 card section, and some- 
times a 3 X 5 card section. 
. A good standard typewriter and a desk for it. 
. Mimeograph. 
. A professional library for use of the superintendent 
and teachers. 
6. Suitable cupboard or storage facilities for all printed 
blanks and office supplies. 
7. A desk telephone. 
8. A comfortable chair for each person employed in the 
office, and a few chairs for visitors. 
g. An adding machine. 
to. A good recent map of the city, framed and hung on 
the wall. 
11. A set of pigeonholes to hold mail, circulars, small 
supplies, etc., for each teacher (if there is only one 
building in the system) or for each building (if 
several). 
12. A paper-cutter, a paper-punch, and a waste-basket. 
The desk 
The desk is the most important piece of equipment. 
136 ap w 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE 
A little study of the user’s needs will determine its ar- 
rangement. Articles for which one naturally reaches 
with his right hand go on the right side and those 
sought by the left hand should be placed on the left 
side. No loose papers should be allowed to remain on 
top of the desk, unless there is a definite immediate 
use forthem. ‘The cleaner the desk, the bigger the 
man,” is an old saying which has much truth in it. 
The desk should not become an auxiliary filing cabi- 
net. Only those documents which are being used 
from day to day by the user of the desk have any 
right to a permanent location there. As soon as a pa- 
per has ceased to be of current value or need, it should 
be removed to the larger filing cabinet. Keep the ex- 
ecutive’s desk in fighting trim, constantly cleared for 
action. Any unfinished work at the close of the day 
should be placed in a vacant drawer. The upper left- 
hand drawer may well have a compartment for this 
purpose. On top of the desk a “‘tickler” or calendar 
pad, a piece of plate-glass, a telephone, and a small 
scratch pad are all useful. 
The mimeograph 
Some means for making duplicate copies of written 
and typewritten matter is essential. In a very small 
system, where fifteen or twenty copies constitute the 
maximum number required, a simple duplicating 
machine will answer the purpose, but in a somewhat 
larger system it is much better to get a good stencil 
137
-P-A-G-E-148
SS 3 a 
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
mimeograph. Such a machine will pay for itself in a 
year or two by the saving it will make on printers’ 
bills to say nothing of the convenience, speed, and 
time-saving features of it. 
The professional library 
A carefully selected and growing professional li- 
brary should be maintained. It need not be large at 
the start — fifteen or twenty high-class books selected 
to cover a number of fields will do. As new books come 
out, a few of the better ones may be added each year. 
Teachers should be encouraged to make use of this 
library in order to learn better methods, and to grow 
professionally. Four or five good professional maga- 
zines ought to be taken each year and a scheme 
worked out so that each teacher will have the better 
articles of the month brought to her attention. 
Records 
The office of an efficient school contains records of 
practically every character needed by the school — 
financial, educational progress, census data, invento- 
ries, book registers, results of standard intelligence 
and achievement tests, insurance data, teachers’ reg- 
isters, etc. James J. Hill once said, “Ample and ac- 
curate information is the first step toward success in 
any undertaking.” It is certainly true as applied to 
all phases of a superintendent’s work. Each record 
should be carefully filed and preserved. 
138,
-P-A-G-E-149
  EFFICIENCY IN THE OFFICE 
Clerical help 
Whenever a school system reaches a total of twenty 
or twenty-five teachers, the superintendent should be 
furnished with a competent office girl who can serve 
as both stenographer and clerk. She can be taught 
to take full charge of practically all the routine work 
in the office, and thereby release the time of the super- 
intendent so that he may actually supervise class in- 
struction for at least half of his time. This is the 
real object of employing a superintendent, anyway. 
His chief business is to improve the quality of instruc- 
tion. It is foolish economy to pay a well-trained su- 
perintendent a salary of several thousand dollars a 
year, and then tie him up in an office with petty cler- 
ical details, and prevent him from really doing the 
biggest job in the system, and especially so when a 
competent office girl can be secured for a few hundred 
dollars a year to look after the bulk of the routine 
work.

  XII 
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
Prans for the next school year begin to take definite 
form about the first of March. From that time on to 
the end of the school year in May or June, most of the 
work in a superintendent’s office has to do either with 
getting ready for the next school year or closing the 
present one. The purpose of this chapter is to sug- 
gest things which need to be done in each of these 
phases of a superintendent’s work. 
Discovering the school problems 
The way to begin planning for next year is to 
accumulate data showing what the school problem 
will be at that time. First of all, there should be 
made a study of the number of children likely to be in 
each grade and in each building if there is more than 
one building in the system. This information can 
be prepared by the teachers and it should be done 
as carefully as circumstances permit. Each teacher 
ought to know by the first of March the approximate 
number of pupils which she will promote to the next 
grade at the end of the current school year. Like- 
wise she should know rather certainly the approxi- 
mate number of pupils likely to fail and remain in the 
140
-P-A-G-E-151
  GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
present grade. If there are several buildings in the 
city to which grade children are sent, it is probably 
advisable to have the principals of the several build- 
ings work out this information together after it has 
first been assembled by teachers. Very often it will 
be found helpful to use a map of the school district on 
which the blocks of the town are shown, and to locate 
upon this map by means of a code number the proba- 
ble residence of each child in the district. A very con- 
venient key for this sort of thing may be made by 
giving each grade building a code number in the tens 
place and by using the number of the grade in the 
units place. For example, if “1” stood for the first 
ward building a child who would attend the third 
grade of this school would be represented on the map 
by the figure “13”; and a child in the fourth grade of 
the second ward could be represented on the map by 
the code number “24.” 
When these data are all assembled, the superin- 
tendent will have before him the setting of his educa- 
tional problem for the next school year. He can then 
determine how many children will be in each grade, 
in each subdistrict of his city. If it should be found 
that there are not enough children in one subdistrict 
to justify the employment of a teacher in that grade, 
it will be known in advance that these children must 
either be combined with another group of children or 
be transferred to another building. From this study 
the superintendent will know just how many teachers 
141
-P-A-G-E-152
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
will be required to supply the needs of the schools so 
far as regular work is concerned. 
Formulating the program for next year 
The next step should be the formulation of the su- 
perintendent’s program for the coming school year. 
This includes a careful consideration of any changes 
which need to be made in the course of study, either 
by elimination or addition thereto. If a new depart- 
ment is contemplated, that should also be known at 
this time and definitely worked out as a part of the pro- 
posed program for the coming year. If there is to be 
any new emphasis given to a special line of work, that 
should also be decided at this time. When the super- 
intendent has studied his entire plant, his commu- 
nity needs, his finances, and all other factors involved, 
he should then formulate in writing a concise, definite 
statement of what he proposes to accomplish during 
the coming school year. This program should be sub- 
mitted to the board of education at a special meeting 
some time during the latter part of March or perhaps 
early April. Ifthere aremanyitemsinvolved, it should 
come before the board at a time when no other matter 
is under discussion. This will give opportunity for a 
full examination of the proposals. When the board 
of education has finally approved the recommenda- 
tions made by the superintendent, it will be possi- 
ble to begin working out the details involved in their 
execution. 
142
-P-A-G-E-153
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
The annual election of teachers 
During the latter part of March or early April 
there should occur the election of teachers for the 
next year. Usually most of the corps employed 
during the current year will be reélected, and it is cus- 
tomary to give these teachers a reasonable length of 
time, generally about ten days, to sign the contract 
which has been tendered to them. At the end of this 
period the campaign to discover new teachers to fill 
any vacancies left in the corps should be got under 
way. Most authorities agree that the minimum re- 
quirement for teachers of towns of any size ought to 
be normal-school graduation for a place in the ele- 
mentary schools and a college graduation for a high- 
school position. If a superintendent can secure the 
adoption of this standard by his board, he will have 
gone a long way toward securing satisfactory teach- 
ers. Without a doubt there are teachers who lack 
the normal-school and college training just indicated 
who are excellent teachers, but a superintendent is 
much safer to insist that this standard be met than 
he is to attempt to fill his corps with people of less 
preparation. 
The salary schedule 
Another very important element in securing satis- 
factory teachers is the salary schedule. It is custom- 
ary to establish a given minimum salary which will be 
143
-P-A-G-E-154
    MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
paid to teachers with minimum qualifications. This 
salary then is increased at a definite rate each year for 
from five to seven or eight years to a determined max- 
imum salary. Quite often there is an additional al- 
lowance of a definite amount for attendance at sum- 
mer schools or colleges beyond the minimum qualifi- 
cations. The following is a copy of a sheet which is 
sent out to applicants by the schools of one typical 
Mid-Western small city. 
REGULATIONS GOVERNING EMPLOYMENT 
OF TEACHERS 
Eligibility 
1. Teachers of kindergartens and elementary grades

tion and experience meet the approval of the Board 
of Education. 
Sick-Leave Allowance 
feachers will be entitled to five days’ sick leave within 
the school year without loss of pay, provided this per- 
sonal illness has been properly certified to by the prin- 
cipal of the school. Teachers absent on account of the 
death of an immediate relative shall be entitled to be 
absent three days at such time without loss of pay. 
Method of Paying Salaries 
Salaries will be paid in ten equal installments. The 
first installment will be paid on September 15, and suc- 
ceeding installments on the 15th day of each succeeding

Superintendent 
Securing candidates for vacant positions 
When it has been determined just what vacancies 
there are to be, just what salaries are to be paid, there 
comes the matter of securing candidates for these 
positions. Several methods are followed by schools 
to find teachers for their vacancies. In many places 
dependence is placed entirely upon those who chance 
to apply. This is not a very satisfactory way, since 
in many cases good teachers do not need to send ap- 
plications broadcast in order to find a good position. 
The more satisfactory way is for the board of educa- 
tion to authorize the superintendent to visit near-by 
normal schools and teachers’ colleges, as well as other 
near-by school systems, to seek desirable candidates. 
When the superintendent has located teachers who 
seem to be satisfactory, they should be invited to ap- 
ply for the vacancy. In some cases, especially in larger 
towns and cities, the superintendent has practically 
146
-P-A-G-E-157
  GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
complete authority to fill all vacancies within the 
limits of his salary schedule without referring to the 
board of education for special action. There is still 
another source of discovering candidates, and that is 
through teachers’ agencies. As a rule this method 
is not a very satisfactory one, although at times 
it works very well. A superintendent considering 
teachers from an agency should know the agency with 
whom he is negotiating and something of their repu- 
tation for sending satisfactory teachers. He must 
also remember a commission of about five per cent 
is charged a teacher on her first year’s salary, and 
to just that extent the candidate furnished by an 
agency is likely to be a cheaper and probably inferior 
teacher to one recommended by a normal school or 
teachers’ college where there is a free placement bu- 
reau. 
Ethics involved in selecting teachers employed 
elsewhere 
Just a word ought to be said about the ethics of 
asking teachers to leave one position and go to an- 
other. When a superintendent has located in an- 
other system one whom he would like to invite into 
his own schools, and he knows that such a change 
would be a professional and salary advancement for 
the teacher concerned, he should first consult the su- 
perintendent of the town where she is then employed, 
as quite often this place would be willing to meet the

advanced opportunity in order to retain the teacher 
in its own schools. Particularly, if the teacher 
sought is under contract in one place a superintendent 
should be very careful about offering her a position 
without first obtaining the consent of the authorities 
where she isemployed. On the other hand, no super- 
intendent should desire to hold a teacher under ordi- 
nary circumstances when there is an opportunity for 
her to make advancement by changing to another sys- 
tem. This whole question is one of the points of con- 
troversy and sources of hard feeling between boards 
of education in the smaller communities and teach- 
ers generally. Probably this whole subject could be 
settled by an agreement in the contract at the time 
of employment that the contract could be terminated 
by either party upon giving thirty days’ notice. 
The application blank 
Most schools use a regular form of application 
which asks for all the information deemed essential 
by school officials employing teachers. The informa- 
tion sought usually is grouped under: (1) personal 
data, including such items as age, weight, height, 
health, citizenship, and other items of a personal 
character; (2) educational preparation, including ele- 
mentary, secondary, normal school, and college 
training, together with any degrees or diplomas; 
(3) experience, including detailed statement of when, 
where, and what; (4) special questions; (5) a list of 
150

three or four references who are able to speak of the 
applicant’s ability and success. A copy of a very 
satisfactory application blank is shown on pages 148 
and149. It ought tobe strongly urged upon all ap- 
plicants that either a personal interview or a recent 
unmounted photograph is essential to secure con- 
sideration of one’s candidacy. 
Investigating applicants 
When an application has been received, it is cus- 
tomary to send out to at least three of the references 
a teacher’s success record blank with a stamped ad- 
dressed envelope for the reply. This blank asks a 
number of questions which are calculated to bring 
out whether the applicant is fitted for the position or 
not. A copy of one of these blanks is printed here- 
with.

  Special qualifications required for some positions 
For some types of positions special qualifications 
are demanded; for instance, a kindergarten teacher 
should have the ability to play a piano and to sing 
in an acceptable manner. This does not mean she 
should be a highly talented musician. She should be 
able to play and sing well enough to perform her du- 
ties in a satisfactory manner. In securing candi- 
dates for a primary position, a superintendent should 
152 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
satisfy himself that the applicant is able to teach the 
particular system of reading which is used in his 
school. An art supervisor should have some artistic 
ability, a music supervisor should be able to sing in an 
acceptable manner and probably should be able to 
play both the piano and the violin. An athletic 
coach should have had some experience, if possible, as 
a player ona college team. In short, the superintend- 
ent should analyze the requirements of every position 
which he has open and then satisfy himself that the 
person whom he recommends for the place is able to 
meet these demands in a satisfactory way. Every- 
where the question of discipline is a vital one, and the 
superintendent should satisfy himself that the one 
whom he recommends is able to meet the require- 
ments in this respect. 
Filling the vacancy 
The practice quite generally followed is for the su- 
perintendent to nominate teachers for the vacancy 
and for the board of education to elect them. No 
teacher should be elected except on the nomination of 
the superintendent. Since he is to be held responsible 
for the results of the school, he must have authority 
enough to be able to make good on that responsibility. 
The contract 
After a teacher is elected, a contract is usually 
mailed to her by the secretary of the board of educa- 
153

tion. This contract should contain a statement of 
the things expected and agreed to upon both sides. 
The following is a form of a contract used by one

Shall “home girls” be employed as teachers? 
In many places the superintendent is confronted 
with the question of whether “home girls” or stran- 
gers shall be employed. In general, a superintendent 
should seek to employ for a considerable portion of 
his corps out-of-town teachers. It is not objection- 
able to have a few “home girls” in the system, but if 
“home girls” constitute the majority of the corps 
there is danger, unless these individuals are unusually 
155 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  ' MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
professionally minded, that their personal conven- 
ience will interfere seriously with the plans for im- 
provement of the schools. These girls, having lived 
a number of years in the community, naturally have 
many social obligations, as well as more or less home 
duties to perform. Often these interfere with teach- 
ers’ meetings and committee work and other extra- 
curricular activities. Again, often these teachers do 
not feel the need of professional improvement, but 
rely upon local political situations to hold their posi- 
tions for them. On the other hand, if two thirds or 
three fourths of the teaching corps is made up of out- 
of-town teachers, the general attitude is much more 
likely to be favorable to professional advancement 
and the placing of school interests first. There are 
exceptions to all of these statements, as some of the 
most codperative teachers with whom the writer has 
worked have been “home girls.” What is written 
here should be understood to apply in general rather 
than to specific situations. 
Textbooks 
While the corps is being shaped for the next year, 
the question of textbooks comes under consideration. 
A textbook under ordinary conditions will last from 
four to five years. A few books like primary readers 
will not last that long because of the hard usage 
given them, while some high-school books will last 
even longer than the time indicated. In general, 
156
-P-A-G-E-167
  
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
from twenty to twenty-five per cent of the books in a 
school, where free textbooks are furnished, will need 
to be changed every year if it is desired to maintain 
the efficiency of the schools and to keep the expense 
item for textbooks from being unusually high in any 
one year. Whenever changes are made in textbooks, 
it should be for some very good reason. New super- 
intendents are often charged with a desire to discard 
the texts which they find in the system and replace 
them with books more to their liking. There is need 
for great caution here. Whatever changes are essen- 
tially necessary ought to be made without hesitation. 
But these changes should be gradual, the result of 
evolution rather than revolution. The superintend- 
ent should remember that textbooks cost money, and 
that if a book is useful at all it should be kept in serv- 
ice until the district has secured its money’s worth 
from the use of it. Of course, there are exceptional 
situations in which changes are necessary. The 
writer recalls having once worked in a school where a 
number of the books used by the children in the sixth 
and seventh grades had been used by the parents 
when they were children. In sucha case it is usually 
not difficult to convince a school board by a mere ex- 
hibition of the books that a change is desirable. 
“ Book-men” 
One of the most helpful agencies for information in 
regard to new books is the traveling representative 
157 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
of the regular established book publishing houses. 
These men are assigned to a limited territory and 
cover it two or three times a year. They are always 
able to point out the excellences of their own texts and 
to recommend a book suitable to the needs of a par- 
ticular school. Most of these men are honest in what 
they say about their own books. The writer has 
known a number of them who refused to recommend 
certain publications of their house because of their 
personal belief that they were not the best books on 
the market. These men are often much abused by 
cheap politicians who try to make political capital 
out of a situation which does not exist. Nevertheless, 
no superintendent should allow his judgment to be 
unduly influenced by the arguments of these agents. 
He should take time to examine carefully a number 
of the recent books published in the field whenever 
there is a change to be made. These books may be 
compared in the privacy of his own office, at his own 
leisure, and a calm judgment reached as to the merits 
and defects of the books under consideration. 
“Samples” 
A word ought to be said about “sample copies.” 
Whenever there is to be a definite change made in a 
given subject, textbook publishers are usually willing 
to submit sample copies for examination with a view 
to introduction. This is a legitimate part of the sales 
expense of the publishing house. This practice, how- 
158
-P-A-G-E-169
  GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
ever, has occasionally been abused by the unscrupu- 
lous superintendent. At times requests have been 
made for sample copies of books when there was no 
probability of their being adopted, or when the num- 
ber to. be bought was so small that it was not profit- 
able for the publishers to submit samples for consid- 
eration. This has led to protests from book compa- 
nies, and justly so. Especially do book companies 
object when these samples, which they have furnished 
free of charge, are sold to second-hand book compa- 
nies to come back into competition with the regularly 
maintained market. School men can doa great deal 
to reduce this abuse by making it a practice to refrain 
from asking or accepting samples of books where a 
change is not actually contemplated in the immediate 
future. 
The technique of selecting textbooks 
Within the last five or ten years much more atten- 
tion has been devoted to the proper selection of 
schoolbooks than theretofore. The best practice of 
the present day seems to lie: (1) in the determination 
of the needs to be met in the particular school for 
which the book is chosen; (2) the setting up, as a re- 
sult of this study, of certain definite standards, by 
which the merits of the books under consideration 
may be judged. At the present time there is no 
universally accepted set of standards. In general, 
such points as content, definiteness, proportion, style, 
159
-P-A-G-E-170
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
appeal to children, illustrations, teachability, and 
mechanical make-up of the book are among the 
points to be given consideration. In larger school 
systems it becomes an accepted practice for the super- 
intendent to secure the advice of a committee of his 
teachers whenever there are textbooks to be selected. 
In any system of schools, where there is a well- 
trained, experienced teacher with a constructive pro- 
fessional point of view, the superintendent will do 
well to secure the judgment of this individual upon 
any proposed adoption in her field. Very often the 
teacher, from her close contact with the children, will 
discover defects or advantages in a proposed book 
which would never occur to a superintendent, who is 
removed a greater distance from close contact with 
the children for whom the book is written. The final 
responsibility for the choice of textbooks belongs to 
the superintendent, and therefore he must make the 
final decision. 
Purchasing supplies 
The purchase of supplies for the coming year is an- 
other matter which should be attended to before the 
close of the current year. Sometimes these supplies 
are ordered entirely by the superintendent, and in 
other cases they are approved by the board of educa- 
tion and ordered by the secretary of the board. The 
particular routine does not matter so much; what is 
more important is that this list should be carefully 
160 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR © 
prepared. This can best be done under the direction 
of the superintendent. For all instructional supplies 
he should have the teachers prepare a list of articles 
which in their judgment are necessary and desirable. 
The teacher should indicate which of these items, if 
any, could be omitted without serious disadvantage 
in case the funds were not available for purchasing 
the entire list. The teacher should also prepare an 
inventory showing the supplies then on hand. From 
these requisitions the superintendent can decide as 
to his needs for the coming year. There should be 
added to this the office supplies and the supplies to be 
used by the janitors. When these lists have been 
finally determined, if they are very extensive, it is a 
good practice to send a copy to four or five of the 
near-by school supply houses with a request for a bid 
to be furnished on the articles specified. The condi- 
tions should require a bid F.O.B. the town in which the 
school is located, as this method will put all compet- 
ing companies upon an even basis as far as the local 
school is concerned. Where the quality of the arti- 
cles is not definitely known, the house furnishing the 
bid should also submit a sample. Quite often it is 
desirable for the school to reserve the privilege of ac- 
cepting certain items in a bid and rejecting any others. 
By this means a considerable saving often can be ob- 
tained. In the purchase of janitor supplies the or- 
dinary buyer is seriously handicapped. He is not 
equipped to test the various articles bought and his 
161  
-P-A-G-E-172
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
knowledge of market conditions is usually less accu- 
rate than in the case of textbooks and supplies. The 
result is that there is generally a great deal of unwise 
buying in this line. Probably the most satisfactory 
method for the smaller school to follow is to select one 
or two janitor supply houses that have furnished sat- 
isfactory material in the past at what seemed to be a 
satisfactory price, and continue to do business with 
them exclusively until such time as there is reason to 
believe a change is necessary. 
Equipment 
In the preparation for the coming school year a su- 
perintendent must also determine what new or addi- 
tional equipment is necessary. The distinction be- 
tween equipment and supplies should be kept in mind. 
Supplies are those articles which are consumed in 
their use, such as pens, ink, paper, and crayon. The 
term “equipment” includes those articles which are 
not consumed with their immediate use and usually 
last over a long period of time. Equipment includes 
such articles as desks, typewriters, blackboards, and 
playground apparatus. What new or additional 
equipment is needed depends upon what changes or 
additions are to be made to the course of study and 
the other activities of the school. The superintend- 
ent should know if he has desks enough to supply all 
the pupils who will attend the schools. The labora- 
tory, shop, gymnasium, library, playground, and the 
162
-P-A-G-E-173
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
office are some of the places where equipment is used, 
and consideration should be given to each of them in 
determining their requirements. Naturally, the su- 
perintendent’s program covers very definitely all of 
these matters. 
Improvements and repairs 
One other important list of items needs to be con- 
sidered before the close of the current year. This in- 
cludes the matter of improvements and repairs to 
buildings and grounds. During the entire year the 
superintendent should make notes in his plan book of 
any suggestions that occur to him for improvements. 
A few weeks before school closes, the teachers and 
janitors should be asked for their suggestions along 
this line. The superintendent should go over all of 
the property thoroughly and satisfy himself as to the 
needs and desirability of these recommendations. 
Then a list should be formulated of the items he ex- 
pects to recommend to the board. On some Satur- 
day, either just before or after the close of the school 
year, the superintendent in the smaller community 
should request his entire board of education to make 
a tour of inspection, and this should be a thorough 
one. Each room, each building from cellar to garret, 
should be visited. As the places are reached where 
repairs are necessary, the superintendent should ex- 
plain his recommendation to the board, showing 
what is needed and why, and secure the tentative 
163
-P-A-G-E-174
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
agreement of the board upon the propositions. All 
such items as window shades, painting, cloakrooms, 
classrooms, building, sidewalks, toilet-room facilities, 
and alterations should be disposed of on the trip. 
When the board of education has completed its tour 
of inspection, it will be found desirable to hold a short 
meeting and consider the list of improvements and 
repairs which have been tentatively approved while 
the inspection was being made. Out of this meeting 
should come a permanent list of the work to be done 
during the summer vacation. 
The budget 
The superintendent is now ready to begin the ac- 
tual preparation of his budget. A budget has been 
defined by some one as ‘‘a financial statement, cover- 
ing a fiscal year in advance, showing the anticipated 
revenue and appropriations of a body having control 
of the disposition of public funds.” Ina large major- 
ity of small communities there is no attempt to make 
a school budget in any systematic manner. When 
the time comes for the levy to be made, some one 
guesses that it will require about so many dollars for 
each of the dozen items of school expenditure, an- 
other lump sum is thrown in for good measure, and 
the levy is made on this basis. If it happens to be 
enough to go around, well and good; if it falls short, 
there is a crimping of activities toward the close of 
the year or else school warrants are registered and in- 
164
-P-A-G-E-175
  
GETTING READY FOR NEXT YEAR 
terest paid. The more satisfactory way is to prepare 
a real budget on the basis of a careful study of the 
needs, and then to see that the appropriation once 
made is religiously kept in sight as the school year 
moves forward. 
The Federal Bureau of Education and a number of 
the State Governments have adopted a universal sys- 
tem of school accounting which includes the follow- 
ing principal items: 
1. General control. 5. Fixed charges. 
2. Instructional service. 6. Debt service. 
3- Operation of plant. 7. Capital outlay. 
4. Maintenance of plant. 8. Auxiliary and sundry 
activities. 
Each of these main heads is further subdivided into 
appropriate items. These terms can well be used in 
making the budget. 
Dr. Strayer, in his City School Bepusdiionsate rec- 
ommends the following proportion of appropriation 
for the several items in the budget: 
Per cent Per cent 
of total of total 
Teaching and supervision, from 70-4105 75)

Teachers alone 60 to 68 
Janitors’ salaries Se tO ey 
Textbooks and supplies 4 405 236 
Fuel 5.) tos a7 
Repairs 3 to. 5 
From the foregoing discussion it will be seen that 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  MANAGEMENT OF SMALLER SCHOOLS 
the budget can be best prepared by the superintend- 
ent of schools himself. It has become a general prac- 
tice, in those communities which follow a systematic 
budget plan, for the superintendent to do this work 
and have it available for discussion at the board meet- 
ing set aside for the consideration of next year’s finan- 
cial plans. The board of education discusses these 
proposals and determines what items shall enter into 
the financial budget. This can be done during the 
month of June unless the State law requires it to be 
attended to at some other time. When this budget 
has been finally approved by the board of education, 
it becomes the basis for the estimate of taxes for the 
following school year. The method by which the 
taxes are levied is regulated by the State law, and 
consequently varies in different parts of the country. 
The most satisfactory situations are those where the 
board of education is the final authority as to its own 
financial requirements. 
Employing the census enumerator and the janitors 
There remains yet in the preparation for the next 
year’s work the employment of the census enumera- 
tor and the school janitors. The census enumeration 
needs to be made carefully and accurately. Whoever 
is employed to do this piece of work should so under- 
stand. A little care in taking the census will save a 
great deal of difficulty when school opens the follow- 
ing September. School janitors are usually reélected

if their services have been satisfactory and are often 
retained when their services are not what they should 
be. 
Closing the year’s work 
Before the last few weeks of the school year, the su- 
perintendent should send out to his teachers defi- 
nite instructions for closing the current year’s work. 
Among the items which should be given attention in 
this bulletin are the reports which the superintendent 
desires on the year’s work. There is usually a statis- 
tical report which has to be made to the county 
superintendent from the data which come from the 
teachers’ registers. Quite often there are desired 
data as to distribution of attendance, and other items 
not called for on the report required to be sent to the 
statistical office of the State. Each teacher should 
put away all books and supplies used in her room 
in a neat manner. She should file at the office a list 
of all pupils promoted and all pupils retained. The 
reason for the retention of each pupil should be shown 
fully, as quite often it is necessary for a superintend- 
ent to pass on matters of this character after the 
teacher has left town. It is advisable for each 
teacher to leave the year’s work with such a complete 
statement that, if a change is made during the sum- 
mer vacation and a new teacher comes in the fall, all 
necessary information will be available to enable her 
to start the year’s work without delay. Teachers’ 
167

registers and plan books should be turned in at the 
office, and the keys furnished the teacher should be 
tied together and labeled before being handed in. 
Finally, the superintendent should secure the sum- 
mer address of each teacher so that, if circumstances 
should make it necessary to communicate with her, 
she could be located without serious delay. 
In the superintendent’s office all records should be 
brought up for the current year, all grades of pupils 
finally recorded, and everything else done before the 
office is closed for the summer. The janitors should 
see that all rubbish and discarded paper is burned, 
that the window shades are pulled down in order to 
prevent a summer sun from damaging articles in the 
rooms, and that all classroom doors are locked. A 
school year which has been closed with attention to | 
all of these details and many others which cannot be 
mentioned will leave things in good shape, should any 
emergency arise during the summer necessitating the 
change of superintendents, for the prompt and suc- 
cessful opening of school the next fall.

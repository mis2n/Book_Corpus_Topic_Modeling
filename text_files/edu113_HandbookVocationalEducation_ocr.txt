  Tue old general rule was that educated people did not 
perform manual labor. They managed to eat their bread, 
leaving the toil of producing it to the uneducated. This was 
not an insupportable evil to the working bees, so long as the 
class of drones remained very small. But now, especially in 
these free States, nearly all are educated — quite too nearly 
all to have the labor of the uneducated in any wise ade- 
quate to the support of the whole. It follows from this that 
henceforth educated people must labor. Otherwise educa- 
tion itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. 
No country can sustain in idleness more than a small per- 
centage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at 
something productive. From these premises the problem 
springs, ‘How can labor and education be the most satis- 
factorily combined?” 
Free labor argues that as the Author of man makes every 
individual with one head and one pair of hands, it was prob- 
ably intended that heads and hands should codperate as 
friends, and that that particular head should direct and con- 
trol that pair of hands. As each man has one mouth to be 
fed, and one pair of hands to furnish food, it was probably 
intended that that particular pair of hands should feed that 
particular mouth — that each head is the natural guardian, 
director, and protector of the hands and mouth inseparably 
connected with it; and that being so, every head should be 
cultivated and improved by whatever will add to its capacity 
for performing its charge. In one word, free labor insists 
on universal education. — ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

  PREFACE 
Ir has taken the United States a long time 
to see the need of vocational education. The 
industrial revolution has been so gradual and the 
stream of immigration has so largely supplied 
our demand for skilled labor that we have drifted 
into a perilous situation without any sense of the 
danger ahead. Now that we realize our position, 
something like a panic has seized the American 
people.. The cry of the Nation is, “What must 
I do to be saved?” Some are for lightening 
the ship by casting out the wheat into the sea. 
Others propose to abandon the old craft and 
trust their lives to the life-boats. Educators who 
have been studying retardation and elimination 
have. come to the conclusion that the “enrich- 
ment” of the course of study has gone so far 
that now the children are suffering from mental 
indigestion. They are those who would cast the

work was undertaken originally in connection 
with a course of lectures on School Administra- 
tion given by the author in New York Univer- 
sity. It is believed that the discussion will be 
useful to students of education anywhere, as well 
as to the general public. The employer, the em- 
ployee, the taxpayer, the publicist, the legislator, 
are all profoundly interested in the questions 
here presented. 
There is at present no single volume which 
gives a systematic survey of the general field of 
vocational education, embodying both the his- 
torical and the logical aspects of the subject. A 
vast body of material has been accumulated, but 
it lies scattered in magazines and monographs 
printed in many languages. This handbook is 
a digest of some of the most important of this 
literature. In this day of agitation and clamor 
for change, the greatest need is accurate infor- 
mation, a proper perspective, and a judicial con- 
sideration of values. The Nation has poured 
millions into its common schools ungrudgingly. 
Now it asks: “What lack I yet?” In a matter 
of such great importance deliberate action in the 
light of complete knowledge is imperative. For,

INTRODUCTION 
I. Equal Opportunities for All.— One of the 
fundamental principles underlying a public school 
system is that it shall offer equal opportunities for 
all. The American public school boasts of this as 
one of its characteristic merits. An examination of 
the facts shows the claim to be unfounded. The 
opportunities are equal only in the sense that all 
classes may freely partake of the common training 
given in the elementary school. Beyond that there 
is no longer even a pretense of maintaining equality 
of opportunity. For the fortunate few whose am- 
bition and economic condition impel them to prepare 
for a profession, the state has opened high schools 
leading to colleges and professional schools. Col- 
leges are often free to this class of students.

what was learned in the elementary school is soon 
forgotten, and no new form of instruction is provided 
to supplement it. There is no supervised appren- 
ticeship system which insures thorough training in 
a vocation. In this condition we find the majority

able resources are our people, and second, that we are wasting 
people more than we are wasting anything else.... If 
one will look carefully about he will see, in any community, 
so many ways in which labor-power is being wasted... . 
There are, first, the army of the unemployed, or the involun- 
tarily idle; second, the imperfectly employed, or the un- 
trained; third, the improperly employed, or the acquisitively 
rather than productively employed; and fourth, the volun- 
tarily idle, commonly known as the leisure class.” 
II. Training for Citizenship. — The State can- 
not continue to spend vast sums on high schools 
and universities and neglect vocational training 
without repudiating the reasons usually given for 
maintaining schools of any sort as a public charge. 
Self-preservation by training future citizens is the jus- 
tification of the State for spending money on schools. 
We have come to a point where the State must 
enter the field of industrial education, and thus 
give equal opportunity to artisan, farmer, merchant, 
and professional man. Justice to the individual 
and the welfare of the State both demand this 
course.    
There is sound psychology and profound phi- 
losophy in the saying, “ Nothing succeeds like 
success.” The man who is riding on the tide of 
success sees rainbows on every leaden sky. He
-P-A-G-E-14
INTRODUCTION 7 
may drown his sorrow in debauchery, join the 
ranks of criminals, or seek refuge in suicide. 
1. The Habit of Success. — Dr. Luther Halsey 
Gulick has a chapter in one of his books on 
The Habit of Success, from which the following 
is quoted : — 
“The principle of the habit of success is constantly dem- 
onstrated in athletics. In practicing for the high jump, 
the beginner will start with the stick at that height at which 
he can jump it easily, and he will raise it every time that he 
clears the stick, so that he must always jump higher. And 
when by the greatest effort he succeeds in clearing the stick at 
his approximately greatest height, he will put it still an inch 
higher — at a point where he must of necessity fail. For a 
long time he will struggle under conditions where failure is 
almost inevitable. This excess of effort always means the 
use of unnecessary muscles and combination of muscles in the 
endeavor to find some better way to jump. That disturbs 
that precision of movement which is essential to any first-class 
athletic performer. It is known as ‘form.’ The result is 
that through his excess of effort he never learns to jump as 
well as does a boy who most of the time jumps within his 
ability and who thus acquires perfect form, perfect control. 
This is not to say that a good jumper never tests himself ; 
he does. But the bulk of his work is done under conditions 
where he can succeed, where he can carry his body in the most 
perfect form.” !

discontent. We try to make good citizens by giv- 
ing formal lessons in civics. But a knowledge of 
the institutions of the country and of the rights 
and duties of the citizens does not in itself suffice 
to make a citizen. “A man may even be an 
admirable teacher of civic science and a first-class 
villain at the same time.’”’! But skill in some art 
which he delights to practice, and on which he can 
rely for the means of livelihood, results in the forma- 
tion of those physical, moral, and intellectual habits 
which constitute the texture of noble manhood. 
Speaking of the perfection of workmanship in 
the arts and crafts of the thirteenth and four- 
teenth centuries, Dr. James J. Walsh says : — 
“The supremely interesting feature of this popular educa- 
tion was its effect upon the lives, and minds, and happiness 
of the workmen. Men got up to their work in the morning 
not as a routine occupation in which they did the same things 
over and over again, until they could scarcely do them any 
more, and then came home to rest from fatigue in weariness 
of mind and body. ... They came to their work with an 
artist’s spirit, hopeful that they would be able to express in 
the material what they saw so clearly with their mind’s eye. 
It was tiresome working, but the hours were not long, and al- 
ways there was the thought of accomplishment worthy of the

INTRODUCTION Ir 
commercial nations of the world have already entered upon 
extensive schemes of practical education. Germany boasts 
that within ten years there will be no such thing as an un- 
trained workman, from chimney sweep to high-grade artisan, 
in the empire. Of the 20,000,000 workers in the United 
States, it is safe to say that not 25,000 have any opportunity 
to secure proper education of the kind that Germany gives 
for their callings. We have practically no schools to meet 
their needs. It has been truly said that, in most of the states 
of the Union at least, the only way in which a boy or girl 
can secure an industrial training is to be born feeble-minded 
or commit a crime!” 
IV. The Industrial Revolution. — Two factors 
have operated to modify, practically to revolu- 
tionize, the economic status of the wage earner 
within the last sixty years. These factors are (a) 
the substitution of machinery for hand labor, and 
(b) the aggregation of capital and the subsequent 
concentration of manufacturing into enormous |   establishments and centers of production. From 
the colonial days down to within our own time, 
farming was the most important industry in our 
nation, and the farmer’s boy generally expected 
to remain on the farm and was satisfied to do so. 
Many of the manufacturing industries were estab- 
lished on the farm and were thus widely distrib- 
uted. The author recalls, for instance, the fol-
-P-A-G-E-17

was completed in a single afternoon and ended with 
a feast and dance, to which the husbands and 
swains were admitted. 
Now contrast present conditions with the picture 
just presented. Cities have multiplied and in- 
creased in population, so that now thirty-two per 
cent of all the children enrolled in our public day 
schools live in cities of four thousand inhabitants 
or more. At least half the population lives in 
villages or cities. The city has become the manu- 
facturing and distributing center. The farmer 
shoemaker has disappeared, and the farmer’s shoes 
are made in Massachusetts. The handloom and 
the spinning wheel have been sent to the museum. 
The farmer’s cloth is woven in New England, and 
his clothes are made in New York by people who 
come from Russia. His wagon comes from South 
Bend, Indiana; his furniture from Michigan; his 
carpet from Philadelphia ; his lumber from Oregon ; 
his flour from Minneapolis. Instead of hiring a 
dozen neighbors to cut his grass and cradle his 
grain, he drives a self-binder through his field which 
drops the sheaf ready to be stacked and garnered. 
If he be one of those prairie farmers of the West, 
he drives twenty horses attached to a monster

work before they have graduated from the elemen- 
tary school. They have very little knowledge of 
books, and they do not know how to do anything 
with their hands. The boy becomes a messenger, 
office boy, grocery boy, or butcher’s boy; the girl 
goes to some mercantile or manufacturing estab- 
lishment to begin a dreary life as a wage earner 
in an ill-ventilated and ill-lighted shop or store.* 
The wages they receive at first hardly suffice to 
pay the car fare. If they go to a factory, they 
learn to operate a single machine; but they get 
no comprehensive insight into the manufacturing 
process as a whole. As Emerson says: “ Man is 
thus metamorphosed into a thing, into many things. 
The planter, who is Man sent out into the field 
to gather food, is seldom cheered by any idea of 
the true dignity of his ministry. He sees his 
bushel and his cart, and nothing beyond, and sinks 
into the farmer, instead of Man on the farm. 
1 Miss Alice P. Barrows in New York Times, March 2, 1913, reports 
as follows :— 
“Of the 302 children studied, twenty-four were still in school, thirty- 
nine had not gone to work. They had either stayed at home or gone to 
business or trade school. Two hundred and thirty-nine had gone to 
work. They had entered 406 jobs. Of these jobs, ninety-four were 
‘outside’ errands; nineteen were ‘on wagons’; sixteen at newsstands; 
twenty-nine were in department stores; twenty-seven in office work; 
forty-four in miscellaneous inside work, and 177 in manufacturing.”

I. England 
1. The Beginnings. —In England there was no 
national system of public education until 1870, 
when Parliament enacted a law which insured ele- 
mentary education to all the children in the land. 
In 1770 Burke deplored the tendency shown by 
Parliament to exercise control upon the people, 
whereas “it was designed as a control for the 
people.” This remark of Burke’s reflects the atti- 
tude of the rising democracy of England at the 
time. During the following century the demo- 
cratic forces assumed an aggressive attitude and 
finally triumphed in the Act of 1867, which decided 
once for all that the British government, though 
monarchical in form, should in reality be demo- 
cratic. Then followed the usual corollary, that if 
the people are to rule they must be educated; 
hence three years later Parliament established a 
national system of schools.

out of the public treasury for the establishment of 
a central Government School of Design, and in 
1841 several provincial schools of design were organ- 
ized with the aid of government grants. But the 
efforts of the national government in this field were 
desultory and insignificant until 1851. In that 
year an International Exhibition was held in Hyde 
Park. The comparison of products there shown 
proved England to be sadly deficient in manufac- 
tures; and therefore the profits of that exhibition 
were devoted to the purchase of land at South 
Kensington and the opening in 1853 of the “ science 
and art department ” of the now famous South 
Kensington Museum. The department was created 
to control and organize industrial education. In 
the absence of a system of secondary schools, it 
was necessary to make elementary education the 
foundation of industrial training. But at this 
time all the elementary schools were still provided 
through voluntary effort, and so inadequate was 
the provision made for the education of the people, 
that even in 1870, in the city of London itself, 
scarcely more than fifty per cent of the school 
population found accommodations in the schools. 
In 1856 the Education Department was created, 
 
-P-A-G-E-22

the regulations of the Science and Art Department. 
But this Department was only permitted by law 
to aid technical education; consequently it could 
only give assistance to day schools in considera- 
tion of the technical education they provided. 
Special programs were promulgated giving definite 
plans for vocational studies in the upper grades of 
the elementary schools. 
In 1890 an act was passed giving County Coun- 
cils authority to aid industrial education in ele- 
mentary and secondary schools by local taxation. 
“science and The work is always referred to as 
art,” by which is meant the industrial bearing 
of drawing and science. The impetus given in 
this way to industrial drawing, industrial de- 
sign, and industrial physics and chemistry has 
meant much to England in her development of 
manufacturing industries during the last quarter 
of a century. 
(1) Organization.—Since the Education Act of 
1902! a system of industrial training adapted to 
the needs of all the children has been gradually 
developed. In most of the English cities handi-

basis.1. Children in grades lower than the fifth 
have the sort of manual training with which Ameri- 
can teachers are familiar; namely, paper folding, 
cardboard construction, wire work, cord. work, 
modeling, and sewing. 
Most of the well-known secondary schools, like 
Eton and Rugby, have retained their distinctly 
classical character. St. Albans is a notable excep- 
tion, having been “ modernized ”’ by the introduc- 
tion of science, practical mathematics, and indus- - 
trial arts. In 1881 the government stimulated 
local initiative by offering grants for the organiza- 
tion of science schools of secondary rank. In 1889 
authority was given to County Councils to assist 
vocational education of all grades by local taxation ; 
and in 1890 Parliament supplemented the efforts 
of local authorities by offering a government grant. 
As a result of this legislation many high schools 
are now offering strong courses in science, drawing, 
and shopwork. Many schools of a distinctly indus- 
trial type, such as the Central School of Arts and 
Crafts in London, have also been established. 
Finally, there are numerous continuation schools 
open chiefly in the evening. London has a total

for 1911-1912, District Superintendent Shiels, in 
charge of evening schools, after a thorough investi- 
gation, recommends “ legislation that will permit 
. .. the Board of Education to require fees for 
attendance.” Philadelphia charges a fee of fifty 
cents for elementary schools and one ie for 
evening high and trade schools. This fee is re- 
turnable if the pupil attends two thirds of the 
sessions. St. Louis charges one dollar per term 
of twenty weeks for all pupils. Boston follows the 
plan of Philadelphia, but collects no fee from com- 
pulsory pupils. Cleveland collects one dollar for 
high schools, returnable after an attendance of 
75% of sessions, and five dollars for technical 
schools, returnable after an attendance of 85% of 
sessions. Buffalo follows the system of Philadel- 
phia, but requires an attendance of 75% of the 
sessions before the fee is returned. Many cities 
charge a fee for supplies or a deposit to insure 
against damage of equipment. Such is the prac- 
tice in Philadelphia, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Detroit, 
Milwaukee, Newark, Minneapolis, Seattle, and 
Tacoma.

(4) That employers must report to the school 
board at specified times, stating particulars as to 
the hours during which young persons are em- 
ployed. 
(5) That employers must provide time for at- 
tendance of young persons at the continuation 
school, and must count the hours spent in such 
classes in computing the hours of employment of 
such young persons. 
(6) That parents must codperate with the school 
board in carrying out the law. 
The Scotch Education Department is at present 
engaged in organizing vocational schools under the 
terms of this act. Several features of the law are 
especially significant. It will be noticed, in the 
first place, that continuation schools are in charge 
of the regular school board, and not of any special 
body, as is usually the case in Germany and as is 
provided by the laws of Wisconsin. While the 
act does not make attendance compulsory, it au- 
thorizes compulsion through the school boards. 
Both the employer and the parent are required to 
codperate in the enforcement of ‘the law. It does 
not provide for day instruction; but the tendency 
will be to promote this most important phase of

division, in order to be recognized, must extend 
over three or more years. The subjects of in- 
struction are designed to fit the pupil for the intel- 
ligent practice of crafts, industries, or occupations. 
The course includes commercial subjects, art and 
art crafts, engineering of various kinds, naval 
architecture, navigation, building trades, textile 
industries, chemical industries, printing, women’s 
industries, agriculture. 
Division IV.— Consists of “ auxiliary classes,” 
including physical culture, military drill, vocal 
music, woodcarving, fancy needlework, elocution. 
These courses are open to all students not included 
under the compulsory provisions of the law. 
Edinburgh has twenty-five of these evening con- 
tinuation schools, six of which are for girls and 
young women, six for boys and young men, ten 
for both sexes, and three for adults over twenty. 
There are 421 teachers, 122 of whom have regular 
teachers’ certificates. For the remaining teachers 
the Board of Education provides lectures on the 
art of teaching with demonstration lessons. The 
schools are in session for a period of twenty-six 
weeks from September to March. 
In all the schools except those for adults, a fee

The object of all these middle schools is to train 
experts, foremen, superintendents, owners, managers, 
salesmen, etc. 
Below the middle schools are the lower schools, 
designed to train apprentices, artisans, operatives, 
and to extend the technical knowledge and skill of

all male workers under eighteen. In South Ger- 
many there is no city or town, however small, with- 
out one such school, at least for boys. In North 
Germany, Essen is the only larger town in which 
such a school is wanting. In Bavaria, Wurttem- 
berg, Saxony, Baden, and Hesse, attendance at a 
continuation school is compulsory for all youths up 
to the age of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen. 
Dr. Kerschensteiner expresses the opinion that a 
properly organized continuation school ‘‘ must ex- 
tend to the eighteenth year of every boy or girl who 
is not being educated in a higher school.” ! The 
reason he gives for holding such an opinion is based 
on the public good. “It is of no advantage,” he 
says, “‘ to a constitutional State to make its oppor- 
tunities of culture accessible to only a small per- 
centage.” Mr. John M. Shrigley, Principal of the 
Williamson Free School, agrees with Dr. Kerschen- 
steiner, as to the need of keeping the pupil until he 
is eighteen, but for a different reason. He says: 
““Tf a school proposes to graduate journeymen, the 
pupils must be sufficiently matured physically and 
mentally on graduation to do men’s work. They

of Public Instruction, but under the Minister of 
Commerce and Public Works. They are not an 
organic part of the state system of public education. 
They admit pupils only after the age of fourteen. 
The continuation schools are day, evening, or Sun- 
day schools. The course of study is not uniform 
throughout the empire or even throughout a State, 
but is left to the option of the local community. 
The schools are not subject to uniform regulation. 
When a community has established a school of this 
kind and can show that it meets a local need, the 
central government is asked for a subsidy, which is 
rarely denied. Industrial schools of secondary grade 
are all day and evening schools and are located 
chiefly in centers of industry. 
3. The Continuation Schools of Munich. — Munich 
supplies an example of the most successful and com- 
plete system of vocational training to be found 
even in Germany. A study of the organization and 
management of these schools is therefore one of the 
necessary steps to a proper understanding of this 
form of education. The origin of the continuation 
schools in Munich dates back to 1875, when two of 
them were founded, one for apprentices and one for 
journeymen. The former was made compulsory
-P-A-G-E-30

gives twelve hours of instruction weekly. The 
attendance of the several kinds of schools in 1910 
was as follows : — 
Compulsory continuation schools for boys . . . . 9400 
Compulsory continuation schools for girls . . . . 7500 
Voluntary continuation schools for young men. . . 2600 
Voluntary continuation schools for young women . . 3700 
Munich has about one eighth of the population 
of New York City. If, therefore, New York made 
the same provision for the training of her young 
people that Munich has made, we should have in 
our several day and evening vocational schools 
75,200 boys between the ages of fourteen and eight- 
een; 60,000 girls between the ages of thirteen and 
sixteen; 20,800 young men over eighteen; and 
29,600 young women over sixteen; or a total of 
185,600 persons. What New York is actually doing 
at public expense is shown by the following table of 
registers of the several day and evening schools in 
which vocational instruction is given : —

From the above list it is apparent that private 
initiative has supplied a part of the need for special 
education. But putting together all that is now 
done through both public and private agencies, it 
is doubtful whether New York offers more than half 
of the opportunity for vocational education that is 
found in many a European city.

in Munich for every trade that has twenty-five or 
more apprentices. At present fifty-two trades are

(c) Cost of Continuation Schools. — The annual 
expenditure for the maintenance of trade schools 
for boys and men, aside from building expenses, is 
$225,000, or about $19 per pupil; whereas the cost 
of day elementary education is $23 per pupil, and 
of secondary education, $50 per pupil. The ele- 
mentary school is supported by the town; the 
secondary school is supported chiefly by the State ; 
and the continuation school is supported by the 
town and State together. The entire cost of the 
continuation schools for girls and women, amount- 
ing to $100,000 per annum, is borne by the town 
alone. : 
A comparison at this point is interesting. Munich 
pays $19 per pupil to educate men and boys in 
their trades; New York pays $180.45 per pupil to 
train a pupil in its Vocational School for Boys. 
Munich pays $9 per pupil to educate girls in their 
vocations; New York pays $75.65 to train a pupil 
in the Manhattan Trade School for Girls. Munich 
pays $23 per pupil for elementary education; New 
York pays $34.78. Munich pays $50 per year for 
a secondary pupil; New York pays $92.85. A

and organized a public instruction, common to all 
citizens, gratuitous as regards those parts of educa- 
tion indispensable to all men.” But nothing more 
was done at the time. The First Republic was so 
busy fighting for its life that there was no time left 
for organizing schools. 
In 1808 Napoleon founded his Imperial Univer- 
sity, a body charged with all the public education 
of the Empire. In 1815 Napoleon was overthrown, 
but his system of education was continued. Little 
was, however, accomplished except that religious 
organizations were authorized to supply teachers 
for elementary schools. 
With the accession of Louis-Philippe in 1830 the 
real work of education may be said to have begun. 
This monarchy depended upon the support of the 
middle classes, and consequently elementary schools 
were increased so that in eighteen years, from 1832 
to 1850, the registration rose from about two million 
to nearly three and a half million, and illiteracy was 
reduced from forty-seven per cent to thirty-five per 
cent. 
2. Organization of Public Instruction. —In 
France, education is divided into four grades, as 
follows : — 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE 45 
In the larger cities workshops are provided in which 
boys have exercises in wood and metal work. The 
girls have sewing, lace making, millinery, garment 
making, cookery, and sometimes silk culture. In 
other parts of the country constructive work is given 
in the ordinary classroom. It consists of concrete 
geometry in connection with arithmetic, clay work, 
paper folding, cardboard construction, etc. This 
is just about the sort of construction we have been 
familiar with in the schools of America during the past 
decade. In Paris the work in industrial arts is much 
above the average of the rest of the country. There 
are in the capital about two hundred shops for wood- 
work and some sixty for metal work. The the- 
oretical part of this work is taught by regular 
teachers ; but the practice is taught by craftsmen who 
go from school to school. The exercises are formal, 
consisting of prescribed models given in logical order 
for the purpose of teaching sequence of tool processes 
and manual skills. The ideal is that of formal dis- 
cipline, which controls also our own scheme of 
manual training as found in the schools to-day. 
The teaching of the industrial arts as a preparation 
for the vocation of the pupil is still unrealized in 
these schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
       INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE 47 
vocational character. In addition to handwork the 
boys learned drawing, geometry, mechanics, French, 
history, geography, biology, physics, chemistry, 
arithmetic, accounts. The girls had the same 
academic studies, plus domestic economy, sewing, 
cutting, and fitting. 
In 1892 an important departure was taken, when 
these advanced primary schools were detached from 
the department of education and placed under the 
authority of the Minister of Commerce and Industry. 
Since then the schools have been known as “ prac- 
tical schools of commerce and industry.” In taking 
this step France has followed the well-nigh universal 
practice of placing vocational schools in charge of 
separate governing bodies. The most important 
feature of vocational education is its close relation to 
industrial needs and standards. The educational 
authorities in charge of cultural schools are not suffi- 
ciently familiar with trade conditions to make voca- 
tional schools practical; hence it has been found 
necessary to provide separate agencies for the control 
of trade education. :

(5) Summary. — From this brief account we see 
that France has a vast system of elementary educa- 
tion ending at the age of sixteen, which is complete 
in itself and does not lead to any higher grade of 
school. The test of its success, according to French 
ideals, is that it tends to keep children in the pro- 
fessions or occupations of their parents. The object 
of the educational policy is to “ catch those who are 
inclined to pursue ambitions which they have little 
chance of satisfying, and put them on the path which 
leads to contentment. This was most easily achieved 
by spreading the net of technical education over the 
primary school.” + Whatever we may think of the 
wisdom of this procedure as applicable to white 
children in our own country, its application to negro 
education in the South would go far to solve one of 
the most perplexing of our problems.

         INDUSTRIAL VS. MANUAL TRAINING 51 
American people. As practiced heretofore, hand- 
work was employed and justified as a means of 
manumental training,—the development of the 
mind through motor processes. It was supposed 
to give a child the use of his hands, to nourish the 
brain by increasing the circulation in the motor area, 
to beget reverence for manual industry, and culti- 
vate the moral sense by the habit of accuracy and 
attention to details. In short, manual training rests 
upon the theory of formal or general discipline and 
the personal culture ideal of the great educational 
reformers, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Herbart, and 
Froebel. This theory has recently been sharply 
questioned, with the result that the superstructure 
of educational architecture is beginning to totter 
for want of a firm foundation. The ideal of personal 
culture is giving way to the demand for efficiency. 
The difference in point of view is like the ancient 
controversy between the theologies of St. Paul and 
St. James. St. Paul’s position is that we are justi- 
fied by faith and saved by grace; but St. James says: 
“ Shew me thy faith without works, and I will shew 
thee my faith by my works.”’ The manual training 
advocate is now being challenged to prove his faith 
by his works. For thirty years he has been taken at

2. Play utility is the dominant interest at all the 
ages tested; namely, from eight to fourteen. 
_3- Nearly half of a boy’s voluntary construction 
are things used in his play; and one third of such 
playthings are boats. 
4. The doll is the center of practically all of a girl’s 
play construction. 
5. The toy is the boy’s leading product and the 
useful gift that of a girl. 
6. We have no positive evidence that the school 
handwork affects a child’s general motor control 
seriously, or even appreciatively. 
7. No one has taken the trouble to ascertain 
whether the best student excels in handwork, or the 
pupil who is slow at his books. 
8. We do not know the economic value of manual 
work; that is, we do not know whether the adult 
efficiency of men in any walk of life is affected appre- 
ciably by the handwork now found in the schools. 
From all this we are obliged to admit that in the 
matter of manual training we have hitherto walked 
by faith and not by sight. In the face of the demand 
for specific vocational training we shall be unable 
much longer to hold the ground for manual training 
of the old type.

curred in the manual work of girls. Sewing began as 
an exercise in learning certain stitches for patching 
and garment making. The material,employed con- 
sisted of remnants only. At present our girls make 
real garments, first for dolls, later for themselves. 
Thirty thousand dresses were made last year by the 
girls in the New York public schools. Cooking has 
always been more practical than other manual work 
of the schools. The change in this case is from the 
mere laboratory demonstration by the teacher to 
individual equipment and cooking by the girl her- 
self. Numerous activities involved in housekeeping 
and home making have been added to the course, 
so that we no longer speak of the activities of the 
school kitchen as mere cooking, but call it domestic 
science, domestic art, or household arts. Similar 
modifications have been made in oak-tag construc- 
tion, raffia, and cord work. The value of manual 
work in paper has always been, in my judgment, 
doubtful. It involves fine measurements, which 
are difficult for small children; it consumes a great 
deal of time ; it fails to exercise the inventive faculty ; 
and it results in a product that has only play utility 
at best, and little of that, on account of the long and 
painful process of construction. But with all these  
-P-A-G-E-41

evolved out of constructive processes. From this 
point of view manual work is not a subject, but is 
the very core of the curriculum, giving life and value 
to all subjects. It has further significance as an 
application of the principle that learning should be 
by doing, and as an application of what is learned 
to life situations. Speaking of the two famous pil- 
lars in the Piazzetta of Venice, Ruskin says: ‘ You 
must find time for a little practical cutting of capi- 
tals yourself, before you will discern the beauty of 
these. There is nothing like a little work with the 
fingers for teaching the eyes.” ! The late Colonel 
Parker classified all educative activities as attention, 
judgment, and expression. Construction he treated 
as one of the nine modes of expression. 
The same analysis that has been made of the 
psychological need for constructive work applies to 
the study of industry. Industries represent that 
phase of life in which construction finds its principal 
use. The committee hopes that constructive work 
and the study of industry in the elementary school 
will in future be of such a character as to enable the 
pupil to make a wisé-choice of avocation. At its 
meeting in Chicago in 1912, the National Education

in a given community will depend upon the prevailing 
occupations of the place. Some of the concrete 
suggestions of the committee are given below : — 
(x) An example of the study of the textile indus- 
try, second year, Horace Mann School, New York. 
(2) An example of candle making, third year,

of Missouri.

gestions offered by the committee are these :—

study in Manual Training, by C. L. Boone, Manual 
Training Magazine, December, 1908, and February,

out losing academic rank. The classes are general 
industrial or work classes. The product which they 
turn out is such as can be utilized by the school 
supply department. 
There are also classes made up of boys and girls 
fourteen years of age or over, selected from the 
lower grades. These have drawing and construc- 
tion work for periods varying from ten to twenty 
hours a week, plus arithmetic, language, and other 
academic work. The manual exercises consist of 
wood-working, cabinet-making, metal-work, sheet- 
metal work, book-binding, and printing. 
There are classes open to graduates of the ele- 
mentary school similar to those just described. 
Finally, there are classes in high schools where 
pupils take academic studies along with an intensive 
study of some industry, like jewelry. 
(4) A Study of Elimination. — Professor Edward 
L. Thorndike has made a study of pupil elimination 
in twenty-three cities and thirty-four colleges which 
shows some startling results.! From this investiga- 
tion it appears that of 100 pupils who enter an ele- 
mentary school, 4 leave before reaching the fourth 
grade; 9 leave in the fourth grade; 13 leave in the

straight line, allowing one foot of space for each 
child, the line would stretch from the upper end of 
Maine across the continent to the lower end of 
California. If those leaving school at or about the age 
of fourteen — nearly all of them to become bread- 
winners — were taken from the line, only that por- 
tion extending across the state of California would 
remain.’’4 
Up to the age of thirteen, the amount of elimina- 
tion in the United States is about the same as in 
Germany, France, and England; but the United 
States is far more successful than the other coun- 
tries named in retaining children after thirteen for 
a much longer and more extensive schooling. 
There is great variability among cities in the 
amount of elimination. The percentage of children 
entering school who continue to the eighth grade 
ranges from 14.4 in Baltimore to 72 in Worcester. 
New York’s percentage in Thorndike’s table is 33.7; 
Malden’s, 76.5; Springfield’s, 53.4; Newark’s, 25. 
The range of children who remain to graduate from 
the high school is from 2.3 % in Baltimore to 26.4 % 
in Worcester. Thorndike is of the opinion that the

  CHAPTER IV 
THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
I. Differentiated Programs of Study for the Last 
Two Years of the Elementary School. — The wisdom 
of giving all children in the elementary school the 
same training for the entire eight years of the 
course is now being questioned. Equal opportunity 
for all does not necessarily mean the same form of 
education for all. The European practice of pro- 
moting class distinctions by a system of fees and a 
sharp differentiation of curricula at the end of the 
fourth school year, is manifestly not in conformity 
with the expressed principles of American democ- 
racy. But a choice of courses at the end of the 
sixth school year, free to all alike, is not a denial of 
equal educational opportunity. On the contrary, 
it is creating a diversity of opportunity, whereby 
different types and degrees of talent may find fitting 
modes of expression and development, instead of 
being confined to a single form of training. In 
order to bring about the proposed reform it would

The course of study of the intermediate school 
might contain four groups of options, as follows : ! —

to take the commercial course in the high school or 
who intend to go to work in business houses : —

science.

(a) 12% hours to literature, composition, spelling, 
penmanship, mathematics, geography, history, and 
science.

attended by about one-third of the seventh and 
eighth grade pupils in the city. Some of the forms 
of handwork for boys undertaken in the Fitchburg 
school under course (3) are as follows: ! — 
(a) In the line of repairs: repacking faucets in the 
building, scraping and refinishing desks, setting 
glass, care of lawn-mowers, painting window screens, 
relaying decayed basement floors, repairing broken 
furniture, reseating chairs, rearranging rubber stair 
pads. 
(b) In the line of woodwork: constructing work- 
benches, assisting in making kitchen tables, making 
teachers’ desks for the entire building, building par- 
titions and lockers. 
(c) In the painting line: bronzing steam pipes, 
oiling floors, finishing and seating chairs bought in 
unfinished wood, painting kitchen, dining-room, 
wood-working room, and locker rooms, finishing 
work-benches and teachers’ desks, painting and 
papering library. 
(d) Work was begun in grading and the laying of 
concrete and granolithic walks. 
In all the above lines of work the pupils are 
directed not only by the teachers, but by skilled

so he “goes on the hook.” Then he becomes a 
conscious lawbreaker; consorts with evil com- 
panions who are older and sometimes skilled in 
crime; and frequently lands in the Children’s Court 
charged with larceny or other juvenile delinquency. 
Unquestionably these older children should be 
segregated and given work to do that is worth 
while from their own point of view. The inter- 
mediate school with an optional program is the very 
place for a misfit hoy. Handwork is always attrac- 
tive to children who hate books; and the muscular 
exercise required for handwork absorbs energy that 
is now expended in vagrancy. 
2. The Cleveland School. — Fitchburg is not the 
only place that possesses an intermediate school. 
The Elementary Industrial School at Cleveland is 
another example. The requirements for admission 
to this school are that pupils “‘ shall be at least two 
years behind grade, that they should either have 
finished the sixth grade or have failed to finish it 
and would therefore become ‘repeaters.’” The 
academic instruction includes English, arithmetic, 
geography, history, and hygiene, all taught in such 
a way that through narrowing the field and inten- 
sifying instruction the pupils may “ secure insight

from fourteen years of age who were in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades, and who were mani- 
festly of a mechanical turn of mind. . . . The 
weekly program is evenly divided between shop 
and academic work, . ... . . but almost all 
the academic work is based on industrial con- 
ditions or needs.” The curriculum of the school 
covers elementary and advanced woodworking and 
elementary and advanced machine and electrical 
work.!

be enumerated as follows : —

boys, 15,948 girls, —a total of 43,126 students. 
He reports also 287 manual, industrial, and tech- 
nical schools, in which 17,907 pupils receive instruc- 
tion in elementary academic studies, 61,296 pupils 
receive instruction in ordinary high school studies, 
and 108,209 pupils receive manual and industrial 
training. The typical manual training high school 
_ is a school of secondary grade in which a greater or 
less amount of handwork is included in the curric- 
ulum and in which the greater part of the academic 
instruction is similar to that found in other high 
schools. Neither the manual nor the academic in- 
struction is especially planned to be of direct voca- 
tional service. The technical high school is a school 
of secondary grade having the distinct purpose of 
preparing its pupils for industrial leadership. In 
such schools the instruction deals not only with the 
important manual operations, but also with those 
principles of science and mathematics, and their 
direct applications to industrial work, which will 
prepare the student for mastering the fundamental 
processes and problems of the industries. In second-

from the literary commercial high schools in that it has some- 
what more shopwork and perhaps more mechanical drawing 
and a literary course less extensive than the first, and perhaps 
a less specialized literary course than the second, I confess I 
see no use for it in the future. It has no distinctive aim and 
character. In such a school there is so great a lack of correla- 
tion between the academic studies and the shopwork that 
boys and girls recite together in their academic work and 
separately only in their strictly technical work. Such a school 
is simply a literary high school with a somewhat narrow aca- 
demic course and with a little more shopwork. The problem 
before us is to transform all such manual-training high schools 
into technical high schools. The manual training of a techni- 
cal high school is likely to be fully as good, and I should say, 
better, than the manual training in a so-called manual-train- 
ing high school of the type here described. Manual training 
does not lose its general educational value, but distinctly 
gains by being given a more definite industrial bent than it 
has had in the past.” ! 
In New York City thirty-seven per cent of the 
population are engaged in industrial and mechanical 
work; thirty-seven per cent in business; nineteen 
per cent in domestic service; and five per cent in 
the learned professions. We have many schools to 
prepare for the professions, but we have, aside from 
engineering schools of college grade, only a few

ment of compulsory laws are the pressing need of 
the hour. 
1. Adjustment of the High School to the Needs of 
the Community. — What can be done in the direc- 
tion of making the high school useful to the com- 
munity which supports it may be shown by citing a 
concrete example. Colebrook Academy ? is located 
in the Connecticut Valley in the northern part of 
New Hampshire. The population of the town is 
1200, and the surrounding country is a fine agricul- 
tural district. This Academy was once a private 
school. While retaining its original name, it is 
really a public high school. In an effort to relate 
the school program as closely as possible to the life 
and industries of the community, four distinct lines 
of work are offered; namely : — 
(a) The ordinary literary course leading to the 
college. 
(6) A course in agriculture. 
(c) A course in home making. 
(d) A commercial course. 
The faculty consists of a superintendent, who 
supervises the district and does no teaching; the

CHAPTER V 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS 
I. The Shop vs. the Trade School. — Whether 
the trade school or the shop is the best place to 
learn a trade is an open question. We have the 
word of Dr. Kerschensteiner that ‘a shop or fac- 
tory cannot produce a good mechanic. Nearly all 
of them lack sufficient variety in scope or range and 
quality of work to enable them to do so. Further- 
more, many of them are not prepared to impart to 
their apprentices what they know themselves.” A 
similar opinion is expressed by Mr. Alexander, of the 
General Electric Company, West Lynn, Massachu- 
setts. Speaking of the apprenticeship system in con- 
nection with so-called ‘‘corporation schools,” he says : 
“We should welcome the development of this phase 
of industrial education, but with a jealous eye 
should watch its progress, and courageously voice 
our protest, if it tends to gravitate toward narrow

shop and competing with the average mechanic; 
while they may be taught considerable ‘ book- 
learning,’ their practical instruction must of neces- 
sity be limited. There is nothing that will take 
the place of practical experience.” + That there is 
truth in this statement is obvious when you apply 
it to the teaching profession. The normal school 
and the training school are very useful in their 
way, but they cannot produce the finished teacher. 
They have their model and observation schools, 
where the candidate tries his hand at teaching. 
But conditions under which he works are artificial 
and not at all like those of a real school. The very 
best graduates of a training school are not able in 
the beginning to compete on equal terms with the 
experienced members of their profession. They 
begin with the lowest salary and require much 
assistance from the principal. Not until they have 
had five or six years of experience can they hope to 
become artists. 
II. The Continuation School. — Since then the 
corporation or shop is not equipped for teaching 
and has more interest in the welfare of the business

supplementary to such employment. In this coun- 
try we find three types of this institution : — 
1. Schools for profit, examples of which are cor- 
respondence schools, commercial schools, and some 
trade schools. 
2. Endowed schools, examples of which are 
Cooper Union, the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute, Pratt 
Institute, the Ranken School of Mechanical Trades 
in St. Louis, and the Williamson School in Penn- 
sylvania. f 
3. Public schools. 
III. The Part-time System in Cincinnati. — 
1. The Engineering College1—In 1906 Professor 
Herman Schneider, Dean of the College of Engineer- 
ing, University of Cincinnati, introduced his well- 
knownplanof codperative education. The University 
belongs to the city and is entirely supported by taxa- 
tion. Thecourse of study isso devised that the student 
works alternate weeks in the college and at the manu- 
facturing shops of the city. The classes are divided 
into two sections, so that when one section is at the 
shop, the other is at the university. The length 
of the course is six years. During the summer

pupil requires it, his schooling may be limited to 
half a day per week. In the first school year the 
boy gives three or four hours a day to wood work. 
In the second year he gives the same time to mental 
work. At the beginning of the third year he selects 
his vocation and enters a shop on the wages of a third- 
year apprentice. The school is open at night for 
adult workers. In 1911 the evening classes enrolled 
2400 pupils. 
3. The Continuation School for Apprentices. — 
The school authorities invited the apprentices in the 
shops to continue their education in the evening 
classes of the high schools. But it was soon dis- 
covered that the training of the apprentice is dis- 
tinctly a daytime proposition. A boy who has con- 
centrated his attention upon a machine or process 
for ten hours during the day has little energy left 
for serious work at night. Hence his education 
must be given, not in addition to his work, but in 
lieu of a part of his work. The Board of Educa- 
tion therefore opened a Continuation School for 
apprentices in 1909. It runs forty-eight weeks a 
year, eight hours a day, four and a half days a week. 
The teachers spend two half days a week studying 
the conditions under which their pupils work, con-
-P-A-G-E-60
  CONTINUATION SCHOOLS gI 
“The manner in which the attitude of the apprentice has 
been influenced and his intelligence increased, so that there 
has been no loss charged up to the shorter week, is most in- 
teresting and is the subject of comment in labor circles as well 
as educational and commercial organizations. 
“The first thing an apprentice is taught is the difference be- 
tween knowledge and skill. The average school lad has been 
led along the paths of knowledge until he has begun to be- 
lieve that knowledge is money. He must be taught that few, 
if any, persons are able to derive an income from the sale of 
their knowledge and that knowledge is only saleable when it 
has been worked into skill. Knowledge is knowing how to 
doa thing. Skill is ability to doit with such a quality and in 
such a quantity that it is marketable. The purpose of manu- 
facture is not to make things, but to make things that will 
sell and to make them for considerably less than they will 
sell for. The apprentice is usually offended at this commer- 
cialism, and it takes him some time to enter into the spirit 
of modern production. He wishes to learn how to do a mul- 
titude of things, but he scorns the drudgery of repeating any 
one thing until he has mastered it. The most vital part of 
apprenticeship is lost to the boy if he finishes his time with 
barrels of knowledge but without the skill to produce a day’s 
work,” ! 
As a result of the success of the school, the Ohio 
Legislature passed a law in 1910 authorizing boards 
of education to establish continuation schools, and 
1J. Howard Renshaw, Principal of the Continuation School, Cin- 
cinnati, Bulletin No. 15, National Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education, 1911, p. 82.

CONTINUATION SCHOOLS 93 
twenty-two from the eighth grade. It appears from 
the previous education of these boys that many of 
them were “ retarded ” in the regular school. They 
evidently had no taste for the kind of instruction 
that is given by the traditional public school. For 
this reason the Massachusetts law requires that all- 
day vocational schools shall be ‘‘ separate,” shall be 
free from the domination of cultural ideals, and gov- 
erned definitely by the vocational interests of the 
pupils. The Newton School emphasizes the idea 
of separateness by calling itself an Independent 
Industrial School. It is independent of the regular 
elementary school and all its ways and works. 
But in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, 
this feature of the Massachusetts law is an error. 
There is no valid reason why a child who dislikes 
books should be compelled to defer his vocational 
training until he is fourteen. Nor is there any good 
reason why the public school should refuse to provide 
vocational training for those of its pupils who desire 
it and at the same time keep open the way to the 
high school for those who are headed that way. 
Reform schools, organized on a vocational plan, often 
receive boys only ten years of age, and succeed 
where the public school has failed. The Newton

the second type of schools authorized by the Massa- 
chusetts law. The pupils give half the time to work 
for wages in the industrial shops of the city, and half 
to school work. The classroom instruction articu- 
lates with the grammar school below and the college 
or technical school above. The regular high school 
building is used for this part of the course. The 
first year the boy devotes his entire time to school. 
The next three years equal groups of boys alternate 
between shop and school, so that half the pupils are 
always at work in the shop and half in school. 
Boys are paid for work done in the shops at the rate 
of ten cents an hour for the first year, eleven cents for 
the second year, and twelve and a half cents for the 
third year. This makes a total income of $552.75 
for three years. 
3. The Springfield Evening School for Trades illus- 
trates the third type of schools contemplated by the 
Massachusetts law. It is the outcome of the Me- 
chanic Arts High School, established in 1898, under 
the superintendency of Thomas M. Balliet, which 
was the first trade school in the United States sup- 
ported at public expense.!_ The general aim of the

CHAPTER VI 
THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL 
TEACHERS + 
I. The Prussian Plan.— We have now been 
agitating the question of vocational education for 
a number of years and have here and there organized 
schools of the vocational type; but we have scarcely 
begun to think of the most important desideratum 
in connection with this new movement; namely, 
the training of vocational teachers. Educational 
reform which overlooks the teacher is but a dream. 
Before we can successfully introduce new subjects 
into the curriculum we must have qualified persons 
to teach them. What is meant by these statements 
will become clear after a brief consideration of the 
training of teachers for vocational schools in Ger- 
many. In 1885 the salaries of such teachers in 
Prussia were smaller than those of the State schools 
and were paid by the local authorities. The teachers 
occupied a lower social rank than regular teachers,

2. Industrial Arts. — During the last few years 
courses of study have been arranged for the training 
of teachers in the industrial arts. For instance, 
Architect Riemerschmidt, of Munich, gives a course 
in furniture design and interior architecture. The 
Trade School of Magdeburg has a course in flat orna- 
mentation. Professor Behrens, of Diisseldorf, has 
a course in lettering. Mural painting and decora- 
tion are taught by Professor Mahrbutter at Char- 
lottenburg. Teachers are assisted by grants from 
the State or municipality to journey to these several 
places for the purpose of study. Teachers of the 
textile branches enjoy similar advantages. 
3. Continuation Schools. — At first these schools 
were taught by elementary school teachers, who 
seldom possessed the necessary skill. Consequently 
these teachers at present all receive special training 
in art, commercial subjects, language, and arith- 
metic. In 1909 the sum of $47,600 was expended 
in training continuation teachers. The number 
of such instructors is about 12,000, of whom some 
550 are employed in the daytime, and the remainder 
at night. Those who have investigated the subject 
tell us that much remains to be done in the proper 
training of this class of teachers.

  THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS 103 
III. The Wurttemberg Plan.— The vocational 
schools of this Kingdom are probably the most effi- 
cient in theworld. They fall into four general groups : 
(t) the machine trades; (2) the building trades; 
(3) the industrial arts; (4) the commercial group. 
In the smaller places a teacher must be skilled in the 
leading industry of the place, and must know some- 
thing of other branches of trade. Only in the largest 
schools is it possible to employ teachers who can 
qualify in only one of the four groups of industries. 
Teachers of the building trades are at present sent 
to Karlsruhe in Baden to be trained. This school 
has the reputation of being the best of its kind in 
Germany. Here the student takes a course of three 
and a half years. The applicants are selected from 
the experienced and efficient elementary and second- 
ary teachers, who already possess thorough peda- 
gogical training. They have been passed through 
at least six years of a secondary school and so are 
well grounded in cultural studies. Wurttemberg 
grants them an allowance of $240 per year while 
they are at Karlsruhe. After completing the course 
they must spend from six months to a year in actual 
shop practice in the industries. 
Teachers of the commercial continuation schools

seventh secondary school year. The instruction 
covers these twelve subjects: (1) German compo- 
sition; (2) German business correspondence; (3) 
commercial mathematics; (4) bookkeeping; (5) for- 
eign languages; (6) stenography; (7) typewriting ; 
(8) general economic geography ; (9) political econ- 
omy and science of finance; (10) legal principles; 
(x1) history of commerce; (12) lectures on teaching 
and theory of method. 
For admission to the industrial division of the 
Karlsruhe school the applicant must be (z) a citizen 
of Baden ; (2) must have passed through the seventh 
year of a secondary school or possess a license to 
teach in an elementary school; (3) must have 
attended the first three classes of the Building Trades 
School in Karlsruhe. The examination is divided 
into a preliminary and principal test. The prelimi- 
nary includes (1) teaching ability ; (2) German com- 
position ; (3) mathematics ; (4) descriptive geometry ; 
(5) physics; (6) chemistry; (7) elements of me- 
chanics ; (8) free-hand drawing and painting. 
The principal examination covers the following :— 
For the building trades: (1) Theory and design 
of building construction in stone, wood, and iron; 
(2) elements of the theory of mechanics. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS 107 
In the same State the vocational teachers for girls’ 
schools must not only be trained in special schools, 
but must serve half a year in the industry which they 
are to teach. In Munich the teachers are drawn 
entirely from the industries and are trained in 
pedagogy. They are successful artificers who take 
up teaching. In Wurttemberg experienced teachers 
of cultural subjects are trained in the technique of a 
vocation. But before they are permitted to teach 
in a vocational school they must spend from six 
months to a year in the industry. In Baden candi- 
dates for vocational schools are experienced teachers 
or persons who possess an academic culture repre- 
sented approximately by a graduate of an American 
high school. These candidates may not teach voca- 
tional subjects until they have completed the train- 
ing school course and served a year or two years in 
the industry. 
VI. Plans in the United States. — Contrast these 
methods with our own, as illustrated by the following 
example : — 
A farmer friend of mine recently employed a young 
graduate of the Cornell School of Agriculture as a 
farm hand. This boy was city-bred and had never 
worked on a farm; but he has a degree in agriculture  
-P-A-G-E-70
THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS  I09 
students, Hampton Institute, Virginia, is the only 
one that prepares teachers of agriculture. As there 
is only a nominal government control of these schools 
and colleges, there is no uniformity in the courses of 
study and method of training teachers. That such 
training is often theoretical in character and not 
very thorough, as compared with German standards, 
may be inferred from one or two quotations from the 
U. S. Commissioner’s Report : — 
“University of Idaho. — The department of agricultural 
education offers 5 courses: Development of agricultural 
education (2 hours); methods of teaching agriculture (2 
hours); rural sociology (3 hours); agricultural economics 
(3 hours); and methods in agricultural extension (3 hours). 
Agricultural students may elect 10 hours’ work in general 
education.” 
“ Massachusetts Agricultural College. — The department of 
agricultural education established by provision of the State 
legislature in 1907, offers 5 courses: Meaning of education 
(3 hours); history and theory of vocational education (3 
hours); methods in agricultural education (3 hours) ; teach- 
ers’ agriculture, a selection and review of the agricultural 
sciences adapted to school work (3 hours); seminar in edu- 
cation with special reference to agriculture (3 hours). Seniors 
preparing for teaching have practical work with children in 
the college school gardens. Summer school courses are 
given in elementary agriculture, and in agricultural pedagogy. 
Correspondence courses are offered in agriculture, the prin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS 111 
brought up on the farm, trained in agricultural schools, and 
experienced as teachers. With state aid sufficient to encour- 
age the payment of adequate salaries for efficient workers, 
these schools would reach 300,000 young people annually, 
and come in close personal contact with not less than 50,000 
farmers, or one fourth the entire number of the state. 
“Fully one half of the pupils in these schools are girls, 
and their needs should be supplied by providing instruction 
in domestic science as effective as that asked for agriculture.” 
2. The Cincinnati Plan. — Cincinnati has found 
it desirable to imitate the Munich plan. Here the 
chief difficulty has been, says Frank B. Dyer, 
formerly Superintendent of Schools, not in securing 
the interest of employers, or the approval of labor 
organizations, or the willingness of the boys, or the 
funds from the Board of Education, but in securing 
properly qualified teachers. The teacher of a part- 
time school must know the technique of trade to 
command the respect of employers and foremen. 
He must at the same time have skill in the technique 
of teaching sufficient to interest the pupil. And, 
lastly, he must meet the demands of the school 
board as to character and scholarship. This is a 
rare combination of skills. After corresponding 
with technical schools all over the country and find- 
ing no suitable person, Superintendent Dyer finally

This school was established in 1903. Its president 
is Mr. L. D. Harvey. No detail as to course of 
study or number of students is furnished; but so 
far as one is able to infer from the facts submitted, 
the institution resembles the Columbia School of 
Practical Arts, though it is much narrower in scope, 
being limited in purpose to the preparation of 
teachers of household arts. Pratt Institute in New 
York, State Normal College at Albany, State Normal 
School at Buffalo, Carnegie Institute at Pittsburg, 
Simmons College at Boston, and scores of other 
colleges, universities, and normal schools are to-day 
giving some sort of training to teachers for industrial 
schools and courses. 
4. A Study of American Conditions. — The Na- 
tional Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education published recently, through a special 
committee, a preliminary survey of the problem of 
training teachers of industries.* 
(1) Certification. —The Committee finds that 
“the State should be the sole certifying authority.” 
The study is limited to the consideration of state- 
aided vocational schools. The financial authority

  THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS 115 
for vocations differing widely from that of shop 
instructor in an industrial school. The graduates 
usually have no trade experience, and they are not 
trained to teach. Furthermore, they command 
better pay than that received by a shop teacher. 
Normal schools represent the final stage of a con- 
tinuous process of education beginning in childhood. 
They do not, therefore, have trade-trained students, 
nor can they themselves furnish the trade training. 
The conclusion is that the chief source of supply 
must be the trades. 
For the supply of teachers of related subjects 
four sources are suggested: (a) the industry; 
(6) engineering schools of college grade; (c) the 
intermediate technical school; (d) the normal 
school. The trade furnishes men with trade ex- 
perience who lack technical knowledge. The en- 
gineering school supplies the technical knowledge, 
but cannot give practical contact with trade. 
The intermediate technical school, such as Pratt 
Institute or the Department of Applied Industries 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology, promises to be 
the most satisfactory source of supply. Preparatory 
schools for teachers, like normal schools and educa- 
tional departments of colleges, give the student
-P-A-G-E-74
  THE TRAINING OF VOCATIONAL TEACHERS 117 
additional expense a normal department could be 
organized, and then New York would have a first- 
class training school for vocational teachers. 
(c) Special Day Course in an Intermediate Tech- 
nical School. — The objection to this plan is the 
economic difficulty involved in the loss of wages. 
The objection is met by the scholarship plan. 
(d) Special Evening Course in Some Technical 
School or College. — One objection to an evening 
school course is the limited number of hours avail- 
able for schooling. Another is that the student is 
not in good condition after a hard day’s labor to 
engage in severe mental effort. The advantages are 
(a) that the student suffers no loss of wages; (0) the 
sacrifice involved is in itself an effective method of 
selecting promising material; (c) practice teaching 
can be had in the evening school; (d) and the plan 
opens an abundant source of supply for trade- 
trained teachers. 
5. Conclusion. — It will be seen from this brief 
abstract of the committee’s proposals, that prac- 
tically every one of its schemes has been anticipated 
by European experience. The committee believes 
that the trades must be the chief source of supply 
for shop teachers. Munich came to the same con-

normal school, to teach both arts at once or in the 
same institution. If the candidate is already expert 
in one art, the State has to pay for the experience in 
the form of a subsidy. If the pupil has no skill in 
either art, added expense is entailed by prolonging 
the period of training. In either case the State 
must pay for skill in two arts.

VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 12 
  In general terms vocational guidance includes 
the study of the child; the preparation of the child 
for a specific calling; the study of industries; and 
the placing of the child into a position with a future, 
which he can fill with profit to himself and his em- 
ployer. The chief end of the business is not, as 
many suppose, finding a job. Securing work is 
usually carried on in connection with vocational 
guidance, but it is only a small part of the field 
covered. The movement has already made large 
progress in New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleve- 
land, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, St. Louis, and other 
cities. 
A study in detail of the work in New York and 
Boston will show us what vocational guidance has 
come to mean. 
II. Vocational Guidance in New York City. — 
The following facts are taken chiefly from the 
Tenth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Labor,' 
which is wholly devoted to industrial education. 
In New York the father of vocational guidance 
is Mr. Eli W. Weaver,? a teacher in the Boys’ High 
School of Brooklyn. With the enthusiasm of Pes-

by Mr. Weaver in Boys’ High School. The object 
of the aid committee at this time was stated as 
follows : — 
(a) To gather information as to the qualifications 
necessary for entering the skilled trades and pro- 
fessions. 
(b) To secure information as to the opportunities 
the city offers to young people who wish to prepare 
for such trades and professions, and as to the time 
required, and expense involved. 
(c) To ascertain what restrictions are placed by 
labor unions and professional bodies upon candi- 
dates who desire to enter trades and professions. 
(d) To ascertain the average remuneration and 
relative permanency of trades, commercial pursuits, 
and professions. 
Here is a specimen of the kind of information 
that was thus made available to young people seek- 
ing employment : — 
(x) “The average annual earnings of women over sixteen 
years of age in the shirt factories of New York is $327; the 
average earnings of over three hundred stenographers em- 
ployed in the several departments of the city governments of 
which the pay rolls were examined was $954. These women 
secured their appointments because of their special training. 
Their income from their work is over $600 a year more than

and contributors, together with school authorities 
under the direction of the City Superintendent. 
(1) Functions. — The functions of this bureau as 
formulated by the committee are as follows : — 
(a) To offer advice and direction to young people 
of exceptional abilities who cannot receive the neces- 
sary assistance from the vocational teachers of their 
respective schools. ° 
(0) To serve as a means of communication be- 
tween employers and the employment agencies or 
vocation teachers of the several schools and colleges 
from which students go out to work. 
(c) To collect information in regard to the oppor- 
tunities for workers of ordinary ability and others 
of exceptional training; information concerning the 
personal and educational qualifications required for 
admission into different lines of work, and concern- 
ing the tests of efficiency which are set for pro- 
motion into the different grades of the same lines of 
work; and information regarding legal enactments 
and labor-union restrictions, this information to be 
gathered from : —

3. Statistical publications and government reports,

2. Through part-time employment, 
3. Through vacation employment. 
III. Vocational Guidance in Boston. — In Bos- 
ton a number of organizations have assumed the 
functions of vocational guidance. At the head of 
these is the Vocation Bureau. Other bodies work- 
ing in harmony with the Bureau are the committee 
on vocational direction of the School Board, the 
Home and School Association, the Girls’ Trade Edu- 
cation League, and the Women’s Municipal League. 
The School Board’s committee was formed for the 
express purpose of beginning the work of guidance 
within the schools before the pupils leave the ele- 
mentary grades. The three independent organiza- 
tions appoint delegates to sit with the executive 
board of the Vocation Bureau. This arrangement 
assures the closest possible codperation of all con- 
cerned and avoids duplication and waste of effort. 
The Vocation Bureau was organized in 1909 by 
public-spirited men and women in the fields of 
labor, education, commerce, manufacture, and social 
work. Its work is carried on by a director and an 
executive board of thirteen members. There is no 
charge of any kind for its services. The Bureau is 
not primarily an employment office, nor does it

basis for vocational counsel. Here is a brief ab- 
stract of a study of 
The Machinist 
“A machinist is a constructor of machines and engines, 
or one versed in the principles of machines; in the general 
sense, one who invents or constructs mechanical devices of 
any kind. The two grand divisions of the occupation are 
general machine work and tool making. The pattern maker 
is a woodworker. The four divisions of people receiving 
wages are the apprentice boy, the journeyman, the foreman, 
and the superintendent. The chief danger of the occupation 
is from dust in cutting and grinding metals, especially in brass 
working. There is an ever-widening field for the expert ma- 
chinist, and the future of the industry will be good in all lines. 
“Pay in the beginning ranges from $3 to $8 a week, accord- 
ing to age, conditions of apprenticeship, or shop entered. 
Boys do errands, act as messengers to machinists, do drilling, 
milling, lathe work, planing, shaping, and run light machines. 
A young man, after a period of learning such processes, earns 
from $12 to $15 a week. A journeyman earns $2.50 or $2.75 
aday. A foreman earns from $21 to $25 a week. The salary 
of the superintendent ranges from several hundred to many 
thousand dollars a year. 
“In this occupation a boy is rarely taken under fifteen 
years of age. He should have a grammar-school education. 
There are found many graduates of high and technical schools. 
These generally become foremen or superintendents. A boy 
should have natural mechanical skill and should be strong 
and in good health.”

changes of vocation. Parents come regularly to 
consult about the welfare of their children. Em- 
ployers seek the advice of the bureau on various 
matters. 
IV. Summary. — From this sketch of the work 
of vocational guidance in New York and Boston, it 
is evident that the employment bureau is an insig- 
nificant feature of a very large enterprise. Lack 
of self-knowledge is the cause of many tragedies. 
_—‘ Know thyself,” is the first exhortation of the Voca- 
tion Bureau to youth. But it does not stop with 
advice. It supplies the facilities and material for 
self-study. Secondly, the Bureau makes a survey 
of the field of human industry and offers to the 
youth accurate information concerning the condi- 
tions, qualifications, dangers, rewards, and pros- 
pects of the various kinds of employment. Having 
set youth to the study of self and the study of in- 
dustry with a view to a wise choice of an occupa- 
tion, the Bureau finally exerts_its inspirational 
offices to induce the young to make thorough prepa- 
ration for the chosen vocation; and offers such 
assistance in this preparation as may be desired or 
required. An employment bureau in itself is of 
small value to an immature child. There is no

APPRENTICESHIP AND COMPULSORY 
EDUCATION 
I. European Experience.— In the days of old 
all arts and crafts were learned from masters by a 
system of apprenticeship. (The vocational school is 
a modern substitute or supplement of apprentice- 
ship.) Therefore no account of vocational education ~ 
is complete which fails to take note of the relation 
of the apprentice to the industry, the school, and 
the State. 
1. Switzerland.1— There is in this country a 
State apprenticeship system supervised by a central 
committee of the Swiss Union of Arts and Trades 
in codperation with the National Department of 
Industries and the Cantonal and Communal labor 
organizations. The apprentice enters into a formal 
contract with his employer which defines the rights 
and duties of both parties. It specifies the length 
of term, the hours of labor, and the time when the

tives; for on this distinction depends not only the 
individual development and well-being of the 
worker, but welfare of the State as well, since the 
youth of to-day is the citizen of to-morrow. 
(t) The Imperial Industrial Law. — Apprentice- 
ship in Germany is minutely regulated by a national 
law. Only citizens may employ apprentices. For 
handwork, the employer must be at least twenty- 
four years of age and have passed the examination 
of a master workman. He has authority to teach 
not only his own trade, but also a related industry. 
Children may leave school at the age of fourteen 
and go to work. They have the option of entering 
upon skilled or unskilled work. The temptation is 
to choose the latter on account of the immediate 
prospect of wages. Consequently, many children, 
whose parents are oppressed by poverty or handi- 
capped by lack of foresight, become ungelehrte Ar- 
beiter, receiving wages that range from $1.92 to 
$2.40 per week the first year, and from $3.60 to 
$4.80 the fourth year. 
Some of the more fortunate parents keep their 
children in a secondary school until the age of six- 
teen. At this age the boy receives a one-year mili- 
tary service certificate, and he is much more desir-

APPRENTICESHIP 137 
“ master- (f) Time and opportunity to make a 
piece”; and 
(g) Specifications as to who shall pay for the ma- 
terial of the masterpiece and who shall finally own it. 
The master must teach the whole trade, or at 
least all kinds of work occurring in his business. 
His instruction is all practical, and need not cover 
the theoretical phase. He must himself train the 
apprentice or assign a properly qualified assistant 
to do the work. He is further obliged to look after 
the conduct and morals of the apprentice. 
For a violation of the contract the employer is 
liable to a fine of not more than 150 marks or to 
imprisonment for not more than four weeks. 
(a) Mutual Services. — The services required of 
the apprentice include: obedience, truth, industry, 
and probity; the performance of mechanical duties 
other than those of his trade; the proper care of 
tools intrusted to him; attendance at an improve- 
ment school. He may be discharged for stealing ; 
deception ; disobedience; carelessness about fire ; the 
commitment of grave offenses against the master or 
members of his family; harming goods of the em- 
ployer or a fellow workman; immoral conduct in 
the master’s family; neglect of duties in the shop;

origin in the medieval handicraft work. The train- 
ing of the people in those days was in the hands of 
the gilds, of which, at the end of the fifteenth cen- 
tury, there were thirty thousand in England alone. 
There were gilds for most of the breadwinning arts 
in which men engaged — craft gilds, art gilds, mer- 
chant gilds, trade gilds.1_ Boys were apprenticed to 
men following an occupation such as the youth or 
his parents preferred, and then began the training. 
The period of tutelage was fixed in most cases at 
seven years. The apprentice usually lived in the 
house of his master, who provided him with board 
and clothes and taught him the art and mysteries of 
his trade. The master and the pupil were in a sense 
on a plane of equality, inasmuch as both came from 
the same social class, and the pupil looked forward 
to the time when he himself would be a master. At 
the conclusion of the term of service the young 
man became a journeyman workman. He usually 
wandered away from his native town, sometimes 
going over seas to learn the foreign secrets of his 
craft. After three years of such experience, he 
presented evidence of his accomplishments. “ If

Museum at Amsterdam, entitled Syndics of the Cloth Merchants’ Gild. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
APPRENTICESHIP 141 
his medieval predecessor, and like him he did odd 
jobs by which he learned nothing and by which his 
apprenticeship was unduly prolonged. 
The industrial revolution discussed above and the 
expanding ideas of personal liberty caused the in- 
denture gradually to grow into disfavor, and by 
1860 it had so far declined that it was the exception 
rather than the rule. The effect of the discontin- 
uance of a legal contract is illustrated by an incident 
within the personal knowledge of the author : — 
(1) A Concrete Case. — A certain boy named Joe 
was apprenticed in the year 1870 to a manufacturer 
to learn the trade of carriage painting. There was 
only a verbal contract, by the terms of which Joe 
was bound for two and a half years to do such work 
in the shop as the employer might direct. He was 
required in addition to perform household drudgery 
in the employer’s family, such as running errands, 
setting the table, washing dishes, and cleaning 
house. The employer on his part agreed to teach 
the boy the trade of painting and trimming car- 
riages. There were at that time only four trades 
involved in building a carriage; namely, those of 
the wheelwright, the blacksmith, the painter, and 
the trimmer. The boy was therefore to be taught

2. The Entrepreneur. — The next stage of the 
revolution brings us to the modern era of great in- 
dustrial enterprises and extreme specialization in 
production, caused chiefly by the substitution of 
the machine for hand labor. The “ master” of 
medieval and early United States craftsmanship 
now becomes the “ captain of industry,” or what the 
French call the entrepreneur. He no longer trains 
the apprentice himself, but delegates this duty to 
subordinates. He no longer knows the apprentice, 
he does not work with him. He cares little for his 
personal welfare. The industry is so organized that 
it is unprofitable to the business to teach the boy 
the whole trade. It pays better to make him expert 
in some one process and keep him at that. The 
manager can get journeymen trained elsewhere, 
especially in Europe, so he is not interested in the 
production of skilled workmen. 
3. The Trade-union and Apprenticeship.—The ap- 
prenticeship system has been revived, however, in a 
newform. The Bureauof Statistics of Laborin Massa- 
chusetts ascertained in 1906 that out of fifty-eight 
employers, thirty-one had a system of apprentice- 
ship. Of one hundred four officers of trade-unions, 
fifty-five represent trades where apprenticeships
-P-A-G-E-90
APPRENTICESHIP I45 
that is, about 70 of the 120 affiliated in 1904 with the 
American Federation of Labor, with a membership 
of 900,000, together with some half dozen un- 
affiliated national unions, attempt more or less 
successfully to enforce apprenticeship regulations.” 
_* The attempt of the union to control apprentice- 
ships after the manner of the ancient gilds by in- 
sisting upon journeymen’s ability as a condition of 
membership is a failure. ‘‘ Apprentices, after ob- 
taining a smattering of a trade or becoming half 
trained, frequently run away and take up work 
elsewhere as journeymen.” + 
It is evident that one of the pressing needs of the 
hour is a series of new laws for the States governing 
apprenticeship. 
One of the most advanced of such laws in the 
United States is the Wisconsin Apprentice Law of 
rg11. (See Appendix VII.) 
III. Compulsory Education.?— There is a tendency 
everywhere to couple child-labor and compulsory 
education laws. In the evolution of society child- 
labor regulation appears first. As a community

been drawn largely from U. S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin No. 2, 
1914, Compulsory School Attendance. 
L

  APPRENTICESHIP 147 
Child-labor legislation is invariably followed by 
compulsory education. ‘The sequence is being illus- 
trated at this moment by the States of southern 
Europe, by Russia, and by some of the States of the 
American Union. 
1. Germany. — The compulsory attendance serv- 
ice of Germany has long been the envy of the rest 
ofthe world. Out of aschool population of 5,754,728 
in Prussia, only 548 children escaped the law in 1901. 
The results of the strict enforcement of compulsory 
education laws are seen in the almost total abolition 
of illiteracy, the high general average of education, 
and the industrial efficiency of the nation. Com- 
pared with conditions in our own country, where on 
an average, according to Professor Thorndike’s 
findings, only about one-third of the children 
graduate from an elementary school, the following 
percentages of elementary graduation in certain 
German cities are illuminating: Bremen, 98.6; 
Frankfort on the Main, 99.2; Wiesbaden, 99.4; 
Leipzig, 99.5; Dresden, 99.6. 
The Imperial Child-labor Law forbids, without 
exception, the employment of children under twelve. 
A thorough system of inspection by church and civil 
authorities and the registration of children at a
-P-A-G-E-92
  APPRENTICESHIP 149 
powered the Education Department to fix these 
limits in case the local authority failed to act. The 
act of 1900 empowers school attendance officers to 
make fourteen years the upper compulsory limit, and 
provides a penalty of twenty shillings for the viola- 
tion of the law. A child may be exempted at the 
age of thirteen provided he is credited with 350 
“ attendances ”’ for each of the preceding five years. 
Children between twelve and fourteen may have 
partial exemption by having credit for 300 “ at- 
tendances ” during each of the preceding five years. 
The results of this legislation to date are as follows : 
Seven of the local authorities have fixed the com- 
pulsory age from five to thirteen. All the rest (327) 
have made the period from five to fourteen. 
The enforcement of the law is primarily in the 
hands of teachers and school officers. When they 
fail the case is turned over toa magistrate. Teachers 
complain that magistrates are too lenient; they 
recommend that the enforcement of the law be in- 
trusted to the educational authorities. In proof of 
the alleged laxity of the courts the federation of 
education committees, at their annual meeting in 
1912, cited the fact that 720,000 children in England 
and Wales were daily absent from school. They

abstract of the school register, with the number of 
absences and the reasons therefor. The school 
committee may summon parents for warning and 
censure. In case of renewed violations the respon- 
sible parties are brought before a magistrate for fine 
or imprisonment. 
This system has not been satisfactory in practice. 
A bill pending in the Chamber of Deputies abolishes 
the communal school committee and transfers their 
duties to the justice of the peace. 
6. Switzerland.— The Federal constitution re- 
quires the Cantons to provide sufficient elementary 
education free to all children “ without prejudice 
to freedom of faith and conscience.” In fulfillment 
of this obligation every Canton has passed a com- 
pulsory education law, and in seventeen Cantons 
compulsion applies to continuation schools. The 
compulsory period varies in length in the several 
Cantons from six to nine years. 
7. The United States.1— All the States of our 
Union have compulsory education laws except 
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Caro- 
lina, and Texas. In Maryland, Louisiana, Virginia, 
1In the United States we have 5,500,000 illiterates. It has been 
estimated that the annual cost of this illiteracy in underproduction is 
$500,000,000,

masters thereof being able to instruct youths so far as they 
may bee fitted for the University; and if any town neglect 
the performance hereof above one yeare, then every such 
towne shall pay five pounds per annum to the next such 
schoole, till they shall perform this order.” ! 
Concerning this act of the General Court, James 
Russell Lowell has written: “It was in making 
education not only common to all, but in some sense 
compulsory on all, that the destiny of the free 
republics of America was practically settled.”? It 
is true that two hundred sixty-seven years after the 
passage of the law we still find half a dozen States 
without compulsion, but we are marching on, and 
a few years more will make the vote unanimous in 
favor of compulsory education. It is also true that 
the laws we have are ineffective in many cases; but 
we are improving rapidly. Each year sees some 
progress. In good time the laws will be perfected 
and public opinion will insist upon their better 
enforcement. 
(1) The School Census. — One of the indispensable 
conditions of a successful compulsory education 
law is an accurate enrollment of the children of school 
age. The school furnishes the names and addresses

2 New England Two Centuries Ago. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  APPRENTICESHIP 155 
Federal agents. The local authorities failed to report more 
than a third of a million children of school age, the error 
in some cases being as high as 25 per cent. In 17 States the 
local agents reported a quarter of a million children more than 
there actually were, the error of overstatement running as 
high as 15 per cent.” ! 
Further improvement was made in the New York 
City Census in 1914 by a consolidation of the Per- 
manent Census Bureau and the Department of Com- 
pulsory Education into a new Bureau of Compul- 
sory Education, School Census, and Child Welfare. 
The difficulty of keeping track of all the children in a 
city of the size of New York may be imagined when 
one considers the constant stream of foreign and na- 
tive immigration, coupled with the frequent changes 
of address on the part of citizens. The writer has 
single schools in which more than two thousand 
changes of registration occur in the course of a year. 
Several of his schools admit during September and 
October some eight hundred children and discharge 
three or four hundred on transfers. The record card 
of a certain boy recently inspected by me showed 
that the child had been in eight different schools in a 
single year. No wonder the legend has arisen that 
1 Bulletin No. 2, 1914, p. 13, U. S. Bureau of Education.
-P-A-G-E-96
  APPRENTICESHIP 157 
would mean the elimination of that child before the 
eighth grade was reached. If 180 days are necessary 
to complete a grade, a child attending 111.8 days 
each year would be 12.9 years completing eight 
”1 Poor attendance accounts for the fact 
that only about one third of the children in certain grades. 
typical American cities complete the eighth grade 
before leaving the school.? Definite information on 
this relation of absence to promotion is contained 
in the following table from the Report of the New 
York School Inquiry : —

(a) His own efficiency. 
(6) The promptness with which absences are 
reported to him. 
(c) The extent to which his measures for enforce- 
ment are backed by school authorities and courts. 
In rural districts the attendance officer is fre- 
quently employed at some gainful occupation as his 
regular work, while his services as an officer of the 
law are performed incidentally. Insufficient salaries 
are the chief cause of low-grade service. A good 
attendance officer is a man (or woman) of consider- 
able education, good character, pleasing dress and 
address, firm will, some knowledge of law, and self- 
possession sufficient to prosecute parents and chil- 
dren in a court. Such a person is worth from a 
thousand to two thousand dollars a year, according 
to length of service and ability. 
The information concerning non-attendance is 
supplied to the attendance officer by the school or 
by the census bureau. The effectiveness of enforce- 
ment depends, therefore, largely upon the promptness 
with which absences are reported. Some laws are 
so poor that no provision whatever is made for 
reporting absences. Some states require teachers 
to report once a month, some only once or twice a

indicate how discouraging is the endeavor to teach 
parents respect for the law. 
(3) The School Visitor. — Within recent years 
the “ school visitor ’’ or ‘‘ visiting teacher ” has been 
employed as an efficient means of adjusting the 
school to the home or the child to the school. One 
of the most important qualities of a good teacher is 
sympathy, — the ability to “ rejoice with them that 
do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.” That 
sort of sympathy is born of knowledge. In order 
really to enter into the lives of the children one must 
know their home conditions. Such information 
can be gained most effectively by visiting the home. 
But the average teacher does not find time to make 
visits and does not regard such activities as among 
her legitimate duties. Each child therefore remains 
a sort of unknown quantity in the teacher’s problem ; 
and we know that a problem in algebra with even 
two unknown quantities is apt to be difficult. Very 
many of the problem cases in school are the result 
of ignorance and consequent lack of sympathy on 
the part of the teacher. Teacher gets cross because 
Mary doesn’t understand her “ examples.” The 
real trouble may be that Teacher doesn’t understand 
Mary. The child may live in a cellar or in a single

quent teacher, magnified out of proportion, while 
the really important things are ignored. 
Even persons who pose as educators are often 
woefully ignorant of the actual state of affairs in 
education. On November 23, 1912, a New York 
daily paper published an article from the pen of a 
certain Professor in Princeton University, from 
which the following is quoted: — 
“T believe our school system is feeble and foolish. We are 
not getting half the results we have a right to expect from our 
schools. With a reasonably efficient organization we should 
be able to get for half the cost more than all the advantages 
and less than all the disadvantages we now obtain from our 
schools. ... The schools to-day are mostly occupied 
imparting stereotyped information and incidentally promot- 
ing democracy — democracy in ideas and ideals, in morals, 
and manners, in contagious diseases and even more con- 
tagious immorality. Bullying, . . . diphtheria, lying, scar- 
let fever, cheating in class and examination, whooping cough, 
profanity, measles, all-round cultivated incompetence, tuber- 
culosis, weakened eyes, . . . are some of the more objection- 
able of the miscellaneous evils disseminated, though not in- 
vented by our school system. 
“But our schools are open to a still severer indictment. 
They have no vital connection with the life of the community 
from which they draw their pupils and their funds. They 
fail to prepare pupils to do anything.”

of life.” The prosaic ‘‘ man has no notion that two 
and two make five, which is the problem the poet 
often has to solve.” The fact that elementary 
schools have taught no vocational subjects in the 
past is no good reason why in future they should 
teach nothing but vocational subjects. All the 
children who can afford to take culture courses and 
are qualified for such work should be given the 
opportunity. The free passage from the kinder- 
garten to the university must not be abolished. 
But, on the other hand, the schools are to do a 
great deal more in the future than they have done 
in the past for the ninety-five per cent who never" 
reach the university, for the ninety per cent who do_ 
not go through a high school, and for the sixty-six 
per cent who do not even graduate from the ele- 
mentary school. 
III. The Remedy. — Our school system is not 
perfect ; but neither is it as feeble and foolish as the 
Professor would have us believe. His assertion, 
without proof, that we should be able to get all the 
good we now have out of the public schools for half 
the cost, does not sound like the utterance of a man 
with the scientific habit of mind. That sort of 
exaggeration may arrest the attention of thought-

eight years of the school. If European experience 
counts for anything, vocational subjects will be 
taken up by the pupil after the completion of his 
thirteenth or fourteenth year. Some pre-vocational 
instruction may be offered by the regular school; 
but actual vocational training for young people 
already employed, will be offered in separate day or 
evening schools. 
President Gompers, of the American Federation 
of Labor, in the following extract from a report of 
his, shows himself wiser than the Princeton Profes- 
sor :— 
“Our movement in advocating industrial education pro- 
tests most emphatically against the elimination from our 
public-school system of any line of learning now taught. 
Education, technically or industrially, must be supplementary 
to and in connection with our modern school system.” 
IV. National Aid.— There was pending for 
several years in Congress a bill introduced by Sena- 
tor Carroll S. Page, of Vermont, which, if passed, 
would have provided national codperation with the 
several states in encouraging instruction in agricul- 
ture, the trades, industries, and home economics in 
high schools. It also offered national grants for 
the teaching of these subjects in State Normal

CONCLUSION I7r 
a fair statement in concise form of the problem of 
vocational education in the United States: — 
1. “Continuation Schools for that half of the children 
who leave school at fourteen years of age, and mostly in the 
fifth and sixth grades, these continuation schools to be liber- 
ally cultural and at the same time to be extremely practical 
and related as directly as possible to the occupations in which 
the several students are engaged. 
2. “The development of a modern apprenticeship system 
wherein by contract the respective and equal rights of em- 
ployer and employee are fully recognized, the entire trade is 
taught, together with such other subjects as are essential 
to good citizenship. 
3. “The development of secondary continuation or trade 
schools, by which the more efficient of the great army of boys 
and girls who will enter the continuation schools may progress 
from these lower continuation schools, as in some other coun- 
tries, to the foremost places in industry and commerce. 
4. “Compulsory education through adolescence, being 
until the seventeenth or eighteenth year, attendance being in 
the all-day school until the fourteenth year, and thereafter 
in either the all-day schools or in the continuation schools 
for not less than one-half day per week, without loss of wages 
for hours in school. 
5. “The strengthening of all truancy laws and the devel- 
opment of public sentiment in support thereof. 
6. “The training of teachers in thoroughgoing methods of 
industrial practice, including as part of such training extended 
experience in actual shop work.

a term of years. He became a member of the 
master’s household, lived under his master’s eye, 
very much in the manner of an adopted son, and

a teacher for the entire year and such teacher is employed for 
such period, as herein provided, the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion shall make an additional apportionment to such city or 
district of the sum of two hundred dollars. But the total 
amount apportioned in each year on account of such teacher 
shall not exceed one thousand dollars. 
3. The Commissioner of Education shall also make an 
additional apportionment to each city and union free school 
district for each additional teacher employed exclusively 
in the schools mentioned in the preceding subdivisions of this 
section for thirty-six weeks during the school year, a sum 
equal to one-third of the salary paid to each such additional 
teacher, but not exceeding one thousand dollars for each 
teacher. 
4. The Commissioner of Education, in his discretion, may 
apportion to a district or city maintaining such schools or 
employing such teachers for a shorter time than thirty-six 
weeks, or for a less time than a regular school day, an amount 
pro rata to the time such schools are maintained or such 
teachers are employed. This section shall not be construed 
to entitle manual training high schools or other secondary 
schools maintaining manual training departments, to an 
apportionment of funds herein provided for. 
Any person employed as teacher as provided herein may 
serve as principal of the school in which the said industrial 
or trade school or course, or school or course of agriculture, 
mechanic arts and homemaking, is maintained. [As amended 
by Laws of 1913, chapter 747.)

that will be required to maintain such schools after applying 
toward the maintenance thereof the amount apportioned 
therefor by the Commissioner of Education. Such amount 
shall thereafter be levied, assessed and raised by tax upon 
the taxable property of the district at the time and in the 
manner that other taxes for school purposes are raised in 
such district. [As amended by Laws of 1913, chapter 747.]

APPENDIX III 
AN UNDEMOCRATIC PROPOSAL 
JOHN DEWEY 
PROFESSOR OF PHILosopHY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 
No question at present under discussion in education is 
so fraught with consequences for the future of democracy 
as the question of industrial education. Its right develop- 
ment will do more to make public education truly demo- 
cratic than any other one agency now under consideration. 
Its wrong treatment will as surely accentuate all undemocratic 
tendencies in our present situation, by fostering and strength- 
ening class divisions in school and out. It is better to suffer 
a while longer from the ills of our present lack of system till

ments now operating for the improvement of existing general 
education. The old time general, academic education is 
beginning to be vitalized by the introduction of manual, in- 
dustrial and social activities; it is beginning to recognize its 
responsibility to train all the youth for useful citizenship, 
including a calling in which each may render useful service to 
society and make an honest and decent living. Everywhere 
the existing school system is beginning to be alive to the need 
of supplementary agencies to help it fulfill this purpose, and 
is taking tentative but positive and continuous steps toward 
it. The City of Chicago in this same State of Illinois prob- 
ably ranks behind no other city of the country in the extent 
and wisdom of the steps already taken, steps which will of 
necessity be followed by others just as fast as those already 
taken demonstrate their efficiency. 
These two movements within the established American 
public school system, the proposed scheme, if adopted, will 
surely arrest. General education will be left with all its aca- 
demic vices and its remoteness from the urgent realities of con- 
temporary life untouched, and with the chief forces working 
for reform removed. Increasing recognition of its public 
and social responsibilities will be blasted. It is inconceivable 
that those who have loved and served our American common 
school system will, whatever the defects of this system, stand 
idly by and see such a blow aimed at it. Were anything 
needed to increase the force of the blow, it is the fact that the 
bill provides that all funds for industrial education raised by 
the local community be duplicated by the state, although the 
funds contributed by the state for general school purposes 
are hardly more than five per cent of the amount raised by 
local taxation. 
oO  
-P-A-G-E-117
  APPENDIX III 195 
a definitely progressive turn, such a reactionary measure as 
the institution of trade and commercial schools under separate 
auspices should be proposed. It is not necessary to argue 
concerning the personal motives of the bankers and manufac- 
turers who have been drawn into the support of the measure. 
Doubtless many of them have the most public spirited of in- 
tentions. But no one experienced in education can doubt 
what would be the actual effect of a system of schools con- 
ducted wholly separate from the regular public schools, with 
a totally different curriculum, and with teachers and pupils 
responsible to a totally independent and separate school ad- 
ministration. Whatever were the original motives and in- 
tentions, such schools would not and could not give their 
pupil a knowledge of industry or any particular occupation 
in relation to “science, art and society in general.” To at- 
tempt this would involve duplicating existing schools, in ad- 
dition to providing proper industrial training. And it is 
self-evident that the economical and effective way to accom- 
plish this move is to expand and supplement the present school 
system. Not being able to effect this complete duplication, 
these new schools would simply aim at increased efficiency 
in certain narrow lines. Those who believe in the continued 
separate existence of what they are pleased to call the 
“Jower classes” or the “laboring classes” would naturally 
rejoice to have schools in which these “classes” would be 
segregated. And some employers of labor would doubtless 
rejoice to have schools supported by public taxation supply 
them with additional food for their mills. All others should 
be united against every proposition, in whatever form ad- 
vanced, to separate training of employees from training for 
citizenship, training of intelligence and character from train-

Comments : 
1. The dulling effect of the home drudgery of the for- 
eign mother was mentioned in our report of last 
month. Time and again we have come across 
mothers who might be willing to help in school 
problems affecting their children, but who seemed

were placed in the halls, refuse was removed from 
halls, and the halls put into better condition. 
4. Three moving picture theaters wer¢ found to be admit- 
ting children without guardian and under sixteen 
in defiance of the law. They were warned. Also 
certain candy stores in the neighborhood used as 
hangouts for children during school hours were 
warned. This will be followed up in the case of 
the theaters. 
V. Three typical cases: 
Case 89: Case of continued truancy. Yetta is a girl 
of fifteen. Upon investigation it was found that 
Yetta’s mother died a year ago in Russia. Yetta’s 
married sister, who lives in this city, sent for her 
with the intention of giving her a good education 
and taking good care of her. The sister’s husband, 
a car conductor, pretty soon discovered that his 
earnings were not sufficient to enable him to keep 
Yetta at school, and he wanted Yetta to go to work. 
Yetta was not ready for her employment certificate. 
Consequently they kept her at home to enable her 
married sister to go to work. They explained to the 
school authorities that Yetta must begin to earn or 
they would have her deported. 
The case was immediately referred to the U. H. C. 
Yetta was placed in a special class and we expect 
her to be ready for her working papers by June. 
Hersister, after consultation, saw things in a reason- 
able light and she was persuaded to codperate. 
Case No. 105: Two children of the same family were 
reported by their teachers as deficient in their work, 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  APPENDIX IV 201 
impudence and shrieking disorder. The mother, 
who had been used to her son’s troubles at school, 
was antagonistic, and the case had all the earmarks 
of a hardened discipline case with very discouraging 
home surroundings. The boy was put back to a 
lower grade; and the case was put in the hands of 
the school visitor. After friendly relations were 
established between the school visitor and the boy, 
a compact was formed between them. He prom- 
ised to make the effort of his life, and now after 
almost a month he has been placed in his proper 
class again and is living up to the terms of the com- 
pact faithfully. 
VI. Conferences: 
Visitor had conferences during the month at the 
Public Education Association, Bronx House and 
with the Mothers’ Club of P. S. 4. 
A conference was held at the Bronx office of the United 
Hebrew Charities, Mr. Henry J. Eckstein, presid- 
ing. Mr. Eckstein is also a member of the Board 
of Directors of Bronx House. Representing the 
school were Mr. Hirsdansky (also on the Board 
of Directors of Bronx House), Miss Lambert and 
Miss Bildersee, Assistants to Principal, Miss Feit- 
zinger, school nurse, and Miss Manheim, visiting 
teacher. Such cases as the school authorities 
knew to be U. H. C. cases were gone over in detail 
and the method of treatment discussed. A de- 
tailed report of the conference is hardly called for 
here, excepting that it shows the way for codpera- 
tion with other agencies. We wish to point out

munities, and imparting to such persons information on said 
subjects through field demonstrations, publications, and 
otherwise; and this work shall be carried on without dis- 
crimination as to race in such manner as may be mutually 
agreed upon by the Secretary of Agriculture and the State 
agricultural college or colleges receiving the benefits of this 
Act. 
Sec. 3. That for the purpose of paying the expenses 
of said codperative agricultural extension work and the 
necessary printing and distributing of information in con- 
nection with the same, there is permanently appropriated,

the sum of $490,000 for each year, $10,000 of which shall 
be paid annually, in the manner hereinafter provided, to 
each State which shall by action of its legislature assent 
to the provisions of this Act: Provided, That payment of 
such installments of the appropriation hereinbefore made as 
shall become due to any State before the adjournment of the 
regular session of the legislature meeting next after the pas- 
sage of this Act may, in the absence of prior legislative assent, 
be made upon the assent of the governor thereof, duly certified 
to theSecretary of the Treasury : Provided further, That there 
is also appropriated an additional sum of $600,000 for the 
fiscal year following that in which the foregoing appropria- 
tion first becomes available, and for each year thereafter for 
seven years a sum exceeding by $600,000 the sum appro-

  THE WISCONSIN APPRENTICE LAW OF 
LO 
SECTION 2377. Every contract or agreement entered into 
between a minor and employer by which the minor is to learn 
a trade shall be known as an indenture, and shall comply with 
the provisions of sections 2378 to 2386, inclusive, of the 
statutes. Every minor entering into such a contract shall 
be known as an apprentice. 
Sec. 2378. Any minor may, by the execution of an inden- 
ture, bind himself as hereinafter provided, and such indenture 
may provide that the length of the term of the apprentice 
shall depend on the degree of the efficiency reached in the 
work assigned, but no indenture shall be made for less than 
one year, and if the minor is less than eighteen years of age 
the indenture shall in no case be for a period of less than two 
years. 
SEc. 2379. Any person or persons apprenticing a minor 
or forming any contractual relation in the nature of an ap- 
prenticeship without complying with the provisions of sec- 
tions 2377 to 2387, inclusive, of the statutes, shall, upon con- 
viction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than fifty 
nor more than one hundred dollars. 
Sec. 2380. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of 
labor, the factory inspector, or assistant factory inspectors 
to enforce the provisions of this act and to prosecute viola-

devices. 
(b) Such other branches as may be approved by the State 
board of industrial education. 
(7) Astatement of the compensation to be paid the appren- 
tice. 
Src. 2383. The instruction specified in section 2382 may 
be given in a public school, or in such other manner as may be 
approved by the local board of industrial education; and if 
there be no local board, subject to the approval of the State 
board of industrial education. Attendance at the public 
school, if any, shall be certified to by the teachers in charge 
of the courses, and failure to attend shall subject the appren- 
tice to the penalty of a loss of compensation for three hours 
for every hour he shall be absent without good cause. It 
shall be the duty of the school officials to coéperate for the 
enforcement of this law. 
SEc. 2384. It shall be lawful to include in the indenture 
or agreement an article stipulating that during such period 
of the year as the public schools shall not be in session the em- 
ployer and the apprentice may be released from those portions 
of the indenture which affect the instruction to be given. 
Sec. 2385. If either party to an indenture shall fail to 
perform any of the stipulations, he shall forfeit not less than 
ten nor more than fifty dollars on complaint, the collection of 
which may be made by the commissioner of labor, factory 
inspector, or assistant factory inspectors in any court of 
competent jurisdiction in this State. Any court of com- 
petent jurisdiction may, in its discretion, also annul the 
indenture. Nothing herein prescribed shall deprive the em- 
ployer of the right to dismiss any apprentice who has will-

A GERMAN APPRENTICE CONTRACT?! 
The following apprentice contract is. executed between the 
firm of Friedrich Krupp, share company in Essen on the Ruhr, 
and (apprentice’s name), born at (place of birth), to (name 
of parents), accompanied by his (parent or guardian, and 
name), as his legal representative. 
Section 1. The firm accepts (apprentice’s name) as ap- 
prentice for their cast-steel factory and obligates themselves 
to have him trained as a (trade or branch in which appren- 
ticed) under the direction of a suitable representative. The 
apprentice is thrown under the fatherly authority of the rep- 
resentative. 
Src. 2. The apprentice is obligated to obedience and 
truth, to industry and proper conduct. 
He must regularly attend, under the direction of the firm, 
an improvement school, and present the certificate there ob- 
tained, immediately on its receipt, to the official set over him. 
Sec. 3. The apprentice is responsible for his support 
and for all other things necessary, with the exception of the 
tools necessary to his work. 
He shall receive from the day of his entrance on apprentice- 
ship pay for each working day, which shall depend on his 
conduct, ability, and efficiency, according to the following 
scheme: 
1 Bulletin No. 19, 1913, U.S. Commissioner of Education.
-P-A-G-E-127
APPENDIX VIII 215 
Src. 6. On the part of the apprentice, the apprenticeship 
may be ended in the cases of section 124, numbers 1, 3, 4, and 
5 of the National Industrial Law (see supplement), and also 
if the firm neglects their legal duties toward the apprentice 
in a manner dangerous to his health, his morals, or his train- 
ing, or misuses the right of fatherly authority, or becomes 
unable to fulfill their contractual duties. 
Src. 7. On the close of the apprenticeship a certificate 
shall be given to the apprentice concerning the length of the 
apprenticeship and the knowledge and skill acquired during 
it, as well as concerning his conduct. An apprentice letter 
(Lehrbrief) shall be given only when the contractual period 
of apprenticeship has been completed or shortened with 
approval of the firm. 
Sec. 8. The firm reserves to itself the payment to the 
apprentice on regular completion of apprenticeship, when 
his conduct and efficiency was, according to the decision 
of the official in charge, good, of a reward not to exceed 
150 marks. 
The firm decides according to its free judgment whether the 
payment is to be refused wholly or in part, and whether it 
is to be made to the apprentice himself or to his legal repre- 
sentative. 
Sec. 9. Subject to the provisions of this contract, the 
apprentice is subject to all regulations for the workers of the 
cast-steel factory, especially the work regulations. 
For other matters, so far as there are no regulations in the 
present contract, the provisions of the National Industrial 
Law apply. 
Sec. 10. Apprentices who remain at the steel factory 
after the close of their apprenticeship shall, on continued good

With the old it is already too late. No one wants them, no 
one can use them. The unskilled person has nothing to 
market but brute strength. When that is gone, he has lost 
all the economic value he ever had. 
But what to do with the young? That is the great 
problem. They know nothing, they wish to know nothing. 
They drift along from job to job, from worse to better, and 
back again to worse. A fifty-cent piece looks bigger than the 
prospect of learning a trade. Just to-day I had a call from a 
large meter works for a boy. He was to get $6.50 as a be- 
ginner. It was not much, of course, but the boy would be 
taught a good trade, the mechanics’ and pipe-fitters’. At 
either of these trades he would in time be in a position to com- 
mand a higher wage than his unskilled father had ever thought 
of. But not a boy would take the place. Boys living at 
home and whose earnings are only spending money laughed 
at it. They wanted nine or ten dollars, not caring about a 
trade. 
In the Spirit of Youth and the City Streets Jane Addams 
sums up the situation far better than I could. But as man- 
ager of an employment agency in one of the largest factory 
centers of the world, I have been struck by the facts as never 
before. Hundreds of people come into my office every week, 
yet for the great majority of them I have no position. They 
are unskilled. The call is for skilled people, those who know 
some one thing. These are always in demand. They re- 
ceive fairly good wages. But the unskilled — they are a drug 
on the market. As the foreman in one of the factories here 
remarked, they know nothing and they want to be paid for 
it. 
Here are a few examples of places open to the unskilled.

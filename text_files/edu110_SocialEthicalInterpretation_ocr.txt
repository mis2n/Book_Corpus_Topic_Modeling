PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 
(Somewhat abridged) 
Tuis volume is a continuation of the studies in genetic 
psychology begun in my Mental Development in the Child 
and the Race. As was announced in the earlier work, I 
had intended to publish the volume of ‘Interpretations’ 
under the same general heading of ‘Mental Develop- 
ment’ and to include in it certain educational ‘Interpre- 
tations’ also. It seems best, however, for the sake of 
unity of treatment in this volume, —and also on account 
of its size, to omit the educational matter for the pres- 
ent, and also to make this volume quite independent of 
the former work, except in so far as the natural connec- 
tion requires somewhat frequent reference to it. This 
departure from my original plan also enables me to 
include in Book II. certain chapters which were written 
with reference to the question set by the Royal Academy 
of Denmark.! 
I have also endeavoured, in view of the lack in English 
of a book on Social Psychology which can be used in the 
universities in connection with courses in psychology, 
1 «Ts it possible to establish, for the individual isolated in society, rules of 
conduct drawn entirely from his personal nature; and if such rules are pos- 
sible, what is their relation to the rules which would be reached from the 
consideration of society as a whole?” A brief analysis of my essay, drawn 
up by Professor Héffding in the report to the Danish Academy, may be seen 
in the Comptes Rendus de Académie du Danemark, (Reprinted in the 
Philosophical Review, July, 1897.) vii

ethics, and social science, to make my essay available for 
such a purpose. This has led to such expansions — some 
may call them repetitions — of the fundamental ideas of 
the work as seemed necessary to a fairly complete work- 
ing-out of the social element in connection with each of 
the greater psychological functions. Book I. is thus made, 
as far as its topics are concerned, a more or less complete 
study of social and ethical psychology. Certain of the 
sections have already been printed, as footnotes of 
acknowledgment to the journals show. 
The writers to whom I am most indebted are referred 
to zz locis. I find my opinions in the matter of the social 
function of imitation lying, in some respects, near to those 
of M. G. Tarde! The agreement is, however, more a co- 
incidence than a direct connection, as readers of my Mental 
Development may remember. I take pleasure in recogniz- 
ing a more fundamental agreement on many of the main 
conclusions of both my volumes with those of my friend, 
Professor Josiah Royce. 
The motto of Book I., the quotation from St. Luke, 
was suggested to me by my friend and colleague, Presi- 
dent Patton, who preached from it a remarkable sermon 
—his latest baccalaureate discourse in Princeton. In this 
sermon he made use of the idea of the identity of ego 
and alter in our thought, much on the lines on which, 
as I think, the social philosophy of the future will be 
developed. 
Besides the thin volume of ‘Educational Interpreta-

tions’ which I hope to get ready in a reasonable time, I 
have a more remote intention of some day gathering into 
a volume the considerations on evolution which a more 
adequate exposition of the principle of Organic Selection 
(Cf. Appendix A in the earlier editions of this work) 
involves.1

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 
Tue changes embodied in this edition—apart from 
verbal corrections and slight supplementary alterations — 
are embodied in Appendix H (II-V). They deal with 
essential topics. 
I may take this opportunity to refer to a matter of per- 
sonal interest, though of minor importance, of which some 
of the reviewers of the book have considered it worth 
while to speak. I refer to the relation of certain views 
expressed in this work to those of the distinguished 
French writer M. G. Tarde. An English reviewer says, 
apropos of the allusion to M. Tarde in the preface to my 
first edition, that it represents “an obligation which is 
perhaps greater than he thinks.” Now I need not say 
that I have very great admiration for M. Tarde, —fre- 
quent references in my books have shown it,—and that 
I am glad to refer to him as a man of great eminence 
who has reached from a different point of view positions 
with which in some points my own are in agreement; and 
this I feel the more after a correspondence with M. Tarde 
in which he is good enough to speak of this matter with 
reference to the French translation of my volume on 
Mental Development in the Child and the Race. He rec- 
ognizes the entire independence of our two endeavours in 
words which he allows me to quote; they are substan- 
tially what he has said in print (cf. his recent work Les 
Lois Sociales, pp. 37-38). He says: 
“Nous nous complétons encore plus que nous nous accordons. 
Votre maniére d’utilizer lidée d’imitation n’a rien de commun 
avec la mienne, et j’ajoute, tres sincérement, qu’il est regrettable 
xi
-P-A-G-E-10
  xii Preface to the Second Edition 
que votre ouvrage ne soit pas venu avant le mien. En effet, votre 
point darrivée, au terme de votre longue et pénétrante analyse 
du processus imitatif, est en quelque sorte mon foint du départ. 
Je prends cette notion, toute faite, et je l’applique dans un domain 
ou il ne peut étre question de cette imitation principalement in- 
consciente et intra-cérébrale que vous étudiez. .. . Les qualités 
d’esprit et les connaissances que réclamait mon analyse 4 moi, 
toute psycho-sociologique, sont trés différents des aptitudes et des 
expériences exigées par votre analyse a vous, physio-psychologique.” 
(Italics his.) 
This statement from M. Tarde I entirely endorse. He 
arrived at the view that Imitation is the fundamental 
social fact a long time before I took up the study of social 
organization at all, and his priority from that point of view 
is unquestioned. Yet speaking of the social point of view, 
I may add that while M. Tarde is unindebted to Walter 
Bagehot,! nevertheless Bagehot published similar conclu- 
sions some time before Tarde, his chapter on Imitation 
having appeared in his remarkable book Physics and 
Politics in English in December, 1872, and in the French 
translation in 1877. Considered, therefore, from the soci- 
ological side, the intuition that the method of social propa- 
gation is imitation, undoubtedly belongs first of all to the 
great English publicist, not to raise the question of still 
earlier intimations of it. 
As for my own position, my conclusion as to the impor- 
tance of imitation in social life was the direct result of a 
series of studies of the psychology of imitation which led 
me to the more general opinions on genetic and social 
psychology now embodied in my two volumes. Much of 
the matter was printed earlier in a series of ‘articles in 
1M. Tarde has stated this also in one of his letters to me.

Preface to the Second Edition xiii 
Science, N. Y. 1890-92, and Mind, London, January, 1894. 
The MS. of my first volume was finished before my atten- 
tion was called to M. Tarde’s Lozs de I’ Imitation, and the 
allusions to him were then made in it as it went to print. 
That my work should bring, in the words of M. Tarde, 
“une confirmation des plus frappantes” of his idea (and 
Bagehot’s), is an event, happy for both of us, so evidently 
due to an unexpected rapprochement from two separate 
fields of inquiry, that it renders impossible any question 
of priority, and any personal relationship but that of 
hearty co-operation. This latter, I am glad to say, the 
correspondence referred to has already established. Fur- 
thermore, I should of course have mentioned in my first 
edition the position taken by Bagehot had I been aware 
of it. His book was known to me only from hearsay, 
and that it contained the treatment of Imitation I had 
no knowledge until last December, when a correspondent 
brought it to my attention. Accordingly, I am now glad 
to cite it as emphasizing the réle of natural selection in 
group-competition which I have called ‘group-selection’ 
(see Sect. 313 @). 
With this much on the agreement between M. Tarde’s 
views and those of this work, a word may be added as to 
the differences. I do not altogether agree with this writer 
in saying: “ainsi le charactére constant d’un fait social, 
quel qu’il soit, est bien d’étre imitatif. Et ce charactére 
est exclusivement propre aux faits sociaux.” (Revue de 
Metaph., January, 1898, p. 28.1) That imitation is the 
method of social propagation, the essential method, and 
that to which other ways of social propagation may be 
1 Now reprinted in his Socta? Laws (Eng. trans.), p. 41. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
xiv Preface to the Second Edition 
reduced —this is the element of truth in the Bagehot- 
Tarde intuition which I think genetic psychology has 
now fully established. This Dr. G. Tosti has pointed 
out in recent articles. But to say “ce charactére est 
exclusively propre aux faits sociaux,” —that statement is 
just what the ‘dialectic of personal growth’ developed 
in this volume and stated in the earlier one, goes to 
disprove. The criticism of M. Tarde in Sect. 316 of 
this work is explicit. The distinction between social mat- 
ter and social process, between propagation and that 
which is propagated, between mere imitation and social 
progress, is here in question; and I hold to the solution 
which my ‘dialectic’ affords. 
A word is to be added supplementary to the allusions 
made in the text (pp. 483, 485) to the views of Professor 
F. H. Giddings expressed in his able book The Principles 
of Sociology, and more especially to his doctrine of the 
‘Consciousness of Kind.’ My criticism of ‘Consciousness 
of Kind’ is aimed at its extreme generality, as applying 
to all stages and sorts of gregariousness and sociality, 
and so serving to obscure the psychological differences 
between certain of these stages; especially that between 
the instinctive collective life of the animals and the 
social life of a reflective sort seen in human affairs. 
This distinction I consider very important. In a pas- 
sage in an earlier publication (Handbook of Psychology, 
Feeling and Will, 1891, p. 193) I made a statement under 
the heading ‘Social Feeling’ which seems to cover ‘Con- 
sciousness of Kind’ — when psychologically defined — and 
which in view of its being the germ of the theory of 
1 The reader may now turn to the new Chapter XIII., on ‘ Imitation.’
-P-A-G-E-13
Preface to the Second Edition xv 
this work (z.e., that social and ethical sentiment develop 
by the ‘generalization of the idea of personality’) I make 
free to quote: “The further generalization of the idea of 
personality, to which developed sympathy attaches, gives 
the emotion a broader reference. Social feeling is sympa- 
thetic emotion as it attaches to man in general. It can 
‘only arise after the conception of man is reached, of man 
as a multiplication of particular men dike myself. As long 
as men were not considered as all ‘like myself,’ but some 
slaves, some barbarians, some Gentiles— only a few Greeks 
or Hebrews —social feeling had only the range of the 
class or race in the midst of which it arose.” 
In order to avoid confusion of citation I may say that 
in referring to my earlier volume in various connections, 
simply by the title ‘Mental Development,’ I have had 
in mind putting the emphasis in the title of the present 
volume on the words ‘Social and Ethical Interpretations.’ 
I have purposely avoided calling them Volumes I. and II, 
seeing that they were composed as independent works. 
The sentence in the first preface to this volume to the 
effect that “certain chapters were written with reference 
to the question” set by the Danish Academy has been 
misunderstood. The remainder of the book (except Chap- 
ter XII and certain short Sections) although not written 
expressly for the purpose, was included in the prize trea- 
tise. I supposed the indication on the title-page would 
make clear this unimportant detail.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION 
In this edition of my book the changes are principally 
additions; and these additions are made in view of criti- 
cisms which have shown in what directions the original 
treatment was not sufficiently developed. The book has 
had detailed and generous criticism, which the stress of my 
work upon the Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology 
(still not entirely published) has prevented my taking up 
in equal detail. I am glad to find, however, that such 
criticisms, illuminating as they are, mainly affect the scope 
and purpose of the book, not its essential theory ; and this, 
I think, will appear to the reader of the sections added in 
this edition. I append below a list of the longer critical 
studies of the work, to which reference is made, and 
add in brackets to certain of them the section numbers of 
the passages in which relevant matter is to be found. 
Whether fully answered or not, I take pleasure in refer- 
ring the reader to these criticisms; for the life of knowl- 
edge is, after all, discussion, and the things of research 
are “not done in a corner!” 
The principal additions are § 2 of the ‘Introduction,’ 
Chapter XIII. (on ‘Imitation’ — almost entirely new), the 
§ 4 of Chapter XII. (on ‘Animal Companies’), § 4 of Chap- 
ter XI. (on ‘The Socionomic Forces’ —revised matter of 
Appendix H, v. of the second edition), § 4 of Chapter I. 
(on the ‘ Genesis of the Self-Thought’ — revised matter of 
Appendix H, rv. of the second edition), Appendix K, 1, 
u., mi. Besides these greater matters, there are many 
xvii
-P-A-G-E-16
  xviii Preface to the Third Edition 
shorter additions and revisions throughout, together with 
citations from late literature. 
I wish to call especial attention to the matter on ‘ Imita- 
tion’ in the new Chapter XIII. I look to it to clear up 
various points of obscurity both in the book itself, and, I 
venture to think, more especially in the treatment of it 
by certain critics. In the ‘Preface’ to the second edition 
I spoke of my relation to M. Tarde; and yet his name and 
mine are quoted together as holders of the ‘Imitation’ 
theory without proper distinction. In spite of the large 
place which I assign to Imitation in the social life, I should 
prefer to have my theory known as the ‘Self’ or the ‘ Self- 
Thought’ theory of social organization.1 This means that 
I should prefer the more inclusive to the less inclusive 
designation, since the latter is misleading in view of the 
larger place assigned to this factor by my honoured friend 
M. Tarde, and also in view of our somewhat different 
definitions of Imitation. These two considerations make 
it evident that it is well-nigh impossible for any one to treat 
M. Tarde’s views and my own together without seriously 
misrepresenting one writer or the other. And I venture 
to add that my essay was and is justified by the recognition 
of certain possible criticisms of the ‘Imitation’ theory, 
properly so called, and by my aim to seek a broader psy- 
chological foundation for social science. 
I have referred above to the co-operative Dictionary of 
Philosophy and Psychology, now in course of publication 
(Macmillans). I may add that the terminology of this book 
1 I can sum up my view no better than I have in the reply to Professor 
Dewey, Appendix K, 11. below, in the words: “Imitation is not social unless 
it be the means of organizing a certain sort of material, and the material is 
not social unless it be imitatively organized. Self-thoughts imitatively organ- 
ized are, I contend, the essence of what is social.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-17
  Preface to the Third Edition xix 
now follows the definitions and formulations of that work, 
which aims in the social sciences generally, as in other de- 
partments, to reflect and to sum up current knowledge. The 
fuller articles of the Dzctionary — written by many hands 
—on the broader topics of Sociology, Social Psychology, 
Biology, etc., may be referred to for their own sake as well; 
and I do not hesitate to allude to them in the footnotes. 
It is not surprising that different critics should read into 
my views a philosophy. Yet that they differ is perhaps 
the best proof that my book is what it set out to be—a 
discussion of genesis and organization on the basis of facts, 
not a theory of the sort of reality of the social life, nor a 
critique of its value as reality. In this matter I insist on the 
independence and self-sufficiency of the scientific point of 
view, as I did also in the companion volume on Mental 
Development. My detailed views on the relation of ‘ gene- 
sis’ to ‘value’ are to be found in an article ‘The Origin of 
a Thing and its Nature’ in the Psychological Review, II., 
1895, p. 551 ff., now included in the volume Development 
and Evolution, mentioned above, p. ix, as about to appear.

  PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION 
Tuts edition is not materially altered, the changes being 
principally additions of literary references and notes. The 
thorough revision and enlargement made in the third 
edition brought the work into practically its final shape. 
The intention to write a single volume on the “ Principles 
of Genetic Science,” setting together the results of all my 
genetic studies, replaces and in a different way, in a meas- 
ure, fulfils that of keeping the separate volumes of this 
series revised up to date with matter of newer discussion 
and opinion. Whatever they may be worth with respect 
to this contribution of ‘ideas’ and theories — this is inde- 
pendent of such continued revision. The constant reprint- 
ing of the books is of course a gratifying proof that they 
have some little worth of that sort. 
The work on Genetic Logic, Thought and Things (Vol. 
I.), has essential relation to this. The topic in regard to 
which the treatment of this volume is most essentially sup- 
plemented and advanced in that book is that of ‘Common’ 
meaning and knowledge. The attempt is there made to 
trace the different modes and meanings of ‘Commonness’ 
in knowledge and thought (Thought and Things, Vol. I., 
Chap. VII., and Vol. II., Chap. II.). The result is akin to 
that reached in this work, summed up in the sentence, “the 
individual is a social outcome, not a social unit” — perhaps 
the most oft-quoted sentence in the book —z.e. the result 
that “knowledge is common property, not a private posses- 
xxi
-P-A-G-E-20
  xxii Preface to the Fourth Edition 
sion.” This is a thesis that should serve to destroy the 
epistemological atomism and subjectivism of individualistic 
theories of knowledge, making personal logical thought az 
outcome, not an epistemological unit; very much as the 
other truth destroys the social atommism of individualistic 
theories of society and the state.

INTRODUCTION 
§ 1. MrrHop 
  It is my aim, in the present essay, to inquire to what 
extent the principles of the development of the individual 
mind apply also to the evolution of society! This thesis 
being the main one, it naturally falls into two main in- 
quiries:? what are the principles which the individual 
shows in his mental life,—principles of organization, 
growth, and conduct?— and what additional principles, 
if any, does society exhibit in its forms of organization, 
progress, and activity ? 
There are three more or less ‘scientific’® methods by 
which this general problem might be investigated, which 
I may name in order: 
First, the Anthropological or Historical method, which 
aims to discover in the history of society the same prin- 
ciples as those which individual mental growth shows. Its 
question is: Does the individual in his progress recapitu- 
late, in any sense, the progress of society as shown in its 
history from the earliest forms of organization to the 
latest ? 
Seconp, the Sociological or Statistical method, which 
aims, by analytical and inductive examinations of society,

to find out the principles of its organization and the_ 
method of its growth; the results to be compared with 
those of descriptive psychology. 
Tuirp, the Genetic method, which has application in two 
fields of investigation : 
1. The psychological development of the individual 
examined for light upon the social elements and move- 
ments of his nature, whereby he finds himself in social 
organization with his fellows. This may be called the 
Psychogenetic method. 
2. The diofogical forces and their results in animal life, 
together with the psychological phenomena of animal life, 
examined for light upon the antecedents of the social 
forces and institutions which are human. This may be 
called the Bzogenetic method. 
These three methods are not strictly distinct, nor are 
their fields of application entirely separate; but the de- 
scription of them may serve to indicate certain converging 
paths by which the general problem may be approached. 
A complete scientific research should include them all. 
The method of the present essay is the Genetic: the 
form of that method which inquires into the psychological 
development of the human individual in the earlier stages 
of his growth for light upon his social nature, and also upon 
the social organization in which he bears a part. The 
evidence presented in this study is therefore, in the main, 
Psychogenetic ; it is drawn largely from direct observation 
of children. The main thought which runs through it is 
the conception of the growth of the child’s sense of per- 
sonality. This gives its title to Book I. The justification 
of. this way of treating the problem must appear, if any- 
where, in the results. 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
Lntroduction 2 
At the same time, the other methods are not without 
evident connection with the one here adopted. The an- 
’ thropological bearings of the genetic data which I employ 
are frequently indicated in the text. The analytical method 
is considered, and in a measure employed, in Part VI. 
The Biogenetic method is valuable mainly in investigat- 
ing the socionomic forces (those which condition or limit 
social change, but are not themselves social in their char- 
acter; see Chap. XI., § 4, Sect. 313 a). It aids us in study- 
ing the social, much as the study of the environment — 
physical features, climate, etc., which are ghemselves not 
vital in their character — aids the biologist. This distinc- 
tion is so important and its observance so necessary to 
the proper understanding of this work that it may be em- 
phasized here: it is explained, and also cited in view of 
certain criticisms, in later pages (see as above, and also 
‘Introduction,’ § 2). This method is employed, however, 
in connection with problems of the soctonomic sort. 
The advantage of the psychological genetic method is 
that it is constantly based upon observed facts and may 
be controlled by them. Psychological observations of the 
child fall within the range of positive science; and their 
value consists in the possibility of their repeated corrobo- 
ration. The theoretical inferences of the work are thus 
made more secure; and they may be supported, moreover, 
by a corresponding appeal to the facts of social life for 
confirmation.

  from a restricted point of view — that further explanations 
are needed as to the presuppositions of the text. Dr. 
Bosanquet criticises it from the point of view of the 
Philosophy of the State (or of Society). But philosophy 
of society is one of the ‘other things’ —it is not social 
psychology. Dr. Bosanquet’s complaint is that invention 
and imitation are not two things, factors, ‘moments,’ 
philosophically considered, but that they are only aspects 
of a single principle, ‘identity in change’; and Mr. Ball 
follows Dr. Bosanquet. Philosophically this may be 
true. I, indeed, find Dr. Bosanquet’s own views in his 
work Philosophical Theory of the State in the main satisfy- 
ing. I had myself indicated that my views might go very 
well with an idealism -in social philosophy of the type 
held by Hegelians; but as a worker in science, in genetic 
science, where facts, oppositions, dualisms, and pluralisms 
of all sorts, are the material, his formula is the purest tautol- 
ogy. What “ doth it profit” the sociologist, the statistician, 
the reformer, the observer of this invention — say the cotton- 
gin which transforms a great branch of industry — or of 
that imitation — say a lynching party following a leader — 
“to gain the whole world” —the “general will” which 
both may illustrate as identity in difference — and lose the 
soul— the concrete social somewhat which distinguishes 
the two cases! Go to the biologist in the analogous case 
and speak thusly: “Cease correlating and measuring varia- 
tions, and cease figuring out hereditary likenesses: the 
principle of life is a principle of identity in change.” + 
1In the words of Bosanquet (Mind, April, 1899, p. 175) : “no reconcilia- 
tion [between identity and difference] is needed, but the universal is unity 
manifested in difference from the beginning and throughout.” Yea, verily ! — 
but first catch your universal!

  He will reply: “Indeed, quite possibly.” But his work 
will go on, and he may say further: “It was not by your 
formula that the modern evolution theory was established, 
nor by it did Darwin discover natural selection; but the 
rather by the observation of variations, and of cases of its 
opposed principle, hereditary resemblance.” I have said 
as much in the section on Hegel’s views (Sect. 3311): 
what is wanting, to bring science to the support of philoso- 
phy, is a formulation of the actual uniformities and oppo- 
sitions, and the discovery of the processes by which these 
occur. This is the business of social psychology, on the 
one side, and of the social sciences, on the other. Social 
philosophy is ‘ another thing.’ 
Then there is biology, and with it individual psychology 
as such. These, too, are ‘other things.’ It is interesting 
to find the distinction made in Sect. 313 a (see also above, 
§ 1 of this ‘Introduction’), and covered under the terms 
“socionomic’ and ‘social,’ recognized by Comte (cf. Barth, 
Philosophie der Geschichte als Soctologie, 1., p. 33 f.). The 
neglect of it since Comte is remarkable. My critic, Pro- 
fessor Ellwood, fails to observe it, and so charges me with 
neglect of these ‘other things.’ I am not second to any- 
body in the recognition of the biological forces — of natural, 
artificial, and sexual selection, of struggle for existence, of 
competition of types and of group selection — as condition- 
ing and directing social evolution. But my work is the in- 
1It may be noted that I had gone so far (Sect. 339; see also Sect. 333) as 
to say that the philosophical supposition of a real or ‘general self’ — that is a 
truer way of speaking than of a “ general will”; truer to the facts I mean — im- 
plicit in the whole process of social organization is at least not excluded by my 
‘self-thought’ theory. Qua philosopher one might say more! — but only in a 
philosophical context. i :

vestigation of the socia/, not the socionomic: the forces 
implicit in the social movement —the uniformities, oppo- 
sitions, and processes of social change. These are always 
inside the social group, not between social groups; if be- 
tween groups, then by this very fact these become parts 
of a larger group within whose movement the social forces 
areimmanent. These ‘ other things’ belong to the sociolo- 
gist, who aims to discover all the conditions as well as all the 
properly social forces of social history ; but not to the social 
psychologist. And even then it is his business to recog- 
nize fully—what he never does!—and, in the spirit of 
Comte’s distinction, these socionomic forces as outside the 
truly social. The biologist often falls into the same con- 
fusion, calling the geographical environment and natural 
selection biological forces; but as soon as we substitute 
‘vital’ for ‘biological,’ we see his error. Professor EIl- 
wood’s criticism on this point, therefore, not only fails to 
reach home, but it illustrates what is to my mind a common 
and glaring confusion of thought (unless, indeed, it is in 
the interest of general sociology that he writes; in that 
case, apart from details, I accept, gua sociologist, most 
that he says). It is just this sort of confusion of things 
and ‘other things’ that makes this whole branch of knowl- 
edge the pseudo-science that it is in the eyes of many.! 
The same — to come closer home —is to be said as to 
the relation of individual psychology to social psychology. 
Only those mental states and processes which are ‘social,’ 
as now defined, belong to social psychology: only those 
which are, actually ave, elements —not merely condition, 
1 Professor Small, Am. Jour. of Sociology, January, 1899, 547 ff., points 
out some of the prevalent faults of method, in words with which I am in 
full agreement.

limit, advance, hinder, states that ave elements — in a whole 
which implicates more than the strictly private life of the 
one person that has them. Only these! A distinction is 
marked by the terms ‘autonomic’ or private, and ‘socio- 
nomic’ (public, social)! Groos divides the “impulses by 
which the individual wins supremacy over his own organism 
without regard to other individuals . . .” from “such 
other impulses as are directly concerned with his relations 
to others.” Not inquiring whether what is strictly private 
or autonomic actually exists, we may say that a large part 
of the individual mental life is at /east socionomic (just as 
we say above that the biological very often is); but now we 
ask, further: what part of this is truly social in the narrow 
sense of being intrinsic and essential to a social, and to 
every social, situation? This alone concerns us in treating 
of our present problem, although one might define social 
psychology more widely as including the socionomic in 
general. So much said, my reason for saying it is this: 
Professor Ellwood and others bring the charge that I do 
not allow for various of these socionomic mental processes 
by which the social life is conditioned and its direction 
determined (as for example the impulses of rivalry, acqui- 
sition, sex, the emotion of fear, etc.). Of these, I have to 
say that they are real and powerful things, and to them the 
social life may owe its direction, its variations of character, 
its forms of operation, and much beside. A writer on 
sociology must be true to psychology on all these things, 
and much of my book, as Professor Ellwood truly says, 
is devoted to them (Part III., ‘The Person’s Equipment’). 
Why then — he goes on to ask — is the psychological factor 
in social organization limited to one impulse, ‘imitation,’ 
1See my note in Groos’ Play of Man, Eng. trans., p. 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  8 Lntroduction 
and to one form of mental content, ‘thought’? The answer 
is that the doctrine does not disregard the others—the 
‘other things’ of psychology — but it finds them socionomic 
only, not intrinsically social. Sometimes they are there in 
a social change, many or few of them; sometimes they are 
not; what zs always there, the psychological thing which 
is essential and sufficient, is the sort of thought which I 
call ‘self-thought,’ and the mode of its growth and propa- 
gation, imitation. Given these, social life is possible. 
There still remains the determination of it by the other 
things, to be worked out by the sociologist. This is my 
view; and such is the reason that the true and powerful 
factors which Professor Ellwood dwells upon are not made 
more of in a work on Social Psychology.t 
To say as Professor Ellwood does that such a process 
could go on in a vacuum is—respectfully submitted ! — 
nonsense. The banks are not the river, but where is the 
river-course without banks? Chemical processes are not 
of themselves vital, but where life without H,O? Similarly 
where organic evolution without the bionomic ?— and this 
quite apart from the theory of imitation which Professor 
Ellwood is mainly criticising (and which, I may say, is 
not mine).? 
So here, as elsewhere, there is a gradation, a hierarchy, 
in science: chemistry necessary to life, but not itself of 
life; forces in the environment necessary to evolution, but 
not themselves vital; life-processes necessary to conscious- 
ness, but not themselves mental; consciousness necessary 
1 The criticism (by Ellwood and Giddings) that I here make a break in 
the evolution process is, I think, entirely without force, as I show in a later 
connection (see the new Sect. 333 a, and also Sects. 159-161).

  Introduction 9 
to society, but not all consciousness social; social con- 
sciousness necessary to social organization, but not all 
social consciousness actually in a social organization. In 
every department of science there is much that is ‘nomic’ 
(conditioning, determining, directing), but not intrinsic, to 
it. Whether or not this be accepted as a working distinc- 
tion in this case, it will nevertheless serve to show what 
the chapters ‘Social Forces,’ ‘ Social Matter and Process,’ 
and ‘Social Progress’ in this work aim to accomplish, 
and also to take point from the criticism that they do 
not recognize those ‘ other things’ which are really outside 
their scope and aim. 
A further word in this introduction on the general class 
of topics covered by the term ‘sociology’ may not be found 
irrelevant to the main subject-matter of the work. In my 
view the special social sciences furnish foundations for a 
general social science, and this latter is sociology. It deals 
(1) with the nature of the social as such: what is common 
to the special social sciences —its analytic branch —and 
(2) with the natural history of societies: the problem of 
social evolution —its genetic branch. A detailed table is 
given in my Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, art. 
‘Social Sciences,’ to show the logical and methodological 
divisions of such a general science. About the same state 
of things appears in Biology (a similar table is given in 
the same work, art. ‘ Biological Sciences,’ with the added 
authority of Professor E. B. Poulton), and the same dis- 
tinction between ‘general’ and ‘special’ is in common 
use in that branch of science. Such a ‘general’ sociology 
must be rewritten over and again, of course, with the 
progress of the ‘special’ social sciences.

THE IMITATIVE PERSON 
CHAPTER I 
Tue SELF-CONSCIOUS PERSON 
§ 1. The Dialectic of Personal Growth 
1. “One of the most interesting tendencies of the very 
young child in its responses to its environment is the ten- 
dency to recognize differences of personality. It responds 
to what have been called ‘suggestions of personality.’ As 
early as the second month it distinguishes its mother’s or 
nurse’s touch in the dark. It learns characteristic methods 
of holding, taking up, patting, and adapts itself to these 
personal variations. It is quite a different thing from the 
child’s behaviour toward things which are not persons. I 
think this is the child’s very first step toward a sense of 
the qualities which distinguish persons. The sense of 
uncertainty grows stronger and stronger in its dealings 
with persons. A person stands for a group of experiences 
quite unstable in its prophetic as it is in its historical 
meaning. This we may, for brevity of expression, assum- 
ing it to be first in order of development, call the ‘p7o- 
jective stage’ in the growth of the child’s personal 
consciousness. 
“Further observation of children shows that the instru- 
_ment of transition from such a projective to a subjective 
13
-P-A-G-E-40
  14 The Self-consctous Person 
sense of personality is the child’s active bodily self, and 
the method of it is the function of imitation. When the 
organism is ripe for the enlargement of its active range 
by new accommodations, then he begins to be dissatis- 
fied with ‘projects,’ with contemplation, and starts on his 
career of imitation. And of course he imitates persons. 
“Further, persons are bodies which move. And among 
these bodies which move, which ‘have certain projective 
attributes, a very peculiar and interesting one is his own 
body. It has connected with it certain intimate features 
which all others lack — strains, stresses, resistances, 
pains, etc., an inner felt series added to the new imita- 
tive series. But it is only when a peculiar experience 
arises which we call effort that there comes that great line 
of cleavage in his experience which indicates the rise of 
volition, and which separates off the series now first really 
subjective. What has formerly been ‘projective’ now 
becomes ‘subjective.’ This we may call the subjective 
stage in the growth of the self-notion. It rapidly assimi- 
lates to itself all the other elements by which the child’s 
own body differs in his experience from other active bodies 
—all the passive inner series of pains, pleasures, strains, 
etc. Again it is easy to see what now happens. ~The 
child’s subject sense goes out by a sort of return dia- 
lectic to illuminate the other persons. The ‘project’ of 
the earlier period is now lighted up, claimed, clothed on 
with the raiment of selfhood, by analogy with the subjec- 
tive. The subjective becomes gective; that is, other 
people’s bodies, says the child to himself, have experiences 
tn them such as mine has. They are also me’s; let them 
be assimilated to my me-copy. This is the third stage; 
the ejective, or social self, is born. 
   
-P-A-G-E-41
The Person as a Self 15 
“The ‘ego’ and the ‘alter’ are thus born together. 
Both are crude and unreflective, largely organic. And 
the two get purified and clarified together by this twofold 
reaction between project and subject, and between subject 
and eject. My sense of myself grows by imitation of 
you, and my sense of yourself grows in terms of my 
sense of myself. But ego and alter are thus essen- 
tially social; each is a sociws and each is an imitative 
creation.” 1 . 
This give-and-take between the individual and his fel- 
lows, looked at generally, we may call the Déalectic of 
Personal Growth. It serves as the point of departure 
for the main positions developed in the following pages. 
§ 2. The Person as a Self 
2. The outcome serves to afford a point of departure 
for the view which we may entertain of the person as he 
appears to himself in society. If it be true, as much evi- 
dence goes to show, that what the person thinks as him- 
self is a pole or terminus at.one end of an opposition in 
the sense of personality generally, and that the other pole 
or terminus is the thought he has of the other person, the 
‘alter,’ then it is impossible to isolate his thought of himself 
at any time and say that in thinking of himself he is not

has been taken by Royce (Good and Evil, Preface, and Chaps. VII., VIII.) ; and 
it is followed now (1901) by Stout, Man. of Psychol. ; Mezes, Ethics ; Ormond, 
Foundations of Knowledge, etc. Cf. also Avenarius, Der menschl. Welthegriff.

parallels suggested by Héffding and Avenarius, see Appendix F,

essentially thinking of the alter also.1 What he calls him- 
self now is in large measure an incorporation of elements 
that, at an earlier period of his thought of personality, he 
called some one else. The acts now possible to himself, 
and so used by him to describe himself in thought to him- 
self, were formerly only possible to the other; but by imi- 
tating that other he has brought them over to the opposite 
pole, and found them applicable, with a richer meaning and 
a modified value, as true predicates of himself also. If he 
thinks of himself in any particular past time, he can single _ 
out what was then he, as opposed to what has since become 
he; and the residue, the part of him that has since become 
he, that was then only thought of —if it was thought of 
as an attribute of personality at all—as attaching to some 
one with whom he was acquainted. |For example, last 
year I thought of my friend W. as a man who had great 
skill on the bicycle and who wrote readily on the type- 
writer; my sense of his personality included these accom- 
plishments, in what I have called a ‘projective’ way. My 
sense of myself did not have these elements, except as my 
thought of my normal capacity to acquire delicate move- 
ments was comprehensive. But now, this year, I have 
learned to do both these things. I have taken the ele- 
ments formerly recognized in W.’s personality, and by imi- 
tative learning brought them over to myself. I now think 
of myself as one who rides a ‘wheel’ and writes on a 
‘machine.’ But I am able to think of myself thus only 
as my thought includes, in a way now called ‘subjective,’ 
1 In isolating the ‘ thought elements’ in the self, I do not, of course, deny the 
organic sensation and feeling elements; but for our present purposes the lat- 
ter may be neglected. I add, in Appendix E, short notices of positions taken 
by Bradley and Royce, which may serve as an introduction to a more complete 
view on the psychology of self-consciousness.
-P-A-G-E-43
  The. Person as a Self 17 
the personal accomplishments of W., and with him of the 
more or less generalized alter which in this illustration we 
have taken him to stand for. So the truth we now learn 
is this: that very many of the particular marks which I 
now call mine, when I think of myself, have had just this 
origin. I have first found them in my social environment, 
and by reason of my social and imitative disposition, have 
transferred them to myself by trying to act as if they were 
true of me, and so coming to find out that they are true 
of me. And further, all the things I hope to learn, to ac- 
quire, to become, all —if I think of them in a way to have 
any clear thought of my possible future —are now, before 
I acquire them, possible elements of my thought of others, 
of the social alter, or of what considered generally we may 
call the ‘ socius.’ 
But we should also note that what has been said of the 
one pole of this dialectical relation, the pole of self, is 
equally true of the other also—the pole represented by 
the other person, the alter. What do I have in mind when 
I think of him as a person? Evidently I must construe 
him, a person, in terms of what I think of myself, the only 
person whom I know in the intimate way we call ‘subjec- 
tive.” I cannot say that my thought of my friend W. is 
exhausted by the movements of wheel-riding and typewrit- 
ing; nor of any collection of such acts, considered for 
themselves. Back of it all there is the attribution of the 
very fact of subjectivity which I have myself. And the sub- 
jectivity of him — it is just like that of me. I constantly 
enrich the actions which were at first his alone, and then 
became mine by imitation of him, with the meaning, the 
rich subjective value, the interpretation in terms of private
-P-A-G-E-44
  18 The Self-conscious Person 
ownership, which my appropriation of them in the first 
instance from him, has enabled me to make. So my 
thought of any other man— or all other men —is, to the 
richest degree, that which I understand of myself, together 
with the uncertainties of interpretation which my further 
knowledge of his acts enables me to conjecture. I think 
him rational, emotional, volitional, as I am;1! and the de- 
tails of his more special characteristics, as far as I under- 
stand them at all, I weave out of possible actions of my 
own, when circumstances call me out in similar ways. 
But there is always the sense that there is more to under- 
stand about him; for, as we have seen, he constantly, by i 
the diversities between us which I do not yet comprehend, 
sets me new actions to imitate or to avoid in my own 
growth. 
So the dialectic may be read thus: my thought of self is 
in the main, as to its character as a personal self, filled up 
with my thought of others, distributed variously as indi- 
viduals ; and my thought of others, as persons, is mainly 
filled up with myself. In other words, but for certain 
minor distinctions in the filling, and for certain compelling 
distinctions between that which is immediate and that which 
is objective, the ego and the alter are to our thought one and 
the same thing. 
3. I do not care in this connection to track out the dis- 
tinction between the subjective or immediate and the 
objective; nor to ask what it is that sets the bounds in 
fact to the person. What concerns us is independent of 
these inquiries, having to do with the question: What is 
1 Even temporary affective experiences tend to be ‘ ejected.” When I have 
a headache I cannot see a person riding, jumping, etc., without attributing to 
him the throbbing which such actions would produce in my own head.  
-P-A-G-E-45
The Person as a Self 19 
in consciousness when one thinks of himself or of another 
person? This, it is evident, is a sufficient introduction to 
a number of questions of high social import ; for we may 
ask: When a man asserts himself, what is it that he really 
asserts? When he sympathizes with another, what exactly 
is that ‘other’? And how do all the emotions, and desires, 
and mental movements of whatever kind which pass through 
his consciousness involve others who are in social connection 
with him? I claim, indeed, that it is just this kind of in- 
quiries that most concern the social theorist just now, and 
with him the political thinker; and the vagueness and 
cross-firing which prevail in some of the discussions of 
these men are due in great part to inadequate analysis 
of the psychological concepts which they use. 
To get such inquiries down to a psychological basis, the 
first requisite is to be reached in the concept of the per-~ 
son. Not the person as we look at him in action, alone, or 
chiefly ; but the person as he thinks of himself. We con- 
stantly presume to tell him what his chief end is, what as 
an individual he most desires, what his selfish nature urges 
him to, and what self-sacrifices he is willing to make in 
this circumstance or that. We endeavour to reach a theory 
of ‘value’ based on a calculus of the desire of one individual 
to gratify his individual wants, multiplied into the number 
of such individuals. Or we take a group of individuals 
together as we find them in society and ask how it is that 
these individuals could have come together. All this with- 
out so much as consulting the single person psychologi- 
cally as to the view he has of his own social life, his 
opportunities, and his obligations! The average individual 
would be ‘scared’ within an inch of his life if he were for a 
moment obliged to put up with the kind of existence which 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
20 The Self-conscious Person 
  such theorists assume him to live ; and he would be para- 
lyzed into permanent inertia if he had to effect by his 
conscious efforts what they teach us he works out. Even 
the later psychological sociologists, as notably M. Tarde, 
treat ‘beliefs’ and ‘desires’ as ultimate self-existent things 
apart from the content of thought to which they are func- 
tionally attached. 
4. To bring our development of the sense of personal- 
ity, therefore, into view of these questions, let us inquire 
briefly into one of the main points in the theory of society 
which recent discussion has tended to formulate. This 
point is that which concerns the ‘interests’ of the individ- 
ual. What are the interests of the individual, and how 
do they stand related to the interests of the community, 
state, social group, in which the individual lives ?? 
Popularly, a man’s interests are those aspects of possible 
fortune which are best for him. What is thus best for 
him is in the main what he wants; but the two classes 
are not always identical. Yet for the sake of making our 
point more plain in the sequel, suppose we begin by defin- 
ing a man’s interest as that which he wants, and is willing 
to put forth some endeavour to obtain. Then let us see 
how this tends to involve the man’s self, and the selves of 
those who are associated with him. 
If the analysis given above be true, then what a man 
thinks of as himself, is in large measure identical with what 
he thinks of as another, or the others in general. So the 
ejecting of the thought of ‘person,’ which, when looked ‘at 
1 This discussion of ‘Interests,’ which has already been printed (Aonist, 
April, 1897), is inserted here to illustrate the general application of the topic in 
social theory. It may be turned to again when the reader has read the chap- 
ters on ‘Sanction’ (IX., X.). The psychology of ‘Interest’ is treated in 
Thought and Things, I., Chaps. III., VII. (§ 1-2), XI. (§ 6). 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  The Person as a Self 21 
subjectively, he calls ‘myself,’ into ‘another,’ — this quali- 
fies that other to be clothed on with all the further predi- 
cates found to attach to the self. The so-called love of 
self, it is evident, is such a predicate; it is a description 
of the attitude which the man takes to himself; a sort of 
reaction of part of his nature upon another part. When 
he is proud, it is because the qualities by which he repre- 
sents himself to himself are such that they arouse his 
approbation. When he thinks, therefore, of the other in 
terms of the same predicates, he has to react, in some 
degree, with the same sense of approval. 
When, likewise, I go farther in thought and say, “ being 
such and such a person, it is my interest to have such 
or such a fate,” I must perforce — that is, by the very same 
mental movement which gives the outcome in my own 
case —attribute to the other the same deserts and the 
same fate. Viewed psychologically, we should say that the 
predicate is a function of the content which we call self, 
and that, so far as the content is the same, the predicate 
must be the same. But this sense of equal interest, desert, 
because of identical position in the evolution of selves, 
what is this but, in the abstract, the sense of justice, and 
in the concrete, the feeling of sympathy with the other? 
The very concept of interests, when one considers it with 
reference to himself, necessarily involves others, therefore, 
on very much the same footing as oneself. One’s inter- 
ests, the things he wants in life, are the things which, by 
the very same thought, he allows others, also, the right 
‘to want; and if he insists upon the gratification of his 
own wants at the expense of the legitimate wants of the 
‘other,’ then he in so far does violence to his sympathies 
and to his sense of justice. And this in turn must impair
-P-A-G-E-48
  22 The Self-conscious Person ‘ 
his satisfaction. For the very gratification of himself thus 
secured must, if it be accompanied with any reflection at 
all, involve the sense of the other's gratification also; and 
since this conflicts with ‘the ‘fact, a degree of discomfort 
must normally arise in mind varying with the develop- 
ment which the self has attained in the dialectical process 
described above. 
5. Or suppose we look at the case a little differently. 
Let us say that the sense of self always involves the sense 
of the other. And this sense of the other is but that of 
another ‘self,’ where the word ‘self’ is equivalent to myself, 
and the meaning of the word ‘other’ is that which prevents 
it from being myself. Now my point is that much of what 
I fancy, hope, desire holds for self in general, without dis- 
tinction as to which self it is; it remains the same whether 
I do actually qualify it by the word ‘my’ or by the word 
‘your.’ Psychologically there is a great mass of motor 
attitudes and reactive expressions, felt in consciousness as 
emotion and desire, which are common to the self-thought 
everywhere. 
6. This is true just in so far as there is a certain typical 
other self whose relation to me has been that of the give- 
and-take by which the whole development of a sense of 
self of any kind has been made possible. And we find 
certain distinctions at different stages of the development* 
which serve to throw the general idea of the social relation- 
ship into clearer light. 
Let us look at the life of the child with especial refer- 
ence to his attitudes to those around him; taking the 
most common case, that of a child in a family of children. 
We find that such a child shows, in the very first stages 
of his sense of himself as a being of rights, duties, etc., a
-P-A-G-E-49
    The Person as a Self 23 
very imitative nature. He is mainly occupied with the 
business of learning about himself, other people, and nat- 
ure. /“ Hie imitates everything, being a veritable copying- 
machine. He spends the time not given to imitating 
others very largely in practising in his games what he has 
picked up by his imitations, and in the exploiting of these 
accomplishments. His two dominating characteristics are 
a certain slavishness, on the one hand, in following all 
examples set around him; and then, on the other hand, 
a certain bold aggressiveness, inventiveness, a showing- 
off, in the use he makes of the things he learns. 
But it does not take very extended observation to con- 
vince us that this difference in his attitudes is not a con- 
tradiction: that the attitudes themselves terminate upon 
different determinations of self. The child imitates his 
elders, not from choice, but from his need of adaptation 
to the social environment; for it is his elders who know 
more than he does, and who act in more complex ways. 
But he is less often aggressive toward his elders ; that is, 
toward those who have the character of command, direc- 
tion, and authority over him. His aggressions are directed 
mainly toward his brothers and sisters; and even as 
toward them, he shows very striking discriminative selec- 
tion of those upon whom it is safe to aggress. In short, 
it is plain that the difference in attitude really indicates 
differences in his thought, corresponding to differences in 
the elements of the child’s social environment. We may 
suppose the persons about him divided roughly into two 
classes: those from whom he learns, and those on whom 
he practises; and then we see that his actions are ac- 
counted for as adaptations toward these, in his personal 
development.
-P-A-G-E-50
  24 The Self-conscious Person 
The facts covered by this distinction — probably the 
first general social distinction in the child’s career —are 
very interesting. The stern father of the family is at the 
extreme end of the class he reveres with a shading of fear. 
The little brother and sister stand at the other extreme; 
they are the fitting instruments of his aggression, the 
practice of his strength, the assertion of his agency and 
importance. The mother usually stands midway, it seems, 
serving to unite the two aspects of personality in the 
youngster’s mind. And it is pretty clear, when the case 
is closely studied, that the child has, as it were, two 
ways of thinking of her, according as she on occasion 
falls into one or the other of these classes. He learns 
when, in what circumstances, she will suffer him to assert 
himself, and when she will require him to be docile and 
teachable. And although she is for the most part a 
teacher and example, yet on occasion he takes liberties 
with the teacher. 
Now what does this mean, this sorting out, so to speak, 
of the persons of the family? It means a great deal when 
looked at in the light of the ‘dialectical movement’ in the 
development of personality. And I may state my inter- 
pretation of it at the outset. 
7. The child’s sense of himself is, as we have seen, one 
pole of a relation ; and which pole it is to be, depends on 
the particular relation which the other pole, over which 
the child has no control, calls on it to be. If the other 
person involved presents uncertain, ominous, dominating, 
instructive features, or novel imitative features, then the 
self is ‘subject’ over against what is ‘projective.’ He recog- 
nizes new elements of personal suggestion not yet accom- 
modated to. His consciousness is in the learning attitude ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  The Person as a Self 25 
he imitates, he serves, he trembles, he is a slave. But on 
the other hand, there are persons to whom his attitude 
has a right to be different. In the case of these the dia- 
lectic has gone further. He has mastered all their features, 
he can do himself what they do, he anticipates no new 
developments in his intercourse with them; so he ‘ejects’ 
them, as the psychological expression is: for an ‘eject’ isa 
consciousness thought of as having only those elements in 
it which the individual who thinks of that consciousness is 
able, out of his own store of experience, to read into it. 
It is ejective to him, for he makes it what he will, in a 
sense. Now this is what the brothers and sisters, notably 
the younger ones, are to our youthful hero. They are his 
‘ejects’; he knows them by heart, they have no thoughts, 
they do no deeds, which he could not have read into them 
by anticipation. So he despises them, practises his supe- 
rior activities on them, tramples them under foot. 
8. Now at this earliest stage in his unconscious classifi- 
cation of the elements of his personal world, it is clear 
that any attempt to describe the child’s interests —the 
things which he wants, as we have agreed to define 
‘interests’ —as selfish, generous, or as falling in any cate- 
gory of developed social significance, is quite beside the 
mark. If we say that to be selfish is to try to get all the 
personal gratification possible, we find that he does this 
only part of the time; and even on these occasions, not 
because he has any conscious preference for that style of 
conduct, but merely because his consciousness is then 
filled with the particular forms of personal relationship — 
the presence of his little sister, etc.—which normally 
issue in the more habitual actions which are termed 
‘aggressive’ in our social terminology. His action is only
-P-A-G-E-52
    
26 The Self-conscious Person 
the motor side of a certain collection of elements. He 
acts that way, then, simply because it is natural for him 
to practise the functions which he has found useful. We 
see that it is natural; and on the basis of its naturalness, 
we are prone to call him selfish by nature.! 
But that this is arguing beyond our facts— really argu- 
ing on the strength of the psychological ignorance of our 
hearers, and our own —is clear when we turn the child 
about and bring him into the presence of the other class 
of persons to whom we have seen him taking up a special 
attitude. We have but to observe him in the presence of 
his father, usually, or of some one else whom he habit- 
ually imitates and from whom he learns the lessons of life, 
to find out that he is just as pre-eminently social, docile, 
accommodating, centred-outwardly, so to speak, as before 
we considered him unsocial, aggressive, and self-centred. 
If we saw him only in these latter circumstances, we 
should say possibly that he was by nature altruistic, most 
responsive to generous suggestion, teachable in the ex- 
treme. But here the limitation is the same as in the for- 
mer case. He is not altruistic in any high social sense, 
nor consciously yielding to suggestions of response which 
require the repression of his selfishness. As a matter of 
fact, he is simply acting himself out ; and in just the same 
natural way as on the occasion of his apparent selfishness. 
But it is now a different thought which is acting itself out. 
The self is now at the receptive pole. It is made up of 
elements which are inadequate to a translation of the alter 
at the other pole of the relationship now established. 
1A good instance of this inadequacy of statement from a psychological 
point of view, is seen in Professor J. Sully’s grave discussion as to whether 
infants are naturally immoral or not (Studies of Childhood, Chap. VIL).  
-P-A-G-E-53
  The Person as a Self 27 
The child’s sense of self is now not that of a relatively 
completed self in relation to the alter before him; it 
was that in the earlier case, and the aggression of which 
he was then guilty showed as much. Now he feels his 
lack of adequate means of response to the personality 
before him. He cannot anticipate what the father will 
do next, how long approbation will smile upon him, what 
the reasons are for the changes in the alter-personality. 
So it is but to state a psychological truism to say that his 
conduct will be different in this case. Yet from the fact 
that the self of this social state is also in a measure a 
regular pole of the dialectic of personal growth, it often 
tempts the observer to classify the whole child, on the 
strength of this one attitude, in some one category of 
social and political description. 
g. I do not see, in short, how the personality of this 
child can be expressed in any but social terms; nor how, 
on the other hand, social terms can get any content of 
value but from the understanding of the developing 
individual. This is a circle in the process of growth; and 
that is just my point.! On the one hand, we can get no 
doctrine of society but by getting the psychology of the 
‘socius’ with all his natural history; and on the other hand, 
we can get no true view of the ‘socius’ at any time without 
describing the social conditions under which he normally 
lives, with the history of their action and reaction upon 
him. Or to put the outcome in the terms of the restric- 
tion which we have imposed upon ourselves, —the only 
way to get a solid basis for social theory based upon 
human want or desire, is to work out first a descriptive 
and genetic psychology of desire in its social aspects; and 
on the other hand, the only way to get an adequate psy- 
1 Not a logical circle, of course; see Appendix K, 11.
-P-A-G-E-54
28 The Self-conscious Person 
chological view of the rise and development of desire in 
its social aspects, is by a patient tracing of the conditions 
of social environment in which the child and the race 
have lived and which they have grown up to reflect. 
10. But the observation of the child shows us that we 
may carry our discrimination of his personal attitudes far- 
ther along the same lines. We have found him classifying 
his companions and associates by the shadings of con- 
duct which his spontaneous adaptations of himself show; 
yielding to some and studying them mainly by imitation, 
abusing others and asserting himself against them aggres- 
sively. This distinction gets a wider development as his 
experience goes on accumulating. As was hinted in the 
case of his attitude to his mother, one person may come 
to have for him the force of several, or of both of the two 
great classes of persons. Sometimes he tyrannizes over 
his mother and finds her helpless ; at other times he finds 
her far from submitting to tyranny, and then he takes 
the réle of learner and obedient boy. Now the further 
advance which he makes in the general sense of the social 
situation as a whole, is in the line of carrying the same 
adaptability of attitude into his relation to each of the 
persons whom he knows. Just as he himself is sometimes 
one person and again another, sometimes the learner, the 
altruist, the unselfish pupil, and then again the egoist, the 
selfish aggressor; so he continues the dialectical process 
by making this also ‘ejective’ to him. He reads the same 
possibility of personal variation back into the alter also. 
He comes to say to himself in effect: he, my father, has 
his moods just as I have. He, no less than I, cannot 
be adequately considered all-suffering or all-conquering. 
Sometimes he also is at one pole of the self-dialectic,
-P-A-G-E-55
  The Person as a Self 29 
sometimes at the other. And so is my mother, and my 
brother and sister, as they grow older, — indeed, so are 
all men. 
So it then becomes his business not to classify persons, 
but to classify actions. He sees that any person may, 
with some few exceptions, act in either way: any person 
may be his teacher or his slave, on occasion. So his next 
step in social adaptation is his adaptation to occasions ; to 
the groups of social conditions in which one or the other 
class of actions may be anticipated from people generally. 
And he makes great rough classes in which to put his 
‘ejects’ — the read-out personalities about him —accord- 
ing to his expectations of treatment from them. He learns 
the signs of wrath, of good humour, of sorrow; of joy, 
hope, love, jealousy ; giving them the added interpretation 
all the time which his own imitation of them enables him 
to make by realizing what they mean in his own experi- 
ence. And so he gets himself equipped with that extraor- 
dinary facility of transition from one attitude to another 
in his responses to those about him, which all who are 
familiar with children will have remarked. 
11. Now all these changes have meaning only as we 
realize the fact of the social dialectic, which is the same 
through it all. There are changes of attitude simply and 
only because, as the psychologist would express it, there 
are changes in the content of his sense of self. In more 
popular terms: he changes his attitude in each case be- 
cause the thing called another, the alter, changes. His 
father is his object; and the object is the ‘father,’ as the 
child thinks him, on this occasion and under these circum- 
stances, right out of his own consciousness. The father- 
thought is a part of the child’s present social situation ;
-P-A-G-E-56
  Bor The Self-conscious Person 
and this situation in the child’s mind issues in the attitude 
which is appropriate to it. If it be the father in wrath, 
the situation produces such a father out of the child’s 
available social thought-material ; and the presence of the 
combination in the child’s mind itself issues in the docile, 
fearful attitude. But if it then turn into the jovial father, 
the child does not then himself set about reversing his 
attitude. No, the father-thought is now a different father- 
thought, and of itself issues in the child’s attitude of play- 
ful aggression, rebellion, or disobedience. The growing 
child is able to think of self in varying terms as varying 
social situations impress themselves upon him; so these 
varying thoughts of self, when made real in the persons of 
others, call out, by the regular process of motor discharge, 
each its own appropriate attitude. 
But see, in this more subtle give-and-take of elements 
for the building up of the social sense, how inextricably 
interwoven the ego and the alter really are! The develop- 
ment of the child’s personality could not go on at all with- 
out the constant modification of his sense of himself by 
suggestions from others. So he himself, at every stage, 
is really in part some one else, even in his own thought 
of himself. And then the attempt to get the alter stript 
from elements contributed directly from his present 
thought of himself is equally futile. He thinks of the 
other, the alter, as his socéws, just as he thinks of himself 
as the other’s socéws: and the only thing that remains 
more or less stable, throughout the whole growth, is the 
fact that there is a growing sense of self which includes 
both terms, the ego and the alter. 
In short, the real self is the bipolar self, the social self, 
the socius. 
   
-P-A-G-E-57
The Person as a Self 31 
12. If we think it worth while again to raise the 
question as to what such a self pursues when, as we say, 
he identifies his interests with his wants, the answer is 
just as before. The growing subtlety of the dialectical 
process has not changed the values which the elements 
represent to the child. What he wants in each circum- 
stance is expressed by his attitude in that circumstance. 
It changes with change of circumstance. He is now a 
creature of burning self-assertion, eager to ‘kill and destroy 
in all God’s holy mountain’; and presto! change, he is now 
the ‘lion lying down beside the lamb.’ His wants are not 
at all consistent. They are in every case the outcome of 
the social situation; and it is absurd to endeavour to express 
the entire body of his wants as a fixed quantity under such 
a term of description as ‘selfish,’ or ‘generous,’ or other, 
which has reference to one class only of the varied situa- 
tions of his life. 
So far, therefore, in our search for a definition of the 
interests of the individual, in relation to his social envi- 
ronment, we find a certain outcome. His wants are a 
function of the social situation as a whole. The social 
influences which are working in upon him are potent to 
modify his wants, no less than are the innate tendencies 
of his personal nature to issue in such wants. The char- 
acter which he shows actively at any time is due to these 
two factors in union. One of them is no more himself 
than the other. He is the outcome of ‘habit’ and ‘sug- 
gestion,’ as psychology would say in its desire to express 
everything by single wotds. Social suggestion is the sum 
of the social influences which he takes in and incorporates 
in himself when he is in the receptive, imitative, attitude  
-P-A-G-E-58
  32 The Self-conscious Person 
to the alter; habit is the body of formed material, already 
cast in the mould of a self, which he brings up for self- 
assertion and aggression, when he stands at the other pole 
of the relation to the alter, and exhibits himself as a bully, 
a tyrant, or at least, as master of his own conduct. Of 
course his personal hereditary characteristics are on this 
latter side in so far as they are of an anti-social sort. And 
the social unit of desire, as far as the individual is taken 
as the measure of it, in any society, is the individual’s rela- 
tively fixed conduct, considered as reflecting his interpre- 
tation of the current social modes of life. 
13. It is easy to discern in the behaviour of the child, 
from about five years old, the blending of these two in- 
fluences. Two children in the same family may differ 
possibly by all the width of the distinction current in 
psychology by the terms ‘sensory versus motor’ in their 
types or dispositions; and yet we may see in them the 
influence of the common environment. One acts at once 
on the example of the father; the other reflects upon it, 
seems to understand it, and then finally acts upon what 
he thinks it means. The motor child learns by acting; 
the sensory child learns and tests his learning by subse- 
quent action. But both end by getting the father’s essen- 
tial conduct learned. Both modify the thought of self by 
the new elements drawn from the father; and act out the 
new self thus created; but each shows the elements dif- 
ferently interpreted in a synthesis with the character 
which he already had. 
Or take the same process of iricorporating elements of 
1 Guyau makes the interesting remark that even though we were purely 
egoistic we should still learn to love, simply through response to the appear- 
ance of love in others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
The Person as a Self 33 
social suggestion as they are absorbed respectively by a 
boy and a girl of about the same age. The difference 
of sex is a real and fundamental difference, on the side of 
what is called ‘endowment’; so we should expect that the 
same social suggestions given the two would be taken up 
differently by them, and show different interpretations 
when the child of one sex or the other comes to act upon 
them. The boy is generally more aggressive, more prone 
to fall into the self-pole of high confidence in his own abil- 
ities. We find him refusing certain forms of suggestion — 
say those coming from a female nurse — which the little 
girl readily responds to. Furthermore, the boy is capa- 
ble, just for the same reason, of standing up to the 
rougher elements of his social s/éeu which only frighten 
and paralyze his sister. And when the same suggestion 
is given to the boy and girl together, the former is likely 
to use it wherewith to exercise himself upon animals, etc., 
while the girl is more likely to use the new act strictly in 
an imitative way, repeating the actual conduct of others.! 
But apart from the attempt to reduce the forms of 
active interpretation to general classes, it is enough here 
to point out the extraordinary variety which the same 
suggestions take on in the active interpretations by differ- 
ent children; and to point out with it the need of recog- 
nizing the fact that in this interpretation by the child 
there is always the fusion of the old self with the new 
elements coming in from the selves external to it. Every 
conscious interpretation of human action is, I think, essen- 
tially of this kind. We think the deeds of others as we 
bring ourselves up to the performance of similar deeds; 
1 Of course, we can only say ‘ more likely’ in any single instance, and in the 
other distinctions between boys and girls as well. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  34 The Self-conscious Person 
and we do the deeds of others only as we ourselves are 
able to think them. In the case of the young child in 
the family, we may often tell how far he is learning cor- 
rectly ; also the particular alter from whom he has taken 
his lesson. But in the larger social whole of adult life 
both elements are so complex —the solidified self of the 
individual’s history is so fixed, and the social suggestions 
of the community are so varied and conflicting —that 
the outcome of the fusion, in a particular instance, is a 
thing which no man can prophesy. 
14. So much for the individual child and his growing 
social personality. We see in a measure what his inter- 
ests are; that is, what elements go to make his interests 
up. Let us now turn to the rest of the family in which 
he lives and briefly state the same inquiry in respect to 
them, thus carrying one step further the growth of the 
social self. 
Waiving the inquiry into the interests of the family 
group as a whole, that is, the question of objective inter- 
ests apart from actual want or desire (as we did in the 
earlier case), our question is now about this: What can be 
said of the wants of the other individuals of the family in 
which the young hero, whose life we have so far described, 
lives and exploits himself? This seems to be answered, 
certainly in part, by the consideration that they have each 
been through the same process of growth in securing the 
notion of self, both the ego-self and the alter-self, that he 
has. Each has been a child. Each has imitated some 
persons and assaulted others. So, of course, of the other 
children in the family; for they are the very specimens 
of the alter which have furnished to the hero his ‘socii’ 
all the way through. So we have only to make them one  
-P-A-G-E-61
  The Person as a Self 35 
by one hero in turn to see that then all the others be- 
come ‘socii’; and the group development replaces the in- 
dividual development. Even the parents are in great 
measure capable of the same interpretation; since they 
have furnished the largest amount of personal suggestion 
to all the children: and the children, in imitating one 
another, aggressing upon one another, etc., are really 
perpetuating the features of social life which characterize 
the parents’ lives. No family, of course, lives in such iso- 
lation as to be in any sense obliged to support itself upon 
its own social stock from one generation to another; and 
there is the further modifying influence spoken of above 
of the peculiar interpretations given to his social sug- 
gestions by each child. But apart from the personal 
form in which the family suggestions are worked over 
by each child, we may say that the material of the social 
life of the family is largely common stock for all the mem- 
bers of the family. 
This means that the alter to each ego is largely common 
to them all; and that what ‘has been said of the wants of 
the ego being not egoistic in the selfish sense, nor gener- 
ous in the altruistic sense, but general in the social sense, 
holds of the family group as a whole. What each child 
wants for himself, he wants more or less consciously for 
each member of his family. While he may assault his 
brother, viewing him as an alter to practise on in certain 
circumstances, how soon he turns in his defence in the 
presence of the alter foreign to them both, when the larger 
social ego of both swells within his breast! What boy 
among boys, what school-fellow among his companions,

  36 The Self-conscious Person 
what Rob Roy surrounded by the clan has not felt the 
socius, the common self of the group, come in to drive out 
the narrower ego of his relatively private life within the 
group? This is not to say that the interests of the group 
may not be more clearly seen by one member than by 
others, nor that direct conflicts may not arise in which 
some one ego will refuse to yield to the demands of the 
socius of the group. Those things may well be, and are. 
To say the contrary would be to say that the development 
of all the individuals was equal. For if each has his ego 
and his alter only by the assimilation of suggestions, then 
the amount of assimilation, of progressive learning of the 
possibilities and relationships of conduct, must indicate 
what the sense of social good is to each. His insistence 
on his interpretation, however, is no more egoistic and 
selfish than is the insistence by the other members of the 
family on a different line of conduct. His double self, 
giving the socius, may be in advance of theirs or behind, 
but it arises in just the same way ; and it is just his social 
nature which may compel him to fight for what seems to 
be a private and selfish interest. 
Apart from the apparent exceptions — not really such — 
now noted, we may say, therefore, that the interests of the 
family group are reflected in the wants of each member of 
the group. Hatred of society, in this primitive form of 
society, is pathological, —if indeed it be possible. Nothing 
but an upheaval of the foundations of personality can eradi- 
cate the sense of social solidarity in every child in a family. 
And the ultimate sanction for family life and its only per- 
manent safeguard is here. No legal provisions could have 
originated the family, no personal conventions advanced it, 
nor can it be endangered by foes from without. Nothing 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  The Person as a Self 37 
but the kind of suggestion in education which would re- 
place the sort of socius represented in the family, by 
another sort, through the same process of identification 
of the self with its alter all the way through the history of 
the growth of personality, could affect it materially one 
way or the other.! 
15. The family is, of course, the first place in which the 
child finds food for his own personal assimilation; but he 
does not long limit himself to the family diet. Nor is he 
from his early months entirely shut up to suggestions from 
within the family circle. His nurse comes in to stand as 
a memiber of his social company, and often the most im- 
portant member from the point of view of the regularity 
and intimate character of her ministrations. She is part 
of the family to all intents and purposes. And other 
children from abroad who come often or at critical times 
to play, etc., are also ‘in it.’ Then again certain actual 
members of the home circle may see the child so seldom 
or in such a passing way that they practically are not, as 
far as the child’s personal growth is concerned. So while 
the family is the theatre of this first stage of his growth, 
it still represents a rather flexible set of personal influences. 
1 Moreover, it is just this fact of identity of personal and family interests 
which is responsible for the rise of the family considered from an evolution 
point of view. Animal families, if they are to survive as families, must, be 
made up of individuals having ingrained in their instinctive life the social 
qualities which make the animal’s own struggle for existence at once also a 
struggle for the existence of the family group as such; just as the child, in his 
personal growth, must become a person by becoming a socius. To separate 
the two in the child is to annihilate the individual person: just so to eradicate 
the family instinct in the animal is to destroy his private chance for survival, 
or if not that, at least to prevent the raising, and perhaps the very birth, of a 
second generation. The child in getting to be a person uses social means to 
that end in his life-history; and the animal in getting to be a species by natu- 
ral selection in race-history survives by his use of the same means, 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  38 The Self-conscious Person 
And his circle grows as he comes to have other rela. 
tionships than those of his immediate and domestic life. 
When he begins to go to the kindergarten or school, the 
teacher in the first instance, then the pupils beside him 
there, or some of them, come to bear on his life in the 
same way that his family companions do. So gradually 
he widens out the sphere of the exploitation of his two 
selves — the receptive self, and no less, the aggressive self. 
In all the stretch of early childhood, pet animals, dolls, 
toys, etc., also play a part, especially as giving him now 
and then a more or less complete alter on which to wreak 
the performance of the new acts recently learned. And 
as he grows a little older, and the sense of personal agency 
arises to play its great part in the development of his ac- 
tivities, all mechanical tools, contrivances, building-blocks, 
sliced animals, etc., are valuable aids to the exercise of his 
understanding of the powers of himself and of others. 
In this expansion of his interests — and with it, his en- 
larging sense of the sphere of personality realized in him- 
self and in others, gradual as it is —— we may mark off certain 
dividing lines. We may always say, no matter what the 
details of the boy’s daily life are, that there is a circle 
within which his socius resides, understanding socius as 
we have above. His socius—to repeat—is the higher 
sense of commonalty, personal implication, mutual inter- 
est, which social intercourse arouses in him. This is 
always alive when events occur which involve persons 
in a larger or smaller circumference drawn about him. 
He has the sense of a socius, for example, when his own 
school is brought into rivalry with the school around the 
corner. A fellow-member of his own school may be 
bullied in the school ; that is an occurrence having only a  
-P-A-G-E-65
  The Person as a Self 39 
one-sided importance in the economy of the school. The 
bullying may be deserved. At any rate, his intra-social 
sense gives the other and older boy in the school the right 
to bully the younger, though the younger be himself. He 
is willing even to ‘fag’ in his own school. All this is a 
part of the peculiar development which his socius has had 
in its internal progress. But let the bullying be done by 
a boy from the other school,—however just it be and 
however powerless he be to prevent it, —he is in arms at 
once. The other school is outside the circumference of 
his present social circle. 
But a little later we find that we may draw a wider line. 
Let him come into some sort of relationship with the 
street-boys who represent no school at all; and let these 
strangers attempt to bully his enemies of the other school 
around the corner, and observe how the interests of the 
rival school at once become his own. His general school- 
socius is now active. And it includes all boys who go to 
school. And it would be only a matter of detail —inter- 
esting, it is true —to follow our little hero in the develop- 
ment of his socius into the broader fields of universal 
human interest; that is, if he be a boy who ever does get 
interests which may be called universal. 
That, however, may wait until we are better prepared 
to estimate those interests ; for the present, we may try to 
understand the case in the narrower circles of observation. 
And before we pass from the family circle, — before the 
boy gets out of his early imitative stage of self-develop- 
ment, —we find another incident of his growth which is to 
him of untold importance. I refer to the rise and develop- 
ment of his ethical sense. What shall we say of this, as 
to its origin and as to its meaning in the social life?
-P-A-G-E-66
  40 The Self-conscious Person 
§ 3. The Person as an Ethical Self 
16. Looking back over the path we have already 
travelled, we see the two poles of the dialectic now 
familiar to us, standing prominently out: the child has, 
on one hand, a self which he ejects into the alter. This 
is the solidified mass of personal material which he has 
worked into a systematic whole by his series of acts. 
When he thinks of himself, this is very largely what his 
consciousness is filled with. Let us now call this the ‘self 
of habit,’ or the ‘habitual self,’ — terms which are common 
and which carry their ordinary meaning. But, on the 
other hand, we have found that the child has another self : 
the self that learns, that imitates, that accommodates to 
new suggestions from persons in the family and elsewhere. 
It is this self that is in part yet ‘projective,’ unfinished, 
constantly being modified by the influences outside, and, 
in turn, passing the new things learned over to the self of 
habit. Let us call this, for reasons also evident from the 
common significance of the term, the ‘accommodating self.’ 
Not that the child has at any time two distinct thoughts of 
himself existing side by side, — that is not true, — but that 
his one thought of self at any time is at one or the other 
pole, is a self of habit or a self of accommodation, Which 
it is to be, depends upon what kind of an alter is then at 
the other pole. But I trust this is now clear.” 
It is a further result that if we continue to ask at any 
time for a complete notion from outside of that boy’s self, 
we cannot say that either the self of habit or the self of 
1 The substance of this paragraph has been printed in the Philosophical 
Review, May, 1897. 
2 In reality these so-called ‘selves’ are active attitudes, the content thought 
of being one and the same. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
The Person as an Ethical Self 41 
accommodation adequately expresses it. The only ade- 
quate expression of the boy is that which acquaints us 
with the whole dialectic of his progress, a dialectic which 
comprehends both these selves and the alter personalities 
which are progressive functions of his thoughts of him- 
self; that is, wth the self of all the rich social relation- 
ships, or the ‘ socius.’ 
It seems then a natural question to ask, whether the 
boy comes to have any sense of just this inadequacy of 
his thought of self when he is thinking of himself in 
either way, either in the way of the habitual or of the 
accommodating self. In other words, does he go on to 
reflect upon the ‘socius,’ as a larger bond of union to 
the different private thoughts of himself?! This is really 
the question of the evolution of the ethical sense put in 
closer psychological terms ; and it may be worth while to 
see to what ethical conclusions this line of distinctions 
would lead. This conclusion has been anticipated in the 
following quotation from the work already mentioned.? 
17. “Whether odedience comes by suggestion or by 
punishment, it has this genetic value: it leads to another 
refinement in the sense of self. ... The child finds 
himself stimulated constantly to deny his impulses, his 
desires, even his irregular sympathies, by conforming to 
the will of another. This other represents a regular, 
systematic, unflinching, but reasonable personality — still 
a person, but a very different person from the child’s 
own. In the analysis of ‘personality suggestion,’ we 
found this stage of the child’s apprehension of persons ; 
his sense of the regularity of personal character in the 
1 We saw that he has a sense of it, in his esprit-de-corps. 
2 Mental Development, pp. 344 f., somewhat revised and condensed.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  42 The Self-conscious Person 
midst of the capriciousness that before this stood out in 
contrast to the regularity of mechanical movement in 
things. There are extremes of indulgence, the child 
learns, which even the grandmother does not permit ; 
there are extremes of severity from which even the cruel 
father draws back. Here, in this dawning sense of the 
larger limits which set barriers to personal freedom, is 
the ‘copy’ forming which is his personal authority, or 
law. It is ‘projective’ because he cannot understand it, 
cannot anticipate it, cannot find it in himself. And it 
is only by imitation that he is to reproduce it, and so 
arrive at a knowledge of what he is to understand it to be. 
So it is a ‘copy for imitation.’ It is its aim—so may the 
child say to himself —and should be mine, if I am awake 
to it, to have me obey it, act like it, think like it, be 
like it in all respects, It is not I, but I am to become 
it. Here is my ideal self, my final pattern, my ‘ought’ 
set before me. My parents and teachers are good be- 
cause, with all their differences from one another, they 
yet seem to be alike in their acquiescence in this law. 
Only in so far as I get into the habit of being and doing 
like them in reference to it, get my character moulded 
into conformity with it, only so far am I good. And 
so, like all other imitative functions, it teaches its lesson 
only by stimulating to action. I must succeed in doing 
—he finds out, as he grows older and begins to reflect 
upon right and wrong —if I would understand. But as I 
thus progress in doing, I forever find new patterns set 
for me; and so my ethical insight must always find its 
profoundest expression in that yearning which anticipates 
but does not overtake the ideal. 
“My sense of moral ideal, therefore, is my sense of a

possible perfect, regular will taken over zz me, in which 
the personal and the social self—my habits and my 
social calls ——are brought completely into harmony; the 
sense of obligation in me, in each case, is the sense of 
the actual discrepancies in my various thoughts of self, 
as my actions and tendencies give rise to them,” + 
18. Perhaps no more direct way to bring home the 
bearing of this present line of distinctions can be found 
than to cite in illustration one of the familiar social situa- 
tions which are ethically embarrassing in practical life. 
I refer to the problem of charitable relief. The dilemma 
of the benevolent man when a needy tramp comes to his 
door in a region where there are no organized agencies 
to investigate the status of individuals of the pauper 
class, —the dilemma brought upon him by the prompt- 
ings of his sympathy, on the one hand, and the sense of his 
duty to society which only the refusal to help the man 
will fulfil, on the other hand, —this dilemma, which on a 
larger scale is one of the critical dilemmas of all social 
endeavour, may be translated directly into the terms of our 
psychological analysis. We may say that Mr. A has two 
possible attitudes or courses of conduct before him. And 
the two are what they are according as he thinks of the 
tramp in one way or the other. If he thinks of him as an 
unfortunate, deserving man, possibly hungry, or maimed 
beyond possibility of self-support, then there is an alter 
which arouses his ‘accommodating’ self, his sympathetic 
impulses, his desire to make an exception in this case. 
1 The obligation side is genetically the motor side, as readers of the book 
cited may possibly recall, since, as I believe, the sense of the general is always 
a motor or affitude sense. But it is not necessary to develop this here. Cf. 
Sect. 29, note 2, and Sects, 186-188.
-P-A-G-E-70
44 The Self-conscious Person 
But when he thinks of the man under the ordinary condi- 
tions of the profession of ‘tramping,’ as a worthless creat- 
ure of drink, who will continue to burden the community 
and persuade others to do the same, as long as free food 
or lodging is given him, or money without work, then he 
has before him quite a different alter; one that calls out 
his habitual, aggressive self. His dilemma, therefore, is 
really due to the shifting of the poles of his inner dialectic. 
Suppose he be a man of benevolence only, or on the con- 
trary, a man with no willingness to take trouble for the 
general good; then he acts at once on the first of the 
thoughts of self —he has no dilemma. So, on the other 
hand, if he be very rational in his methods of thought, or 
very much impressed with the dangers of the tramp 
tribe, or very impecunious and willing to make law a 
cloak for private selfishness—in any of these cases he 
acts promptly in terms of the habitual self; then also he 
finds no dilemma. So the very fact of the embarrassment, 
if it arise, is witness to the play of his various thoughts of 
the tramp. 
But this, it is clear, does not exhaust the statement of 
the dilemma. As a matter of fact, whichever way he 
decides, he is afterwards haunted by the fear that he 
has done wrong. The two thoughts of self still remain 
clamorous. And the question comes up: Why is this so? 
Why is not the choice of either course right? What is 
the further standard, to which he feels he should appeal, 
to settle the case justly? To ask this question is to ask 
—is it not?—for a further thought of self, one which 
should see clearer, be wiser, do better than either of 
these two which come up to create his dilemma. Gen- 
erally, indeed, we do quiet our apprehensions in just the
-P-A-G-E-71
    
The Person as an Ethical Self 45 
way which the terms of our psychological explanations are 
going on to require; we appeal to some one else in whom 
we trust as having arrived at deeper insight, or better 
information, of the conditions of the social life of the 
neighbourhood, than we have. He then, this alter, this 
wise man, is a further thought of a self. 
So we may trust to this instance of social embarrass- 
ment — with its sharp ethical meaning in our practice — 
to show that the question of the further development of 
the sense of self, based, as we said above, on the conflicts 
of the two earlier partial selves, is really one of vital 
social meaning, and that, too, in the ethical sense. 
1g. Again, if we look at the doctrines of the rise of the 
ethical sense which have become historical, we see that 
they commonly represent constructions based on the par- 
tial selves, described as ‘habitual’ and ‘accommodating’ 
respectively. 
These historical doctrines, we may say, fall into two 
classes :1 those which base the ethical sentiments upon 
sympathy, or some form of social instinct, on the one 
hand; and those, on the other hand, which base them 
upon custom or habit. Let us look a moment at. each of 
these attempts to account for the genesis of the moral 
sentiments, taking the latter first. 
20. This view seeks to account for the sense in a man 
that he ‘ought’ to doa thing, by the tendency in him to 
feel that things are going well when he is working along 
the lines guaranteed by his past habits and instincts.? 
1 Neglecting for the time the third great historical group of theories, which 
may be called ‘ideal.’ 
2 And, more especially, ill when he violates them. See Darwin’s interest- 
ing case of a supposed bird, after migrating, feeling moral remorse at having  
-P-A-G-E-72
  46 The Self-conscious Person 
What is best for him to do, is what is right ; and what is 
best is that which has been established in the course of his 
life by adaptation, utility, and development. The sense of 
right, therefore, to this view is simply the consciousness 
of certain habits of the physical or mental organization. 
Without going into detail to justify this brief characteriza- 
tion of the theory of the rise of the ethical sense as held 
by many of the Association psychologists, I may state the 
lack it has in the view of those of other schools of thought 
who have criticised it. The lack is this: that the theory 
of habit does not afford an adequate account of the sense 
we have, in our acutest ethical experiences, that what we 
ought to do may run counter to our habitual tendencies. 
On the habit view, only that kind of action would get the 
right to have ethical approval attached to it which was so 
prevalent and regular in the normal life of the individual 
as to be reflected in his every-day conduct. But the oft- 
recurring antithesis in practice, no less than the recogni- 
tion of the same antithesis in ethical theory —see, for 
example, the statement of it from the pen of a scientist 
in the Evolution and Ethics of Huxley — between the ‘is’ 
and the ‘ought,’ serves to set the objection to this theory 
clearly in the light. According to Mr. Huxley the habit 
of being immoral should make the immoral come to seem 
right.? 
violated the maternal instinct by leaving the young behind in the nest. 
(Descent of Man, p. 87.) 
1I do not see that the hypothesis of race experience or race habit helps 
the case much, for the child does not inherit the content of morality; he gets 
it the rather through instruction and social example, and has to reduce it to 
his personal habit just the same, even though it do—as it probably does — 
embody race custom. How then would such habits differ from his other 
private habits? On the point of Huxley’s see Sect. 194.  
-P-A-G-E-73
  The Person as an Ethical Self 47 
This criticism of the habit theory may be put in the 
terms of the child’s social growth without any trouble ; 
and that may serve to show it more forcibly. The child 
has, as we have seen, a habitual self. It is the outcome 
of the assimilations and actions which he has already 
learned. So the tendencies to conduct in realizing the 
behests of this self are, it is easy to see, the same actions 
which the advocates of the habit theory bring forward as 
the acts which, as due to habit or custom, are morally 
right. Now if we agree with this theory, and say that 
those acts which are guaranteed by habit are the right 
ones, then what shall we do with all the tendencies to 
action coming from the presence of the other self which 
we have found the child entertaining also, the accommo- 
dating self? The accommodating self is the learning 
self; the self which comes forward to imitate, to be 
teachable, sympathetic, generous. I think it only needs 
to be put into words that both these selves are equally 
real to convince us that those sharp approvals or condem- 
nations of ourselves which we experience in our judgments 
of right and wrong, are not always administered in favour 
of the self of habit. 
Or, if we look at the question from the side of the race 
development of mankind, we find, as I have argued at 
length in the volume referred to, that the repetitions of 
habitual performances by an organism would not give 
growth. In order to grow, to be better as an organism, 
merely, there must be constant violations or modifications 
of habit. So if we put the ethical sense only on the plane 
that some of the advocates of the habit theory claim for it, 
—d.e., an index of organic utility and development, —even 
then we must find in it more than the outcome of repeated
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  48 The Self-conscious Person 
habit. This is not the place to carry out this thought; but 
it is on the surface difficult to see how we could hold that 
departure from habit as such arouses the sense of wrong, 
if all through the course of organic and mental develop- 
ment it is by just such violations and modifications of old 
habits that new adaptations have been secured to the growth 
and evolution of the organism. There is a sense, it is true, 
in which the ethical sense may be said to represent a 
habit ; but, as its statement below will show, it is different 
from the view customarily developed by the associationists.1 
In short, not to go into this theory further, we may say 
that it represents an attempt to found the moral senti- 
ments upon one of the two selves which the social life 
involves, —the self of habit. 
21. And the other historical theory mentioned above 
does the reverse ; it attempts to derive these feelings also 
from one of the two, but it takes the other. Sympathy, 
benevolence, — which when reduced to its lowest terms 
means the retirement of the aggressive, self-seeking agent 
in man for a period, and in reference to a particular object, 
— instinctive sympathy is the watchword of the traditional 
English theory of the moral sentiments. Adam Smith; 
Darwin, Stephen, and many other apostles of the natural- 
history conception in this realm, think that morality is a 
complex outcome of animal or social sympathy; and the 
later writers account for the rise of sympathy by making 
it of biological utility in the preservation of animal com- 
panies. 
1 Of course this is only one criticism of the habit views; another would be, 
that they do not account for reflective morality, since they do not consider the 
moral sense a function of the thought of self. The relation of private morality 
to social custom is considered in detail further on.  
-P-A-G-E-75
  The Person as an Ethical Self 49 
Put psychologically, this is the recognition of the accom- 
modating self. Actions which are done in deference to 
the presence and conduct of others, which involve a de- 
parture from the first promptings of self-interest, an abey- 
ance of the aggressions of the self of habit, — such actions, 
this theory holds, are good. Self-denial is the keynote of 
morality ; that is, in so far as morality is reflective at all. 
Now it might not be an adequate criticism of this view 
to say that it is one-sided, as the former theory is other- 
sided ; some one-sided things are true. But the same tests 
which we applied to the habit theory may be brought into 
requisition here. Our moral approbations do not ipso facto 
attach to sympathy nor to the generous man. Is generosity 
never wrong? Is not sympathy with the condemned mur- 
derer a maudlin sort of virtue? Are the sudden, irrespon- 
sible, capricious appeals of our environment to our private 
sympathies the highest ground and the final criterion of 
good conduct? Then is the improvident the better man, 
and lawlessness better than law. 
And is there no virtue after all in habit? Is the incal- 
culable, the exceptional, the impulsive, normally a higher 
kind, a safer kind, a more development-furthering kind 
of action than the regular, well-tested, smooth-working, 
grounded acts of organic and intellectual habit? Or, if 
the reader wish to lift the question up to the higher plane 
of spiritual interest, setting aside considerations of organic 
development, let me ask the question differently: Is the 
kingdom of spirit so chaotic that the accidental sugges- 
tions of sympathy are of more value in it than the reason- 
able action which is ruled by some kind of law? Granted 
we do not find, with the associationists, that the law of 
habit is adequate, even in the lower realm of biological 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
50 The Self-conscious Person 
  growth, still the absence of law, be it in a realm of higher 
interests, would seem to be somewhat of a hindrance to 
our getting an adequate doctrine of the meaning of the 
ethical life of man. 
22. But, more positively: turning now to the child and 
observing him in the period when his personal relationships 
are becoming complex, say along through the third year, 
thé dawning moral sense is then caught as it were in the 
process of making. And in it we have a right to see, as I 
have had occasion to say in regard to other of the child’s 
processes, the progress of the race depicted with more 
or less adequacy of detail. 
The child begins to be dimly aware of such a presence, 
in his contact with others, as that which has been called in 
the abstract the socius. What this is to him is, of course, 
at this early stage simply an element of personal quality in 
the suggestions which he now gets from others; an ele- 
ment which is not done justice to by either of the thoughts 
of self to which he is accustomed on occasion to react. He 
notes in the behaviour of his father and mother, whenever 
certain contingencies of the social situation present them- 
selves, a characteristic which, in the development of ‘per- 
sonality-suggestion,’ was termed the ‘regularity of personal 
agency.’! He sees the father pained when he has to ad- 
minister punishment; and he hears the words, ‘Father 
does not like to punish his little boy.’ He finds the mother 
reluctantly refusing to give a biscuit when it is her evident 
desire to give it. He sees those around him doing gay 
things with heavy hearts, and forcing themselves to be 
cheerful in the doing of things which are not pleasant. 
1 Mental Development, p. 125.
-P-A-G-E-77
  The Person as an Ethical Self 51 
He sees hesitations, conflicts, indecisions, and from the 
bosom of them all he sees emerge the indications of some- 
thing beyond the mere individual attitudes of the actor, 
something which stands toward these higher persons from 
whom he learns, as the family law, embodied possibly in 
the father, stands toward him. 
Now I do not mean that the child sees all this in the 
terms in which I have described what he ‘sees.’ He does 
not see anything clearly. He simply feels puzzled at the 
richness of the indications of personal behaviour which pour 
in upon him. But the very puzzle of these situations is 
just the essential thing. It means that the categories of 
personality which he has so far acquired, the two selves 
which exhaust the possible modes of behaviour he is able to 
depict to himself in thought, are really inadequate. Here 
in these situations of his father and mother is more per- 
sonal suggestion, which is still quite ‘projective.’ It is 
personal ; things do not show it. But it is not yet under- 
~~ sto0d7-~Fhe self of habit, no less than the self of accommo- 
dation, is thrust aside, as he sees his mother’s sorrow when 
she refuses him the biscuit; he cannot act aggressively 
toward her nor yet sympathetically. There must needs be 
some other type of personal behaviour, some other thought of 
a self; for if not, then character must after all remain to 
him a chaotic, capricious thing. 
23. We may ask, before we attempt to find a way for 
the child to extricate himself from this confusion in his 
thoughts of personality, whether he have in his own expe- 
rience any analogies which will help him to assimilate the 
new suggestive elements. And our observation is very 
superficial if we do not light upon an evident thing in 
his life; the thing he has come to understand something
-P-A-G-E-78
  52 The Self-conscious Person 
about every time he odeys. This is so evidently a thing of 
value that psychologists long ago struck upon it. The 
‘word of command’ is to Professor Bain the schoolmaster 
to morality. By it the child gets the habit of personal 
subjection which, when he illustrates it reflectively, shows 
itself as morality. This, I think, is true as far as the func- 
tion of the ‘schoolmaster’ is concerned; but much more 
than this schoolmaster is needed to school the agent boy 
to morality. How it works, however, another appeal to the 
growing sense of self will serve to show. 
Whenever he obeys, the boy has forced in upon him a 
situation which his thoughts of himself are not adequate 
to interpret. He is responding neither to his habitual self 
nor to his accommodating self. Not to the former, for if 
the thing he is told to do is something he does not want 
to do, his habits, his private preferences, are directly vio- 
lated. And on the other hand he is not acting out his 
accommodating self simply, just in proportion as he is 
unwilling to do what he is told to do. If this self held 
all the room in his consciousness, then obedience would 
be companionship, and compliance would be no more than 
approval. No, it is really his private habitual self that is 
mainly present ; the other being a forced product, unless 
by dint of schooling in submission his obedience has 
become free and unconstrained. 
Besides these elements, his two selves, then, what more 
is there to the child? This: @ dominating other self, a 
new alter, is there; that is the important thing. And 
what does it mean? It means, in the first instance, a line 
of conduct on his part which the obedience represents. 
But in this line of conduct we now have the real school- 
master to the boy. It is just by it that he learns more 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
The Person as an Ethical Self 53 
about character, precisely as, by his spontaneous imitations 
at the earlier stage, he established lines of conduct which 
taught him more about character. At this stage also, his 
intelligence is not so rudimentary as at the earlier one. 
It does not take him long to learn certain great things. 
By the action he performs through obedience, he learns the 
meaning of these actions: how they feel, what good or 
evil results they lead to. And in all his learning by this 
agency, he learns above all the great lesson essential to the 
development of his thought of self: that there is a some- 
thing always present, an atmosphere, a circle of common 
interest, a family propriety, a mass of accepted tradition. 
This is his first realization to himself of what the socius 
means. It comes by his growth as a personal self, but 
the process of obedience greatly abbreviates his growth.1 
For a long time it is embodied as a matter of course 
in the persons whom he obeys. But the social limita- 
tions which these persons réspectively represent are not 
always coextensive or parallel. His father and mother 
often embody very different family spirits to him. And it 
is only after many tentative adjustments, mistaken efforts 
to please, excesses of duty in one direction, and instances 
of rebellion? in other directions, that he learns the essen- 
tial agreements of the different persons who set law to 
him. 
Now this is a new thought of self. How can it be other- 
wise when all its origin is from persons, and all its char- 
1 As he grows older his intellectual faculties are also exercised at their best 
upon those puzzling situations presented by the behaviour of others toward 
one another, in which a solution by his own action is not immediately required. 
2 The instances of violent rebellion, which become frantic and dramatic 
sometimes in young children, are emphasized by Sully (Studies of Childhood, 
Chap. VIII.) as impressive revelations to the child of the existence of law.       
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  54 The Self-conscious Person 
acters are learned only by the efforts of the struggling 
hero to realize their meaning by his own actions? Apart 
from the elements of a possible self, there is absolutely 
nothing. It is his own actions felt, then added to imita- 
tively and made to illustrate the actions of others, with 
which he fills his consciousness when he thinks of it. And 
in each of his straining efforts to obey, to do what he is 
told to do, his success or failure is a further defining of 
the limitations of one or the other of his old selves, and in 
so far the creation of a new self which sets law to both of 
them. 
Now this new self arises, as we have seen, right out of 
the competitions, urgencies, inhibitions of the old. Sup- 
pose a boy who has once obeyed the command to let an 
apple alone, coming to confront the apple again, when 
there is no one present to make him obey. There is his 
private, greedy, habitual self, eying the apple; there is 
also the spontaneously suggestible, accommodating, imita- 
tive self over against it, mildly prompting him to do as his 
father said and let the apple alone; and there is— or 
would be, if the obedience had taught him no new thought 
of self — the quick victory of the former. But now a 
lesson has been learned. There arises a thought of one 
who obeys, who has no struggle in carrying out the be- 
hests of the father. This may be vague; his habit may be 
yet weak in the absence of persons and penalties, but it is 
there, however weak. And it is no longer merely the faint 
imitation of an obedient self which he does not understand. 
It carries within it, it is true, all the struggle of the first 
obedience, all the painful protests of the private greedy 
self, all the smoke of the earlier battlefield. But while he 
hesitates, it is now not merely the balance of the old forces
-P-A-G-E-81
  
The Person as an Ethical Self 55 
that makes him hesitate ; it is the sense of the new, better, 
obedient self hovering before him. A few such fights and 
he begins to grow accustomed to the presence of some- 
thing in him which represents his father, mother, or in 
general, the lawgiving personality. So, as he understands 
the meaning of obedience better, through his own acting 
out of its behests in varied circumstances, the projective 
elements of the alter which thus sets law to him become 
subjective. The socius becomes more and more intimate 
as a law-abiding self of his own. 
24. Then, with this self in him, he proceeds to do with 
it what we always do with our thoughts of self; he ‘ejects’ 
it into all the other members of the family and of his 
social circle. He expects, and rightly too, that each 
brother and sister will have the same responsibility to 
the Zeztgeist that he has—will reverence the same 
Penates. He exacts from them the same obedience to 
father and mother that he himself renders. It is amus- 
ing to see the jealousy with which one child in a family 
will watch the others, and see that they do not transgress 
the law of the family. If the father makes an exception 
of one little being, he is quickly ‘brought up’ by the pro- 
tests of other little beings.! This is a pertinent piece of 
evidence to the essential truthfulness of the process de- 
picted above, where it was said that the alter is one with 
the ego as a self, and that it is impossible for the child to 
attach predicates to the one without, ipso facto, attaching 
the same predicates to the other. To say that little 
brother need not obey, when I am called on to obey, is 
1(Cf. the instances cited by Sully, Joc. ci¢., Chap. VIII., with his curious 
explanation of them as implying an ‘instinct for order’ in the child (p. 284 
e¢ seq.).
-P-A-G-E-82
  56 The Self-conscious Person 
to say that little brother is in some way not a person, that 
is all. So we constantly have to explain to our children 
‘the dollie cannot feel,’ ‘the leather elephant cannot eat,’ 
‘the woolly dog need not be beaten when he gets in the 
way.’ “These things,” in short, we say to our children, 
“are not selves; they have the shapes of possible selves, 
it may be, and they have so far served as convenient 
alters for you to practise on, but they need not be ex- 
pected to take up with you the responsibilities of family 
life.” , 
So, once born in the fire and smoke of personal friction, 
the socius lives in the child, a presence of which he can 
never rid himself. It is the germ of the ideals of life, 
the measure of the life to come, both in this world and in 
the next ; for it is this self that the child thereafter pur- 
sues in all his development, making it his only to find that 
it is further beyond him. He is “ever learning, but never 
able to come to the knowledge of the truth.” 
25. Taking up the sense of morality, therefore, — the 
sense that we mean when we use the word ‘ought,’ — we 
now have it. Let the child continue to act by the rule of 
either of his former partial selves, —the private habitual 
self or the accommodating capricious self of impulse and 
sympathy, —and this new ideal of a self, a self that ful- 
fils law, comes up to call him to account. My father, 
says the child, knows and would say ‘what’ and ‘how’; 
and later, when the father-self has proved not to know all 
‘whats’ and all ‘hows,’ then my teacher, my book, my in- 
spired writer, my God, knows ‘what’ and ‘how’ still. In so 
far as I have learned from him, I also know; and this I 
expect you, my brother, my friend, my alter, to know too, 
for our common life together. And the sense of this my
-P-A-G-E-83
The Person as an Ethical Self 57 
self of conformity to what he teaches and would have me 
do — this is, once for all, my conscience. 
We do not need to develop in this place a complete 
theory of the adult conscience; that would be outside our 
topic. But no account of the development of the sense 
of self, or of the social conditions under which the sense 
of self arises and grows, as the later developments of our 
work go on to depict them, would be adequate which left 
out this highest reach of the child’s constructiveness. We 
are wont to think that we can draw lines in the attain- 
ments of mind, interpret so far and leave the rest over; 
but the surging activities of stimulation and response pass 
right over our boundary lines, and we find the germs of 
the higher impregnating the lower stages. The child, 
when once this sense of a self which is not but ought to 
be, comes to him, does everything under its law — whether 
his action conform to what he understands of it or whether 
he disobey and offend it. He is henceforth never inno- 
cent with the innocence of neutrality. He must think of 
the better with sorrow if he choose the worse, and of the 
worse with joy if he choose the better; and when he 
makes his act only in response to the measure of good 
which he sees, taking a step in the dark, still there is with 
him the necessary conviction of a self that he groped for, 
but did not find, —a law behind the chaos of his struggle. 
26. It is enough, in this connection, that one or two 
truths regarding the nature of this ethical self should 
remain in mind. It is, first of all, a slow social attainment 
on the part of the child. He gets it only by getting cer- 
tain other thoughts of self first. Then it takes on various 
forms, each held to only to be superseded in turn by some- 
thing higher and richer. The obligation to obey it is also 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
58 The Self-conscious Person 
  slow in its rise. It is a function of the self —this self, the 
socius —just as the tendency to yield to the behests of 
habit or of sympathy are simply functions, the motor side 
of their respective contents. The ‘ought’ comes right up 
out of the ‘must.’ Transfer the self to be obeyed from 
the environment to the inner throne, make it an ego 
instead of an alter, and its authority is not a whit changed 
in nature. Something of its executive compulsion is gone; 
it is one of the very intimate differences between an ego 
and an alter, that the ego is its own impulsion while the 
alter brings compulsion; and as the alter aspect of the 
new self becomes more and more adequately assimilated, 
this difference grows more emphatic. The developed 
ethical sense needs less and less to appeal to an alter self, 
an authority, a holy oracle, to sanction the ought of con- 
science; it gets itself more and more promptly executed 
by its own innerimpulsion. A history of the great world- 
religions, or of the inner form of their deities, might be 
written on the basis of this movement in the form of the 
ethical self, which also implicates the social Zeztgeis¢.1 
27. Anda second point to be borne in mind: that as 
the socius expands in the mind of the child, there is the 
constant tendency to make it real—to eject it—in some 
concrete form in the social group. The father, mother, 
nurse, are apt to be the first embodiment of social law, and 
their conduct, interpreted through obedience and imitation, 
the first ethical standard. And as the child finds one man 
or woman inadequate to the growing complications of the 
case, other concrete selves are erected in the same way. 
The popular voice, the literature of the period, the king, 
1 Compare what is said on the ‘ Religious Sanctions,’ Chap. X., § 4.
-P-A-G-E-85
  The Person as an Ethical Self 59 
the state, the church, —all these are choice repositories 
of the ejected ethical self. Public opinion is our modern 
expression for the purely social form of this spirit. 
28. Then a third point: we may ask what the law is 
which we find this self embodying. And we get a two- 
fold answer. Most comprehensively it may be said that 
the law is in one sense always the realized self of some- 
body. Apart from a self it can be nothing, because nobody 
would understand it. It must come out of somebody’s 
apprehension of the social situation and the requirements 
of the case. The parents themselves are usually the source 
of family law over against the rest of the family. But that 
they are held to the actual socius—to the relationships 
existing between them and the others—is seen in any 
attempts they make to transcend these relationships. Sup- 
pose that the father commands each of the family to dance 
the highland fling and then to write a book. Whether the 
first of these commands be obeyed, would depend upon 
whether he has had a right to include in his sense of the 
alter personalities of the family the accomplishment in 
question. And, as to the second, it is likely that he would 
get a laugh for his pains. 
But further, the law, thus tempered by the thought of 
the other selves involved, is a function of the socius-con- 
sciousness in each of its two aspects. It is ‘projective’ to 
the child when he first receives it and submits himself to 
it. He does not yet understand it; it requires him to act 
blindly. He, in his individual capacity, is not a judge of 
the wisdom or appropriateness of it. The other person 
sets it, the self in whom he is then finding his socius real- 
ized; and the child is properly social only if he submit, 
even if he have to be made properly social by being
-P-A-G-E-86
60 The Self-conscious Person 
  compelled to submit. And the other aspect of the law is 
equally important, that set by the other thought of self 
which the socius includes, the ‘ejective’ embodiment of 
the law. After the child has obeyed, and learned by obe- 
dience, he himself sets the law of the house for the other 
members of it. And the law then becomes ‘common law,’ 
inasmuch as it is engrained in the very thought of the 
better self of every member of the social group. All com- 
mands and behests which are not thus embodied in the 
spirit of the whole, are yet to a degree really only the 
reflection of the highest thought of self in the group, that 
of the father; if to the others these have not yet become 
‘common law,’ the common dictates of the common social 
self, that is because the individuals are yet immature mem- 
bers of the circle or family. Put briefly, all law must arise 
somewhere in the family from the legitimate development 
of the social self ; and it is realized, or obeyed as law, only 
as the members of the family come, each in his turn, to 
mould his social self into intelligent observance of it, and 
intelligent enforcement of it. And the family is typical 
of the community. 
29. A final observation is this: there is, as was inti- 
mated above, a sense in which the socius, the social self, 
and with it the ethical self, is a self of habit. If this 
thought of self which we are calling the ‘socius’ really be, 
in so far as the child understands his own thought of it,‘a 
sense of his denials of both his lower and less social selves 
—the self of private habit and the self of accommodation — 
in favour of a law set him by an alter, then this very attitude 
must become in some degree a habit, a tendency to look 
for a higher law, a moving toward a higher authority. But 
it is a habit of acting, not a habit of action. It involves
-P-A-G-E-87
    
The Person as an Ethical Self 61 
the most acutely painful and difficult violations of old 
habits of action. Jt zs a habit of violating habits —that 
is the relation of morality to habit. And it is an inter- 
esting side-light on the method of the rise of the suc- 
cessive selves by imitation and submission, that in the 
lower stages of evolution we find the organism working 
under the same subtlety. The organism develops only by 
cultivating the habit of imitating ; while the very value of 
imitation is that by it the organism acquires new accom- 
modations by breaking up habits already acquired. The 
organism must be ready, by a habit of acting, to impair 
the habits of action it already has! And the origin of the 
moral sense by this method shows it to be an imitative 
function. We do right by habitually imitating a larger 
self whose injunctions run counter to the tendencies of 
our partial selves.? 
1 This amounts to what Mr. Huxley describes as nature combating herself 
(Zoc. cit., p. 35), and considers so surprising. It is the same point of view, 
on the ethical plane, that Mr. Romanes has taken on the biological plane 
(Ment. Evol. in An., p. 20) in saying that heredity cannot provide in ad- 
vance for its own modification, I have shown that nature does produce just 
this state of things in biology (cf. Mental Development, Chap. VIII., § 5); 
Professor Lloyd Morgan has published (Habit and Instinct, p. 264) a sim- 
ilar criticism of Romanes. In the ethical sense we find nature combating 
herself in the same way; combating by a higher adaptation a lower law of 
her own making. It is not necessary to say that such an adaptation is ‘con- 
trary to nature’ and not a part of evolution; for, as Mr. Huxley himself says 
in a note, it simply requires a larger way of looking at the process of evolution 
itself. See further allusion to Mr. Huxley’s position in Sect. 194 and in 
Appendix C. 
2 The question of the psychophysics of the moral sense cannot be discussed 
here; yet the foregoing position would seem to indicate that the sense of 
obligation must be accompanied in the brain with a process which represents 
a partial inhibition of lower motor syntheses (representing habits, impulses, 
etc.) by a higher and more unstable motor integration, into which the lower 
tend to be brought. This second synthesis stands for the general or ideal self 
which sets law to the lower partial selves. This view has much in common
-P-A-G-E-88
  62 The Self-conscious Person 
The more refined phases of ethical emotion, together 
with their influence on social conduct, are considered 
under the headings of ‘Sentiment’ and ‘Sanction.’! 
§4. The Genesis of the Self-Thought2 
29a. The question may very well be asked at this point, 
how the various ‘self-thoughts’ hitherto distinguished are 
related to one another, and also how they are possible if 
the mind in all its development is proceeding with what 
has been called an identical content, in the thought of 
self. It is desirable, therefore, to make sure that we are 
not entangling ourselves in the meshes of our own details 
and distinctions. The matter straightens itself out when 
we recall to mind certain points already made out in what 
precedes. 
First, we may recall the fact that a mental content may 
be considered either for itself, or with regard to the atti- 
tudes, the active processes, which accompany it. We 
with that developed by Guyau (Zsguisse d’une Morale). He says (Educa- 
tion and Heredity, p. 79): “Thought, action—they are at bottom identical. 
And what is called moral obligation or constraint is, in the sphere of the in- 
tellect, the sense of this radical identity; obligation is an internal expansion, 
a need for completing our ideas by making them pass into action. Morality 
is the wnity of the being.” See the following § 4 (added in the second edition). 
I may add that no philosophy of morality is attempted here, but only a genetic 
account of the rise of the moral consciousness. Consequently such ‘criticism’ 
as Mr. Ball’s (A/ind, April, 1901, p. 165 ff.), which simply reiterates a philo- 
sophical point of view, I consider irrelevant. Cf. the remarks in the preface 
(to third edition) ed fin., and in § 2 of the Introduction. 
1 Chaps. VIIL., §§ 2, 4, IX., § 5, and X.,§ 4. The ethical is so intimately 
bound up with the social —as it is one of my main purposes to show — that 
the later chapters of the essay will all be found to contain ethical matter. 
2 The explanations of this paragraph were suggested by Professor Dewey’s 
and Professor Tufts’ interesting points of criticism (see references given in 
-the preface to this edition), and may serve to clear them up.
-P-A-G-E-89
The Person as an Ethical Self . 63 
  shall see (Sect. 54-56) that the active processes are 
always functions of the content; and, on the, other hand, 
that the content is always largely determined by earlier 
active processes.. There is here a genetic circle. It fol- 
lows that the same content may be present in connection 
with different attitudes. When, for example, a self-con- 
tent, at whatever stage of its development, is presented, 
having the additional marks which determine it to be 
another person, an alter, then the self-attitude aroused 
may be either what has been called ‘aggressive,’ or what 
has been called ‘accommodating,’ according as it, the 
attitude, is determining the content, or as the content is, 
in some degree, also determining the attitude. In the 
former case, the alter is ‘ejective’; in the latter case, it 
has elements which are ‘projective.’ What we mean, 
therefore, by the ‘self of habit or aggression,’ and the 
‘self of accommodation or imitation,’ are not different 
self-contents. They have differences, to be sure, from 
the presence of an alter requiring one attitude or the 
other; but these are not elements of self, not self-marks, 
so to speak, until they have been taken over, by accommo- 
dation, from the projective and incorporated in the content 
of self. The differences of attitude are the differences of 
real genetic importance. 
Second, the distinction between projective and ejective 
content turns upon the same requirement that we distin- 
guish between content and attitude. When the self-con- 
tent is accompanied by the aggressive attitude, the alter 
is never projective, never considered unfinished ; it is then 
always ejective, thoroughly understood. The projective 
is always the aspect of persons which excites the accom- 
modating imitative attitude. Once accommodated to,
-P-A-G-E-90
  64 The Self-conscious Person 
however, it becomes self-content, arouses habitual atti- 
tudes, and so goes on to be ejected. 
Third, granted then that we have a developing self- 
content which at any time may be associated either with 
an aggressive or with an accommodating attitude, what 
shall we say of the ‘general’ and of the ‘ideal’ self? 
The general self, like the general everywhere in mental 
things, is, I believe, an attitude; an attitude which is a 
more or less complex integration of the partial attitudes 
aroused in definite concrete cases. The self-content re- 
mains one, growing with experience, it is true, but never 
more than one self-content. The partial attitudes which 
habitually determine and express it, tend to realize them- 
selves severally; but it is the mark of the general that 
they are in some degree held in the larger issue which 
constitutes the limit of personal growth up to date. The 
general self is, therefore, the sense of a system of atti- 
tudes which avail, by reason of the relative adequacy of 
their ejective content, to cope with the varied personal 
experiences of life. | 
Fourth, this ‘general,’ however, like all attitudes con- 
sidered with reference to their contents, is itself inade- 
quate to personal situations not yet covered by experience. 
The attitude called the general is therefore itself different 
according as the content is determined ‘ejectively’ or 
‘projectively,’ ze. according as it determines the content, 
or the content in part determines it; according, that is, 
as the person met with, or the personal situation experi- 
enced, has new, interesting, instructive features, or, on 
the other hand, is thoroughly understood, and already 
successfully acted upon. The former is the ‘general’ as 
above defined, and as properly designated —the attitude 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  
The Person as an Ethical Self 65 
which is not violated in the round of concrete personal 
experiences ; the latter is the ‘ideal’ self. The ideal self, 
then, is the attitude which looks forward toward a state- 
ment of the self-content which is not yet secured, and 
which no concrete self-experience suffices to fulfil, but 
which would respond adequately, if we had it, to all 
possible personal demands. In its actual mechanism this 
means, I think, — what it means also on the lower plane, 
—the readiness or habit of our motor nature to accommo- 
date itself ever more adequately, while at the same time 
it is becoming general and spontaneous in its expression. 
So we have the outcome of the preceding section, to the 
effect that in the ethical ‘ought’ we have a: ‘habit of 
violating habits’: a call to accommodate to what is as 
yet unrealized in actual self-content and so to modify the 
attitudes which accompany real content. 
1 Cf, the remarks, made in reply to Professor Tuft’s criticism, in Appendix 
- = the work, Thought and Things, Vol. I., the psychology of the self, con- 
sidered as an object of cognition in the various stages of development, is worked 
out (Joc. cit, Chap. IIL, § 5, Chap. V., § 7, Chap. VL, §§ 6 ff. Chap. VIII, 
§ 9, Chaps. X., XI.).

CHAPTER II 
Tue Soctat Person 
  Tue expositions so far made of the child’s progress 
toward the complete equipment of himself for social life, 
lead us now to see a principle ruling his development which 
should have more adequate formulation; indeed, we are 
now in position to estimate the factors which enter into 
his social development. In this inquiry we come to formu- 
late, on the basis of the development of the preceding 
chapter, the principle of ‘Social Heredity.’! 
§ 1. Social Heredity 
30. We have found that the social sense of the child 
grows constantly with his personal acquisition of new func- 
tions, activities, etc., through the influence of his social 
environment. And further, his process of acquisition is 
always complex. It always involves two standards of ref- 
erence. The measure of the child’s capacity at any time 
is referable to his past; he can do only what he has 
learned to do, This is what we may call the measure of 
his attainment by the standard of ‘private reference.’ He 
is a single individual person only in so far as we agree, 
1 The facts of the indebtedness of the individual to his social environment 
and antecedents are well stated by Mr. Leslie Stephen in his Science of Ethics, 
Chap. III. Other writers who have emphasized the general truth of social 
transmission by tradition are, in biology, Weismann and Lloyd Morgan, and 
in philosophy, Ritchie, Mackensie, S. Alexander. 
66
-P-A-G-E-93
  Social Heredity 67 
more or less tacitly, to estimate him by this standard; by 
what he can do, with no account of what he can further 
learn to do. If we go back and take into account the 
few functions which his natural heredity gives him ready- 
formed, —his reflexes, private instincts, etc.,— these too 
come in here as part of the person viewed with this private 
reference alone. 
But as soon as we come to ask what he can learn to do, 
we find that the private reference carries us no farther; 
we have then to take a wider point of view, —the point of 
view of ‘public reference’ or ‘social reference.’ We have 
found that the prime and essential method of his learning 
is by imitative absorption of the actions, thoughts, expres- 
sions, of other persons. He has grown up in a setting of 
social functions of a type higher always than that of his 
private accomplishment; and his elevation to this higher 
plane, at each stage, is just by” ‘his “gradual absorption. of 
‘copies,’ patterns, examples, from the social.life. about him. 
And again as soon as we come to ask genetic questions, 
questions pertaining to the origin of his activities, con. 
sidered one by one, we find that, at each stage of his” 
progress, it was only by a process which brought in the 
public or social reference that he could gain the functions 
which he afterwards considers private to himself. We 
have traced this dependence upon the social environment 
in the matter of his ‘interests,’ and we shall learn further 
on that even in his originalities, his inventions, he is by no 
means independent of the scheme of social activities which 
are current in his environment. So the sphere of the 
private reference grows smaller and more contracted the 
further we go back in his life-history, until we reach 
the bare naked presence of the infant endowed only with
-P-A-G-E-94
  68 The Social Person 
what he has inherited, together with the magnificent 
capacity, which he so soon begins to show, of learning by 
the absorption of social ‘copy,’ and of gradually growing 
into conformity to this copy both in his thought and in 
his conduct. 
Even farther back than this also, do we find a similar 
state of things. In the instincts of the animals we see a 
series of functions which could have arisen only as fitting 
the animal to maintain a gregarious and co-operative life. 
The actual adaptations which the possession of such charac- 
ters gave the parent animals — whatever theory of physical 
heredity we may hold—is the only justification of them 
in the offspring; so we may say that even the infant’s 
private physical self — the organism with which he is born 
—is the reflection of a state of living which involved a 
more or less complex system of social relationships. Now, 
waiviug the question as to the degree in which it is true 
that anything exclusively private in an individual, be 
he child, animal, youth, man, is impossible in any case — 
whether he does anything or whether he does nothing in 
securing growth, or progress, absolutely by himself, — 
waiving this, and contenting ourselves, at this stage of the 
inquiry, with the smaller fact that there are many things 
that he cannot learn to do without help from his social 
environment, let us call this general fact, that in much of 
his personal growth he is indebted to society, the fact of 
‘Social Heredity.’ We may then go on to draw the lines 
of definition and description more narrowly. 
31. It does not much matter how far the animals have 
“functions which they learn only through the stimulus 
of gregarious existence. It is an interesting biological 
question on which light has lately been thrown. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-95

here we may limit the inquiry to the human person’s de- 
velopment, and so keep in the line which leads up to hu- 
man social organization. Several things may then be said 
about Social Heredity. 
(1) The first thing is that it is analogous to physical 
heredity.1_ The child, apart from the defective in mind or 
body, learns to speak, write, read, play, combine force with 
others, build structures, do book-keeping, shoot firearms, 
address meetings, teach classes, conduct business, practise 
law and medicine — or whatever his line of further develop- 
ment may be away from the three ‘r’s’ of usual attainment 
—just as well as if he had received an instinct for that 
activity at birth from his father and mother. His father 
or mother may have the accomplishment in question ; and 
he may learn it from him or her. But then both the father 
and mother may not have it, and he then learns it from 
some one else. It is inheritance; for it shows the attain- 
* ments of the fathers handed on to the children; but it is 
not physical heredity, since it is not transmitted physically 
at birth. 
(2) It is hereditary in that the child cannot escape it. 
It is as inexorably his as the colour of his eyes and the shape 
1The term ‘social heredity’ in this connection has been objected to, 
especially by Professor Lloyd Morgan, Hadit and Instinct, p. 183, and Professor 
E. D. Cope, American Naturalist, April, 1896, p. 345. Besides the justifica- 
tion of the phrase ‘Social Heredity’ given in the text, the reader may consult 
my papers in the American Naturalist, May, 1896, p. 422, and July, 1896, 
p- 355 f. I donot find it possible to adopt Professor Lloyd Morgan’s exclusive 
use of the term ‘tradition,’ since that word denotes the matter handed down, 
while ‘social heredity’ indicates the imitative process of absorption of this 
matter of tradition by individuals, whereby its continuity from generation to 
generation is secured. The social heredity of individuals differs with sex, 
temperament, etc., while their tradition may be the same: social heredity is 
the outcome of a personal reaction upon tradition. Cf. Groos, Play of Man 
(Eng. trans.), p. 282.

of his nose. He is born into a system of social relation- 
ships just as he is born into a certain quality of air. As 
he grows in body by breathing the one, so he grows in 
mind by absorbing the other. The influence is as real 
and as tangible; and the only reason that it is variable 
in its results upon different individuals is that each indi- 
vidual has his physical heredity besides, and the outcome 
is always the outcome of the two factors, — natural tem- 
perament and social heredity. The limits of the relative 
influence of these two factors I shall speak of again; here 
it is enough to say that the development of the natural 
disposition is always directed more or less into the channels 
opened up by the social forces of the environment. The 
union of these two factors leads us, however, to observe a 
further point. 
(3) The influence of social heredity is, in a large sense, 
inversely as the amount and definiteness of natural hered- 
ity. By this is meant that the more a person or an animal 
is destined to learn in his lifetime, the less fully equipped 
with instincts and special organic adaptations must he be 
at birth. This has been made so clear by recent biological 
discussion that I need do no more than refer to it. The 
interpretation of a creature’s infancy turns upon the ques- 
tion how much the exigencies of future life are to call upon 
him to learn. Ifa great deal, then we find him born prac- 
tically helpless and requiring artificial support and atten- 
tion during a long infancy period.’ If the young creature is 
to have a life of relatively unchanging activities with little 
need for the acquisition of functions not already possessed 
by the species as instincts, then he comes into the world 
1Cf, Fiske, Cosmic Evolution, and Baldwin, Mental Development, pp. 28 f. 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  Social Heredity 71 
with ready-made instinctive activities, and can take care of 
himself independently very early, or even at birth. The 
two organic tendencies seem each to have had exceedingly 
wide independent development in the different forms of life. 
In the insects we find the instinctive apparatus marvellously 
complete ; much of the life-history of the insect being pre- 
pared for in the equipment which he brings into the world. 
The other extreme is realized in the human infant. He 
has very few instincts, and these are almost all fitted to 
secure organic satisfaction. Many of them terminate with 
the rise of volition. The insects have remarkable instincts, 
but cannot learn to do new things; the baby, on the con- 
trary, has no complete instincts to speak of, but can learn 
to do almost anything. Now the learning capacity is the 
capacity to which social heredity appeals and which it 
calls into play; on the other hand, the instincts are the 
result, in their method of acquisition by the individual, of 
natural heredity; so it is plain from the simple state- 
ment of these facts that the two kinds of heredity are in 
inverse ratio to each other. The insect pays dear, there- 
fore, for his early ‘start’ on the infant toward maturity; and 
the infant gets a royal reward for the toil and trouble of 
his early months and years. 
It is interesting also to note as another way of consider- 
ing the same contrast between the gifts of natural heredity 
and the acquisitions of individual life, that the latter in- 
volve the presence and activity of a very high form of 
consciousness as contrasted with the former. In order to 
learn to do new things with his hands, for instance, the 
child must be capable of wide-awake, sustained attention 
and repeated effort. This experience of effort, with the 
great mental concentration which it requires, is about
-P-A-G-E-98
  72 The Social Person 
the most acute and intense experience which conscious 
beings ever know; and if we describe this as ‘high,’ or 
personal, or strong, consciousness, then on examination 
we find that the reflex, more instinctive, and automatic 
processes and actions are lacking in it. They go on very 
largely without supervision ; they do not even require at- 
tention ; so far from calling out effort, they are in many 
cases not brought into our consciousness at all until they 
have actually been performed.1_ They have then as reactions 
very ‘low,’ obscure, weak consciousness attached to them. 
And the same antithesis holds throughout the series of 
organic forms in the animal kingdom ; the animals which 
are given over almost altogether to instinctive activities 
have least of this high consciousness. They do not need 
the assistance of conscious effort in getting adapted to the 
world, since, by reason of their inherited adaptations, they 
are sufficiently equipped already for the life which they are 
to lead. 
32. Further, the same distinction has its counterpart in 
the nervous system and its variations in the animal series. 
The reflex, automatic, and instinctive activities are regu- 
lated by the spinal and lower cerebral plexuses ; while the 
higher and more complex activities involving conscious 
supervision, volition, and all that is involved in the process 
of the learning of new lines of action, go out from the gray 
matter of the cortex of the brain. This gray material 
represents the more unstable and plastic substance ; and it 
is in the organization of this material that the new actions 
acquired by the individual in his lifetime get their registra- 
tion. From this it follows as an easy inference that the 
1 This after-consciousness of the effects may be very vivid and so also may 
the stimulating sensation which releases the instinct.
-P-A-G-E-99
Physical Heredity and Social Environment 73 
creature which is born with most of this unorganized gray 
matter, characteristic of the brain, will be the creature 
capable of most education during his lifetime, and so 
capable of sustaining the most complex system of those 
social relationships which call this process of acquisition 
into play. On the other hand, this creature will also lack 
the elaborate system of fixed instinctive actions which his 
less brainy rival will possess ; since the use of his brain in 
learning requires the varied and free use of muscle and limb 
brought into play in the new activities. These members 
then, as he learns to use them, come to perform, in an in- 
finitely more varied and effective way, the functions of 
personal life performed by the lower creature’s instincts 
through a few fixed self-repeating reactions. 
Plasticity, therefore, on the one hand, and fixity, on the 
other hand, sum up the differences between social and phys- 
ical heredity on the side of the organism; while “igh con- 
sciousness, seen in attention, voluntary imitation, concentra- 
tion, on the one hand, and low, dreamy, diffused, subconscious 
processes, on the other hand, serve to define the distinction 
on the side of the mental life itself. 
§ 2. Physical Heredity and the Social Environment 
33. With so much attention to the general definition 
of what is called ‘social heredity,’ and with a further word 
of emphasis upon the phenomena of the child’s develop- 
1 For the influence of ‘Social Heredity’ upon organic evolution, see Ap- 
pendix A, Later on in this chapter also (Sects. 42, 43) we find that the 
phrase has further appropriateness from the direct influence which social con- 
ditions have upon physical heredity through the ‘ personal selection’ of mates 
in marriage. Of course, this theory of social heredity by no means denies 
the great importance of the physical heredity of characters in group-competi- 
tion (cf, Group-Selection, Sect, 120 and Sect. 313 a, 1).
-P-A-G-E-100
    74 The Social Person 
ment upon which the doctrine has been found so far to 
rest, we may now turn to a closer examination Of certain 
phases of the topic which come up as soon as we attempt 
to make any application of the position to the affairs of 
mankind at large. It will be remembered that a page or 
two back I had occasion to say that even the so-called 
‘private reference’ of the individual’s attainments have, 
when their origin is in question, a strain of ‘social refer- 
ence’ as well; and that even the instinctive functions of 
the individual creature —the activities which seem most 
private of all—are in an important sense the outcome 
of social race conditions. And in the definitions just 
given the same point appeared; the statement was 
made that in each case there are two factors involved 
in a person’s equipment: his physical heredity and his 
social heredity. The question raised by these remarks is the 
traditional one covered by the antithesis between ‘heredity 
and environment’; and while the discussion which follows 
will be found not out of touch with the contributions made 
to this topic by Galton and other distinguished investiga- 
tors, I yet hope that the point of view which I am incor- 
porating in the doctrine of ‘social heredity’ and the final 
view that we get of the human ‘socius,’ may add something 
of more or less value to the elucidation of this problem. 
It goes without saying that by environment in this con- 
nection what is meant is social environment. The question 
of the influence of the physical environment, on the other 
hand, is a biological one, involving what is, in an exclusive 
sense, the private business of the organism, its private 
accommodations, and its chances of selection and survival 
among these physical conditions. Here we have a distinc- 
tively human problem ; and in case we take a man’s moral  
-P-A-G-E-101
  Physical Heredity and Social Environment 75 
stature as the instance for investigation, we have to ask: 
What elements in his life does he owe to his association 
with his fellows, and what, on the contrary, does he owe to 
his physical heredity? This is the first question. And the 
second is like unto it: What part of his physical heredity 
does he owe to the social influences in which his father 
and mother lived? Or, seeing that such social influences 
would act in great measure upon all the individuals alike, 
how far is a man’s physical heredity common property to 
others with himself ? 
34. The first of these questions concerns a matter of 
fact which we have had already before us in our investiga- 
tion of the child’s processes of learning to be an adult man. 
Our definitions of social heredity have covered just the 
relation to which this question refers. The growth of 
human personality has been found to be pre-eminently a 
matter of social suggestion. The material from which 
the child draws is found in the store of accomplished 
activities, forms, patterns, organizations, etc., which society 
already possesses. These serve as ready stimulating 
agencies, loadstones so to speak, to his dawning energies, 
to draw him ever on in his career of growth into the safe, 
sound, useful network of personal acquisitions and social 
relationships which the slow progress of the race has set 
in permanent form. All this he owes, at any rate in the 
first instance, to society. His business is to be teachable. 
He must have the plastic nervous substance known popu- 
larly as a brain; he must have organs of sense and sufficient 
organic equipment to enable him to profit by the methods 
of personal reaction necessary in the presence of his social 
fellows; he must be able to imitate, to attend, to invent. 
Taking all this now for granted, we may rest in this matter-  
-P-A-G-E-102
of-fact answer to the first of our questions ; and so formu- 
late a statement which throws the burden of further in- 
vestigation upon the other problem stated above ; and this 
with the less hesitation since the facts are not generally in 
question. All theories will admit that the child does actu- 
ally begin without many personal acts of skill; and that he 
does actually learn his further acts of skill from his fellows ; 
moreover, it is also admitted that he learns in the long run 
only those acts of skill which his social environment already 
possesses and illustrates before him. Even when he learns 
more, making inventions which are completely new, and 
so instructing his associates, instead of being instructed by 76 The Social Person 
them, ‘it is by some variation of the material which he has 
learned from them, and is an invention of which his own 
and their social judgment is liable to see the’ meaning in 
terms of the already familiar ways of action of the social 
group. Leaving this possible case of the genius in any 
case for a later discussion, — in which it is shown that the 
genius does not, after all, escape the laws of human prog- 
ress as embodied in the social acquisitions of his tribe and 
time, — we may now consider the average man, and pass 
on tothe next inquiry. This I have put in alternative terms 
above ; we may take the more social emphasis as the more 
critical, and discuss the form of it stated in these terms: 
how far is a man’s heredity, physical and social, common 
property in the community in which he is born ? 
35. The force of this form of statement is seen as soon 
as we realize the terms of the older statement which con- 
trasted ‘heredity’ sharply with ‘environment.’ If that 
contrast is to be made and if it be a question of the divi- 
sion of a man’s equipment into two parts, one due to his 
endowment or physical heredity, and the other due to his
-P-A-G-E-103
Physical Heredity and Social Environment 77 
environment, there is no question of a third category. It 
supposes that these two agencies are opposed forces, and 
that each element of the man’s entire character must be 
due to one or the other of them. The alternative, shat 
most of the man’s equipment is due to both causes working 
together, is not recognized; and the resulting dualism or 
strife between the two supposed influences at work has 
no way of reconciliation. The very statement of the ques- 
tion in the terms given above, however, is itself the admis- 
sion of such a third category; and we should expect, if 
the affirmative answer to it should be established by the 
facts, that a modified view of the relation of these two 
traditional factors would be justified. For we should then 
be obliged, in some degree at least, to identify the two 
influences which thus serve to produce results in com- 
mon, but to which in their extreme forms we give differ- 
ent names. 
It is hardly an anticipation to the reader who has fol- 
lowed the earlier chapter of this essay to say that it is 
the affirmative answer to the question thus stated which 
seems to the present writer to result from an adequate 
examination of the facts on both sides or on either side. 
And it is to the presentation of the evidence of this that 
the remainder of this chapter is to be devoted, so far as 
the case is not covered by the classes of facts already pre- 
sented in the earlier pages. 
36. Taking up the case first from the point of view of 
the individual’s experience, we may cite the evidence 
available to show that the acquisitions of each person are 
constantly made by slow progress toward standards of 
excellence already established in the society about him. 
He has a teacher all through his education just that he  
-P-A-G-E-104
  78 The Social Person 
may be led by one who has already trodden the path of 
development upon which he is constantly advancing in 
his own personal growth. As far, therefore, as we are 
concerned in tracing the method of that more formal 
training covered by the word ‘education,’ there can be no 
doubt that we may safely say, as an element in our conclu- 
sion, that what the individual learns, the teachers of that 
individual have also learned —some more, some less; so 
that it is true that the social heredity which thus bears 
in upon the one, has before borne in upon the others by 
a similar process of teaching; and the elements of social 
inheritance which each gets in his education are common 
to the group in which he is reared. This holds of the 
great sphere of personal accomplishment represented by 
literature, art, the established forms of social organization, 
etc., which are made a formal part of the instruction of 
children and youth. 
In the same manner, also, do we find the child learning 
those more fundamental activities which serve, in our later 
phrase, as ‘social aids to invention.’1 Speech, reading, 
writing, the elements of correct personal deportment ‘in 
the family, in the school, in social gatherings, etc.,— 
these are impressed upon him, even by force if he show 
any reluctance or incapacity to take them in of himself, 
The most direct and severe punishments are laid down 
for breaches of social etiquette in the family and school 
discipline of the youth. And all this, of course, being so 
fundamental to the existence of the social organization of 
men together, has also been learned by the parents in 
much the same way, and under much the same social | 
sanctions as the next generation after them. So again 
1 Cf, Chap. IV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
Physical Heredity and Social Environment 79 
we may say that with regard to these more definite and 
stereotyped utilities of social life, it is true that the single 
individuals get them similarly, and what is true of one 
such person is true in its main lines of all. 
The only other sphere of personal influence of man upon 
. man is that which may be represented by the current 
phrase ‘unconscious’. influence, to which, from the fact 
that it is obviously typified by the more or less approximate 
reproduction of opinions, styles, etc., of one person in 
others, the name ‘plastic imitation’ was given in my ear- 
lier work. All influence of this unconscious kind is clearly 
to be classified under the term ‘suggestion’; and inas- 
much as it notoriously belongs in that department of col- 
lective psychology which finds its most striking instances 
in the matters where social opinion is most acute and 
social criticism most dreaded, it is no stretch of evidence 
to say that, as for the learning of the individual in these 
unconscious ways, it is common, par excellence, to the 
whole social group. 
37. Having now gone so far, we are at once confronted 
with the following state of things: Here are a number of 
beings all pursuing the same activities in a system of re- 
markably complex relationships with one another. Each 
one in turn has been born with none of these activities in 
any advanced state of development; but has depended — 
by the inflexible conditions of his organic make-up — upon 
finding just this system of relationships there beforehand, 
prepared to hail, embrace, and educate him. All were 
born helpless; all have been educated. Each has been 
taught ; each is to become a teacher. Each learns new 
things by doing what he sees others do; and each im- 
proves on what the other does only by doing what he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  80 The Social Person 
already learned. Each teaches simply by doing, and each 
rules the others by his example. This, it will be re- 
membered, is the state of things when we consider soci- 
ety as an organization of common men; we have left the 
consideration of the candidates for the great name of 
genius over for separate treatment. 
§ 3. Social Suppression of the Unfit 
What shall we then say about the physical heredity 
of these toiling, playing, teaching, learning individuals? 
What must we say? 
The very least we can say seems to me worth saying; 
for its bearings are in some respects critical for the 
theory of society. (1) Zhe individual must be born to 
learn; and (2) all the individuals must be born to learn 
the same things. 
This may seem but the statement of platitudes; but 
their commonplace character indicates their truth. For, 
as commonplace as they are, and as true as the common- 
place character of them would lead us to expect, they are 
still the two points upon which, as I think, the entire 
system of truths in the relation of the individual to his 
kind depend. Their importance may be seen from the 
remark that the historical development of social and eco- 
nomic theory which goes by the name of ‘Individualism’? 
directly contradicts them. I need not stop to make good 
this statement now; our later outcome involves it: but 
the more immediate bearings of the principles before us 
will suffice to show their meaning. 
38. I. Man is born to learn: how does this define his 
1 Defined strictly in opposition to ‘ Collectivism,’  
-P-A-G-E-107
Social Suppression of the Unfit 81 
physical heredity? It defines it in several ways, and I 
shall try to make them cumulative in their statement. 
If a creature is to come into the world fitted to learn, 
he must not —to state a negative requirement — he must 
not have hereditary tendencies which will make him anti- 
social, to what may be called a suppressive degree. This 
means simply that he must not develop activities or per- 
sonal qualities so counter to the true line of conformity 
to the teachings and relationships of the common social 
milieu, that society and other individuals will not let him 
live to do them harm, or to set them a bad example. What 
these actions and qualities are which an individual must 
not be born to perform, it is not necessary to define in 
detail. That is for the particular society to say ; and his- 
torically different societies have said many things very 
different in detail. It is for the community to say; and 
that is only another way of stating the point already made, 
that the other element of the person’s entire equipment 
is the common social standard of the ‘social heredity’ of 
the group. Society it is which addresses the anti-social 
man, saying to him: “ Dear sir, your physical heredity has 
overstepped its bounds; to tolerate you and men like you 
would endanger the social heritage which our fathers have 
given us; you must go. You have the making of a crimi- 
nal, and although we may have to wait till your potencies 
actually show you up a criminal, still, as far as in us lies, 
criminals shall be suppressed.” 
I know that there are several questions which may arise 
in the mind of the reader— especially the biologist — 
regarding this formulation. One of them concerns the 
standards of society with reference to which its judgments 
are rendered. Another concerns the sphere of possible
-P-A-G-E-108
82 The Social Person 
variations in the social worth of individuals with reference 
to this standard; this I can only define here by the relative 
limitation indicated by the phrase ‘suppressive degree.’ 
And then, of course, the biologist rushes in with the ques- 
tion what relation this term ‘suppressive’ bears to natural 
selection! in the organic world. The general relation of 
social facts to organic facts cannot be profitably discussed 
in this connection ; but the remarks which follow in eluci- 
dation of the ‘suppressive degree’ which the individual’s 
anti-social tendencies may not reach may serve to quiet 
the oversensibilities of the biological enthusiast at this 
point. 
39. But before we go further, it may be well to illus- 
trate the method which society adopts to suppress the 
individual who is unfit. I have said that the level of 
social heredity of the group or society, as a whole, repre- 
sents the voice of this society in pronouncing sentence 
upon its unworthy members. This, in our developed 
society, is embodied in the real institutions and laws 
which aim at the correction, isolation, and punishment of 
the social offender. If a man is born with too strong an 
egoistic tendency, with, let us say, uncontrollable passions, 
with abnormal emotions, such as jealousy, malice, unre- 
flective self-assertion, or what-not of tendency which, when 
he grows up, leads him to commit crime, the arm of society, 
acting through its institutions of justice, takes up his case. 
If you kill, say the people in most instances, you shall be 
1 The biologists say that a character has a ‘selective degree’ of utility 
when its utility is sufficient to preserve the life of the animal possessing it, in 
the ‘struggle for existence.” The phrases ‘suppressive degree’ and ‘ suppres- 
sion of the unfit’ used in the text suggest a parallel which will become clearer 
as we proceed.
-P-A-G-E-109
  Social Suppression of the Unfit 83 
killed; and he is. If he shows by his thefts that he has 
a strain of heredity which leads him to disregard the 
claims of society to the mutual respect of property-rights 
as society defines them, then he must be put where he can 
find no property, says the social spirit; and he is. If he 
is born with an intellectual nature out of proportion to his 
social nature, and thinks to circumvent the regulations of 
the social spirit by wily cunning and well-laid schemes, 
then society seeks one who is as smart as he and more 
loyal, to track him out, that he too may be socially sup- 
pressed. And so the cases go. Society it is that formu- 
lates in what we call laws the truths which it knows about 
itself; and society it is that says in this case or that: 
‘You have proved yourself anti-social and you must leave 
society.’ So what we have to say about the negative sort 
of selection called ‘social suppression’ may take its point 
of departure here. 
4o. It is probably clear to the reader from these illus- 
trations what is meant by suppression in this social realm. 
Certain individuals are singled out or selected for special 
treatment. The great peculiarity of this negative selection 
is that it selects the most unfit rather than the most fit, and 
instead of selecting for preservation, 7¢ selects to remove or 
to destroy. In the organic world it is the organic causes 
themselves which work with the environment to secure 
a race progressively better as individuals; in the social 
world it is the social whole which applies social criteria 
for the eradication of what is harmful. This contrast may 
be pointed out here, simply to clear up the meaning of the 
concept of social suppression; not to exhaust the biological 
analogy from natural selection; for there are other phases, 
both of contrast and of similarity between the two kinds    
-P-A-G-E-110
    84 The Social Person 
  of selection, which would demand more extended treat- 
ment.! 
Understanding, then, that we are dealing with the social 
selection of the unfit with a view to their suppression, we 
have to ask, farther, what constitutes the ‘suppressive 
degree’ of unfitness? This question we shall find answered 
in the second clause of our formulation of the kind of 
natural heredity which the eligible social personality must 
have; and further remarks may be made under the con- 
sideration of that factor. I have stated it above in these 
words: ‘Al must be born to learn the same things.’ 
41. This is the second positive requirement. It sets 
the level of social attainment in the community in which 
each individual is born. The social inheritance is not an 
arbitrary requirement devised by an individual, nor by a

tition is sharp, natural selection ‘selects’ the fi//es¢ (Darwin, Spencer); while ina 
stationary environment or where competition is lax or adaptation general and 
good, only the very w#/it are eliminated (Pfeffer). Both of these are always at 
work, and every degree of selection is found between these extremes. So general 
contrasts are unsafe. For example, the contrast made by Professor Lloyd Morgan 
(Habit and Instinct, Chap. XII.), who thinks ‘conscious selection’ selects the 
best, while natural selection eliminates the poorest, is true only under certain 
well-defined conditions. The working of ‘social suppression,’ for example, is 
quite the reverse of what he attributes to ‘conscious selection,’ although it 
is ‘conscious.’ There is a conscious selection of the best going on in society, 
both of individuals and of experiences, thoughts, plans, ideals; these might be 
called respectively ‘social selection’ (through competition), and ‘imitative 
selection’ (through the imitative propagation of ideas from person to person). 
Cf. Sects. 120, 305 f. And there is also another form of conscious selection, of 
person by person where preference and liking or aversion of whatever kind come 
in, as seen conspicuously in matrimony, spoken of immediately below (Sects. 42, 
43), which is not of the best, but of what may be described as the ‘socially avail- 
able.’ This might be called ‘personal selection,’ leaving ‘sexual selection’ to 
the animals, where immediate reproduction is the motive. See note to Sect. 307, 
and Appendix B (omitted after the 2d ed. since the matter is incorporated in 
the work, Development and Evolution, Chap. XII, § 2).

class; nor is it a convention by which each or any indi- 
vidual agrees to give up his so-called private rights. On 
the contrary, there is a possible standard of general recog- 
nition, and a possible recognition of the existing standard 
with social progress in both of these, only in so far as the 
physical heredity of the individual sets toward the learn- 
ing of just the sort and variety of relationships which 
the social tradition imposes. A community is impossible 
in which the majority are born so anti-social that they 
resist the social tradition or cannot absorb it; since the 
factor of personal heredity, tending to individual idiosyn- 
crasy, would then swamp the factor of social heredity, tend- 
ing to social organization. The principle of ‘suppression 
of the unfit’ would cease its operation ; there would be no 
established representative of social utility to prevent the 
indulgence of the personal as against the social factor, 
and society would be ¢so facto abolished. Such a state 
of things is in sight in the opinion of Max Nordau: the 
physical heredity of the degenerate represents a strain of 
social decay, and the appeal must be made to the possible 
existence of a larger community whose physical heredity 
is still so unified in its tendencies that its representatives 
keep alive the social tradition, and so select out and frown 
down— or print down, to adopt the method of the prophet, 
Herr Nordau —the degenerates by birth. 
In saying, therefore, that in any social community the 
natural heredity of the individuals must be such that they 
all may learn the same things, I simply mean that the 
limits of individual variation must lie inside the possible 
attainment of the social heritage by each person. In the 
actual attainment of this ideal any society finds itself 
embarrassed by refractory individuals, all too numerous ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  
86 The Social Person 
the variations which overrun these limits are always 
many. But social progress and even social stability de- 
mand that this tendency to chaos shall never actually 
annul the operation of the requirement which represents 
the social life as such. It is the duty of each individual 
to be born a man of the social tendencies which his com- 
munal tradition requires of him; if he persist in being 
born a different sort of man, then, as far as his varia- 
tion goes, he is liable to be found a criminal before the 
bar of public conscience and law, and to be suppressed 
in an asylum or a reformatory, in Siberia or in the potter’s 
field! 
42. I think we are able now to see somewhat more 
clearly the relation of the two factors ordinarily called 
heredity and environment. Apart from the presence of 
variations, they are both common property. For the 
natural heredity of the individual must in its develop- 
ment lift the individual into participation in the social 
store and in the tradition administered by the organization 
called the environment ; and on the other hand, the envi- 
ronment, being only the general sphere of the operation 
of the collective heredities of the individuals and of their 
fathers, must draw out, confirm, establish, the individual 
in these natural inherited tendencies which all have in 
common. The social influences which act upon the 
individual, therefore, do not and cannot represent, in the 
language of a recent writer,! ‘a cycle of causation’ quite 
apart from that represented by the physiological processes 
which operate in physical heredity. They constitute, it 
is true, separate spheres of causation; we cannot substi- 
tute a social cause for a physical cause, or the reverse. 
1 William James, Atlantic Monthly, 1880, Will to Believe, p. 220 f.
-P-A-G-E-113
Social Suppression of the Unfit 87 
But they are not disparate, in the sense that each runs its 
course without ‘interference from the other; on the con- 
trary, social life acts as a constant check upon ‘sports’ as 
such, and upon unsocial hereditary tendencies in general.! 
43. But not only is there this suppression of the unfit 
individuals after they are born, and the consequent check- 
ing of their influence both physical and moral; there is a 
more direct interference of social with physical heredity. 
The sphere of physical heredity is encroached upon, and 
the direction of its issue changed, by every influence in 
the environment which comes to throw possible parents 
together or to separate them; and these influences are 
often the social barriers or inducements which the ‘social 
environment’ prescribes. 
This I may illustrate by an example. In the southern 
United States there is a social barrier to the intermarriage 
of blacks and whites. It is part of the unwritten law of 
polite society. The result is that there continue to bea 
white population and a black population existing side by 
side, the mixed element of the population being for the 
most part of illegitimate origin from black females. This 
keeps the white race pure, while there is a growing race 
of mulattoes and a diminishing race of blacks. The 
cycles of causation represented by these different races 
are distinctly held in physical bounds by the social cycle. 
Suppose, on the contrary, a generation of whites should 
be born who should forget the social sentiment. now ex- 
isting, or that a sufficient number of Northern whites, 
who do not regard such a barrier, should migrate to the 
South and marry freely with the blacks; then the only 
1 At the same time it may well be an undertaking of the social reformer to 
render this sort of control much more effective. The reverse — the action of 
the physical upon the social —is discussed in Sect. 313 @, 3 
{

    88 The Social Person 
future society would be one of legitimate mulattoes. In 
this case we should have to say that the series of terms 
representing the causes and effects in the physiological 
cycle had become different simply from a change in social 
sentiment, or from the inrush of men and women of dif- 
ferent social heredity. It is not needful to cite instances 
from history, although many might be cited; for the 
reasons already suggested for believing that neither series 
of phenomena can be free from constant action and re- 
action with the other are sufficiently convincing. It is 
only necessary to put a single corollary in a little clearer 
evidence to make the bearing of this identity of tendency 
in the two orders of heredity quite clear, for the average 
activities of ordinary individuals. 
44. This general corollary, or rather restatement, of a 
position already reached in our study, concerns the individ- 
ual, considered as one in a number —the same, therefore, 
being true of each —who live and act together in society. 
It concerns the results of his social learning all the way 
along through the different stages of his education for his 
place and work in life. These results, at whatever age 
or in whatever condition we find the person, must mean 
that he has substantially the same standards of social 
value, personal and ethical worth, and in general the same 
sense of fitness in all the variety of meanings which this 
term can have in its application to human beings, their 
institutions, and their inventions, which he finds reflected 
also in the social group in which he moves. His opinion 
of others must be referred to the same standards by which 
he judges himself; and their opinion of him must, for the 
same reasons, agree with his, in both these directions of its 
application. This is the saving rule of all organizations  
-P-A-G-E-115
Social Suppression of the Unfit 89 
of a social kind which have any call to live. For if we 
admit that the average individual’s judgments are in the 
main and intrinsically at variance with the social judg- 
ments of his time and place, how can there be any social 
judgments? For the social judgment is in some way the 
judgment of the individuals, acting in a social way; and 
if there be no area of common judgment among the indi- 
viduals, then there can be in so far no social standards. 
This follows without doubt from the considerations already 
adduced concerning the respective limits of social and 
physical heredity. 
45. It also follows from another line of considerations 
which have been presented at some length. I refer to 
the method of growth of the individual in attaining his 
sense of himself as a personal and social agent. His 
progress, ze, the child’s, has been dwelt upon at some 
length just to make clear this point,—his absolute de- 
pendence upon the continual presence of suitable personal 
environment. These suggestions which come to him from 
others are realized in himself, and his thought of another 
is—not stands for, or represents, or anything else than 
zs —his thought of himself, until he adds to it a further 
interpretation ; the further interpretation is in turn, first 
himself, then is—again nothing short of this zs—his 
thought of the other. And so the play goes on, and so 
he grows. But all the while here is the essential thing: 
he has not two persons to think of, his ego and the other 
man’s, the alter; not at all. He has only one body of 
personal data. This he reads one way for himself and 
the other way for the other. And so how can he have 
two classes of judgments to pass upon this one personal 
thought? In condemning, approving, loving, hating, com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  90 The Social Person 
mending, reviling, — in all the judgments passed on per- 
sonality as such, —he criticises personality, and all he says 
holds for himself as for his neighbour; for the two selves 
are but terms of opposition in the movement of his per- 
sonal growth. And this is true of the other man’s per- 
sonal growth as well; so he must also include my person 
in his judgments. His personal data are identical in the 
main with those by which I grow. His judgments, then, 
both of himself and of me, must be in the main the same 
as my judgments both of myself and of him.1 
46. So the conclusion seems quite safe. It follows 
both from the theory of social heredity, and also from 
the theory of the individual’s personal growth. This 
collateral argumentation is in itself the strongest proof 
of the truth of the conclusion. For it is the first re- 
quirement of a theory of society that it shall have ade- 
quate views of the progress of the social whole, which shall 
be consistent with the psychology of the individual’s per- 
sonal growth. It is this requirement, I think, which has 
kept the science of society so long in its infancy; or, at 
least, this in part. Psychologists have not had sufficient 
genetic theory to use on their side; and what theory they 
had seemed to forbid any attempt to interpret social prog- 
ress in its categories. As soon as we come to see, how- 
ever, that the growth of the individual does not forbid this 
individual’s taking part in the larger social movement as 
well, and, moreover, reach the view that in his growth he 
* is at once also growing into the social whole, and in so far 
aiding its further evolution — then we seem to have found 
a bridge on which it is safe to travel, and from which we 
can get vistas of the country on both sides. 
1 This anticipates detailed conclusions reached later on.

  Social Variations gi 
§ 4. Social Variations 
47. Ever since Darwin propounded the principle of 
‘natural selection,’ the word ‘variation’ has been current. 
The student in natural science has come to look for varia- 
tions as the necessary preliminary to any new step of 
progress and adaptation in the sphere of organic life. 
Nature solves the problem of selection in the simplest of 
ways. The young born in the same family are naturally 
unlike; ‘variations’ occur. If all cannot live, the best of 
the variations live, and the others die. Those that do live 
have thus, to all intents and purposes, been ‘selected.’ 
Now, this way of looking at. problems which involve 
aggregates of individuals and their distribution is becom- 
ing a habit of the age. Wherever the application of the 
principles of probability do not explain a statistical result, 
—that is, wherever there seem to be influences which 
favour particular individuals at the expense of others,— 
men turn at once to the principle of variations for the 
justification of this seeming partiality of nature. And 
what it means is that nature is partial to individuals 7 
making them, in their natural endowment, rather than 
after they are born. 
Of course the resources of this doctrine of variations 
are available for social questions in so far as physical 
heredity is still the bridge from generation to generation 
of social men. However we may limit the influence of 
physical transmission and emphasize that of social trans- 
mission, yet the great fact that men are born dissimilar, 
mentally and morally as well as physically, must have a 
place in all theories of social life. A word may be in order 
here in the way of description of some of the more marked 
social variations.
-P-A-G-E-118
  92 The Social Person 
48. First, there is the idiot. He is not available, from 
a social point of view, because his variation is too great 
on the side of defect. He shows from infancy that he is 
unable to enter into the social heritage because he cannot 
learn to do social things. His intelligence does not grow 
with his body. Society pities him if he be without natural 
protection, and puts him away in an institution. So of 
the insane, the pronounced lunatic; he cannot consistently 
sustain the wide system of social relationships which 
society requires of each adult individual. Either he is 
unable to take care of himself, or he attempts the life of 
some one else, or he is the harmless unsocial thing who 
wanders among us like an animal, or stands in his place 
like a plant. He is not a factor in social life; he is not 
to share the inheritance. 
Then there is the extraordinary class of people whom 
we may describe by a stronger term than those already 
employed. We find not only the unsocial, the negatively 
unfit, those whom society excludes with pity in its heart; 
but there are also the anti-social, the class whom we usually 
designate as criminals. These persons, like the others, are 
variations ; but they seem to be variations in quite another 
way. They do not represent lack on the intellectual side, 
always or alone, but on the moral side, on the social side, 
as such; for morality is in its origin and practical bear- 
ings a social thing. The least we can say of the criminals, 
is that they tend by heredity, or by evil training, to violate 
the rules which society has seen fit to lay down for the 
general security of men acting together in the enjoyment 
of the social heritage. So far, then, they are factors of 
disintegration, of destruction; enemies of the social prog- 
ress which proceeds from generation to generation by
-P-A-G-E-119
Social Judgment 9 3 
just this process of social heredity. So society says to the 
criminal, also, ‘you must perish.’ We kill off the worst of 
them, imprison the bad for life, attempt to reform the rest. 
They too, then, are excluded from the heritage of the past. 
Then finally, with all these, and with the countless cases of 
less prominent variation in one direction or another, we 
find a type of variation which, though taking different 
forms, presents one of the most critical and interesting 
topics of social study, the genius. With him we have to 
deal later on. 
§ 5. Social Judgment 
49. There grows up, in all the interchange of sugges- 
tion among you, me, and the others, in all the give-and-take 
between us now described, an obscure sense of a certain 
social understanding about ourselves generally — of a Zezt- 
geist, an atmosphere, a taste, or, in minor matters, a style. 
It is a very peculiar thing, this social spirit. The best 
way to understand that you have it, or something of what 
it is, is to get into a circle in which it is different. The 
common phrase ‘fish out of water’ is often heard in refer- 
ence to it. But that does not serve for science. The 
next best thing that I can do in the way of a preliminary 
rendering of it is to appeal to another word which has a 
popular sense, the word ‘judgment.’ Let us say that there 
exists in every society a general system of values, found 
in social usages, conventions, institutions, and formulas, 
and that our ‘judgments’ of social life are founded on our 
habitual recognition of these values, and of the arrange- 
ment of them which has become more or less fixed in our 
society. For example, to say ‘you are welcome’ to a dis- 
agreeable neighbour, shows good social judgment in a small  
-P-A-G-E-120
  94 The Social Person 
matter. Not to quarrel with the homceopathic enthusiast 
who meets you in the street and wishes to doctor your 
rheumatism out of a symptom book—that is good judg- 
ment. In short, the man gets to show more and more, as 
he grows up from childhood, @ certain good judgment ; and 
his good judgment is also the good judgment of his social 
set, community, or nation. The psychologist might prefer 
to say that a man ‘feels’ this; perhaps it would be better 
for psychological readers to say simply that he has a 
‘sense’ of it; but the popular use of the word ‘judgment’ 
fits so accurately into the line of distinctions I am making 
that I shall adhere to it. And so we reach the general 
position that the eligible candidate for social life must have 
good judgment, as represented by the common standards 
of judgment of his people.1 
It may be doubted, however, whether this sense of social 
values is the outcome of suggestion operating through- 
out the term of one’s social education. That we have 
endeavoured to show in the earlier chapter on the child’s 
personal growth. It will appear true, I trust, to any one 
who may take the pains to observe the child’s tentative 
endeavours to act up to the social usages of the family and 
school. One may then actually see the growth of the sort 
of judgment which I am describing. Around the funda- 
mental movement of his personal growth all the values of 
1 An interesting phenomenon under this head is that usually described 
as the influence of example on personal belief. What we call persuasion is 
largely the suggestion of the emotion which accompanies strong conviction, 
with the corresponding influence which the emotion suggested has upon the 
logical relationships apprehended by the victim.” — Baldwin, Mind, January, 
1894, p. 50. Later discussions show in more exact terms what this implies 
psychologically, The statement in the text is preliminary. Cf. Chap, IIL, 
§§ 1, 3.  
-P-A-G-E-121
Social Judgment 95 
his life have their play. So I say that his sense of truth 
regarding the social relationships of his environment is the 
outcome of his very gradual learning of his personal place 
in these relationships. 
50. We reach the conclusion, therefore, from this part of 
our study, that the socially unfit person is the person of poor 
judgment. He may have learned a great deal in some 
directions ; he may in the main reproduce the activities 
required by his social tradition; but with it all he is, in 
some degree, out of joint with the general system of esti- 
mated values by which society is held together. This 
appears to be true even of the pronounced types of unsocial 
individuals. The criminal is a man of poor judgment. It 
may be that he has a bad strain of natural heredity, what 
the theologians call ‘original sin’; he is then an ‘habitual 
criminal’ in Ferri’s distinction of types. Any sense of 
his failure to accept the teachings of society may be quite 
absent, crime being so normal to him. But the fact 
remains that in his social judgment he is mistaken ; his 
normal is not society’s normal. He has failed to be edu- 
cated in the judgments of his fellows, however besides, and 
however more deeply, he may have failed. Or, again, the 
criminal may commit crime simply because he is carried 
away in an eddy of good companionship, which represents 
a temporary current of social influence; or yet again, his 
nervous energies may be overtaxed temporarily or drained 
of their force, so that his education in social judgment is . 
forgotten. In all these cases he is the ‘ occasional crimi- 
nal’; but it is yet true of him also, that while he is a 
criminal, while he has yielded to temptation, has gratified 
private impulse, he has then lost his social balance, he is 
no longer socially sane. In it all he shows the lack of that

sustaining force of social consciousness which represents 
the level of righteous judgment in his time and place. 
Then as to the idiot, the imbecile, the insane — they, too, 
have no good judgment, for the very adequate but pitiful 
reason that they have no judgment at all. 
§ 6. Conception of the Social Person 
51. It may be well at this stage of our inquiry to em- 
phasize the main conclusion to which our discussions have 
led, although the repetition may be unnecessary to many 
readers. Yet for the clearer understanding of the general 
positions involved in the further expositions of the essay, I 
venture to make this further statement. 
All our thought has led us to see that one of the histori- 
cal conceptions of man is, in its social aspects, mistaken. 
Man is not a person who stands up in his isolated majesty, 
meanness, passion, or humility, and sees, hits, worships, 
fights, or overcomes, another man, who does the opposite 
things to him, each preserving his isolated majesty, mean- 
ness, passion, humility, all the while, so that he can be 
considered a ‘unit’ for the compounding processes of social 
speculation. On the contrary, a man is a social outcome 
rather than a social unit. He is always, in his greatest 
part, also some one else. Social acts of his — that is, acts 
which may not prove anti-social —are his decause they are 
society's first; otherwise he would not have learned them 
nor have had any tendency to do them. Everything that 
he learns is copied, reproduced, assimilated, from his 
fellows; and what all of them, including him,—all the 
social fellows,—do and think, they do and think be- 
cause’ they have each been through the same course of 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
  Conception of the Social Person 97 
copying, reproducing, assimilating, that he has. When he 
acts quite privately, it is always with a boomerang in his 
hand; and every use he makes of his weapon leaves its 
indelible impression both upon the other and upon him. 
It is on such truths as these which recent writers 1 have 
been bringing to light that the philosophy of society must 
be gradually built up. Only the neglect of such facts can 
account for the present state of social discussion. Once 
let it be our philosophical conviction, drawn from the more 
general results of psychology and anthropology, that man 
is not two, an ego and an alter, each of which is in active 
and chronic protest against a third great thing, society ; 
once dispel this hideous un-fact, and with it the remedies 
found by the egoists,—back all the way from the 
modern Individualists to Hobbes,—and I submit the 
main barrier to the successful understanding of society 
is removed. 
52. Perhaps no better illustration of the point of view 
which I wish to leave prominently in the reader’s mind 
can be reached than to cite its contrast with that of the 
recent book by Mr. Kidd on Social Evolution. His whole 
conception hinges on the view that the individual can get 
no ‘rational sanction’ for social life. He must then either 
rebel against society or strangle his ‘reason.’ According 
to Mr. Kidd he does the latter and, by espousing a super- 
natural sanction found in some religious system, acts — by 
inference — 7zrrationally. But why are his selfish and anti- 
social impulses the only rational part of the man? Does 
not the most superficial consideration of the origin of man, 
to say nothing of the teaching of the first principles of 
psychology, show that the indulgence of these impulses is

  98 The Social Person 
in many instances irrational? Action on his real, most 
complex, richest thought, is rational, as a later chapter (on 
‘Sanctions,’ Chap. IX.) aims to show in detail; and if the 
author of Social Evolution is right in saying that religion 
serves as the mainspring of this kind of action, then re- 
ligion has here, in some degree, its rational justification.? 
1 See also Sect. 178. 
2 It may be unnecessary, except for the sake of clearness, to note that the 
place of the individual inside a group is here in question, his position in 
his own society. Questions of the relations of groups inter se, and the cor- 
responding characters of individuals, are only incidentally involved.

  Part II 
THE INVENTIVE PERSON 
CHAPTER III 
INVENTION VS. IMITATION 
53. THE recent literature of the social life in which the 
imitative functions have had so much emphasis, has tended, 
in the minds of some, to obsctire the great facts of inven- 
tion ; while the same tendency has prevented others from 
giving the facts of imitation due weight. In the pages 
above I have tried as far as may be to keep to the natural 
history standpoint, tracing what seemed to be clearly imita- 
tive and giving a genetic view of the rise of the notion of 
self without raising the question one way or the other as to 
the mind’s initiation of what is new and inventive. This 
question cannot be put off permanently, however; and I now 
propose to take it up for direct discussion. How does the 
mind invent anything new? Or, put conversely: How far is 
what we call invention really the creation of something new? 
This question may be approached, I think, most profit- 
ably from the side of the child’s early development. And 
this approach to it has the advantage of giving us results 
in direct relation to those already reached in the discussions 
of the imitative factor in the growth of the personal sense. 
If the child is inventive at all, he must show it in connec- 
tion with the attainments which he makes everywhere; even 
99

  100 Invention vs. Imitation 
  in those attainments which we find reason for calling imita- 
tive. We cannot divide the child into two parts, two realities 
coming up to the facts of life with different capabilities, one 
fitted only to imitate, and the other fitted to invent. Of 
course it is the same child whatever he does; and if he be 
gifted with the power of invention at all, this power should 
show itself in all that he does — even in his imitations. 
This general claim may be enforced by the examination 
of the child’s very imitations. Such a direct appeal to 
fact, if adequately carried out, should be worth any amount 
of abstract discussion of the merits of imitation and inven- 
tion in the mental life generally, in which —as is so often 
the case—the two types of function are considered by 
definition at the start as far removed from each other as 
the letters ‘vs.’ put between them would suggest. In the 
opinion of many, an act is either imitative or inventive, 
and in performing it the child is either a creator or a 
slave. The phrases ‘divine creation’ and ‘slavish imita- 
tion’ are common enough. 
§ 1. The Process of Invention 
54. Yet before we go to the child, our inquiry may be 
abbreviated by a little more definition of the term ‘inven- 
tion,’ as the present state of psychological knowledge ena- 
bles us to set its limitations from the outset. There is no 
question in psychological circles to-day of the absolute men- 
tal creation which was formerly assumed. The newer doc- 
trine (1) of ‘mental content,’ on the one hand, which holds 
that no elements of representation can get into conscious- 
ness except as they have been already present in some form 
in presentation ; and, on the other hand, (2) the doctrine 
that the activities of consciousness are always conditioned
-P-A-G-E-127
  The Process of Invention 101 
on the content of presentation and representation present 
at the time—these positions make it impossible to hold 
that the agent or the mind can make anything for itself 
‘out of whole cloth,’ so to speak. The former of these 
views, held now by everybody, leads us to look in all cases 
of imagination — even in all cases of invention —for ele- 
ments of construction themselves more or less familiar 
beforehand to the thought of the person who makes the 
invention. The phrase ‘imagination is constructive, not 
creative’ has crept into all the text-books, even into 
those whose authors find some other ground for holding 
that absolute initiations may be possible to consciousness 
itself. We have the right, therefore, to draw our lines 
somewhere inside this view of current psychology. 
The other doctrine referred to is, I think, equally well 
established, although not so generally known in popular 
statement as the former. Psychologists look upon the 
activities felt in consciousness as being in some way 
involved with the mechanism of movement — either the 
movements of the muscular system or with the phases of 
the attention—and then find these movements of both 
kinds expressions of the content then in consciousness. 
What we do is always a function of what we think} 
If these principles be true, there is a certain way in 
which consciousness might still be inventive. We might 
say that the activities of consciousness in some way give 
a new shape, form, synthesis, sifting, zo the very contents 
out of which they themselves arise. 
55. Even with this narrow limitation, there are again 
1See The Power of Thought, by J. D. Sterrett, for a detailed popular state- 
ment of this. Guyau, Zducation and Heredity, Chap. I., also draws impres- 
sive lessons from it.
-P-A-G-E-128
  102 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
two directions in which we might look for novelties in the 
mind. These two ways differ, however, in the ‘locus,’ 
so to speak, of the effective novelty or invention in the 
train of processes involved in a complete section of con- 
sciousness. We might say (1) that the novel or original 
idea came into consciousness just from the mingling 
together in memory, imagination, etc., of the disjecta 
membra of earlier thoughts, perceptions, etc., in new and 
varied combinations: that on one hand. Or we might say 
(2) that the novelty was introduced among the forms into 
which the actions, the endeavours, the efforts, of the life 
of conduct tend to bring the earlier memories, imagina- 
tions, and thoughts. 
1. In the former case, we should find all the various 
forms in which our fancies unite struggling to get place in 
our apperceptive systems and to discharge themselves in 
action ; and the valuable ones would get their value from 
their success in bringing about satisfactory results. The 
criteria of an invention, as opposed to a mere accidental 
and worthless fancy, would be its subsequent selection, 
and there would be no way of discounting beforehand the 
chances of any of them! The great question would be 
1 This would seem to be the position of W. James in his admirable Chap- 
ter XXVIII. in Vol. Il. of Principles of Psychology. His main contention 
is that in their origin the forms of thinking are variations ‘independent of 
experience.’ I do not find that he takes up in detail the question as to how 
these variations are subsequently selected, although he admits that for natural 
scientific knowledge they must be (/oc. cit., II., p. 636). If it be by experi- 
ence that this selecting is done—as it must be—and if the individual’s 
selected variations are reproduced in subsequent generations through natural 
and organic selection (see Appendix A) as well as by social transmission, 
then we have mental evolution directed by experience after all—even as 
regards the pure and ‘elementary’ categories —in a way which escapes the 
criticisms cogently urged by James against the ‘race-experience’ hypothesis
-P-A-G-E-129
  The Process of Invention 103 
left over: How do the real inventions get selected as 
permanent and valuable acquisitions? This question it is 
which would force us to review the whole theory of the 
origin of thought and its utility in organic and mental 
evolution. This cannot be done here,! but we may 
assume the general result that it is by action that their 
value is to be tested. If it be said with some that con- 
sistency with earlier thought is the test, then we may 
say that it is by action that all this earlier thought has 
been tested, and it is through action that the thoughts 
already acquired as valuable are held together in a system. 
The very test of consistency means synergy, or unity of 
action. It is, then, a short step to the view that it is 
preferably from the basis of the active achievements 
already secured that the new combinations or interpre- 
tations which are real inventions arise. This leads us to 
the second possible view. 
2. On this view the new combinations secured for the 
inventive life are not the chance outcome of the revived 
fragments of memory and fancy ; they are rather the new 
forms into which the materials of our thought are cast 
as the result of variations in our actions in the process 
of adaptation to the ends of utility. It is by adapted 
action that our mental life is held together in great con- 
sistent thought-systems; and it is by new refinements 
upon these adapted and correlated actions that new varia- 
tions are introduced into the systems of our coherent 
of Spencer: and this even on James’ suppositions. There would thus be a 
progressive coincidence between what is 2 priori to the individual (arising as 
variation, then selected and inherited) and what is ¢rue to experience in the 
evolution of the race. 
11 have already considered this topic in detail in my earlier volume on 
Mental Development.  
-P-A-G-E-130
104 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
  thought. The criteria of the value of these new elements of 
thought are again their issue in action; and they have to 
be actually tested : but that they issue from the platform of 
accomplished systems and accomplished accommodations 
renders their good quality the more likely from the start. 
On this second view, which I give as the true one, 
the process of selection goes on from a level of earlier 
mental attainment,! while, on the other view, each inven- 
tion is a casual outcome from among all the possible 
creations of fancy. The question of the actual opera- 
tion of the selection, both in its objective tests and in 
the brain-processes involved, is left for a later page.” 
Both views, however, assume the existence of variations 
in brain-processes; one places them on the receptive or 
sensory side, and the other in the motor or active side. 
One says, we are liable to all sorts of imaginations; some 
of these prove valuable and true. The other says, we are 
capable of thoughts which are valuable and true because 
they are held in a system by the processes of action and 
attention; when these processes vary, some of the varia- 
tions give better and truer thoughts. 
56. It is true, the latter would also say, that we do 
imagine all sorts of things, but it is not to these imagin- 
ings that we often look for the valuable inventions.’ 
1 This, it is evident, makes the determination of mental evolution in the 
lines of experience —as indicated in the note on page 93—still more direct, 
seeing that the variations from which the selections are made are themselves 
distributed about the mean of earlier adaptations. This gives what I have 
called in a later discussion the ‘systematic determination’ of thought (Psych. 
Rev., January, 1898). 
2 § 3 of this chapter, on ‘ Selective Thinking.’ 
8 Since this was written, the article of W. M. Urban (Psych. Rev., July, 
1897) has appeared, with an interesting discussion. Dr. Urban agrees with 
the position taken here to the extent of holding that new thoughts arise
-P-A-G-E-131
  The Process of Invention 105 
This last position is proved from the comparison of 
the two fields of fancy and thought respectively. We 
rarely come upon a valuable combination in our revery, 
or in our dreaming, or in our’ rumination in subjects 
which we have not studiously explored. The inventions 
come from hard thinking, steady application, casting about 
of attention, trained and conscious direction of the opera- 
tions of mind. The valuable variations, therefore, are 
already more or less détermined, as a whole, in their 
direction, by reason of the ‘particular system in which 
they occur. These systems have arisen under the rule of 
certain objective marks or coefficients of belief in the 
different spheres of truth.? 
57. This general view, I may also add, is consistent 
with the psychological requirements already laid down. 
We saw that a new invention must be made out of old 
material, and must come just through the activity which 
it is the function of this old material to arouse. The view 
presented fulfils both these requirements. It makes the 
new thought in each instance one of the possible synthe- 
ses of earlier thoughts ; and then it has just the advantage 
over the other view spoken of, that it makes the variation 
which issues in the invention, a variation in the legiti- 
mate active processes arising from approximately similar 
thoughts. The whole process is a circular one. Here, let 
us say, are thoughts which issue in movements adapted to 
these thoughts. Variations in these movements react to 
from the platform of the earlier apperceptive (his ‘imaginative’ ) processes, 
which he likewise makes imitative. His views are noticed again below, 
where the selecting processes are discussed (Sect. 78). 
1 For the discussion of these criteria of belief see the psychologies. In my 
Handbook, I1., Chap. VII., they are classified under the term ‘ coefficients.’
-P-A-G-E-132
106 Invention vs. Imitation 
produce variations in the thoughts. Some of these thought- 
variations are selected and held for ‘true.’!_ These are the 
inventions. 
So with the formula: what we do is a function of what 
we think; we have this other: what we shall think is 
a function of what we have done. 
§ 2. The Child’s Inventions? 
58. This latter view, then, —if it be true and if, as was 
said, both the content and the activity are conditioned upon 
1 The view has been current (Bain, James) that thought is due genetically 
to the obstruction, or damming back of movement, the energies which would 
otherwise have discharged in movements being thus used in building up the 
mechanism of thought. I have never seen this position adequately defended 
on psychological grounds. It seems to me to offer insurmountable difficul- 
ties. The question may be asked: How do the existing correspondences 
arise between the thoughts about the external world, let us say, and the 
actual conditions existing in the world as discovered by movement? In 
other words, how can thoughts be true? It is quite natural to suppose that 
the existing adapted or fact-revealing movements have gone before, and that 
thought is in some way a form of inner re-establishing, without constant depend- 
ence on real objects, of the system of values first revealed by such movements. 
On this view the growth of thought would be by a series of brain-variations 
which produced in the mind a ‘copy-system’ of the actual relations of the 
world first reported, or at least contributed to, by movement. The move- 
ment-variations would go ahead of the thought-variations, and the growth of 
thought would depend upon successful movement, rather than upon its obstruc- 
tion and damming up. On the ‘obstruction’ view, on the contrary, the thought- 
variations could prove their value, or get to be judged true, only through their 
issue in movement; and besides the difficulty of doing this under the con- 
ditions of obstruction (whatever that means), there would have to be the 
same selecting process acting upon movements, which would have been in- 
yoked in case the simple movement-variations went ahead. It seems to me 
to involve, when we reflect upon it, a sort of cart-before-the-horse all through 
the evolution of mind. It is much truer to the facts to say that simple 
motor adaptations — in ¢hinking they are adaptations of attention — go before 
thought, and that the brain-variations which perpetuate and stand for these 
adaptations are ipso facto selected in the selection of the movements; with 
them come the true thoughts.

Aug., 1897. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  The Child’s Inventions 107 
the growth of experience, — ought to get some support from 
the careful examination of the growth of the child’s experi- 
ence at the very time when he seems to be most clearly 
illustrating both of the limitations imposed by psychology 
upon his originality. In childhood he is most clearly sub- 
ject to these limitations, because then he is mainly a 
learner. He does not turn out many startling inventions 
then; at least, they are not startling to others, however 
they may seem so to him. As a matter of fact, we can 
usually see whence he has derived most of the material 
of his thought, and by what kinds of reaction upon his mate- 
rial he has come to get it into the forms which his little 
inventions present. 
The task, therefore, to which we bring ourselves is a 
very plain and simple one: to detect in the inventions, — 
the games, sand-piles, toy-houses, statements, beliefs, etc., 
—of the child, any contributions he has himself made to 
the examples, situations, events, shapes of tool or thing, 
or what not, which stand ready at his hand and which he 
comes to perceive, think about, or act upon. In short, 
what does he as an individual contribute to the complexion 
of his own thought ? 
59. There are two general principles apparently involved 
in all a child’s originalities ; these two principles have grown 
up in my own mind as necessary interpretations of the 
observations which I have made of children in the last few 
years, and in the course of the meditating which I have 
done on the varied doings of childhood. I shall venture 
to state one of these principles at a time, in the form of a 
somewhat dogmatic-sounding opinion, and then go on to 
cite the evidence and give the illustrations upon which it 
is based, as far as space may permit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
    108 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
1. The child’s originalities are in great part the new 
ways in which he finds his knowledges falling together in 
consequence of his attempts to act to advantage on what he 
already knows. Or, made more brief, his originalities arise 
through his action, struggle, trial of things for himself in 
an imitative way. 
2. The child's originalities, further, ave in great measure 
the combinations of his knowledges which he feels justified 
in expecting to hold for others to act on also. 
60. These two statements I do not mean to make as 
two distinct principles operative apart or in opposition to 
each other, nor are they the expression of a chronological 
order in the child’s development; they rather present 
phases of the one fact of invention, and for convenience 
for reference we may call them respectively the ‘ personal 
phase’ and the ‘social phase.’ 
There is a further statement, also, which I may make of 
both of them before going on to consider them separately ; 
a statement which it is well to make in advance of its 
clearer formulation from the evidence, since it brings the 
topic well into connection with our earlier distinctions in 
the child’s development. This statement is to the effect 
that the child’s inventions are, in these two phases, reflec- 
tions of the twofold aspects of his own personal growth. 
It will be remembered that we found the child growing 
by the imitative absorption of material from the persons 
about him, in the first instance; and then, in the second 
instance, by legislating his own personal growth — the 
facts which he has found out about himself as a personal 
being — back into the persons around him again. Now 
the first phase of his inventive activity is shown in connec- 
tion with the first of these personal movements: he zs
-P-A-G-E-135
The Child’s Inventions 109 
original in the way he learns from others by taking in 
personal elements from them. And the second phase of 
his originality is a function of the other process of his 
personal growth, he ts original in the way he treats others, 
the way he disports himself in his intercourse with them. 
And the latter is a sort of test or proof of the value of the 
former to the child himself. 
61. I. We may now take up for fuller treatment the 
‘personal’ phase of the child’s inventions. 
In order to avoid repetition, use may be made of the 
results of the earlier pages devoted to the development of 
the child’s sense of his ego or personal self; and we may 
draw from the details the great fact that all his personal 
absorption from his immediate associates is through his 
tendency to imitate. The interesting character which 
draws him to this element or that in the man, woman, or 
child from whom he learns, is itself due to imitation; for 
his interests are really only the intellectual reflection of 
his habits, and his habits are the motor phenomena which 
have resulted from his earlier activities of the same imita- 
tive type. But quite apart from theory, we are constrained 
by the facts to say that the method of his personal progress 
is imitation. For if we say that he cannot do anything 
without some approximate ability to apprehend what he is 
to do —that is, without a content of revival of something 
already apprehended on an earlier occasion; and if we go 
on to enforce the other psychological truth put in evidence 
just above —that no action can take place which is not, in 
greater or less degree, the proper outcome of the motor 
energies of the revived content: admitting these two 
points, then the action which the child performs in any 
case must have an imitative character just in so far as 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  110 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
the habit which it tends to stimulate is true to the situa- 
tion outside him which the child observes; that is, in so 
far as he succeeds in learning. 
For example, say a child sees me finger a ring. He has 
certain habits of action. The content of his conscious- 
ness — my fingers — tends to start the one of his habits of 
action which is attached to other contents most nearly like 
this one, ze. his own fingers. But this movement of his 
fingers thus brought about is imitative; and the fact that 
it is imitative, that is, that it is the motor expression of a 
presentation like the one set before him — his finger sub- 
stituted for mine — this is the reason, and the only reason, 
that a movement takes place by which he learns. In other 
words, he can only learn by imitating; for if he only acts 
strictly on the revived elements of content which come up 
in his own consciousness from within, then he is acting 
strictly as he has acted before, and that teaches him noth- 
ing. On the other hand, he cannot act in ways absolutely 
new, for they come into his consciousness with no tendency 
to stir up any appropriate kinds of action. He cannot act 
suitably upon them at all. Hence it is only new presenta- 
tions which are assimilable to old ones that can get the 
benefit of the habits already attached to the old ones, and 
so lead to actions more or less suited to the new. But this 
is imitation. 
We have just been giving, as may have been evident, 
the basis of what is usually called the ‘instinct of imitation.’ 
The instinct to imitate operates by the use of the move- 
ments required to do the thing imitated. But unless the 
child has a sense of what movements will do it, he cannot 
produce them. This sense of the proper movements can 
only have come from the earlier performance of those
-P-A-G-E-137
The Child’s Inventions III 
  movements in connection with some other mental content. 
And the movements associated with another mental con- 
tent can be available for this content only if this new 
content can take the place of the old one in the motor 
scheme.! 
62. Now the reader asks at once: Does the child learn 
anything by such imitations? Is he not simply acting out 
his habits just the same whether it be the thought of his 
own fingers directly, or only the thought of them in- 
directly as suggested by the sight of some one else’s 
fingers, which brings out the movement ? 
To this last question we may answer, yes, at once. The 
child may not learn anything important simply by the 
movement, since it is very largely a movement which he 
has made before. But let us put the question more 
broadly and ask whether he learns anything by the situa- 
tion as a whole; that requires a very different answer. 
The question put by the reader may then be stated in 
general terms: How can the imitative situation operate to 
instruct the child? 
63. We must at once see that his own movements, his 
imitative actions, bring new elements into the situation. 
He has, just after he acts, three things in his mind— let 
us say in the case of the imitation of the movements of 
the fingers. First, he sees the movements of the other 
person ; then he has the memory of his own finger-move- 
ments (probably indeed both of his fingers as they look 
and of the movements of them as felt); then finally, the 
sight of his own finger-movements. Now two different 
things may happen, and which of the two it is to be will 
1 The mechanism of imitation is described in detail in my Mental Develop- 
ment, Chap. X., § 1, and Chap. XIII., § 2. On the use made of this function 
in this work see Chap. XIII. (third edition).
-P-A-G-E-138
112 Invention vs. Imitation 
  depend largely on the age of the child. He may learn 
something, and he may not. If he have already attained 
what is called ‘persistent imitation’ —the try-try-again 
tendency —or the more developed exercise of volition 
which comes through the exercise of persistent imitation, 
then he will learn. Indeed, then he cannot help learning. 
For he will see the inadequacy of his attempt in the 
first instance and then rally his forces to do better. This 
means that he will act again; but not as before simply 
upon the old sense of his own earlier finger-movements, 
but upon the whole threefold complex content which is 
now surging in his consciousness for expression. And 
added to it all, will be certain extraneous elements result- 
ing from his action: strains due to his attention, twitch- 
ings from his other limbs, rushings of blood to the head, 
pleasant emotional excitement, fatigue presently in the 
muscles used, etc. Now let us say he acts a second time. 
Here is again a new complexity of content, more varied, 
and as strange as the former one. Let him go on trying 
till he ‘hits it’— succeeds in making my finger-movements 
after me—and then ask whether this movement is all 
that the child has learned! 
64. Apart from the acquisition of the finger-combination 
which is his immediate object, he has learned a variety of 
things. Only the principal features of his learning may 
be mentioned here: the essentials of the fact of learning 
itself apart from the details of this particular finger-exer- 
cise. He learns we may say, first, a great number of 
combinations which are not those he is after. Each of the 
single efforts which he makes is a novelty to him, and each 
has its interesting features. Indeed, if we watch him, and 
especially if we withdraw the ‘copy’ which our finger-
-P-A-G-E-139
The Child’s Inventions 113 
combination sets before him, we may find his becoming so 
absorbed in the single efforts which he makes, the partial 
successes which crown his efforts, that he forgets to go on 
trying. He begins to reproduce his own combinations 
again and again, and so to learn them. So in each of his 
efforts, no matter how far removed it may be from the 
copy he sets out to imitate, in each of them he finds a 
possible combination of fruitful pursuit for his training and 
in many cases also fruitful for his utilities of movement. 
Then, again, another very valuable lesson; he learns 
the method of all learning. He begins to see that it is he 
who varies the copy by trying to reproduce it; that he 
turns out interesting combinations which are his own 
peculiar property. He stops in wonder before his own 
doings, and runs again to his elders or to his companions 
saying, ‘See what I can do.’ He thus grows to recognize 
himself as more than a mere imitator. He begins to see 
that it is just by this method of exercising themselves that 
the other persons from whom he is accustomed to learn 
get their facility in giving him new things to learn; and 
so he gradually apprehends that after all he is not entirely 
dependent upon them for the setting of new lessons to 
himself. He begins to be ina measure self-regulative in 
the tasks of his daily life. 
These are the two great aspects of his learning — both 
much more important than the mere acquisition of the 
single action which he sets out to do. In regard to that 
latter he is imitative, he is constrained by the copy, he is 
in a sense a slave, so far as it is legitimate to look at him 
as in any wise merely learning that one thing. The weak- 
minded are, in this sense, merely imitators; they learn 
only one thing at a time, and learn it by the direct com-
-P-A-G-E-140
  114 Invention vs. [Imitation 
pelling force of the copy set up before them and driven 
intothem. For them alone is it a sign of slavery to imitate. 
And to them it is so, merely because they have no capacity 
to be anything but slaves. Remove the bonds of their limi- 
tation —the bonds to imitation —and far from becoming 
free, they would perish. But the normal child —the child 
of restless attention, absorbing interests, the dawning 
sense of an agency of his own which is destined to set law 
in its turn to the world as well as to himself —he is never 
a slave even in his most strenuous imitations. And the 
further examination of his learning will show us as much. 
65. First, we may say that each of the situations which 
arises from his effort to reproduce the copy zs az invention 
of the child’s. It is so because he works it out; no one 
else in the world knows it nor can reproduce it. He aims, 
it is true, not at doing anything new; he aims at the 
thing the copy sets for him to imitate. But what he does 
differs both from this and from anything he has ever done 
before. It is a new synthesis of old material, of his old 
pictures of finger-movements, in this case, with the new 
picture presented to his eye, and his old strains of muscle, 
shortness of breath, rushing of blood, setting of glottis, 
bending of joints, etc. But the outcome —that is new, 
both in the new picture of finger-movements and in the 
setting together of the strains, organic sensations, and all. 
He has a new thing to contemplate and he is withal a new 
person to contemplate it. The plane of his being and 
contemplation is now a grade higher. 
66. We have already seen how it is that his sense of 
himself grows by these accretions from the elements of 
personality taken in by imitation, It is thus that the 
projective in the personal life of father, mother, etc., are
-P-A-G-E-141
The Child’s Inventions 115 
incorporated in his thought of his own subjective self. 
This new self, at each new plane, is also a real invention. 
The child not only becomes a self, not only acquires the 
sense of higher power, mastery, goodness, or whatever 
aspect of his personal growth the particular instance may 
illustrate; he does more. He makes it; he gets it for 
himself by his own action ; he achieves, invents it. And 
the same is true of all his knowledges. He never simply 
takes the knowledge of some one else. This it would be 
impossible for him to do. Even the weak-minded of 
whom I have spoken must have enough self-control to 
imitate, and enough assimilative capacity to hold together, 
in a new form, the elements which surge into his con- 
sciousness through and with his imitative act. But the 
active healthy child brings a new self up to a new object 
every time he acts in a way not entirely dictated by habit ; 
and the result ensuing, the second construction which then 
again follows his new act, is another invention for him to 
take delight in. The growth of self is seen in the growth 
of his demand that his results shall show constantly more 
independence of the external copy. The growing com- 
plexity and utility of the invention which he turns out is 
a new premium put in his thought upon the need of con- 
sidering himself more than an imitator. So he comes to 
view himself as a free man who, in an ever-increasing 
degree, bends nature and his fellow-man to his will, and 
to view what he does as a contribution to the arrange- 
ments and utilities of things. 
67. To illustrate how this works practically, we may 
take this instance from my child’s use of her building 
blocks. She sits on the floor and I ask her to make a 
church like the one she sees pictured in her book.  
-P-A-G-E-142
116 Invention vs. Imitation 
  She begins, lays the foundation of the church: a long 
line of blocks laid straight, with another line crossing the 
first about two-thirds of its length. Then suddenly her 
face lights up and she quickly takes more blocks and 
lays a third line parallel with the second and crossing the 
long line at one-third of its length. “What are you 
doing that for, I ask; I never taught you to make a 
church with two cross lines.” ‘Oh, no; I am making an 
animal,” says she, “with a head and a tail and four legs.” 
She has, to my knowledge, never made an animal like 
this before. And she certainly did not set out to make 
an animal. It had come to her in her progress with the 
church that the arrangement might be altered so as to 
make an animal. That is, her mental picture had come, 
in her action upon it, especially in laying the cross-line 
of blocks, to be assimilated with her old mental picture of 
an animal; and forthwith, by the addition of another line 
like the former, the church turned into an animal. 
Now this is an invention in the strictest sense, It is 
peculiar to the child. Who ever before made an animal 
out of a church? What external influence suggested to 
the child the similarity between the essential lines of the 
two objects? What former single mental picture of her 
own adequately explains this sudden outcome? If none 
of these, then all the sources are exhausted, and we must 
say that she is an inventor as much as any historical 
genius is who has enriched the world by his thought. 
68. But now the child does something further; she 
calls on everybody in the room to come and see the 
animal which she has made; she, no less than the first 
Maker of whom we are told, looks upon the thing that 
she hath made and, lo! it is very good. And then she
-P-A-G-E-143
  
The Child’s Inventions 117 
amuses herself by making the animal again and again, 
and saying also “it is not a church, for a church doesn’t 
have these two ends” (the third line across). “I have 
made it into an animal!” So—and this is her second 
invention —she has changed her thought of herself. To 
herself she is now a person who can make animals out 
of churches. She is in a new sense —or at least from a 
new point of view—an agent; her growing sense of her 
own originality, power over things, freedom to depart 
from the thraldom of imitation, has received an impulse. 
The next time she comes to play with the blocks, the 
splendid invention of this occasion is full in her mind, 
and the blocks, together with the suggestions which I 
make for their use, are to her things for her domineering 
ego to trifle with, despise, and utilize as never before. 
She has, therefore, come to a new thought of herself, and 
this is also a discovery, an invention. 
69. So numerous instances might be cited from the 
lives of my children, many more complex than this one, 
but all the same in the essential elements of the situation. 
And the great fact to be remarked is that which we 
formulated in the beginning: chat the result ts the out- 
come of the child’s action, of his personal struggle, in the 
first instance; and then, second, that the nature of his 
struggle is seen to be that of strenuous exercise of the 
habitual imitative activities which he has already acquired. 
The child’s originalities, are not bolts from the blue, 
nor earthquakes from below; they are simply his own 
interpretations, through his own action, of the situation 
which spreads its elements about him in the matter-of- 
fact doings of the life of habit. By exercising his habits 
in the new and original ways which strenuous imitation 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  118 Invention vs. Imitation 
allows, he finds out more both about himself and about the 
world. Then we observers find ourselves inquiring, from 
the point of view of our ignorance of the processes going 
on in his consciousness, how such a beautiful, true, useful 
thing could have come to be his discovery. 
So much may be said of the facts of the child’s originali- 
ties from the point of view of their origin; it remains to 
consider the second aspect of the case already pointed out 
above under the phrase ‘social phase’ of invention. It 
will be remembered that the aspect now put in evidence 
in some detail was described as the ‘personal phase’ of 
invention. 
7o. II. Coming to take up the so-called ‘social’ aspect 
of this question, we may again’state the general principle 
which the following pages are to illustrate: the principle 
that the child now, after having made his discovery, does 
not treat it as an individual possession, but considers it 
common property, for others as for himself, and then, 
withal, considers others subject to the same need of find- 
ing it true that he is. 
The first phase of originality we have found to have its 
mental motive in the child’s absorption of new elements 
of the personal and generally projective environment; he 
imitates, as has been made clear, and proves himself an 
inventor in the very midst of his imitations. The process 
is that of the first movement described in the theory of 
what was called in the earlier chapter a ‘dialectic of 
personal growth.’ The projective becomes subjective, and 
by so doing it becomes in each event an invention. But 
it will be remembered that the child understands others 
better by coming to better knowledge of himself. He 
reads out of himself the facts learned of himself; and so
-P-A-G-E-145
The Child’s Inventions 119 
lodges the richer thought of self also in the persons of 
others. This has been enlarged upon sufficiently in the 
earlier connection. 
Now this second aspect of his treatment of the material 
of his personal thought adds an interesting phase also to 
the meaning of his originalities. Whatever his construc- 
tions are, he reads them into the appropriate escort, con- 
nection, setting, in the world of persons and things around 
him. And the degree of success in this process, the degree 
of what we call truth which he finds his new syntheses 
attaining under this exaction, this is the measure of his 
learning. 
71. As to the method which the child pursues here, 
perhaps an example of what we call ‘inventive lies’ may 
serve us best. H. was guilty of the first lie of this kind, 
which I discovered, in her twenty-first month. On May 
27, 1891, I was busying myself with some students’ ex- 
amination papers which were tied up in bundles of a size 
to weigh about one to two pounds each. A number of 
these bundles had been piled up in the passage-way out of 
sight from where I sat; and as H. came in at the door I 
told her that she might help me by bringing them into the 
room. To this she gladly assented and began bringing 
them in one by one to the floor before my chair. Pres- 
ently she tired of the task, and I could see that she wished 
to leave off; her step grew slow and her countenance 
grave. Then, after bringing one of the bundles, she stopped 
before me, hesitated a moment, and then said ‘no moi’ (‘no 
more,’ meaning, ‘there are no more’). Knowing the real 
number of the packages, I suspected a certain kind of 
obliquity and so looked somewhat severe as I asked ‘are 
there really no more?’ She was evidently discomforted
-P-A-G-E-146
120 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
by the question and perhaps also by the manner of it; 
and after hesitating a moment or two looked out in the 
direction of the remaining packages and said ‘ moi’ (‘there 
are more’), and ran out to bring in another to show me. 
- This is an instance of what I have called an inventive lie; 
and it will throw light on the point which I wish to 
make. 
72. When we come to ask how it was that H. resorted 
to this device to avoid further work, we see that it is neces- 
sary to make certain presuppositions of what was going 
on in her consciousness. In the first place, there was in 
her mind a thought which went farther than the facts; 
she had to picture a situation in which the essential ele- 
ment was the absence of more of the packages in the 
original pile. This is at the outset an invention of the 
‘personal’ sort already described and explained in the fore- 
going passages. It has been through her action in bring- 
ing some of the bundles in from the passage that she has 
got what reason she has for the imagination that there 
are no more; that is, that she has brought them all. 
This we may suppose becomes a very familiar thought to 
her as she begins to grow fatigued; the thought of the 
situation when all should be done and she should be re- 
lieved. But now, in addition to this thought, there is 
of course the continued thought of the presence of the 
father, myself, as the director, the inciter, the one whose 
commendation is to be gained; and with this there is the 
further invention, arising also through her activities in 
social situations preceding this, the thought of the situa- 
tion when, the bundles all gone, her new self receives 
commendation from the parent whose work has been 
done for him. So far, clearly, we are proceeding on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
    
The Child’s Inventions 121 
rules of construction by action given in the first principle 
stated above. 
What is necessary, besides, to explain the child’s lie? 
This, I think: the thought that her construction of the 
situation ts also my construction of the situation, or would 
be if my thought went forth to the end of the task as hers 
does. All that is needed to effect this in my mind is the 
information that the bundles are all gone. That would 
make the invention true —just as true as if she went on 
with the work and finished it. The essence of the lie is 
just the adoption of this social device to produce convic- 
tion as a substitute for the ordinary actual facts. And this 
mental movement, on the part of the child, apart from its 
use in deceiving others as in this case, — which is taken 
only as a case of the broader phenomenon, not as the only 
or the most frequent case of children’s lies, — zs an element 
in all originality viewed as truth. As I have said above, 
it is the need which the child feels that others as well as 
himself think his original thoughts and act upon them as 
he does. In this case the child adopts a conscious social 
method—and adults do in their lies—to get this sec- 
ond element artificially attached to mental constructions 
which really lack it. Without it both her invention of the 
new situation and her thought of her new self, as having 
wrought the situation, are not true. 
73. Let me explain a little further what I conceive this 
second factor in invention to be. We may get at it pos- 
sibly better by looking at the child’s mental constructions 
negatively. Let us ask what distinguishes his inven- 
tions, his originalities, the things of some dignity and 
worth and truth, from mere imaginations or fancies as 
such? Certainly he has vain imaginations, no less than
-P-A-G-E-148
  122 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
we adults; and the real originalities, the truthful ones, 
must have some distinguishing mark. 
This question presents itself in a very broad way to 
general psychology ; and I may at once assume the result 
that in the criterion established by our first principle — 
z.e., that it is by action and thought upon real things, 
copies, events, that the true inventions arise—we have 
confirmed the conclusion reached theoretically above, which 
rules out the vagaries of mere fancy, or so-called ‘passive’ 
imagination. The outcome of fancy, or in general of 
imagination uncontrolled by present reality or by the atti- 
tude of strenuous thinking and action upon a real situa- 
tion, is generally worthless. So when I ask how the 
ordinary creations of the mind, in its normal pursuit of 
truth, and in the midst of its full struggles for consistent 
and enlightened conduct, fall short of being true inven- 
tions, it is a closer question, the very necessity for which 
is often overlooked. It is this, in the terms of my child’s 
lie: what is the value, to the child’s construction, of the 
further acceptance of it by me which she tells the ‘lie’ 
to secure? Is it a true invention before this, or does the 
child’s sense that I must accept it illustrate a real and 
necessary requirement? 
I think it does represent a real requirement, and this 
because this factor, when it is secured, brings into the very 
construction itself new elements, the assimilation of which 
vevises and purifies the construction ttself. It will be 
remembered that we found the child constantly reading 
his subjective experiences into others, trying to make all 
his thought of himself ‘ejective.’ He constantly practises 
upon his little brother, seeing how he will act, planning 
situations based on what he thinks the little fellow will do
-P-A-G-E-149
PE SEER RENE TE EERO TVET TT 
\ 
The Child’s Inventions 128 
in this circumstance or that; in it all putting to the test 
of experiment the features of himself that he now enter- 
tains in his thought; seeing, by the unconscious tests of 
action, whether he be not like others. This we have seen 
to be an insatiable demand of the child, and no less an 
essential movement in his personal growth. By this series 
of tests he learns what is really true of personality in gen- 
eral, and so has his ‘socius’ consciousness built up. Just 
in so far as the alter responds differently from his expecta- 
tion, that is something new in the alter; and he then 
shifts about again to the learning pole of the dialectic, 
takes up the imitative attitude, and so aims to realize in 
himself a larger revised thought both of himself and of the 
other. 
It is a part of his constructive tendency that his inven- 
tions should be tested in just the same way. It is impos- 
sible for the child to rest in them as mere thoughts of his 
subjective self. His very confidence in them is contin- 
gent upon the successful imposition of them upon the 
alter. “He is like me,” we can fancy the child saying, 
“he will think as I do; this result that I get by my action 
is fit for his action too. I, an ego, do this; if he be any- 
thing of an ego, let him do it also.” So he sets this trap 
for the alter, by asking that he act also upon the inven- 
tion. And just in so far as his thought does not stand 
this test, so far as other persons do not accept it and act 
on it, just so far does it become impossible for the original 
thinker to adhere to it; for the action of the other in 
departing from expectation is now a reacting factor upon 
the thought of self. ‘My sense of attraction — he might 
go on to say —toward what he does act on, conflicts with 
my very thought of my former invention ; I must forth-
-P-A-G-E-150
Fe eT eRe Te ee 7 
124 Invention vs. Imitation 
with invent a new thought of myself in the light of his 
action, and then to this new self the former invention is 
only a half-truth, to be supplemented by new lessons, and 
then, in turn, to be again tested by the same social test.” 
74. To deny this would be to surrender, it seems to me, 
one of the main lessons which we seemed to learn from 
the growth of the personal and social sense; the lesson 
that the suggestions constantly received from the persons 
around us are elements in the thought of self, and through 
the thought of self, elements also in the valuation passed 
on all persons and things. In the case of the child’s 
| invention of an animal out of the outline plan of the 
church, as narrated above, her exhibition of it to others 
and her sense of their acceptance of the figure for an ani- 
mal, is a real and necessary part of the true invention. 
Suppose those to whom she appealed had told her “No, 
that will not do for an animal; it has no head, but only 
a neck,” she would have accepted the amendment and 
scouted the construction in which she before took pride. 
So when we do accept it for an animal, agreeing with her 
that she has made a happy thing, that is the confirmation 
which it is a necessary movement of her personal devel- 
opment to require. It is in the same sense a part of the 
invention as the other materials of it were in the first 
instance. The child’s sense of reality or material truth, 
when she has once departed from the purely mechanical 
facts which her native reactions guarantee for her, involves 
this very element of social confirmation. 
While we cannot say that the construction which the 
child makes, considered simply for himself, is not in a 
sense an invention, still we can say that it is not a com- 
plete invention. The very attempt to put the question in 
that way is mistaken. The child himself never attempts
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Child’s Inventions 125 
to make this artificial distinction between what he is and 
what he does, and again between what he does altogether 
alone and what he does with the help of others. His 
world of reality is one, and he is there in the midst of it. 
He knows only the one personal experience in which the 
two phases are united in one superb series of progressive 
advances. To stop him off short without the social con- 
firmation for his constructions is to leave him in that 
condition of permanent hesitation, doubt, and anxiety, 
which produces, when forced, all sorts of personal isola- 
tions and often, as a matter of fact in the cases of adult 
patients, ends in certain forms of mania known as the 
‘insanities of doubt.’! 
75. The relative importance of the two factors now 
described — that called ‘personal’ and that called ‘social’ 
— differs greatly in different children, and also at different 
periods in the life of the same child. We find the one 
child at times—some children constitutionally — develop- 
ing very fast in the direction of an exaggerated sense of 
personal agency, independence, self-confidence, trust in 
the outcome of his own processes of thought with a mini- 
mum of social confirmation. This tendency is seen in 
the phenomenon which has been lately called ‘contrary 
suggestion.’? The child seems to rebel against instruc- 
tion, to insist upon his own understanding and use of 
things, and to try to impose his individual thought, whether 
1 This position brings to mind that of Royce (Philos. Rev., September to 
November, 1895), who finds a social ingredient in the knowledge of external 
nature. My conclusion would support this, provided we mean judgments of 
nature in distinction from the mere brute contacts with it which do not im- 
plicate the sense of the personal self. Cf. Appendix E. The confirmation of 
knowledge by its ‘conversion’ into ‘things’ is ‘primary’ (conversion into 
the ‘external’) and ‘secondary’ (conversion into another person’s knowl- 
edge). See the work Thought and Things, Vol. I., Chap. IV. 
2 Mental Development, Chap. VI., § 6,
-P-A-G-E-152
  126 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
or no, upon the persons who touch his life. This is, when 
not too insistent, a healthy sign. It betokens the rapid 
progress of the assimilation of elements to his nucleus of 
‘subject,’ which carries with it the sense of agency, power, 
and freedom.! The ‘contrary’ boy is a very promising 
boy, provided he be not allowed to domineer when he 
should be made to obey. But this spirit should be con- 
fined within very strait limits; for it is evident that the 
indulgence, in the boy or girl, of the sense of self- 
sufficiency, will itself tend to dwarf and impoverish that 
very sense of self on which it is based. For the stopping 
up of the avenues of imitation which it involves, cuts off 
the supply of higher personal suggestion upon which the 
growth of the self-sense depends. For instance, how can 
the ethical sense, which is essentially a subordination of 
all private thoughts of self, grow more competent, when 
the suggestions which stand for law are not humbly 
received, nor obediently ? 
On the other hand, also, there are many—and periods 
again in the life of all—in whom the second aspect of the 
whole process of invention takes on an exaggerated impor- 
tance. The need of social confirmation becomes so great 
to the child that his distrust of his single-handed per- 
formances becomes excessive and abnormal. He meets 
so often the overriding lessons of the alter, finds his 
small meed of understanding so insufficient for his life, 
grows so accustomed to see the larger wisdom of his adults 
victorious over the objects and events of nature by which, 
when alone, he is piteously overcome, that he dare not 
stand up without a social arm about him. This period 
of timidity in most children follows that of aggression. 
1Cf, Sects. 148 f. on ‘Social Opposition,’
-P-A-G-E-153
The Child’s Inventions 127 
In my two little girls both periods have been well 
marked, and the order has been the same despite very 
great differences in general disposition. They both had 
the period of aggression, or of exaggerated personality 
with contrariness in the third-to-fifth half-year; and this 
we should expect from the fact that it is then that the 
period of organic bashfulness! is coming to an end. The 
child is losing his constitutional fear of persons, and 
the bond of restraint to the rapid development of his 
sense of his own subjective importance is being released. 
But then followed in each of these children — though 
much more marked in the one, E., than in the other —a 
period of extreme social dependence. In the child E. 
this was still very marked in the fourth year. She was 
never comfortable in any thought of her own until she 
found ‘some one to agree with her in entertaining it. And 
in her case this went to such an interesting extreme that 
she invented persons out of inanimate objects, if need be, 
in order to convince these imaginary beings of the truth 
of her thought or to try upon them the working of a 
fancied situation. In this latter fact, indeed, we come 
upon a tendency which is found fully developed in the 
play-instinct, so called, to which I shall return later for 
additional illustrations both of the general growth of the 
social sense and also of the varied aspects of the child’s 
invention.? 
76. Further, as between the two general types of mind 
which psychology nowadays finds it safe to distinguish, 
the ‘sensory’ and the ‘motor,’® I think the balance be- 
tween the two phases of invention is pretty well divided. 
1 Ment. Devel. Chap. IV., § 6, and below, Chap. VL, § 2. 2 Chap. IV., § 2. 
8 See the detailed study in the writer’s Story of the Mind, Chap. VIII.
-P-A-G-E-154
  128 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
The motor child is impulsive, imitative, self-confident ; his 
self-sense takes the lead in the progress of his invention, 
and he is apt to be unsafe in the practical working out of 
his thought. This tendency, if uncorrected in the educa- 
tive stages of his growth, is likely to issue in the forms of 
idiosyncrasy which we find in the men whom we find 
‘opinionated,’ intolerant, hasty, and unreliable in mat- 
ters requiring careful reflection. These are the persons, 
however, who ‘show up’ best in emergencies; they 
arrive at decisions quickly, and enforce them promptly. 
The other type, the sensory individual, is likely to be 
inventive in the more profound and finished sense required 
by the second principle put in evidence above. His habit 
of getting social confirmation becomes really a sort of 
second deliberation to him, which issues in a revised and 
more mature thought of the situation before him. His 
constant question is: ‘What will my fellow-men think of 
this?’ and ‘Will this work in society or in the mechani- 
cal sphere of its intended application?’ This brings a 
further mass of content back upon his first construction, 
and so leads to a further grouping or apperception of the 
situation as a whole. He thus gets beyond the mere 
primary dependence, characteristic of the child, upon the 
actual pronouncement of society, and finds in himself the 
means of anticipating the voice of his social fellows. His 
final confidence thus reached, although always more slow 
in coming and less defiant in its bearing, is still better 
grounded than that of the other type, and is, in so far, 
more prophetic of a truthful outcome. 
77. We may sum up the descriptive account of the 
child’s originalities under a term which is sufficiently 
general on the one hand, and on the other hand suffi-
-P-A-G-E-155
  
Selective Thinking 129 
ciently popular, by calling them in all cases the child’s 
‘interpretations.’ The imitative copy within himself or 
out in the world is what he interprets; and into his inter- 
pretation goes all the wealth of his earlier informations, 
his habits, and his anticipations. The first interpretation 
is the synthesis which he effects, by his own action, of 
the new data with his personal growth. But with this first 
interpretation, as we have seen, he does not rest satisfied. 
He makes a second interpretation through an appeal to 
his social fellows, or to his own social judgment. On the 
basis of the response which he gets, a new synthesis arises 
constituting his present invention. This is held until the 
whole mass of elements going to make it up is again pre- 
cipitated for another interpretation by some new sugges- 
tion from the sources of his knowledge. So he never 
rests, never ceases to invent. 
§ 3. Selective Thinking 
78. The question which still remained over after our 
theoretical determinations was that of the actual ground 
of the selection of the valuable variations which remain 
as truthful thoughts in the mind of the child and the man. 
This was deferred until we should have examined the 
actual inventions of the child. I think the result of 
our examination justifies in a measure the expectation 
that some light would come to us. For we have found 
the child making his selections of the things which he will 
finally think to be true under certain leading rules. 
1. In the realm of social suggestion we find that the 
new thoughts are functions of the personal self. Only 
those things which the child can assimilate, by imitation, 
in his own personal growth become true to him; he can
-P-A-G-E-156
  130 Invention vs. Imitation 
hold true of others, and of persons generally, only those 
things which he might master by his own imitative action, 
and make true of himself. 
2. Of other truths, whether directly attributable to 
persons or not, only those come to be real and valid to 
him which hold for others also. This means that in all 
his thinking, if his thoughts are to be of value, and to be 
selected as true, his thought of self is so far implicated that 
it is a personal achievement ; it must stand liable to incur 
the inspection of the alter whose existence is ejectively 
guaranteed by the thought of self. This demand for 
social confirmation is what we should expect from the 
dialectic of personal growth in all cases in which the con- 
viction involved is in any sense an expression of a per- 
sonal attitude. 
3. These results fall in with the analyses of belief and 
judgment made by recent writers. In an earlier work 
the outcome of such an analysis has been expressed in 
these words: “Belief is the personal endorsement of 
reality” ;1 and belief and judgment are there considered 
different phases of the going-out of the motor processes of 
impulse and ‘need’ upon their objects.2 Without assum- 
ing this view with reference to all judgments, —although 
I think it is true, —we may yet say: in so far as a per- 
sonal attitude is involved in a judgment, in so far the 
organization of the personal self is the ground of the 
selection of the particular thought as true And, further, 
1 Baldwin, Handbook of Psychology, Feeling and Will, p.158. See Ormond, 
‘The Negative in Logic’ (Psych. Rev., May, 1897); also the newer logicians, 
Brentano, Sigwart, who tend to identify judgment with the belief attitude of 
mind. See the detailed theory now (1906) worked out in Thought and 
Things, Vol. 1. Chap. XL, and Vol. IL, Chap, I.

8 This is intimated in the treatment of my Handbook in these words :
-P-A-G-E-157
Selective Thinking 131 
when the self-thought is thus the nucleus of organization, 
there the social criterion of truth must also be in force. 
The general conclusion is, therefore, that there is a 
great sphere of truth, of selective thinking, of inventions 
judged true, of mental constructions believed, in which the 
criterion of selection is all along availability for imitative 
social assimilation in the growth of the thought of self; 
and unless in some spheres we be able to find other com- 
pelling criteria of truth, we shall have to say the same of 
all selective thinking.? 
“ Amid the variations of composite and varying reality, the most fixed point of 
reference is the feeling of se/f. All reality is given us through our own expe- 
rience, and the centre of experience is self and its needs.” (Loc. cit, p. 170.) 
1This last clause expresses the probability, in my personal view. The 
further interesting question arises (and would demand discussion but for our 
limitation to social interpretations), what relation such a principle of selec- 
tion in the realm of thought bears to the ordinary utility-selection as operative 
in organic accommodation. Dr. Urban’s paper already referred to (Psych. 
Review, July, 1897) discusses the question of utility briefly. Without going 
into details, I may say that the criterion of utility is preserved in both of the 
aspects of selective thinking pointed out in the text. 1. In thinking, the agent 
of accommodation is the attention, which has its own pleasure and pain tone, 
and in the production of the variations from which the true thoughts are 
selected, the attention represents the motor habits in which—according to the 
general point of view developed above (§ 55) —the variations primarily take 
place. Cf. my Mental Development, pp. 312 f., 331 f., for evidence of varia- 
tions in the attention complex. Accommodation of the attention is necessary 
to all thinking. It is by restless and energetic attention upon old knowledges 
that the new thoughts come. The variety of attention modes dictates the 
variety of new thoughts. It is this accommodation which constitutes the 
child’s reception and absorption of relatively abstract and theoretical new 
material. It is the more formal utility element, which we might conceive to 
be still present in case further social ratification were not available. But, 2, the 
social criterion is also a direct utility requirement. His need of learning is to 
the child his most strenuous need; and social sources are his first and last, in 
learning the lessons of his life. I should say, therefore, that selective thinking 
does fall under the law of utility-selection.— The selection of true thoughts 
of the external world is made by the accommodation of organic movement, 
which proceeds by the ‘functional selection of overproduced movements’
-P-A-G-E-158
132 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
§ 4. Private Judgment 
79. In the earlier chapter we had reason, from an objec- 
tive point of view, for finding a certain ‘social judgment’ 
current in each society, represented by public opinion, and 
coming out in the attitudes of individuals in situations of 
social moment. We called its exercise in the individual 
‘judgment’ by a certain license, and in deference to popu- 
lar usage. It seemed to us well to say that the socially 
eligible and competent person was a man of ‘good judg- 
ment’ in the relations and circumstances of his social life. 
In what has gone before in this chapter we have now 
seen something of the rise of selective thinking in the 
mind of the individual. It has seemed to proceed, at least 
in those cases which involve the implication, to however 
slight an extent, of the personal thought and interest of 
the man or child, by imitation. And this examination, 
conducted from the point of view of the conditions of the 
rise of selective thinking in the person himself, led us to 
see that his criterion all the way along is necessarily — in 
so far as he reaches mature convictions of truth —a social 
criterion. Further, this sense of personal security in a 
(Ment. Devel. p. 179). This, then, has its identical principle in the accom- 
modation of the attention in thinking; and in thinking, in so far at least as 
it proceeds by social stimulations, we find the further selective function of 
judgment, in the way we have described. Dr. Urban thinks that the utility 
principle gets no application to the theoretical relationships discovered inside 
a whole of knowledge, although the whole, as a concrete whole, is selected on 
the utility principle. But it would seem that the parts are themselves possible 
wholes, which could not have been established otherwise, and that the relations 
have already been ‘selected.’ The subject of ‘Selective Thinking’ has now 
been reviewed and the positions here taken expanded and explained in my 
‘President’s Address,’ Amer. Psych. Association, Psychological Review, January, 
1898 (later included in the new volume Development and Evolution).

Private Judgment 233 
thought, of personal endorsement of it, is what is called in 
psychology ‘judgment.’ 
80. It is now a simple matter to let these two points of 
view give to each other a certain mutual confirmation. 
The ‘social judgment’ is, when looked at from the side of 
its currency in society, —and named therefor, —one and 
the same with the private judgment of the individuals 
which make the society up. The social criterion of selec- 
tion in private judgment is just the bridge between the two 
sets of values, public and private. The social judgment 
gets its competence from the common absorption of the 
same imitative copies by all the individuals; and the indi- 
vidual’s private judgment gets its social validity from the 
conditions of its social origin. 
It is only then in a relative sense that the private judg- 
ment is private ; and it is only in a relative sense that the 
public judgment is public; for in the main they are the 
same. 
81. But it may be asked: Is it true that our private 
judgments have the social ingredient attributed to them? 
Are we not competent to\solve problems by sheer private 
thinking, and then to know that the solution is true by 
sheer private conviction ?— both with no reference to any- 
body else? The fuller answer to this question will appear 
as our development proceeds ; but it may be well to make 
two general statements in reference to this possibility. 
1. However independent one’s private judgment may 
be,.and however strenuously in opposition it may seem to 
the views current in society, yet he who thus judges as- 
1 This might be called in a sense a ‘social deduction of the category of 
universality,’ to speak in a Kantian phrase borrowed from Professor Royce. 
In the work cited in the next note, the term ‘syn-nomic’ is applied to judg- 
ments and truths considered as having this two-fold ground of validity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  134 Lnvention vs. Imitation 
sumes, all the way through, the common standards of 
truth and error which society also assumes. The position 
taken above does not result in detracting in the least from 
the competency of the individual’s judgments. It only 
seeks to state the influences which have worked to enable 
him to build up his competent judgments. Here as else- 
where habit comes to rule. Good habits of judgment tell 
in individuals. Hereditary differences are great. And it 
is no argument against the position taken above, to cite 
cases of private judgment which seem competent. That 
I shall myself do later on. 
2. I have admitted the possibility of the establishing of 
other criteria of truth in other fields of knowledge. At 
least we do not need to pass on that question now. An 
a priori philosopher may say that mathematical knowledge 
is not at all subject to social confirmation. Let him believe 
it. What is essential for our position is that, so far as the 
individual’s knowledge is subject to a process of selective 
development in experience, so far that knowledge is not 
reached exclusively by private tests. The development is 
guided in part by social tests; and the judgments of truth 
which arise in the individual in the progress of it are, in 
so far, social judgments.

in the work, Thought and Things, Vol. 1., Chap. VIL., and Vol. II., Chap. I.

CHAPTER IV 
Sociat Arps To INVENTION 
82, Wirt the view which we have now reached of the 
nature of invention in the child, we are prepared to trace 
its growth with his, and to point out the main aids to its 
progress in his life-history. 
The child differs from the young animal mainly in this 
feature: the thought of himself as a personal being. It 
is in those functions through which his personal growth 
proceeds that we should expect to find his life mainly dif- 
ferentiated from the brutes. If the foregoing account be 
true of the method of the personal growth of the child, of 
his progress in his thought of himself, the means which 
his environment offers for the satisfaction of his demands 
should stand out most prominently, both in the contrast 
with the animal’s environment, and also as prominent 
per se. There should be a premium put, in society, 
upon the formal or conventional modes of action which 
give constant patterns and supports to the child’s need 
of progressive realization of himself and of knowledge of 
the world; and there should be equally a general mode 
of social expression, a method of bringing his acquisi- 
tions to the social test; these two features of the social 
whole being in their origin themselves the outcome of 
the very demand to which at every stage of progress 
they are found to minister. The child must at every 
135
-P-A-G-E-162
  136 Social Aids to Invention 
stage have some general imitative copies before him, 
already realized in society; he must reproduce these in 
his own growth. And the extent to which he can go, with 
the vis a tergo of heredity behind him, depends upon the 
degree in which his social environment is itself a thing of 
set and formulated convention. On the other hand, the 
active method, both of his learning amid the conventions 
of the family, school, etc., and of the setting of his habits 
in the forms of social warrant and utility, must have some 
general modes of issue also common to the social group as 
a whole. Both these functions are served pre-eminently 
by speech; and in them, taken together, I think the true 
philosophy of speech is to be found. Not only is this true 
of the development of speech in the individual child, — 
its ontogenetic phase; but it holds also of the origin and 
development of speech in the race—its phylogenetic 
phase.1 We may confine our inquiry for the present to 
the social function of learning and expression in the 
child, by means of the acquisition and use of spoken 
language. 
First, we may consider the acquisition of language by 
the child and the lessons of it in his progress as a personal 
and inventive being ; and second, the use which he makes 
of speech, and its lessons as well. These two topics, it is 
plain, carry farther the distinction between ‘imitative’ and 
‘social’ invention already dwelt upon.? 
1 Avenarius makes speech the great means of ‘introjection’ in its historical 
development: Mensch. Weltbegriff, p. 44. 
2The consideration of speech, as well as of play and art, as social 
instrument, must be very sketchy in a single chapter, and the following 
general indications should be considered only as suggestions.
-P-A-G-E-163
Language 137 
§ 1. Language 
83. I. The Method of Learning Language.— All the 
theories of the child’s procedure in acquiring language 
are based upon the very evident fact that speech is an 
imitative function. This is so evidently true that the 
temptation is strong to use speech in all cases to illustrate 
imitation at its purest. The process of association by 
which the child gradually gets the sounds of words heard 
connected with his own lip and tongue sensations in 
speaking the same words, and then uses his own sounds 
to control the muscular movements, instead of still wait- 
ing for the voices of others, — these processes are also 
commonly recognized, and I shall not delay upon them. 
Neither do I propose to institute an inquiry into the 
phonetics of the infant’s progress with language, ask- 
ing what letters he learns first, last, and between. All 
that is beside the present problem, interesting and impor- 
tant as it is in itself. The aspect of the case to which 
attention is now directed is a different one and one not so 
commonly discussed ; indeed, I do not know of any dis- 
cussions of just the function of the child’s particular imita- 
tions of speech-sounds, in enabling him to come first into 
the language tradition and through that into all the social 
heritage of his people. 
84. The use made by the child of the language of those 
about him is at first quite unreflective ; that is, the use for 
his own direct imitations. He gets, it is true, a large and 
varied sense of the meanings of words, such as ‘papa,’ 
‘mamma,’ ‘spoon,’ ‘baby,’ ‘chair,’ etc., as used by other per- 
sons before he shows at all the tendency to acquire speech 
for himself. He learns also a great variety of associations
-P-A-G-E-164
138 Social Aids to Invention 
between words which he hears and things which lie about 
him; all this is part of the general system of sugges- 
tions which his passing life-panorama of things and events 
impresses upon him. This indicates on the organic side 
the great readiness of his nerve machinery to undertake 
the tasks of life. His active life is somewhat behind the 
receptive; that is, somewhat less formed at the begin- 
ning of his career. So he brings to his first lessons in 
active imitation a certain mass of informations which are 
ready to cluster up upon his further acquisitions and 
assimilate them. Here we find in the child himself, 
therefore, a certain body of well-knitted meshes or nets 
ready to catch his newly acquired ‘copies’ as he repro- 
duces them from out the environment, and to give them 
meaning in terms of safe knowledge. This is the sort of 
first interpretation or personal invention already signalized 
above. 
85. But as soon as the child begins to imitate things 
seen or heard, he strikes into perfect gold-mines, of the 
richness of which he knows nothing; mines in which the 
wisdom and growth of ages of ancestral life are hidden in 
nuggets of purest intellectual ore. His efforts, it is true, 
merely scratch the surface, All his learning is but find- 
ing out the deeper and ever-deeper meaning of the surface- 
exposed strata. This we have seen in tracing the very 
gradual development of the sense of self. He has to go 
through a series of very remarkable insights, directed 
now outward, now inward, now outward again, all bring- 
ing him to a fuller and fuller apprehension of what people 
are and what their actions mean. So it is with every 
category of his learning ; and most of all so of his learning 
to speak. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
Language 139 
The case of this function is the more important and 
interesting since not only is it the way of his learning 
language in itself, but it is then through speech that he 
goes on to learn almost everything else. Speech has its 
main value not as an exercise in itself, but as an instru- 
ment; yet it has first to be learned as any other function 
has to be—it has to be first itself an acquisition —in 
order then to be available for the uses it goes on to sub- 
serve. And the way of getting to speak by imitation is 
itself perhaps the profoundest pedagogical influence in the 
child’s mental history. 
His instinctive imitation of word-sounds opens a door to 
the entrance of word-meanings. His rapport with the per- 
son who speaks to him is a little fuller, a little more sym- 
pathetic, when the child can utter the same word. His 
utterance of it leads to the common observation of the 
thing the word denotes ; to the common doing of the act 
which it describes. Further, the rafort thus established 
now extends away from the individual thing, at first pres- 
ent at the learning. The distant object, the past or future 
event, can now be referred to. So the basis is laid for a 
new word-lesson : the lesson of the relation of the object 
which is now here on one hand, to that on the other hand 
which, though not here, yet can be brought here in its 
meaning and memory by the use of the word which has 
been earlier acquired. So also can the relations of space 
be spanned by thought through this wonderful instrumen- 
tality, just as those of time are. Not that the child does 
not remember his past without uttering his memories in 
speech or before he can utter them; but that he does not 
make these memories of his past the basis of the further 
extension of that personal understanding with the others 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
140 Social Aids to Invention 
from whom his learning proceeds and by which his own 
thought of himself and the world must grow. It is because 
the parent or teacher has more lessons for him to learn — 
because they are familiar with the relations of time, space, 
cause, etc. —that it is important for him to learn the pres- 
ent words. His progress in thinking is to be like their 
progress before him, and, as a matter of fact, their prog- 
ress is embodied in their language. They cannot impart 
their learning except in the moulds in which they have 
learned ; so in his learning he must get the meaning of 
the word now set before him before he can grow into a 
further set of meanings.! 
The essential function of language, therefore, on the 
side of its acquisition by the child, is this pedagogical 
or ‘leading-string’ function. The child does not have to 
explore the relations of things for himself; this his ances- 
tors have done for him, and their discoveries have been 
embodied in language. Then he comes upon the scene 
with the hereditary capacity for speech, and the tendency, 
also hereditary, to imitate. So of course he falls into the 
speech of his social elders and so finds himself, before 
he knows it, and without any necessity of understanding 
it, right in the midst of a most intricate network of 
social relationships directly available to him by the use 
of the words picked up by pleasant and playful imita- 
tion. 
For example, he learns the word ‘knife,’ perhaps, from 
his table experiences repeated daily; then he is told ‘the 
1 The truth of this is seen in the difficulty found in teaching deaf and dumb 
children. Methods have to be devised which are foreign to the teacher’s own 
normal modes of expression. Instead of natural social relations, these are 
conventions which are artificial, in the first place, to the teacher himself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  Language 141 
knife cuts,’ when, by a slip of his fingers, he*-has come in 
the way of his nurse’s brandishments of that instrument. 
Now, by holding on to these two words ‘knife cuts,’ he 
is enabled to do at once what probably represents a long 
series of race experiences in the learning of meanings and 
relationships in nature. He ‘conceives’ the thing knife, 
since he is able to put into it, by means of his own per- 
sonal growth, a general meaning or expectation. Speech is 
his means of doing this, because it is, in the first instance, 
the race’s means of doing this, and unless the race had 
developed some general way of doing it, neither could he. 
It prepares him at once for the further understanding 
of the increasing and differing instances of both the ideas 
thus crudely learned. And his knowledge then proceeds 
from the more general, the safer, to the less general, the 
concrete, the more risky. What I mean by this last 
remark may be brought out a little more fully. 
86. Suppose the child beginning with no tendency to 
generalize his experience with the knife; he would then 
not expect other knives, hatchets, tools with sharp edges, 
to cut him. He would put them all to the same test, 
either intentionally or by the accidents arising from his 
failure to apply the lesson of the earlier knife, and the 
result would be that he would be cut again and again. 
And should he extend this haphazard experience of learn- 
ing for himself to all the provinces of his action, it becomes 
plain that his life would not suffice to teach him the things 
he most needs to know. He would be forever falling by 
the wayside from the shock of evils which, as it is, he 
readily anticipates and avoids. We may call this a sort of 
generalization, and see in it, as we do, a case of personal 
accommodation by the use of a single copy of great gener- 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  142 Social Aids to [Invention 
ality for a group of similar experiences. It seems to dis- 
tinguish the child from the young animal; not, indeed, 
merely as perception of resemblance (LI. Morgan), or asso- 
ciation by resemblance (James) — both of these, I think, 
many animals clearly have—and not indeed by any im- 
passable gulf in nature; but as indicating the direction 
which development has taken, whereby the child’s kind 
have become animals which reflect, while the others have 
not. I think that Romanes is right in holding it possible 
that the direction given to development through the first 
rude uses of movements for personal expression was really 
the direction taken by man, the reasoning creature, in dis- 
tinction from the lower animals that do not speak nor 
reason.t Speech is the crown and climax of expressive 
movements, and by it development took on its highest 
social and personal phase.? 
87. The child’s main business with words is the absorp- 
tion of meanings, rather than the discovery of them. The 
discovery is a matter of social usage, which comes to him 
in great generalizations. The child has thrust upon him 
words used in their general significations; he invents 
general situations or meanings to interpret the general 
speech which he hears; in this he shows all the aptitude 
arising from his hereditary readiness for the race progress 
which the speech he hears itself embodies; his happy 
responses are encored and he clings to them as useful 
1 And he is also in accord with the text (see Sects. 78, 82) in the position 
that the essential distinction between man and the brute “truly consists . . . 
in the power to think which is given by introspective reflection in the light of 
self-consciousness” (Mental Evol. in Man, p. 175), and he finds this “in its 
simplest manifestation . . . in judgment” (zé7d., p. 178). Cf. note in Appen- 
dix H, I. 
2 In another place (Mental Devel., Chap. IV.) I have reached the conclu- 
sion that right-handedness originally served purposes of expressive movement.
-P-A-G-E-169
  Language 143 
things. Indeed, one of the most striking phenomena of 
infant speech is the way in which the child uses a newly 
acquired word to cover objects which present only the 
most vague and incidental resemblance to the right one. 
The books on child-psychology are full of instances, and I 
need not cite more. The boy learns that my knee is a 
‘knee.’ He forthwith begins to look upon the corner of 
the table as a ‘knee’; so is the end of the stick of fire- 
wood a ‘knee’; the mountain becomes a ‘big knee,’ and 
the pencil should have its ‘little knee’ sharpened. All 
this is his first interpretation, the generalization which 
he falls into by all the force of race history and habitual 
reaction. These objects fulfil the conditions of the first 
apprehension of ‘knee,’ which issued in the fortunate 
utterance of the word; so all of them also become it. 
So far we now understand: this is the ‘leading-string’ 
function of language, just to lead him forward into this 
error of generalization. The power to generalize is a part 
of his endowment ; it is his gift of originality, in so far. 
88. II. Zhe Uses of Language.—We may say at the 
outset that the child’s uses of language illustrate very 
plainly the second kind of invention described above as 
‘social.’ It consists in a series of second interpretations 
of words on the basis of the first interpretation made in 
the way already described. The child’s progress is by 
delimitation of the areas over which he may apply words. 
This comes about in his further experience in the applica- 
tion of his newly acquired terms. He finds himself strain- 
ing the meanings of them in his efforts to make himself 
understood by others. When he speaks of the ‘knee’ 
of the table, I fail to understand him, perhaps, and he 
sees that his first apprehension is in some way not that
-P-A-G-E-170
  144 Social Aids to Invention 
which gets social confirmation. So he abandons his first 
interpretation, and either asks me why a table-corner is 
not a knee, or shows me by pointing what he means in 
speaking of the table’s knee, or waits to hear in my further 
conversation the distinctions which resolve the puzzle for 
him. His use of speech is a constant test of the inventive 
interpretations already made through imitation. 
His progress is the reverse of that of the ordinary 
psychological doctrine of conception, z.e., that it proceeds 
from the particular to the universal. It is from the more 
to the less general constantly.1_ He circumscribes his 
meanings by the very necessity of the use of language 
—the necessity of being understood. 
This leads him on then to the second interpretation 
found in all valid invention. Speech of all things must 
work in society. And just in so far as, after each test, the 
meaning given to a word is found to be wrong, too inclu- 
sive, and in so far as he then gets a new sense of the right 
conditions for a new sense of the meaning, to that degree 
he makes a new meaning, a new invention, only to find it 
subject, as the old one was, to the tests of actual usage 
in his social group. 
89. We find that when he does this, when he uses a 
word with a question on his face, waiting to see its fate in 
the understanding and critical treatment of others, then 
the first function of language, the ‘leading-string’ function, 
gets a new chance. The parent or teacher may now avail 
himself of the child’s error to lead him into all truth. 
I hasten to inform the child that the table has no knees, 
1 And prevailingly at this early period ; of course the other process is also 
real, but it characterizes a later period, i.e., that of logical rather than verbal 
instruction. Cf, the process called ‘erosion’ in AZental Development, p. 328.
-P-A-G-E-171
Language 145 
and why. I make the occasion which reveals his wrong 
interpretation the occasion, also, of a new lesson whereby 
he takes up new elements of social suggestion for the 
refining of his words, and through them of his knowledge. 
There is no end, of course, to this give-and-take between 
the child and me; he takes what I give, and gives it back 
in his own form of assimilation or invention, only to have 
his construction rejected by me with further directions 
whereby he may make it conform better to the demands 
of the developed system of meanings which I have already 
acquired by precisely the same process, So his second 
interpretation becomes in turn a first interpretation for 
another second, And so on indefinitely. 
So speech is genetically an aid of the first importance 
in the development of knowledge, and illustrates well the 
social factor which we have called ‘judgment’ above. Fur- 
ther I need not go in this connection. Yet the point should 
not be overlooked that in this development, the method 
of the acquisition of language is that of the organic growth 
of the person as a whole, considered in his social relation- 
ships. The child learns himself and his alter, as we have 
seen, by reacting upon constant suggestions from the alter 
personalities about him. We now see that speech is, after 
the first year or more of his life, the great vehicle of such 
suggestions, and consequently the great engine of his per- 
sonal development. When it is no longer a matter of 
learning speech, it is yet a matter of learning through 
speech. Both the process of taking up the projective into 
the subjective ego, and that of ejecting the subjective into 
the alter-ego, get their principal material through language. 
By their speech he learns of others, and by his speech he 
teaches others of himself.  
-P-A-G-E-172
146 Social Aids to Invention 
go. III. The Uses of Reading and Handwriting.— The 
position now assigned to speech in the social evolution of 
the child gets farther confirmation from the examination 
of those variations of this function found in reading and 
handwriting. In reading we find the receptive state of 
mind necessary to imitative invention very greatly empha- 
sized. Handwriting, on the other hand, and with it all 
the forms of inscription, printing, etc., into which it has 
developed in the advanced social organization of civilized 
peoples, represents the other pole,—that of expressive 
utility. Handwriting is to the writer in the first instance 
—as printing and publishing are to the author—the 
means of submitting the results of his invention to the 
‘ social tests, the nature of which we have already dwelt 
upon. The child writes in his copy-book for the criticism 
of his teacher. He writes to his friend, both as a child 
and later as an adult, for the expression of his thought; 
but his expression is worthy and represents invention only 
as his friend’s criticism tolerates and exploits it. If he 
thus become an author and his productions be fixed in the 
permanent form of print or archives, he is then appealing 
to a larger constituency of critics, and for a judgment 
extending over a longer period of time. This then is 
literature. It is the permanent series of recorded inven- 
tions in form and matter by which society has gradually 
enriched itself, and to which society has subjected itself 
as to a great series of limitations put upon its inventive 
power. 
Then as to reading —the child not only learns to read, 
but he learns to assimilate the thoughts he reads. In 
learning merely to read, he is learning to reinvent for him- 
self the forms of language, just as we have seen him doing
-P-A-G-E-173
  
Language 147 
it also in learning to speak. But in reading, the ‘copy- 
system,’ so to speak, the gauges, controls, relationships, 
are richer than in his speech. For in the former he is no 
longer compelled to wait for the presence of his father or 
mother to give him the forms of correct discourse, and to 
give them to him in forms not always correct. His books 
are a graded series of wisely arranged forms of increasing 
complexity, and in them he has the slow processes of 
acquisition set out for his development as fast as the 
growth of his inventive powers enables him to utilize them. 
And having thus transcended the forms of usage in his 
own social circle, he goes on, by the supply of literature in 
the library to which he has access, to transcend as well the 
commonplace thought of daily life, in the community in 
which he lives. 
So by his reading and his writing he assimilates, on the 
one hand, and expresses himself socially for the judgment 
of his fellows, on the other hand. And these are the 
two fields, assimilation and expression, in which we have 
seen invention to have its place in the development of 
personality. This whole series of functions, therefore, 
which cluster about the use of language, constitute the 
most important of all the agencies of personal development ; 
not indeed because of any intrinsic peculiarity of them 
considered as personal performances, but entirely because 
in them the social Gezs¢, the socius, comes to ever-clearer 
and more adequate expression.! In the instrumentalities 
1 Cf. the articles ‘Language’ (Wheeler) and ‘ Language-Function’ (Stout- 
Baldwin) in the writer’s Dict. of Philos. and Psychol., Vol. 1. Much psycho- 
logical matter is to be found in the treatment of language by Wundt, J’é/ker- 
psychologic, Bd. 1. A recent general linguistic work is Oertel, Zhe Scientific 
Study of Language (1901).
-P-A-G-E-174

of written discourse, the social conditions of the past are 
crystallized and made available; and in them, as we have 
had occasion to see, the new individual, from the time that 
he is born into the world of independent action, finds much 
of his social heritage directly available. 
§ 2. Play} 
gi. The place of the play-instinct in the general equip- 
ment of the young of animals and of man has had much 
discussion recently from a biological or phylogenetic point 
of view. Apart from questions of origin, however, we may 
inquire into the meaning of play in relation to the social 
and personal development of the individual —in short, its 
ontogenetic value — in the somewhat summary way which 
the necessary omission of details requires. 
Among the more important functions of play, in the edu- 
cation of the individual for his life-work in a network of 
social relationships, the following may be indicated with 
some reference to their natural order. 
92. I. Play ts a most important form of organic exercise. 
In so far as the tendencies involved are instinctive, the ex- 
ercise is secured to the individual directly in the channels 
set by heredity, and required for the adult activities of the 
species. On the organic side, we find— what it is our 
main object to show also for the mental— that the ac- 
tions into which the young of animals tend normally and 
spontaneously to indulge, are those which the finished ac- 
1 Since this section was written, I have fallen in with the very able work, 
Die Spiele der Thiere, by Professor K. Groos. His theoretical conclusion as 
to the function of play, from the biological point of view, is the same as that 
favoured here. (His book is now translated into English by Miss E. L. 
Baldwin.) See also (1901) his Play of Man, Eng. version by the same 
translator. 2 Many references will be found in Groos’ two volumes.

tivities later brought into operation are to require. This 
is an important indication regarding the meaning of play 
from an historical or phylogenetic point of view, ze., that 
the play-instinct as such has arisen to afford a sort of 
artificial recapitulation of the serious and strenuous exer- 
tions of race progress, and thereby to subserve the need, 
that the individual creature has, of training in the same 
exercises, before the time of storm and stress comes upon 
him.t 
As to the individual’s advantage from play, it is shown 
so plainly in the illustrations cited from the life of young 
animals by other authors, that I need not stop to do more 
than recall some of these illustrations. It will be remem- 
bered that young dogs play at biting, chasing, fighting, 
clawing, etc., up to the limits of safety. This is inter- 
preted as showing that the play-instinct had its race-origin 
in the actual forms of struggle and competition by which 
the species has maintained and developed itself. We now 
see that these play-activities of the dog are also of direct 
value to him as a schooling in the life of self-support 
which he has to live as an individual dog. Another case 
—the play of a kitten with a mouse after catching it —is 
1 See the examples given in the work of Groos. I have discussed his Play 
of Animals in Science, February 26, 1897 (reprinted in part as preface to the 
Eng. trans.). Two other indications of the function of play ix race develop- 
ment may be suggested. It serves, first, as an index of the organic devel- 
opment already secured to the species; it reveals something of the amount 
and direction of the hereditary impulse before it is actually developed in the 
individual. The plays of animals are particular, varying with the species ; 
just as much so as are their full-developed instincts. Second, by the exercise 
involved in play the animal enlarges the scope, strengthens the force, and so 
aids the further development of the hereditary impulse in the species in the 
direction of the functions thus brought into play, through the operation 
of organic selection (the preservation of the better adapted or accommodated 
individuals progressively under natural selection. See Appendix A).
-P-A-G-E-176

a still more striking instance of the schooling of the young 
into the stock-in-trade of the adult’s method of support 
and of defence, when in a wild state. And so on through 
an infinite catalogue of instances. 
93. Il. Play ts a most important method of realization 
of the social instincts. The summary consideration of the 
organic utilities of play prepares us for the part which the 
same group of activities play on the side of the conscious 
and social equipment of the young. Here the phenomena 
are seen in very marked form in the animal world, since 
in the brutes the phenomena of instinct are not compli- 
cated with those of the higher mental faculties to the 
same extent as in man, and the immediate urgencies are 
more pressing. So I may first speak with more reference 
to those higher animals which have well-developed collec- 
tive methods of action. 
The kind of social preparation which the young of ani- 
mals get from their playful activities together is just che 
experimental verification of the benefits and pleasures of 
united action. The maternal and filial instincts involve 
a strain of play, in animals no less than in the human 
species. Dogs in their play at fighting often set numbers 
against swiftness or force, and exchange parts in the midst 
of the game, the chaser being chased, etc. Birds in the same 
flock will unite to storm a tree where a fancied enemy is 
perched, just as they combine against a real enemy when he 
has the tree to himself. Ants have sham battles with op- 
posing hosts; thus getting the effects of military manceuv- 
ring without bloodshed.!_ The extended ‘make believe’ of 
animals —for example in pretending to bite one another, 
with the elaborate responses of pretended anger and

-P-A-G-E-177
  
  Play 151 
attack — shows invaluable practice in varying and under- 
standing quasi-social relations and situations. Mock fight- 
ing, sometimes very elaborate, is widespread in nature: 
ducks play at fighting on the water, birds in the air, animals 
injure one another in their playful zeal! The remarkable 
phenomena of leadership show just the results to be ex- 
pected from game exercises. In certain packs of dogs, in 
the words of Hudson, “from the foremost in strength and 
power down to the weakest, there is a gradation in author- 
ity; each one knows just how far he can go, which com- 
panion he can bully when he is in a bad temper . . . and 
to which he must yield in his turn.”? Cases of division of 
responsibility between individuals in trapping prey, etc., 
are recorded, in which it is very difficult to see the possi- 
bility of the united action becoming fixed as an instinct 
unless the repetition of the situation in some such artificial 
way as the play-instinct would seem to give opportunity for, 
enabled the animals to learn their part; this might be of 
enough importance to shield the individuals for some gen- 
erations against natural selection.? 
  1Cf. Hudson, Zhe Naturalist in La Plata, p. 308. The reader may con- 
sult Hudson’s extended account of the social plays of birds and mammals (/oc. 
cit., esp. Chap. XIX., ‘Music and Dancing in Nature’) and Groos’ Play of 
Animals. It is a defect, I think, of Herr Groos’ treatment that he does not 
make adequate recognition of the social function among the utilities of play. 
(Cf., however, p. 71, “daher ist die sociale Bedeutung der Spiele ausserordent- 
lich gross” ; it is completely recognized in the later Play of Man, reference 
being there made to this criticism.) I should say that it is notably in view of 
the social life of the higher orders and of man that this neat sentence, pro- 
pounded by Groos as something of a paradox, gets much of its truth: “ Die 
Thiere spielen nicht weil sie jung sind, sondern sie haben einer Jugend, weil 
sie spielen miissen” (doc. cit, p. 68). 
2 Loc. cit., p. 337. “This masterful and domineering temper, so common 
among social animals, leads to the persecution of the weak and sickly.” 
8 This is only a suggestion, but if facts should warrant it, it might be a re- 
source in some of the discussions of congenital endowment, heredity, etc., in 
which the origin of a once-functioning or periodical instinct is in question.
-P-A-G-E-178
152 Social Aids to Invention 
  From the anthropological point of view also the instinct 
to play would have the same utility. Primitive man, we 
are told, indulged to a remarkable extent in games, dances, 
amusements of a co-operative character. This must have 
been a constant training to him in the benefits of sociality 
and a constant stimulus to the pursuits of peace. 
94. But it is in the human young that this type of 
utility attaching to play-activities comes into greatest 
prominence; and here it is a matter of such importance 
that I may be excused for going into some detail in the 
following points, in order to join up this topic with the 
method of social development of the child in general. 
The child is destined to a life of personal self-consciousness 
which is realized in all its richness only in the social re- 
lationships into which he is reared; and the indications 
that in his games he has one of his most important means 
of schooling in personal development should, if it be true, 
be given the emphasis which both its theoretical and 
practical importance would seem to warrant. 
Ill. Play gives flexibility of mind and body with self- 
control, There is a certain plasticity of function secured 
by exercise which is in striking contrast to the plasticity 
of crude unformed movement. To do things quickly axd 
well is more than to do them quickly ov well. Just as the 
grace of the trained horse can be contrasted with the awk- , 
wardness of the colt, so the ready use of the mental facul- 
ties by a trained scholar may be contrasted with the mental 
movements of the rustic. I think all games, from the 
nursery to the athletic field, have this virtue. 
95. IV. Play gives the child a constant opportunity for 
imitative learning and invention. It is evident to any 
one who has observed children at play that the instinct to
-P-A-G-E-179
Play 153 
imitate comes strongly out in many ways in the disposition 
of the players, in the following after the leaders, in the 
learning of successive situations, in the division of parts, 
in the novel variations and improvements which are intro- 
duced in the progress of the several games performed. 
There are usually in each group of children some of 
greater inventive faculty than the rest; they are more 
restless than their fellows, fond of leading, constantly 
proposing novelties. The others, on the contrary, follow 
these by more or less ready imitation. It matters little, 
of course, how valuable or how lacking in value the new 
elements of the game may be. The fact that the children 
imitate it and, by so doing, learn how to realize for them- 
selves the new combinations of movement, new varieties 
of social relationship, new dispositions of persons for united 
co-operation and effort — this is enough to make the disci- 
pline of the game a matter of the greatest interest and 
importance in the origin and development of the personal 
and social sense. The stimulus to imitation is thus felt 
in the circle of the child’s own equals, and action upon 
such a stimulus is most unreserved and natural. Besides, 
the child has in such cases only relatively simple and easy 
novelties to which to accommodate himself; and he is not 
embarrassed by the failure to understand what is required 
of him, as he so often is in the case of the interpretations 
which he is called upon to make of the actions of his 
elders. 
In this learning by imitation during his games, the child 
is exercising himself in the art of invention as well as 
simply gaining new insights into situations of social value; 
for by imitation, as we have already seen, the first exhibi- 
tions of originality are made possible.
-P-A-G-E-180
  154 Social Acids to Invention 
96. V. But it ts no less true that the social aspect of in- 
vention ts also well realized in the games of childhood. It 
will be remembered that we found the child—and the 
adult as well —constantly bringing his thoughts, interpre- 
tations, inventions, to the social tests represented by the 
judgments and sentiments which his creations meet with 
in society about him. Now this testing, essential to his 
growth as it is, finds a field of exploitation in all his 
games. And I may distinguish again two ways in which 
this advantage is secured to the young heroes of the play. 
In the first place the game is essentially a thing of 
activity ; it calls the player into action. He must make 
strenuous, varied, and repeated trial and effort. The end 
in view, the winning of the game for himself or for his ‘side,’ 
involves a series of steps, each putting him to the test in 
all the ways of action which the particular sport involves. 
It is natural. to suppose, therefore, that as such a game 
progresses the child comes to understand himself better 
through his own actions and their limitations than he did 
before. He finds out how fast he can run, how much he 
can lift, how dexterous he is in dodging, how skilful in 
eluding pursuit, etc. He thus comes directly to a larger 
and more adequate sense of his personal and social fitness 
for the common activities which the game represents, and 
with them for the real duties and undertakings which his 
actual life calls upon him to perform. This power to 
estimate self, with the self-reliance which goes with it, 
constitutes one of the essential constituents of sane and 
healthy social character. 
At the same time, second, the same revelation of the 
personal quality of the hero who thus learns to understand 
himself, is made regarding him to each of his playfellows.
-P-A-G-E-181
Play 155 
They also learn what he can do in the various exercises of 
mind and body, how ingenious he is, how supple, how in- 
ventive, how swift, how strong. And the progress of the 
game depends, or comes to depend, upon the preserving of 
some degree of balance between him and them. He is 
given his part by a quick judgment of what he can do or 
what he is liable to choose to do. He must be combined 
against if he be strong, supplemented if he be weak, in- 
structed if he be dull, circumvented if he be bright. All 
this then reacts upon the particular boy again to stimulate 
him to better and better judged effort for himself, and to 
more concerted effort for his party. 
97. The outcome of it all, we may then go on to say, 
becomes, or tends directly to become, socially important. 
A premium is put upon united action just by the fact of 
united knowledge. To exhibit what I can do alone, is to 
exhibit my importance as an ally. The sense of my weak- 
ness in myself is a revelation to me of my need of you as 
my ally. The presence of a stronger than either is a 
direct incitement to the quick alliance between you and 
me against him. And the victory which we win over the 
stronger by the alliance is both a confirmation to us of the 
utility of social co-operation and a convincing proof to him 
that society is stronger than the individual. The spirit of 
union, the sense of social dependence as set over against 
the spirit of private intolerance, the habit of suspension of 
private utilities for the larger social good, the willingness 
to recognize and respond to the leadership of the more 
competent, —in short, all that constitutes a person a dif- 
ferent person, a new self, a socius, all this grows grandly 
on the playground of every school where the natural 
instincts of the scholars are unmolested by ill-judged
-P-A-G-E-182
  156 Social Aids to Invention 
interference and artificial restrictions. Many of the or- 
ganizations of developed society are exemplified in the 
spontaneous play-organizations of large schools; and it is 
only a due recognition of these facts to say that because 
of them the games of childhood and youth are an engine 
of great social value. 
§ 3. Art 
98. The beginning of the art-impulse in children seems 
to appear in the occupations which serve to bring out the 
imagination; and by imagination in this connection we 
mean the function of invention understood in the wide 
sense, as including both the aspects of originality now set 
out in some detail? For the beginning of a career which is 
to be artistic even in the most meagre way, the child must 
make for himself new combinations of the copy-materials 
of his imitation. This is, of course, the first requirement. 
But it is evident that this does not, when taken alone, sat- 
isfy the requirements of art-production. Others may pro- 
nounce our imaginative productions grotesque, indeed we 
may do so ourselves. It is this appeal to others and to 
the matured opinion of his own better and second self that 
constitutes a claim on the artist’s part to the appreciation 
which serves to bring the work of his invention into the 
area of art. 
I do not intend in this connection to propose even the 
1If all these utilities, as well as direct organic utility, are subserved by play, 
we seem justified in considering it a native impulse, and in discarding entirely 
the view which confines it to the using up of ‘surplus energy.’ On this also 
see Groos’ The Play of Animals, Chap. I. 
2 That is, so-called ‘constructive imagination,’ by which invention pro- 
ceeds ; not passive imagination, often called ‘fancy.’
-P-A-G-E-183
  Art 157 
rudiments of a theory of art; but it is a common element 
in many theories of art that they require more than the 
subjective putting of materials together and the making 
of new shapes, if the producer is to be an artist and his 
work artistic. This second something we must look for, 
therefore, in the judgments of others than the individual, 
even though the individual may come by education or by 
heredity to have the criteria of such judgment all within 
himself. In other words, the judgment in which art-appre- 
ciation rests zs a social judgment, whether the individual 
be able to rise to it or not. And the fact that an artist 
gets the praise of mankind for his work is just the evidence 
that here is a man who, in his private sense of values, does 
in some adequate way realize the social judgment. His 
work pleases mankind. 
If this be true, —and its truth becomes more evident 
from the synthesis it enables us to make of certain current 
doctrines in zesthetic theory, —we find that art, like lan- 
guage and play, becomes capable of interpretation through 
its connection with the social consciousness. The per- 
sonal element in art, the mere creation, in the imagination, 
of new but private combinations, is invention in its early 
imitative aspect ; the appeal then made to a wider social 
judgment for the sanction of the beauty of the construc- 
tion, illustrates the second aspect of invention which we 
have now found present in so many activities of both child 
and adult: ‘social invention’ I have called it.. Let us 
see how the child gets the rudiments of art started in him 
on this basis. 
99. It is clear, when we think of it, that the only way 
that the child has of getting the appreciation of others is 
through action. We have seen how this works in his
-P-A-G-E-184
  158 Social Aids to Invention 
games. The general way, therefore, of getting the kind 
of social judgment which artistic appreciation renders, 
must also be through action; and the child must exhibit 
himself on all occasions, if he would turn his imitative 
imaginations into things of social worth. Upon these 
acts, whereby he more or less explicitly exhibits himself, 
and upon the social recognition of the inventive thoughts 
which inspire them, the beginning of all art-interests in 
the community must have originally rested, and must rest 
in the child in so far as he is left to his own devices. So 
we should expect to find children very fond of exhibiting 
themselves, of ‘showing off’ as the saying is —a phrase 
which, in its ordinary usage, may be taken to give some 
evidence at least of the reality of the phenomenon itself. 
The point thus established may be made evident to an 
observer of children not only in their games, but in all the 
affairs of their life. No invention pleases them, as we 
have seen, until it is socially confirmed by mother or sister. 
No attainment — drawing, new speech-combination, hand- 
manipulation, or what-not of youthful pride—is of much 
value, or held in high esteem, until father has seen that 
his boy can do it and do it by himself. His sense of 
agency and originality seems to feed and grow fat upon 
just the sort of recognition which comes through his 
exhibition of himself in his social circle. His judgments 
are directly modified and controlled by the social effects 
which his attainments call out. The exhibition of his new 
drawing in the home circle is as much to his budding 
genius as is the exhibition which the artist makes in the 
Salon or at the World’s Fair; and, I take it, his develop- 
ment is dependent upon it in very much the same sense, 
and to a greater degree.
-P-A-G-E-185
Art 159 
too. Originality in art, therefore, as is originality every- 
where else, is an affair both of individual endowment and 
thought and of social recognition and confirmation. It 
is not that the art-impulse is exhausted in self-exhibition; 
that is to take the later aspect for the whole, to confine 
ourselves to the social point of view, and to make genius 
out of vanity. But it is to say—and this is my essential 
point —that the social judgment, which a work of art has 
to sustain, finds its correlative impulse in the self-exhibition 
of the producer. Only thus can his own judgment be 
instructed. The reaction of this social recognition upon 
the producer is not only the fountain of his stimulus and 
the test of his success; it is also the very source of his 
sense of values. 
For the growth of the self-thought it is which gives 
the judgment of values, and that growth is by these two 
essential movements. This is carried out in detail in the 
consideration of sentiment (Chap. VIII.), where we find 
that a full ethical or esthetic judgment cannot be con- 
stituted as long as the thinker resolutely excludes the 
sense of the knowledge or judgment of others. 
1o1. If it were my purpose in this connection to attempt 
a general survey of the arts from this point of view, certain 
evident sources might be cited from which confirmation 
could be drawn. We might say that song (with the dance) 
is the first attempt at art, and both from an archeological 
point of view and from an infantile point of view, it is one 
of the first instruments of personal show and the attempt 
at social effect. The serenade of Hamlet commends 
Hamlet ; the evening circle draws closely about the indi- 
vidual who entertains the company with song. The birds 
make love with notes, and the notes seem to express the 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  160 Social Aids to [nvention 
excellence of the emotions by which they are inspired. 
In short, the idea of commending self to mate, companion, 
friend, seems to attach to song as a remnant of the utility 
which must have been great in the animal world, and to 
point to the time when song was the only art, and when 
the only function of art was that of attracting attention. 
In music generally, the plastic arts, and painting, the 
self-exhibiting impulse is more difficult to detect; but the 
outcome of it, the appeal to social recognition which they 
all make, is what remains of it. This is what I desire to 
leave in the mind of the reader as my immediate thought 
on the subject; the actual ground on which the art- 
impulse is identified, in so far, with the self-exhibiting 
impulse has been well indicated by another.? 
102. It may be well to point out, in including the con- 
sideration of art as an aid to social development, that the 
view now given serves to free the theory of Spencer from 
its most embarrassing criticism. Spencer has long held 
that the origin of art is to be found in the play-instinct. 
But he fails to see the utility of the play-instinct, and so 
opens himself to the criticism that in the doctrine of the 
genesis of art he deserts the evolution hypothesis alto- 
1 Marshall, Pain, Pleasure,and isthetics. As to the general genetic theory 
of art, that is not in place here ; but I may take occasion to suggest that the 
antithesis between decorative and imitative art may find its ground in the two 
psychological principles of sedfexhibition and imitation by which invention 
always proceeds. By émitation, the new interpretations are secured; this is 
the principle of the imitative arts, which spring from this need of man to 
reach new results by the imitative handling of materials. Then by expression, 
in the form of se/fexhibition, decoration, social display, the second need is 
realized ; so there arises the other great class of artistic products, the decora- 
tive and ornamental, coming out earliest in the painting of the person, the 
decking out of the body with bright feathers, etc., on the part of rude peoples. 
As culture advances, these two great motives are united in the fine arts. Self- 
exhibition, however, does not always require an actual audience, as Hirn, 
Origins of Ard, p. 25, seems to think I mean; cf. above, Sect. 98,  
-P-A-G-E-187
Art 161 
gether. If play be merely a surplus activity, as he seems 
to hold, then the outcome, embodied in the art-impulse, 
is a by-product merely, and is to be considered without 
utility from first to last. The theory, on the other hand, 
which identifies the art-impulse with the self-exhibiting 
impulses, is consistently evolutionary; but it has failed 
to find, in my view, that the self-exhibiting impulses have 
either the important function or the degree of exercise 
which the derivation of the art-impulse from them would 
demand. They have been connected mainly with sex. 
The present view seems to avoid these criticisms, I think. 
It makes the essential element of art-production the syn- 
thetic or creative imagination working by imitation. The 
social control and limitation necessary to esthetic value 
in these creations are secured by the self-exhibiting im- 
pulse; and finally the self-exhibiting impulses find their 
field of exercise notably in the playful tendencies. It also 
fails to find art ‘autotelic’ (an end unto itself —‘art for 
art’s sake’; a term recommended in my Diéctionary of 
Philosophy, sub verbo) except so far as playful or ‘inner’ 
imitation is autotelic. Groos has a new and interesting 
section on ‘inner imitation’ in his Play of Man, Eng. trans., 
p. 322 ff. The claim that art is autotelic is examined by 
Hirn, Origins of Art, Chap. I. 
Art-production falls, therefore, under the general function 
of ‘selective thinking’ in which the same two phases and 
the same utility have been discovered.? 
1 Above, Chap. III., § 3. It may have been noticed by the reader that this 
social determination of the selective principle in the case of the zesthetic judg- 
ment is an application of the general determination of the same principle made 
under the larger head of selective thinking. We will find another such case 
in the similar treatment of the ethical judgment. All the special instances in 
which selections are made, with the mental attitude of belief or judgment or 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
162 Social Aids to [Invention 
Both the selective criteria, however—that of social 
confirmation, as well as that of imitative construction — 
forbid our finding art creations in all the products of play, 
that is, in the ‘make-believe’! or Schezw which distin- 
guishes play from strenuous activity (v. Hartmann, Groos). 
The element of truth in that theory seems to be that in 
‘semblance’? — which is at its best in play —the sense of 
personal freedom and creation is strong — the exaggerated 
self-consciousness which we have found in all invention — 
together with the aloofness and detachment from real life 
which characterizes art. But the need of selective criteria 
in judging these creations appears in both the contrasted 
facts that (1) the veriest ‘make-believe,’ seen in fancy and 
play, is oftener grotesque than beautiful, and (2) that the 
arrangements of nature, which have in our perception no 
elements of ‘make-believe,’ are beautiful as often as 
grotesque. 
sense of ‘sufficiency,’ should illustrate the criterion found above to be general. 
The further question as to the differentiation of the respective domains, as 
for example between the esthetic and the ethical, concerns the objective 
qualities or ‘coefficients’ in accordance with which the matter of experience 
serves in this case or that to arouse this general attitude. That we cannot 
discuss here ; but the reader may turn to the remarks made on the same dis- 
tinction in the earlier connection (Sect. 55, 2). 
1 A phrase used by Stout (Anad. Psych. IL, p. 262). 
2 The term'‘semblance’ is recommended in the writer’s Dict. of Philos. for 
the instances of narrower make-believe or ‘inner imitation,’ involved in art 
and play. Under this phrase, ‘the Semblant Mode,’ the objects of play and 
art are assigned an essential rdle in the development of knowledge in the 
work, Thought and Things (Vol. I., Chap. VL, Play; Vol. IIL. Art, not yet 
published. See also the Genetic Tables in Chap. II., § 3, of Vol. I.).

CHAPTER V 
Tue Genius! 
§ 1. The Genius a Variation 
Wiru the outcome of the preceding chapter in mind, 
the problem of the genius becomes somewhat easier. The 
first requirement is that we state the social man in the 
fewest terms, in order that we may then estimate the 
genius with reference to the sane social man. What he 
is, we have seen. He is a person who learns to judge by 
the judgments of society. What, then, shall we say of the 
genius from this point of view? Can the hero-worshipper 
be right in saying that the genius teaches society to judge; 
or shall we say that the genius, like other men, must learn 
to judge by the judgments of society ? 
103. The most fruitful point of view, no doubt, is that 
which considers the genius a variation.2, And unless we do 
this, it is evidently impossible to get any theory which will 
bring him into our general scheme. But how great a vari- 
ation? and in what direction? —these are the questions. 
The great variations found in the criminal-by-heredity, 
the insane, the idiotic, etc., we have found excluded from 
society ; so we may well ask why the genius is not ex- 
1Cf. Popular Science Monthly, August, 1896.

Will to Believe, pp. 216 ff., which first appeared as an article in the Ad/antic 
Monthly, October, 1880, 
163
-P-A-G-E-190
164 The Genius 
cluded also. If our determination is correct of the limits 
within which society decides who is not to be excluded, 
then the genius must come within these limits. He 
cannot escape them and live socially. 
The directions in which the genius actually varies 
from the average man are evident, as matters of fact. 
He is, first of all, a man of great power of thought, of 
great constructive imagination, speaking as psychologist. 
So let us believe, first, that a genius is a man who has, 
occasionally, greater thoughts than other men have. Is 
that a reason for excluding him from society? Certainly 
not; for by great thoughts we mean true thoughts, 
—thoughts which will work, thoughts which bring in new 
eras in the discovery of principles, or in their application. 
This is just what all development depends upon, this at- 
tainment of novelty, which is yet consistent with older 
knowledge and supplementary to it. But suppose a man 
have thoughts which are not true, which are not ‘fit’ for 
the topic of their application, which contradict established 
knowledges, or which result in bizarre and fanciful combi- 
nations of them; to that man we generally deny the name 
‘genius.’ He is a visionary, a ‘crank,’ an agitator, or what- 
not. The test, then, which we bring to bear on the intel- 
lectual variations shown by different men, is that of truth, 
practical workability—in short, to sum it up, ‘fitness.’ 
Any thought, to live and germinate, must be a socially fit 
thought. And the community’s sense of the fitness of 
the thought is their rule of judgment. 
Now the way the community got this sense—that is 
the result we have reached above. The sense of fitness 
is just what we called above their judgment. So far at 
least as it relates to matters of social import, it is of social 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
The Genius a Variation 165 
origin. It reflects the outcome of all social heredity, 
tradition, education. The sense of social truth is their 
criterion of social thoughts, and unless the reformer’s 
thought be in some way fit to go into the setting thus 
made by earlier social development, — whether, indeed, 
the people of his generation see it or not,—he is not a 
genius, but a ‘sport.’ 
104. I may best show the meaning of the claim that 
society makes upon the genius by asking in how far in 
actual life he manages to escape this account of himself 
to society. The facts are very plain, and this is the 
class of facts which writers like Mr. Spencer urge, as 
supplying an adequate rule for the application of the 
principles of their social philosophy. The simple fact is, 
say they, that without the consent of society, the thoughts 
of your hero, whether he be genius or fool, are practically 
valueless. The fulness of time must come; and the 
genius before his time, if judged by his works, cannot be 
a genius at all. His thought may be great, so great that, 
centuries after, society may attain to it as its richest out- 
come and its profoundest intuition ; but before that time, 
it is as bizarre as a madman’s fancies and as useless. 
What would be thought, we might be asked by writers 
of this school, of a rat which developed upon its side the 
hand of a man, with all its mechanism of bone, muscle, 
tactile sensibility, and power of delicate manipulation, if 
the remainder of the creature were true to the pattern 
of a rat? Would not the rest of the rat tribe be justified 
in leaving this anomaly behind to starve in the hole 
where his singular appendage held him fast? Is such 
a rat any the less a monster because man finds use for 
his hands?  
-P-A-G-E-192
  166 The Genius 
To a certain extent this argument is forcible and true. 
If social utility be our rule of definition, then certainly 
the premature genius is no genius. And this rule of defi- 
nition may be put in another way which renders it still 
more plausible. The variations which occur in intellect- 
ual endowment, in a community, vary about a mean; 
there is, theoretically, an average man. And the differ- 
ences among men which can be taken account of in any 
philosophy of life must be in some way referable to this 
mean. Variations which do not find their niche at all 
in the social environment, but which strike all the social 
fellows with disapproval, getting no sympathy whatever, 
are thereby exposed to the charge of being ‘sports’ of 
nature and the fruit of chance. The lack of hearing 
which awaits such a man sets him in a form of isolation, 
and stamps him not only as the social crank, but also as 
the cosmic tramp. 
Put in its positive and usual form, this view simply 
claims that man is always the outcome of the social move- 
ment. The reception he gets is a measure of the degree 
in which he adequately represents this. movement. Cer- 
tain variations are possible— men who are forward in the 
legitimate progress of society—-and these men are the 
true and only geniuses. Other variations, which seem to 
discount the future too much, are ‘sports’; for the only 
permanent discounting of the future is that which is pro- 
jected from the elevation of the past. 
105. The great defect of this view is found in its defini- 
tions. We exclaim at once: who made the past the meas- 
ure of the future? and who made social approval the 
measure of truth? What is there to eclipse the vision 
of the poet, the inventor, the seer, that he should not
-P-A-G-E-193
  
  The Genius a Variation 167 
see over the heads of his generation, and raise his voice 
for that which, to all men else, lies behind the veil? The 
social philosophy of the school of Spencer cannot answer 
these questions, I think; nor can it meet the appeal we 
all make to history when we cite the names of Aristotle, 
Pascal, and Newton, or of any of the men who single-handed 
and alone have set guide-posts to history, and given to 
the world large portions of its heritage of truth. What 
can set limit to the possible variations of fruitful intel- 
lectual power? Rare such variations —that is their law: 
the greater the variation, the more rare! But so is 
genius: the greater, the more rare. And as to the rat 
with the human hand, he would not be left to starve and 
decay in his hole; he would be put in alcohol when he 
died, and kept in a museum! And the lesson which he 
would teach to the wise biologist would be that here, in 
this rat, nature had shown her genius by discounting in 
advance the slow processes of evolution ! 
It is, indeed, the force of such considerations as these 
which have led to many justifications of the position that 
the genius is quite out of connection with the social move- 
ment of his time. The genius brings his variations to 
society whether society will or no; and as to harmony 
between them, that is a matter of outcome rather than of 
expectation or theory. So the view held by William 
James, for instance, — to which we have already referred, 
—that the causes that enter into the production of varia- 
tions in the heredity of the individual are altogether physi- 
ological, and so represent a complete ‘cycle’ apart from 
the other ‘cycle’ of causes found in the social environment 
of the individual. 
While not agreeing with the doctrine which makes the 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  168 The Genius 
genius independent of the social movement, — least of all 
with the doctrine that physical heredity is uninfluenced by 
social conditions, — yet I think the hero-worshipper is right 
in saying that we cannot set the limitations of the genius on 
the side of variations in intellectual endowment. So if the 
general position be true that he is a variation of some 
kind, we must look elsewhere for the direction of those 
peculiar traits whose excess would be his condemnation. 
This we can only find in connection with the other de- 
mand that we make of the ordinary man—the demand 
that he be a man of good judgment. And to this we may 
now turn. 
§ 2. The Judgment of the Genius 
106. We should bear in mind, in approaching this topic, 
the result which follows from the reciprocal character of 
social relationships. No genius ever escapes the require- 
ments laid down for his learning, his social heredity. 
Mentally he is a social outcome, as well as are the fellows 
who sit in judgment on him. He, therefore, must judge his 
own thoughts as they do. And his own proper estimate 
of things and thoughts, his relative sense of fitness, gets 
application, by a direct law of his own mental processes, 
to himself and to his own creations. The limitations 
which, in the judgment of society, his variations must not 
overstep, are set by his own judgment also. If the man in 
question have thoughts which are socially true, he will 
himself now that they are true. So we reach a conclu- 
sion regarding the selection of the particular thoughts which 
the genius may have: he and society must agree in regard 
to the fitness of them, although in particular cases this 
agreement ceases to be the emphatic thing. The essen-
-P-A-G-E-195
The Judgment of the Genius 169 
tial thing comes to be the reflection of the social standard 
in the thinker’s own judgment ; the thoughts thought must 
always be critically judged by the thinker himself; and for 
the most part, and genetically considered, his judgment is at 
once also the social judgment. This may be illustrated 
further. 
107. Suppose we take the man of striking thoughts 
and withal no sense of fitness—none of the judgment 
about them which society has. He will go through a 
mighty host of discoveries every hour. The very eccen- 
tricity of his imaginations will only appeal to him for the 
greater admiration. He will bring his most chimerical 
schemes out and air them with the same assurance with 
which the real inventor exhibits his. But such a man is 
not pronounced a genius. If his ravings about this and 
that are harmless, we smile and let him talk; but if his 
lack of judgment extend to things of grave import, or be 
accompanied by equal illusions regarding himself and 
society in other relationships, then we classify his case 
and put him into the proper ward for the insane. Two 
of the commonest forms of such impairment of judgment 
are seen in the victims of ‘fixed ideas’ on the one hand, 
and the evaltés on the other. These men have no true 
sense of values, no way of selecting the fit combinations of 
imagination from the unfit; and even though some trans- 
cendently true and original thought were to flit through 
the diseased mind of such a one, it would go as it came, 
and the world would wait for a man with a sense of fitness 
to arise and rediscover it. Men of such perversions of 
1 This is another way of saying what was said above (Chap. III., § 3) that 
the individual’s private ‘selective thinking’ proceeds under the social tests in- 
volved in his personal growth, giving meanings that are common in the sense 
of ‘syn-nomic. (See note to Sect. 81, above.) 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
170 The Genius 
  judgment are common among us. We all know the man 
who seems to be full of rich and varied thought, who holds 
us sometimes by the power of his conceptions or the 
beauty of his creations; but in whose thought we yet find 
some incongruity, some eminently unfit element, some 
grotesque application, some elevation or depression from 
the level of commonplace truth, some ugly strain in the 
zesthetic impression. The man himself does not know it, 
and that is the reason that he includes it. His sense of 
fitness is dwarfed or paralyzed. We in the community 
come to regret that he is so ‘visionary,’ with all his talent ; 
and so we accommodate ourselves to his unfruitfulness, and 
at the best only expect an occasional hour’s entertainment 
under the spell of his presence. This certainly is not the 
man to produce a world movement. 
Most of the men we call ‘cranks’ are of this type. 
They are essentially lacking in judgment, and the popular 
estimate of them is exactly right. 
108. It is evident, therefore, from this last explanation, 
that there is a second direction of variation among men: 
variation in their sense of the truth and value of their own 
thoughts, and with them of the thoughts of others. This is 
the great limitation which the man of genius shares with 
men generally —a limitation in the amount of variation 
which he may show in his social judgments, especially as 
these variations affect the claim which he makes upon 
society for recognition. It is evident that this must be an 
important factor in our estimate of the claims of the hero 
to our worship, especially since it is the more obscure side 
of his temperament — the side generally overlooked alto- 
gether. This we call in our further illustrations the 
‘social sanity’ of the man of genius.
-P-A-G-E-197
The Judgment of the: Genius 171 
One of the evident indications of the kind of social 
variation in question may be seen in the varying effects 
which education has upon character. The discipline of 
social development is mainly conducive, as we have seen, 
to the reduction of eccentricities, to the levelling off of 
personal peculiarities. All who come into the social heri- 
tage learn the same great. series of lessons derived from 
the past, and all get, in the formative years of their educa- 
tion from the common exercises of the home and school, 
the sort of judgment required in social life. So we should 
expect that the greater singularities of disposition, which 
represent insuperable difficulties in the process of social 
assimilation, would show themselves early. Here it is 
that the conflict actually comes—a struggle between im- 
pulse and social restraint. Many a genius owes the re- 
demption of his intellectual gifts to legitimate social uses, 
to the victory gained by a teacher and the discipline 
learned through obedience. And thus it is, also, that ‘so 
many who in early life give promise of great distinction 
fail to achieve it. They run off after a phantom, and 
society pronounces them mad. In their case the personal 
factor has overcome the social factor. They have failed 
in the lessons they should have learned, their own self- 
criticism is undisciplined, and they miss the mark. 
1og. These extremes, however, do not exhaust the 
case. In one of them we see the tendency of social life 
to obscure the light of genius; in the other the ten- 
dency of the potential genius to work himself out a crank, 
through his rejection of social restraint. The average 
man is the mean. But the greatest reach of human 
attainment, and with it the greatest influence ever exerted 
by man, is yet more than either of these. It is not
-P-A-G-E-198
172 The Genius 
enough, the hero-worshipper may still say, that the genius 
should have sane and healthy judgment, as society reckons 
sanity. The fact still remains that even in his social judg- 
ments he may instruct society. He may stand alone, and, 
by sheer might, lift his fellow-men up to his point of van- 
tage, to their eternal gain and to his eternal praise. Even 
let it be that he must have self-criticism, the sense of fit- 
ness of which you speak, that very sense may transcend 
the vulgar judgment of his fellows. His judgment may 
be saner than theirs ; and as his intellectual creations are 
great and singular, so may his sense of their truth be full 
and unique. To be sure, this divine assurance of the man 
of genius may be counterfeited; the vulgar dreamer may 
have it, but nevertheless, when a genius has it, he is not 
a vulgar dreamer. 
This is true, I think, and the explanation of it leads to 
the last fruitful application of the doctrine of variations. 
Just as the intellectual endowment of men may vary within 
very wide limits, so may also the social qualifications of men. 
There are men who find it their meat to do society ser- 
vice. There are men so naturally born to take the lead 
in social reform, in executive matters, in organization, in 
planning our social campaigns, that we turn to them as by 
instinct. They have a sort of insight to which we can 
only bow. They gain the confidence of men, win the sup- 
port of women, and excite the acclamations of children. 
These people are social geniuses. They seem to antici- 
pate the discipline of social education. They do not need 
to learn the lessons of the social environment. They dis- 
count the social future as men with great intellectual gifts 
may discount the future of knowledge and invention. 
Such persons represent, I think, a variation toward sug-
-P-A-G-E-199
The Judgment of the Genius 173 
gestibility of the most delicate and singular kind. They 
surpass the teachers from whom they learn. It is hard to 
say that they ‘learn to judge by the judgments of society.’ 
They so judge without seeming to learn, yet they differ 
from the man whose eccentricities forbid him to learn 
through the discipline of society. The two are opposite 
extremes of variation ; that seems to me the only possible 
construction of them. It is the difference between the 
ice-boat which travels faster than the wind, and the skater 
who braves the wind and battles up-current in it. The 
latter is soon beaten by the opposition; the former out- 
runs its ally. The crank, the eccentric, the enthusiast — 
all these run counter to sane social judgment; but the 
genius leads society to his own point of view, and inter- 
prets the social movement so accurately, sympathetically, 
and with such profound insight, that his very singularity 
gives greater relief to his inspiration. 
Now let a man combine with this insight—this ex- 
traordinary sanity of social judgment — the power of great 
inventive and constructive thought, and then, at last, we 
have our genius, our hero, and one that we well may wor- 
ship! To great thought he adds balance; to originality, 
judgment. This is the man to start the world movements, 
if we want a single man to start them. For as he thinks 
profoundly, so he discriminates his thoughts justly, and 
assigns them values. His fellows judge with him, or learn 
to judge after him, and they lend to him the motive forces 
of success, — enthusiasm, reward. He may wait for recog- 
nition, he may suffer imprisonment, he may be muzzled 
for thinking his thoughts, he may die and with him the 
truth to which he gave but silent birth. But the world 
comes, by its slower progress, to traverse the path in 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
174 The Genius 
which he wished to lead it; and if so be that his thought 
was recorded, posterity revives it in regretful sentences 
on his tomb. 
The two things to be emphasized, therefore, on the 
rational side of the phenomenally great man—I mean on 
the side of our means of accounting for him in reasonable 
terms —are these: first, his intellectual originality; and 
second, the sanity of his judgment. And it is the varia- 
tions in this second sort of endowment which give the 
ground which various writers have for the one-sided views 
now current in popular literature. 
110. We are told, on the one hand, that the genius is a 
‘degenerate’; on another hand, that he is to be classed 
with those of ‘insane’ temper; and yet again, that his 
main characteristic is his readiness to outrage society by 
performing criminal acts. All these so-called theories 
rely upon facts—so far as they have any facts to rest 
upon — which, if space permitted, we might readily esti- 
mate from our present point of view. In so far as a really 
great man busies himself mainly with things that are 
objective, which are socially and morally neutral, —such 
as electricity, natural history, mechanical theory, with the 
applications of these,—of course, the mental capacity 
which he possesses is the main thing, and his absorption 
in these things may lead to a warped sense of the more 
ideal and refined relationships which are had in view 
by the writer in quest for degeneracy. It will still be 
admitted, however, by those who are conversant with the 
history of science, that the greatest scientific geniuses 
have been men of profound quietness of life and normal 
social development. It is to the literary and artistic 
genius that the seeker after abnormality has to turn; and
-P-A-G-E-201
  The Judgment of the Genius 175 
in this field, again, the facts serve to show their own 
meaning. 
As a general rule, these artistic prodigies do not 
represent the union of variations which we find in the 
greatest genius. Such men are often distinctly lacking in 
power of sustained constructive thought. Their insight 
is largely what is called intuitive. They have flashes of 
emotional experience which crystallize into single creations 
of art. They depend upon ‘inspiration’—a word which 
is responsible for much of the overrating of such men, and 
for a good many of their illusions. Not that they do not 
perform great feats in the several spheres in which their 
several ‘inspirations’ come; but with it all they often 
present the sort of unbalance and fragmentary intellectual 
endowment which allies them, in particular instances, to 
the olasses of persons whom the theories I am discussing 
have in view. It is only to be expected that the sharp 
jutting variation in the emotional and esthetic realm 
which the great artist often shows, should carry with it 
irregularities in heredity in other respects.1_ Moreover, 
the very habit of living by inspiration brings prominently 
into view any half-hidden peculiarities which he may have 
in the remark of his associates, and in the conduct of his 
own social duties. But mark you, I do not discredit the 
superb art of many examples of the artistic ‘degenerate,’ 
2 
1 Just as also with the criminal; both he and such geniuses may have 
physical defects, various so-called ‘stigmata’; but it is evident that it is 
incompetent logic which finds in these stigmata the ‘signs’ or invariable 
accompaniments either of genius or of criminality. And it is, @ fortiori, 
worse logic to reverse the proposition and say that a man with so-and-so- 
shaped ears, a trembling palate, or a prognathous jaw, has either the one or 
the other. Possibly the best refutation of Nordau, Lombroso, and the rest, 
on pathological grounds, is Hirsch’s book, Genius and Degeneration.
-P-A-G-E-202
  176 The Genius 
so called; that would be to brand some of the highest 
ministrations of genius, to us men, as random and illegiti- 
mate, and to consider impure some of our most exalting 
and intoxicating sources of inspiration. But I do still say 
that wherein such men move us and instruct us they are 
in these spheres above all things sane with our own sanity, 
and wherein they are insane they do discredit to that 
highest of all offices to which their better gifts make 
legitimate claim —the instruction of mankind. 
t11. Does not any theory of man which loses sight of 
the supreme sanity of Darwin,1 and with him of Aristotle, 
and Angelo, and Leonardo, and Leibnitz, and Shakespeare, 
and Washington, seem weak and paltry? Beside the work 
of these men, do not the contributions of the talented 
special performer sink into something like apologies — 
something even like profanation of that name to conjure 
by, the name of genius? But, on the other hand, why 
run to the other extreme and make this most supremely 
human of all men an anomaly, a prodigy, a bolt from the 
blue, an element of disorder, born to further or distract 
Malprosseed of humanity by a chance which no man can 
estimate? The resources of psychological theory are ade- 
quate to the construction of a doctrine of society which 
is based upon the individual, in all the possibilities of vari- 
ation which his heredity may bring forth, and which yet 
does not hide nor veil those heights of human greatness 
1In the original publication of this chapter (Pop. Sci. Monthly, August, 
1896), I used Darwin’s formulation of the principle of variations (with natural 
selection) as an appropriate illustration of the ‘judgment’ of the genius; the 
more appropriate as being itself the explaining principle applied in the text. 
I am interested to find Professor Poulton (Charles Darwin, p. 12 f.) empha- 
sizing the same characteristic of Darwin’s genius. I reprint my remarks on 
the q ibject, together with a quotation from Professor Poulton, in Appendix G,

The Inventions of the Genius 177 
on which the halo of genius is wont to rest. Let us add 
knowledge to our surprise in the presence of such a man, 
and respect to our knowledge, and worship, if you please, 
to our respect; and with it all we then begin to see that 
because of him the world is the better place for us to live 
in and to work in. 
So we find that, after all, we may be social philosophers 
and hero-worshippers as well. And by being philosophers 
we have made our worship more an act of tribute to 
human nature. Given a philosophy that brings the great 
intétouch with the commonplace, that delineates the 
forces which arise to their greatest grandeur only in a 
man here and there, that enables us to contrast the best 
in us with the poverty of him, and then we may do intel- 
ligent homage. To know that the greatest men of earth 
are men who think as I do, but deeper, and see the real 
as I do, but clearer, who work to the goal that I do, but 
faster, and serve humanity as I do, but better, — that 
may be an incitement to my humility, but it is also an 
inspiration to my life. 
§ 3. The Inventions of the Genius 
With the foregoing description of the type of man to 
whom the appellation ‘genius’ may be properly applied, it 
is of further interest to look with closer scrutiny upon the 
inventions which he produces ; with a view to finding some- 
thing of their general character, and the grounds of their 
influence as factors in the progress of mankind. The 
mechanical arts owe their progress so evidently to the 
inventions which single men make, and the movements 
of masses of people turn so often upon the social effects 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  178 The Genius 
which such contrivances bring about, that any light we 
may be able to get from this source on the motives of 
collective action should be turned to account. There are 
some considerations which give justification to the brief 
discussion of this topic. 
112, The inventions of genius fall into two classes. 
First, there are the scientific inventions, which may be 
described as, in each case, either the discovery of some 
new truth, whether it be in science proper, in literature, 
or in social life; or in the new adaptation and application 
of some aspect of knowledge already more or less ade- 
quately understood. And second, there are the esthetic 
tnventions, which are new dispositions of the material 
of thought viewed as arousing emotion and sentiment. 
These two classes of inventive creations are not mutually 
exclusive ; nor can they be said to have strict psychologi- 
cal justification as classes. For the new fact of science, or 
the new application of a scientific principle, arouses emo- 
tion; and the esthetic constructions of the artist serve to 
enlarge knowledge and refine human appreciation of truth. 
But, on the surface, these two traditional aspects of the 
novelties which the inventive mind puts forth are so 
clearly distinguished from each other, and the types of 
mind which represent them respectively are so disparate 
and so seldom found in the same individual, that we 
may well distinguish them with reference to their social 
meaning. 
113. The so-called scientific inventions, removed as they 
seem to be from the progress of social life, have important 
bearings upon it nevertheless. We only need to be re- 
minded of the printing-press, the cotton-gin, the loom, 
the threshing and reaping machines, the steam-engine,
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Inventions of the Genius 179 
and the steamboat —to take only those specimens of me- 
chanical invention which make our modern era great — 
to see that because of these contrivances our life is a 
very different thing from our fathers’. The social effects 
of the railway and the telegraph are enormous. The 
newspaper, with all its educating influence; the library 
in the home, the school, and the village building; these 
are the results of the printing-press. And almost all of 
the marked characteristics of our daily life, as far as they 
have a material side, will be found to have a direct depend- 
ence upon the inventive thought of some one man who 
first planned this or that mechanical innovation. 
There are two great ways of looking at the function of 
these inventions, apart from merely descanting upon the 
wonder and magnitude of them. These two ways of con- 
sidering them fall in with the earlier aspects of social life 
already emphasized. All inventions may be considered 
on the side of social heredity ; and as such their signifi- 
cance becomes that of the other great incentives to the 
learner —the ‘social aids to invention,’ as we have had 
occasion to call the channels of tradition and acquisition. 
Inventions, from this point of view, remain a part of the 
social heritage which posterity shares, as riches common 
to society. They go to direct social habit. 
The second aspect of discovery is what, on the other 
hand, I may call its accommodation function. Inventions 
are new elements brought into social life, new ways of doing 
things ; calling for new training, and requiring new ways 
of living to which the people have to be accommodated or 
adapted. I shall take up these two points in turn.! 
1 It is also largely through his inventions that man is able to work the changes 
in his environment which we often sum up by the phrase ‘ conquering nature,’
-P-A-G-E-206
  180 The Genius 
114. I. The psychological processes of the inventor, 
whose procedure has been discussed in the chapter on ‘In- 
vention,’ show us that an effective invention is always rooted 
in the knowledge already possessed by society. No effective 
invention ever makes an absolute break with the culture,! 
tradition, fund of knowledge treasured up from the past. 
The education of the inventive genius makes him ame- 
nable to the judgments of society, and he himself reflects 
the same standards of judgment. To invent a social 
thing without using material current in his environment 
would be as impossible to a man as to think anything 
without using the materials of his own memory and past 
imagination. It is a commonplace in psychology that, 
however fanciful the combinations which arise in our 
imaginations, and however grotesque the form in which our 
fancies parade, they must contain elements which have 
occurred at some time in the experience or in the fancy of 
the individual. This is as true of the social imagination as 
itis of the individual’s imagination. Nothing takes form in 
the usages and institutions of society absolutely per saltum. 
Just as there is, on the one hand, in the individual, a 
drift of personal tendency and a set of selected and 
dominant images which make an ‘apperceiving mass’ to 
which all the novelties of his thought must conform and 
from which they take their origin; so also is there on 
the other hand, in society, the mass of traditions, con- 
Certain writers have correctly insisted that this is an important factor in social 
progress: for if nature were not ‘conquered’ men would remain in many 
respects isolated and their social capabilities would be in so far undeveloped. 
1 Of course the nearest approach to this would be the scientific discovery of 
something absolutely unrelated to earlier knowledge; or something contradic- 
tory to current beliefs, as the Copernican theory (which, however, drew upon 
the data of common knowledge).
-P-A-G-E-207
The Inventions of the Genwus 181 
ventions, established usages, formal institutions, industrial 
and political customs, which set limits to the new. 
The individual’s creations are his only in the sense that 
it is through him that the elements of social tradition 
show themselves in their concrete variations; and if 
perchance the creations of the genius seem in a measure 
to violate tradition and to be judged more truly by the 
thinker than by society, nevertheless, even such real addi- 
tions to possible human achievement do not become the 
social success which makes them additions to human cult- 
ure, until society do come up to the standard of judg- 
ment which they require. So that while we may say, as 
we have, that the inventor himself may be a variation of 
such a kind as to seem far removed from the ordinary 
standards of society, the same cannot be said of his inven- 
tion, if it is to be a factor of social progress. 
It should be borne in mind, indeed, that the problem 
of the invention itself, considered as a factor in human 
progress, is quite different from the problem of the inventor, 
considered as a man. The invention cannot be an element 
in human progress unless it enter into the network of 
social relationships in some way. If it do not, it may be 
a thing of great ingenuity and originality; but that only 
makes it a part of the problem of the origin of the man. 
It then loses its interest as a thing of social value. 
115. The reason that an invention or discovery gets im- 
portance in the social movement is that it arouses human 
attitudes of some kind. The adjustments already effected 
in society represent, as we have seen, the various and very 
complex conditions of human activity up to the present. 
Society is stable only because these relationships are, in 
the long run and on the average, constant. The attitudes
-P-A-G-E-208
  182 The Genius 
of employer and employed, the holiday privileges, hours of 
work, scale of wages, kind of domestic life, — all of these 
things are the gradual outcome of an enormously complex 
system of personal attitudes and claims; and the relative 
satisfaction with them represents the constant interaction | 
of these attitudes and their discharge in actual and mutual 
service. Now this adjustment is usually contingent upon 
some more-or-less important invention, upon some thought 
or system of thoughts which represented some one’s 
originality. The inventions, therefore, using the word in 
the widest sense, are the points of emphasis, the nuclei, so 
to speak, the centres, from which diverging interests radi- 
ate. The normal course of a man’s life flows about some 
single idea, established scheme, institution, or even some 
single machine, which represents what to him is the out- 
come of the thought and personal effort of mankind in a 
particular direction. The inventions, then, may be taken 
as representing the advance guard of social progress. In 
them, as in centres, the fund of human mental and social 
capital is invested. The activities of men terminate on 
them and their support comes from them. 
This tendency of the interests of social life to crystallize 
about the greater thoughts and inventions which are em- 
bodied in it, shows itself in many ways. It is a phe- 
nomenon of social habit, exhibited on a large scale. It is 
the habit of the race, which the individual has to acquire 
in his personal education. It then controls his personal 
habits, because it represents the persistent line of activities 
in the accomplishment of which his life is spent. It is his 
social heritage. The sorting of men out in professions, 
in trades, in colleges, in banks, etc., is but the solidifying 
‘of the lines of personal habit in forms suited to the more
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Inventions of the Genius 183 
effective pursuit of certain common aims and activities of 
the members. So whenever a new thought comes, or a 
new invention, there is likely to be a great caving-in of 
the social crust, so to speak. And from this point there 
will again radiate a great number of vested interests. In 
fact, I find it impossible to think of a society, in any de- 
veloped sense, in which this principle does not work to 
produce in every individual a certain prescribed range of 
special interests, at the centre of which lies an idea 
or thought, now a matter of accomplished social habit, 
which gives movement to his life and affords an outlet 
to his energies. 
116. This is reflected in what is called the ‘conserva- 
tive’ spirit in society. It is the voice of social habit. 
It is the law of social heredity proclaiming itself in the 
bosom of each member of society. It says to him: 
“ Guard well the heritage of the fathers; listen not to the 
agitator, the innovator, the advocate of change. The es. 
tablished is the safe; it is acquired, it is tested; experi- 
ence is the best, indeed the only, teacher that organized 
society may appeal to.” This is even more true of society 
than it is of the individual; for when the individual makes 
the mistake of venturing beyond the teachings of his pri- 
vate experience, he simply suffers a penalty which in the 
future he can avoid — except in the cases mentioned below, 
in which his indiscretion costs him social place. But it 
is not so in the social realm. The very complexity of 
the interests involved in any social adjustment, and the 
variety of individuals who may have been brought by a 
happy combination into co-operation, makes a single inno- 
vation irrevocable. Political agitators realize this, and 
aim to carry measures by a wave of temporary enthusi-
-P-A-G-E-210
  184 The Genius 
asm against the dictates of sound social judgment. A 
detailed and complicated social arrangement may go to 
pieces through a single error of judgment. 
And this applies, as has been intimated, to mistakes 
on the part of individuals also, acting in their social 
capacity. A single lapse from convention or social moral- 
ity gives a man a name and reputation from which he 
never gets himself free. The tales of fiction-writers often 
turn upon this motive. A character appears in a com- 
munity and gains a high place by his talents and social 
probity, until some rumour of an earlier crime comes to 
blast all the fruitage of his toil; the outcome of a single 
act weighs more than all the record made under the new 
and more difficult circumstances. All this shows the 
extreme force of conservative sentiment in matters of 
social organization. It is the governor of the engine, and 
its loss is sufficient to wreck the train. Its presence is 
not an accident ; it is the safeguard which the evolution of 
society itself has produced as the necessary check upon 
precipitation and ill-judged change. 
This principle of conservatism is one of the most im- 
portant elements of what is meant by ‘ public opinion.’ 1 
So far we have reached a view which teaches us that 
the definite social attainment of society, on the side of 
what is usually called its material life, — all the acquisition 
up to the present, —is embodied in the inventive thoughts, 
schemes, institutions, industrial arrangements, etc., actually 
existing ; these are the nuclei about which the entire social 
turmoil centres. And the effect of this growth of institu- 
tions about such great germinal ideas, or inventions, is 
that men come to invest all their interests in these ideas, 
1 See below Chap.-X., § 2.
-P-A-G-E-211
  The Inventions of the Genius 185 
and so become what we ordinarily call conservative. 
Carrying these two points along with us, we may now turn 
to the other side of the matter, still concerning ourselves 
mainly with the scientific, utilitarian, ‘material’ side of 
invention. 
117. II. The second general consideration is by no 
means inferior to the first. It has to do with the actual 
growth of society, as the other has to do with the conserv- 
ing of the attainments already made by society. As we 
have seen, society has to have habits, traditions, institu- 
tions, and with them the conservative attitude of mind 
which sees that these things are jealously guarded and con- 
served. But it is plain that if this were all, no progress 
would be made; indeed, the conservative is usually the 
hindering element in social progress. Just as natural 
development has to see to it that the organism gets new 
accommodations which bring the creature constantly into 
adaptation to the newer and changing conditions of the 
environment, sometimes indeed working directly in oppo- 
sition to the habits already acquired, so also is it with the 
social body. There must be a principle of social accom- 
modation, analogous to the principle of organic accom- 
modation recognized in theories of organic and mental 
development. The requirements of the case seem to 
be essentially the same, in the two spheres. In organic 
development, we find the two principles coming to unite 
in those critical reactions which at once illustrate habit 
and at the same time secure new adaptations. In the 
growth of the individual child we have seen that the 
reactions which are imitative in type accomplish this; by 
them the child expresses himself in the habitual ways 
1 See Chap. X., § 2, below.
-P-A-G-E-212
  186 The Genius 
which he has already learned, and also secures the new 
actions which serve to bring him into better relation to 
his social and physical environment. So also recent 
writers have found that the theory of race adaptations 
proceeds upon the assumption of the same type of ac- 
tivity in the species which is to live and grow. It must 
have reactions which constantly bring the exercise of 
habits into conflict with the environment, so that the 
principle of natural selection may come in to secure the 
survival of those which can so modify their habits, so ac- 
commodate themselves to the newer conditions of living, 
as to utilize them for the purposes of life and growth. 
When we come to look at the progress of society from 
the point of view of this analogy, we find in part what 
has already been said in the pages immediately preceding. 
The law of social heredity with the conservative spirit is 
the law of social habit. By it, social reactions are made 
permanent and secure. And the kind of reactions, atti- 
tudes, institutions, which represent this law are those 
which are developed about the great germinal ideas or 
inventions of the past. The inventions of the genius 
are the nuclei of social habit. 
118. But they are more. And what more?—this in- 
troduces the question of accommodation. They are the 
loci of social accommodation, as well as the nuclei of social 
habit. As the habits of the organism are the means of 
new organic adaptations, so the habits of the social body 
are at once also the means of its growth. 
The way it works is this. The new invention comes to 
create disturbance. The kind of disturbance I mean is the 
kind which arises when the fixed ways of social activity 
of any kind are violently wrenched and altered. I
-P-A-G-E-213
  The Liventions of the Genius 187 
have only to cite the social disturbances which arise 
around the introduction of new machines to make my 
meaning clear. Riots, bloodshed, labour disputes, boy- 
cotts, revolutions of the unemployed, persecutions of the 
employing classes, attempts at conservative legislation in 
the interests of classes, these are the historical wit- 
nesses to the critical part which inventions play in the 
evolution of social life. The printing-press drove the 
illuminator and his art out of existence. The reaping- 
machine made the scythe a wall ornament, and the human 
reaper an anachronism. The steam-engine relieves the 
posthorse of his burden and the driver of his employment. 
In fact, in this material realm, the science of archzology 
is a record of the progress of humanity as it is recorded 
in its successive inventions; and our museums are collec- 
tions whose main lesson perhaps, to the student of human 
progress, is the superb one that intellect is alive in the 
world and that thought leads, even though it be by con- 
vulsions of the social body and by the strangulation of 
outgrown utilities. 
A new invention, thought, idea, in whatever realm of 
our interests it may be, is like an electric spark in a mixt- 
ure of oxygen and hydrogen. An explosion is the im- 
mediate result. But, as in chemistry, the explosion is the 
incident merely. The result of the explosion in chemistry 
is the production of the world’s drinking-water. The new 
thought is an electric spark in human affairs ; it does lead 
to the explosions. Yet they are but the sign of the new 
adjustments which society goes on to effect. The new 
supersedes the old by using it, remoulding it, refining it ; 
and after such a fight with the conservatives, to whom the 
old is too dear, the thinkers who bring in the new see
-P-A-G-E-214
188 The Genius 
that by it humanity has gained and the millennium is 
nearer. There is a precipitation about a new nucleus. 
That is the method of social accommodation. And just 
in so far as the new idea is new, revolutionary, unheard- 
of, so far will the struggle be bitter and the chance of 
its working its way less. 
119. The attitude which this law of accommodation 
tends to bring about in men is that of opposition to con- 
servatism ; we call it ‘liberalism.’ It is a tendency which 
is very real and powerful in society. It marks a tempera- 
ment in particular men, as the conservative tendency does 
in others. And any account of the impulses which play 
in social life has to do in part with these great antithetic 
attitudes, arising conspicuously about the thoughts and in- 
ventions of great men, but present always in the slower 
movements as well. 
To get the real force of the two principles now set forth, 
we should be well aware that the word ‘invention’ is not 
confined in its application to machines ; it applies to orig- 
inal conceptions of every kind. The man who proposes 
a new banking law, or a new scheme of taxation; the theo- 
rist who writes a persuasive book on the methods of city 
administration or on the ways and means of public educa- 
tion, —these men are inventors, and their proposals come 
directly before the people for social assimilation. The 
socialists of to-day are a set of more or less original men, 
who seek to commend innovations in the actual adjust- 
ments of social forces to one another. The secretary of 
the navy who submits a new scheme of coast defence, and 
the continental statesman who has an idea on the subject 
of the disturbances in Armenia, are inventors, and candi- 
dates each for the honour of being a social electric spark
-P-A-G-E-215
   The Inventions of the Genius 189 
which is to produce an explosion and set a permanent 
nucleus of progress — equally so with the man who in- 
vents duplex telegraphy or a type-setting machine. The 
idea is the thing—and the man who is able to have the 
idea. It then remains to see what society can do with 
the idea, and what the idea can do with society. 
When we come to put the two aspects of the inventor's 
work together, we find that it is not so much the particu- 
lar invention or discovery that our theory values, chosen 
out to illustrate the principle, as the general fact that 
society proceeds by inventive increments to its store, both 
of truth first and of adaptation to truth afterwards. Not 
the great genius alone illustrates it, but every man, so 
far as he thinks out novelties which society finds it pos- 
sible to embrace and assimilate. The inventor of the self- 
clasping collar-button is an original social force, in the 
same sense that the Howes and the Hoes and the Edisons 
are; but toa different degree. We can better dispense 
with the collar-button than we can with the sewing-ma- 
chine; but I doubt whether we could dispense with all 
the smaller inventions and adaptations of our lives as well 
as we could with all the larger ones. This is of course an 
artificial comparison and a needless one; but I write it 
out to illustrate the fact that the theory which we have 
now worked out concerns itself with the smaller as well 
as with the larger phenomena, and reaches results which 
set the smaller in their place beside the larger. It is a 
commonplace that all great inventions are at first rough- 
hewn, to a degree angular and unassimilable, until the 
smaller and more painstaking men have modified them 
into better conformity to the actual demand which society 
makes. The patent office is full of secondary patents fol-

lowing the few main ones which embody really great and 
novel ideas.! 
§ 4. Social and Imitative Selection 
120. It may be useful at this point to gather together 
the various meanings which we have found it possible to 
give to the term ‘selection’ when used in its social refer- 
ence ; especially in view of the confused conceptions to 
which its uncritical use may lead. In an earlier place? cer- 
tain of the meanings of selection were pointed out with 
especial reference to natural selection. In addition to 
what was said there, we find it well to suggest that the 
phrase ‘social selection’ be employed when, and only when, 
there is a real operation of natural selection working upon 
some form of social variations. This is realized in two 
cases. 
First, we have the form of social selection which results 
from the competitions of individuals with one another in 
society. There is a social survival, and even often a physi- 
cal survival, of the socially fittest zzdividuals. The man 
with the ‘pull’ gets the political place because he has the 
social qualifications which his ‘pull’ represents; and the 
man who passes the best competitive examination also gets 
the place because his qualifications are also specially fit ; 
in this case fit for the service, as in the other the fitness 
was for the ‘pull.’ The man of social gifts is employed as 
floor-walker in the business house ; and the man who writes 
a good hand and so saves the eyes of his employer, suc- 
ceeds as book-keeper. All these are cases of ‘social selec- 
tion.’ 
  1See the discussion of the ‘generalization’ worked by society, below, 
Chap. XI, § 3. 
2 Sect. 40, note. See also Sects. 306 f.
-P-A-G-E-217
  Social Selection IgI 
Second, there is the fact of ‘group selection’ which illus- 
trates natural selection operative upon social groups. Here 
there is the survival of the group as such. The fitness is 
fitness for the requirements set by the collective conditions 
of the life of the group. Historically this principle, which 
is strictly a case of natural selection, has many important 
illustrations in tribal and national competitions due to 
migration, colonization, rival occupation of territory, etc. 
It is, I think, with reference to these sorts of selection 
that the analogy between social and biological progress 
gets its force. Here we find both natural selection and 
physical heredity, with congenital variations, in operation. 
These sorts of selection; with the analogy in question, 
should be distinguished with all the more care from those 
in which one or other of these principles is not operative. 
Especially should they be distinguished from the different 
forms of selection, so important in social life, which operate 
by conscious choice and imitation. The social selection of 
individuals merges into conscious selection by individuals 
when the criterion is no longer the social variation of the 
one selected, but the choice of the one selecting. This 
distinction comes out in the illustrations given above; the 
choice of the candidate by his friend may be contrasted 
with his success in the examination. 
121. In so-called ‘imitative selection, 2 with which we 
have more to do later on, —the imitative propagation of 
ideas in society, —we have a phenomenon for which biology 
1 It gives rise to what may be called the law of ‘the widening unit,’ ze. 
that as the circle of co-operation widens the unit of survival, the group, taken 
as a whole, becomes larger. The rdle of Group-Selection in Social Evolution 
is discussed in Sect. 313 a, 1. 
2 See above, Sect. 40, note. In order to keep it quite clear from biological 
implications, as well as to designate its essential character, it is called below 
‘social generalization’ (Chap. XI., Sects. 309 f.).
-P-A-G-E-218
192 The Genius 
  shows us no analogies. What survives in this case is not 
individuals, but zdeas; and these do not survive in the 
form in which the first thinker conceives them, but in the 
form in which society applies them. Again, their fitness 
is not in any sense fitness for struggle; it is fitness for 
imitative reproduction and application. And finally, they 
are not physically inherited, but handed down by ‘social 
heredity ’ as accretions to the store of tradition. 
These essential differences may be summed up in a way 
which connects this sort of selection — so-called ‘imitative 
selection’ — with what has been said of public opinion, as 
representing the conservative spirit in society. Public 
opinion may be called the organ of imitative selection, It 
sets the standards with reference to which the idea selected 
shows its fitness. It represents the set forms of tradition 
into which the new idea is to be absorbed. It brings to 
bear the judgment which society cherishes; and which, 
when reflected into the thinker himself, constitutes the 
measure of his social sanity. It applies the idea, when 
once it is selected and embodied in this institution or that, 
to each individual in turn in the way which in its broader 
aspects we have called ‘social heredity.’ ! 
It remains only to say that we have now reached a 
sort of resting-place in our discussion, from which cer- 
tain main facts of social development appear in view. 
The essential meaning of the imitative and inventive prin- 
ciples have been discussed both on the side of the individ- 
1 The distinction between ‘social selection’ and ‘social suppression’ (men- 
tioned above, Chap. II., § 3) will be evident. It is interesting to note that 
the law is the administrative organ of the latter, public opinion being incom- 
petent to suppress individuals. Cf. Appendix B for a classification of the vari- 
ous ‘selections’ (in 2d ed., now to be found in Development and Evolution, 
Chap. XIL, § 2).

ual’s personal growth — whether he be genius or drone — 
and of the movement of society to higher levels of com- 
mon accomplishment. The outcome so far may be em- 
bodied, on the part of the individual, in the view that 
every man ts a socius ; and on the side of the social body, 
in the view that every society reveals the socius. It follows, 
from this, that there are two fundamental inquiries at the 
bottom of any adequate theory of society. The first is 
this: How far a complete knowledge of the individual man 
in society would also be a complete revelation of the society 
which he isin? And the second question is this (the re- 
verse of the other): How far ts it necessary to understand 
society, as it actually exists, in order to construct an adequate 
view of the man’s actual nature and social possibilities ? 
We now find it possible to go on to the discussion of 
these questions with some hope of reaching results. It 
will have been observed that the consideration of the 
‘esthetic’ inventions has been left over for the chapter 
on ‘Sentiment.’

THE PERSON’S EQUIPMENT 
CHAPTER VI 
His Instincts anp Emorions 
In the preceding pages, we have seen reason to believe 
that the individual has certain propensities toward life 
with his fellows, and also certain capacities for realizing 
his social nature by action. It now becomes our task to 
inquire as to the ways in which he shows the social ele- 
ments of his character in conduct. ee—s 
§ 1. Instinctive and Reflective Emotion 
122. The observation that men are emotional animals, 
and that emotion is a great incentive to action, is a com- 
monplace. We need not stop to define emotion nor 
trace its genesis in the animal kingdom. On the con- 
trary, we may assume that the reader has a clear enough 
sense of what emotion is when he feels it. The remark, 
then, that the social man has emotions and that they 
influence his conduct is pertinent here only as indicating 
a further problem: the problem, to wit, as to how the 
individual manifests his emotions and how these mani- 
festations tell, in his social life, upon him and upon 
others. 
194
-P-A-G-E-221
   Instinctive and Reflective Emotion 195 
Psychologists agree that emotion is generally an ac- 
companiment of ideas. An emotion has a distinctive 
character consonant with the character of the particular 
idea which it accompanies. A lion arouses fear, a 
friend affection, an enemy hate, etc. But there is a fur- 
ther fact about the idea or thought which one has in 
mind when he experiences a lively emotion. This appears. 
in the fact that emotions are usually classified under two, 
great heads: those which attract us to.an object thought 
of, on the one hand, and which are accompanied by pleas- 
ure, and those, on the other hand, which repel us from the 
object and feel painful. The attracting emotions are 
uniformly pleasurable and the repelling emotions painful 
experiences. And when we come to inquire into this 
curious state of things, we find only one way to explain 
either the one or the other pair of opposing facts —the 
pair representing attraction and repulsion or the pair 
representing pleasure and pain. The fact is this: that 
there is a centre of organic or personal existence —a self 
of some kind—to the welfare of which the emotion in 
some way refers. We say ‘J am afraid,’ or ‘J love and 
hate,’ or ‘the lion frightens me.’ ‘When I fly from a 
fearful thing, I try to remove myse/f’ And when I 
embrace a friend, hope for a gift, rejoice in an honour, it 
is that I myse/f find advantage in some way in the attrac- 
tion exerted upon me by the object involved in this case 
or that. This much we may say, however our opinions 
may differ as to the best way to explain this reference of 
emotion to the good or evil involved for the personal 
self. Certain emotions, usually called reflective emotions, 
have a distinct reference to our conscious thought of our 
own welfare, or the opposite. First among these, is, of 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  course, the class of emotions known as vanity, pride, etc., 
in which the thought of self is very prominent. 
123. Granting so much about emotion, another distinc- 
tion arises. There are certain emotions whose reference 
is distinctly physical, organic. In the case of these, the 
seizure by the emotion does not seem to require that we 
actually think of ourselves. We may not have time to do 
this. We often simply find ourselves in or undergoing the 
emotion, and the discovery that we are in danger or in 
joy is a later thing. These emotions are said to be 
instinctive or organic. They seem to belong to the physi- 
cal organism, and to be so closely knit into the structure 
of the body by its heredity that they serve to protect us 
from harm and to secure benefits without assistance 
from our reflective processes. 
124. Now these two references to a self-centre in the 
emotional seizure — however different the self may be in 
the two cases —are each of dirgct social importance. As 
far as the emotion is a matter of organic reaction merely, 
its expression is an affair of fixed organic habit. It sug- 
gests to us the question whether in these organic exhibi- 
tions of race habit there is to be found any evidence that 
the species to which the individual in question belongs 
has lived a social life. Of course the forms of reaction 
show the general character of the environment in which 
the emotional expressions were learned ; and if we find in 
them elements which clearly require social environment, 
then better evidence could not be wished that such ances- 
tral conditions existed. How far, then, do we find in 
emotional expression evidence of the relations of co-opera- 
tion which social life requires? , 
This question has already been answered in the various 196 fits Instincts and Emotions
-P-A-G-E-223
  
  Instinctive and Reflective Emotion 197 
works in which the social instincts have been submitted 
to more or less adequate examination. As far as man 
shows the social instincts of the animals, so far we have 
a right to say that his reactions may be taken to show 
that the early social habits of man were, in the’ respects 
which these reactions indicate, the same in kind as those 
of the animals. This is true of the family instincts in 
general: the maternal care, the paternal provision of food 
and watchfulness in danger, the parental instruction in 
movement, self-support, etc., the filial response to parental 
care andvinstruction, the fraternal attitude of the young to 
one another in the same family, the play-instinct with its 
exercises in endurance, defence, and skill. All these 
things show a common fund of acquisition by man and 
brute, and point back, I think, to the race conditions 
which were operative before man appeared upon the 
earth. As regards man himself, these tendencies are, in 
the main, hereditary, and the exercise of them in a spon- 
taneous way by the infant gives evidence of the law of 
‘recapitulation’ in its main conception.t 
In addition to these instinctive reactions of an emotional 
kind, however, there are certain other expressions found in 
a marked degree in children, and in animals sometimes, 
which it is our immediate object to investigate ; they form 
an apparent link in the chain of facts upon which both 
the biological theory of recapitulation, and also the higher 
form of the same truth found in the history of human race 
progress, rest for support. These facts are: the mant-

stages in his development which show in order some of the stages which the

are also given.

  198 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
Sestations or expressions of certain emotions which have both 
the organic and later the reflective form as well; such, for 
instance, as jealousy, fear, anger, and sympathy. These 
emotional expressions, together with the physical reac- 
tions which are shown by young children in what we 
call bashfulness and in the play-instinct, are, to my mind, 
of great importance in the mental evolution upon which 
the social life is founded.) This makes it well that we 
should understand more clearly the issues raised ; and I 
shall devote a few paragraphs to setting certain distinc- 
tions out more fully, before taking up the series of facts

125. It appears that the theory of ‘recapitulation’ has 
two great spheres of application. It applies on the animal 
side, as usually studied by the biologists and comparative 
psychologists, and it has, besides, a certain application on 
the human side—this latter having to do with what the 
writers on anthropology call culture-stages. In biology 
and comparative psychology the question is whether the 
human organism and mind go through stages which recapit- 
ulate the forms of the animal world; the anthropological 
question, on the other hand, is whether the human indi- 
vidual goes through the stages of culture which the human 
race as a species has gone through. In discussing the 
mental development of the child we have both these 
problems to solve: the two problems, z.¢., whether the 
child’s mental development recapitulates the stages of 
mental development in the animal world, and second, 
whether it then goes on to show, or to recapitulate, the 
stages through which the human mind, after it arose in 
history, has passed in our race development.! 
1 My earlier discussion, already referred to (Mental Development, Chap. I.), 
takes up only the first of these questions.
-P-A-G-E-225

It is easy to see that the social life is mainly a matter 
which falls under the second inquiry. Only in so far as 
the child has the modicum of social tendencies which we 
also find in the animals — only so far can the question as 
to whether he is recapitulating animal forms of sociality 
be put and answered. But inasmuch as the child then 
goes on to exhibit further reactions of a special kind, or 
in a special degree, which the animal world does not seem 
to possess, — especially if these latter seem to be super- 
posed upon the former and to supersede them, — the 
second question of recapitulation becomes pertinent ; and 
we then ask: Are these further tendencies of the child 
toward social life a repetition of the development of man 
from the conditions of primitive life in which he was nearer 
to the animal? The answer to this question supposes 
some knowledge of the history of culture from prehistoric 
times: the information which the ethnologist sets himself 
to discover. Just as the comparative morphologist fur- 
nishes his data to the human embryologist and asks him 
to discover parallels which indicate recapitulation ; so the 
ethnologist may come with his determinations of the social 
conditions of primitive man at various epochs, and ask the 
psychologist to point out parallel stages in the child’s 
progress. 
When we come to put together the two spheres of ap- 
plication of the principle of recapitulation, we find that the 
history of the whole progress of the animal series up into 
the human “epoch, and also the later history of the man’s 
progress in social life, should be given in the child’s 
growth. And we cry, how rich a field of study! But the 
very fact that the child has to reveal so much, makes it 
impossible to expect that the record will be complete.
-P-A-G-E-226
  200 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
On the organic side, we find a reasonably complete record 
of animal progress in biological development; but the 
very fact that it was only after man had come that the 
development of the social life began which requires much 
intelligent co-operation — this tends to obscure the earlier 
stages of mental development. In order to be reflectively 
social, the child must be less aggressive, more tolerant, 
more adaptable, less dominated by inflexible instinct. But 
in order to this, those stages of the development in the 
animal mind which require the opposite qualities, such as 
high instinctive equipment, must be either quickly passed 
over by the child, or be absent altogether. If this general 
point be true, then we should expect to find in the mental 
development of the child only those mental traits of the 
animals which could exist along with the higher social 
development which comes to be an essential thing in 
human life. 
126. Such traits, we do find, as a fact, in the child: cer- 
tain great systems of reactions and their mental accompani- 
ments which bear such a construction. These reactions 
seem to be original elements in his hereditary equipment. 
They seem to be well explained by the law of organic 
recapitulation. 
Yet we find that they are also capable of a construction 
which would have placed them as the results of intelligent 
adaptation and social co-operation. They can be explained 
as illustrating the later or anthropological sort of recapitu- 
lation. These are the emotional expressions of which I 
am about to speak. 
To cite an instance: the child shows certain mative ex- 
pressions of affection which are common to him and cer- 
tain animals. These expressions can only be accounted for
-P-A-G-E-227
Lustinctive and Reflective Emotion 201 
as having arisen ancestrally under conditions in which, in 
certain respects, these animals now are. But after the 
child grows older, we find that his zzzelligent expressions 
of affection take the same channels. If we had not seen 
them in the child at the earlier period, we should have 
said, quite possibly, still applying the theory of recapitula- 
tion, that they represented the period in the development 
of the human race when certain ways of intelligent action 
in a social community were found useful. There are here, 
therefore, two different assignments of these reactions 
by the recapitulation theorist. This serves to show how 
rich a field for interpretation these emotional expressions 
are. It is interesting to note that Darwin, and the other 
writers who have studied them, have with rare exceptions, 
as far as I know, confined the interpretation to the utilities 
in the animal series, without inquiring into the culture- 
history side; that is, without inquiring as to the second or 
intelligent utility which the same reactions subserve in 
the history of human development, together with the cor- 
respondence between the two. 
127. As to the relative effects which these two kinds 
of recapitulation produce in the child’s development, cer- 
tain truths may be made out. We may say (1) in so far 
as the heredity of the child’s animal ancestry tended to 
come into conflict with the requirements of the social de- 
velopment of the race of mankind, then the former must 
have been obliterated ; since, as a fact, the child does ful- 
fil the requirements of social development. The self-seek- 
ing tendencies of the animal must give place to co-operation 
and sympathy. And the process of selection, in order to 
get the human race started on a career of sociability, must 
have put a premium upon variations which did this. (2) In 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  202 fits Instincts and Emotions 
so far as the organic reflexes of animal instinct, which had 
proved useful to the animal, did not hinder the develop- 
ment of the social ways of action thus put at a premium, 
they would run an equal chance of still surviving for the 
sake of their older utility. And (3) in so far as the animal 
modes of action served Surposes which were favourable to 
the growth of social life, or could be pressed into the 
newer utilities of social life, then these reactions would be 
confirmed and further developed. The germs of social 
life found in the gregarious habits of certain animals were 
available for further development in man. 
The first of these three classes of cases we find illus- 
trated, in the human young, in the absence of native in- 
stincts impelling to co-ordinated systems of movement 
apart from certain combinations which are actually neces- 
sary to his life. And the reason becomes clearer when we 
remember what has already been said as to the need of the 
child’s having all his members so plastic and unconstrained 
as to learn, as fast as possible, the acts of skill which his 
social environment requires of him. These acts are so 
varied that the same muscles and members have to be 
used in the greatest variety of combinations; a need 
which could not be fulfilled if these muscles and the brain 
matter which works them were already tied up in such in- 
stincts as those possessed by the animals. Plasticity is 
the rule of social life, and its requirement; the opposite 
is the condition represented by animal instinct. 
The second and third cases also have instructive exam- 
ples. We may ask why the arms are no longer legs, 
while the legs are still legs. The reason is plain. The 
purposes of locomotion require legs; the legs remain legs 
because to lose all legs would have been to lose life.
-P-A-G-E-229
Instinctive and Refiective Emotion 203 
These organs are continued because they continue a func- 
tion which the new dawning social life not only does not 
antagonize, but actually requires. But the arms cease to 
be legs because a social function can be found for them, 
without sacrificing any essential animal function. This 
the organism found a way of effecting as soon as the 
adaptation which we call upright-walking was reached. 
So the fore paw, with its flat simplicity of use, became the 
human hand—that most marvellous implement of human 
utility. The tongue is a case in which the old and the new 
functions exist together in the same member: eating and 
speech. 
128. The third of these cases—the ratification and 
further development for social utilities of the ways of 
animal action which first rose for organic utilities —this 
brings us again to the emotional expressions which we set 
out to examine. 
The thing which strikes us at the outset, in taking up 
the emotional expressions which have social value, is just 
their double meaning. That they have this double mean- 
ing indicates, again, two general things about their condi- 
tions of rise and their relation to each other. First, it is 
evident that, in order to persist in the social development 
of mankind after serving their utility in the animal series, 
—while, as we have seen, so many other animal reactions 
did not persist, —they must have represented adaptations 
to a pre-social environment which was at least consistent 
with the social environment, if not actually in a measure 
social. Ata, second, it must mean that when taken to- 
gether all these reactions are to be explained, along with 
the new social adaptations which have been built up 
upon them, by one general life-tendency. That is, the 
\ \ 
x  
-P-A-G-E-230
  204 fits Instincts and Emotions 
drift of the selective principle must have been to conserve 
and develop these sorts of reaction. And from these 
truths the further one seems to be reached: that the 
principles of selection and survival get a construction 
which shall secure social progress. 
§ 2. Bashfulness and Modesty 
129. The more evident physical accompaniments of 
bashfulness in the child have been well set forth by various 
writers ; and one at least of the signs of modesty, by far 
the most striking sign in the youth and adult, dlushing, 
has been discussed in some detail by Darwin.? The fol- 
lowing description of the phenomena of bashfulness, with 
hints as to the phylogenetic meaning, may be quoted from 
my earlier work.® 
“Tt [bashfulness] begins to appear generally in the first 
year, showing itself as an inhibiting influence upon the 
child’s normal activities. Its most evident signs are ner- 
vous fingerings of dress, objects, hands, etc., turning away 
of head and body, bowing of head and hiding of face, 
awkward movements of trunk and legs, and in extreme 
cases, reddening of the face, puckering of lips and eye 
muscles, and finally cries and weeping. An important dif- 
ference, however, is observable in these exhibitions accord- 
ing as the child is accompanied by a familiar person or not. 
When the mother or nurse is present, many of the signs 
seem to be useful in securing concealment from the eye of 
strangers — behind dress or apron or figure of the familiar 
person. In the absence, however, of such a refuge, the

child sinks often into a state of general passivity or inhibi- 
tion of movement, akin to the sort of paralysis usually asso- 
ciated with great fear. 
“This analogy with the physical signs of fear, gives a 
real indication, I think, of the race origin of bashfulness; 
it is probably a differentiation of fear. This I cannot 
dwell upon now, but simply suggest that bashfulness arose 
as a special utility-reaction on occasion of fear of persons, 
in view of personal qualities possessed by the one who 
fears. The concealing tendency also shows the parallel 
development of intimate personal relationships of protec- 
tion, support, etc., and so gives indications of certain early 
social conditions. 
“My observations of bashfulness— not to dwell upon 
descriptions which have been made before by others — 
serve to throw the illustrations of it into certain periods 
or epochs which may be briefly characterized in order. 
“1, The child is earliest seized with what may be called 
‘primary’ or ‘organic’ bashfulness, akin to the organic 
stages in the well-recognized instinctive emotions, such as 
fear, anger, sympathy, etc. This exhibition occurs in the 
first year, and marks the attitudes of the infant toward 
strangers. It is not so much inhibitory of action in this 
first stage; it rather takes on the positive signs of fear, 
with protestation, shrinking, crying, etc. 
“The duration of this stage depends largely upon the 
child’s social environment. The passage from the attitude 
of instinctive antipathy toward outsiders, and that of affec- 
tion equally instinctive toward the members of the house- 
hold, over into a more reasonable sense of the difference 
between tried friends and unproved strangers —this de- 
pends directly upon the growth of the sense of general  
-P-A-G-E-232
  206 © fits Instincts and Emotions 
social relationships established by experience. One of the 
most important elements in the child’s progress in this 
way out of its ‘organic’ social life, is the degree and 
variety of its intercourse with other children, and indeed 
with other adults than those of its own home. 
“2, I find next a period of strong social tendency in the 
child, of toleration of strangers and liking for persons gen- 
erally, in great contrast to the attitudes of organic distrust 
of the earlier period just mentioned. There seems to be in 
this a reaction against the instinct of social self-preservation 
characteristic of the earlier stage. It is due in all likelihood 
to the actual experience of the child in receiving kind treat- 
ment from strangers — kinder in the way of indiscriminate 
indulgence than the more orderly treatment which it gets 
from its own parents. Everybody comes to be trusted on 
first acquaintance, by the child, through the teachings of 
his own experience, just as in the earlier years everybody 
was treated by him, under the instincts of his inherited 
nature, as an agent of possible harm. 
“3, Finally, I note the return of bashfulness in the 
child’s third year or later. This time it is bashfulness 
in the proper sense of the term, rid of the element of fear, 
and rid largely of its compelling organic force and meth- 
ods of expression. The bashful five-year-old smiles in 
the midst of his hesitations, draws near to the object of 
his curiosity, is evidently overwhelmed with the sense 
of his own presence rather than with that of his new 
acquaintance, and indulges in actions calculated to keep 
notice drawn to himself. 
“The reality of this group of the child’s social attitudes, 
and the great contrast which they present to those of the 
organic period, can hardly have too much emphasis. It
-P-A-G-E-233
  Bashfulness and Modesty 207 
is one of the great outstanding facts of his progressive 
relation to the elements of his social mlieu. There isa 
sort of self-exhibition, almost of coquetry, in the child’s 
behaviour; which shows the most remarkable commin- 
gling of native organic elements with the social lessons 
of personal well- and ill-desert which are now becoming 
of such importance in his life. All this makes so 
marked a contrast to the exhibitions of organic bashful- 
ness that it constitutes in my opinion a most important 
resource for the study of the evolution of the social 
sense. 
“The observation of organic bashfulness tends to con- 
firm our view of the way the child begins to apprehend 
persons ; and at the same time it enables us to see a little 
further. For, strange as it may appear, we are here con- 
fronted with an element of organic equipment especially 
fitted to receive and respond to these peculiar objects, 
persons: ‘personal projects.’ The child strikes instinc- 
tively a particular series of attitudes when persons ap- 
pear among his objects, attitudes which other objects, 
qua objects, do not excite. And later in life, in the organic 
effects indicative of modesty, such as blushing, hesitating, 
etc., we find familiar signs of a social rapport which has 
grown into the very fibre of our nerves. We have to 
say, therefore, that the child is born to be a member of 
society in the same sense precisely that he is born with 
eyes and ears to see and hear the movements and sounds 
of the world, and with touch to feel the things of 
space.” 
130. These facts, with the inferences from them, may 
be taken as sufficient for purposes of description. The 
two principles which seem to be revealed are: /irs¢, that
-P-A-G-E-234
  208 fits Instincts and Emotions 
these reactions, taken as a whole, indicate the existence of 
social conditions so far back in the organic ancestry of the 
child that the reactions which show adaptation to such an 
environment have actually become ingrained in the ner- 
vous structure of the child to the extent that the functions 
are now instinctive. It is impossible to believe that the 
young chick would heed the warning note of the hen when 
the hawk flies over, unless his ancestors had experienced 
similar common dangers; so it is impossible to believe 
that the child could show instinctive bashfulness before 
persons except on the supposition that his ancestors have 
sustained close relations of some kind to their fellows. 
Of course, it still remains to ask how far back this condi- 
tion of social relationship goes in the life-series; whether 
they are only present after the human species appears 
with its tendency to establish intelligent social co-opera- 
tion. This depends upon the kind of social co-operation 
which the actual reactions shown by the bashful child 
would indicate. Upon such an actual examination of the 
reactions involved depends also the question as to the 
character of these ancestral social relationships. Apart 
from the details of fact, however, there is a general hy- 
pothesis which seems to be justified by this phenomenon. 
It is this: that organic bashfulness is, as is indicated in 
the quotation above, a differentiation of animal fear ;1 and 
that the more reflective bashfulness which comes only 
after the child has begun to have a notion of his subjec- 
tive self, is a reaction of anthropological origin. On this 
view the organic form of the reaction belongs to the 
animal phylogeny, and the reflective form is a further

changes in the rabbit’s ear during slight fear and excitement: Mosso, Fear.

Bashfulness and Modesty 209 
development belonging to the human phylogeny; so that 
both sorts of recapitulation cited above are represented in 
the growth of the child’s modesty reactions. The phe- 
nomena of blushing, and certain other physiological ap- 
pearances, belong in both of these. 
131. As to further evidence in favour of this position, I 
may cite: First, the general course of the child’s develop- 
ment. Organic bashfulness appears at the remarkably 
early period when the child has no reflective processes, no 
emotions due to ideas, except as his suggestions confirm 
his instinctive reactions. He cannot inhibit his bashful- 
ness, nor much modify it, His mental part is below the 
development of certain of the animals. Again, the details 
of the reactions of this first sort of bashfulness are strik- 
ingly similar to those of purely instinctive fear, as it is 
shown by the animals. The profoundly organic elements 
in these modifications seem to require that their origin be 
as far back in the life-series as the indications on other 
grounds will allow us to place them. 
Second, these exhibitions of organic bashfulness are modi- 
fied as soon as the later development of self-consciousness 
brings in reflective modesty. The characteristics common 
to this reaction and to fear tend to disappear; and the 
child’s attitudes become mainly a mixture of fear, hesita- 
tion, and self-exhibition. This last element, seen in the 
child’s unwillingness to allow himself to be overlooked by 
strangers, is in striking contrast to the concealing tenden- 
cies of the organic period. It can only have arisen, it 
would seem, after the child had attained some more or 
less obscure form of self-consciousness. This would bring 
this form of the modesty reaction down into the human 
epoch in race-history ; since there is no evidence of such a 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  210 fits Instincts and Emotions 
sense, except in the most rudimentary form,! in any of the 
higher animals. These higher manifestations of modesty 
get their only explanation as belonging to primitive human 
society, and as having arisen by the adaptation of the 
earlier bashful attitudes, which primitive man inherited © 
to the requirements of more complex social life. This 
agrees with the supposition that the organic form of 
bashfulness belongs in the animal phylogeny, where it is 
mainly the reaction of fear. 
Third, I think there are signs of organic bashfulness to 
be found in certain animals. The behaviour of a dog in 
the presence of strange dogs appears to justify this opin- 
ion. When the dog meets an unknown dog, he shows a 
general disposition to be cautious ; he gets ready for flight, 
but still does not fly; he shows an incipient fear-anger 
psychosis by the raising of the hair of his neck, the 
straightening out of his tail, the setting of his ears forward 
in an alert way —all attitudes of self-defence.2 And with 
it all, there is a set of tentative manceuvres of exploration, 
1 The evidence of such a sense is usually drawn from just these animal 
emotions: pride, jealousy, etc. And in estimating it, one is embarrassed by 
the question as to how much of these may be instinctive. In a paper on ‘In- 
timations of Self-consciousness in Animals,’ read in my Seminary, Dr. C. W. 
Hodge concluded that we must allow dogs (eg.) an obscure form of self-feel- 
ing. That a dog may eject something of his own mental life and act as if he 
‘put himself in another’s shoes,’ while still maintaining his own self-sense, 
appears in the following case, which I have at first hand from Mrs. Baldwin. 
Her dog Nero was accustomed to escape from the yard by a hole under the 
fence. On one occasion a strange dog visited him and was shut in the yard 
by the closing of the gate. Nero, who was outside, helped him to get out by 
running ahead on the other side of the fence, barking vigorously, and looking 
back to see that the other dog followed, until he led him to the hole through 
which he was himself accustomed to escape. 
? Cf. Darwin’s description of these attitudes in the dog. xf. of the 
Emotions.
-P-A-G-E-237
Bashfulness and Modesty 211 
scenting, advancing and retreating, etc., which are very 
similar to some of the indications of bashfulness of the 
child. We cannot say that the dog is waiting to see what 
the other dog thinks of him; that would be to make of 
the dog a man; but we can say that his actions may be a 
sort of race equivalent of just that. And as soon as fair 
treatment, or a show of respect from the other dog, ap- 
pears, he grows affectionate and demonstrative. This is 
also the course of the child. Moreover, the signs of shame 
which some writers have observed in animals are to be 
brought under this class of reactions. These signs are 
those of slinking away, attempting to hide, random move- 
ments with a good deal of inhibition, sinking of the body 
toward the ground, and furtive restlessness of gaze. All 
these things are present also in the child’s early bashful- 
ness, in the period before the dawning of self-conscious- 
ness introduces an element of self-exhibition into the 
phenomenon. 
Fourth, there is a class of modesty actions associated 
with the sexual relation which show a similar likeness to 
the reactions of the child. It is evident how great a place 
this kind of social toleration and acquiescence must have 
had in animal life. (The oncoming of adolescence had 
to be provided for in the hereditary impulse; and among 
the actions which represent social life in general, we 
should expect that those which belong to this relation 
would be prominent. Now the phenomena which various 
writers have described as characteristic of animals at their 
mating, will be found, when analyzed, to show remarkable 
similarities to those shown by the bashful child What 
1 See Groos’ detailed descriptions of ‘Courting Plays’ and the coyness 
(Sprédigkeit) of the female, especially among birds (Play of Animals).
-P-A-G-E-238
  212 Fits Instincts and Emotions 
this means in the development of the child is probably 
this: that the modesty reactions which he inherits and 
which he finds himself performing all through his life, are, 
in a measure, those which the sexual relations of the 
earlier forms have established, and which his own adoles- 
cent period will, at a later time, bring again into ac- 
tivity. That the general phenomena of bashfulness, in 
all its phases, is pronounced and unmistakable in what 
we call ‘shyness’ as the period of adolescence approaches 
in the youth, is a matter of common knowledge. The 
force of this consideration would also be in the direction 
of placing the organic basis of bashfulness and shyness 
back in the animal epoch of evolution. 
These indications seem to me sufficient to lead us to the 
probability that, in the bashful youth, we have both terms 
of race-history represented. The further development of 
the modesty reactions of the individual take us on in the 
history of social humanity. And at the outset I may say 
a few words about the course of the child’s progress from 
a bashful babe to a modest man. 
132. On the organic side, we find the reactions charac- 
teristic of so-called bashfulness giving way to those which 
go by the name ‘shyness,’ as the child grows up into the 
period of youth. Shyness is, however, more particularly 
applied to mental and social attitudes. The physical signs 
of shyness are, in the main, a lowering of the eyes, bowing 
of the head, putting of the hands behind the back, nervous 
fingering of the clothing or twining of the fingers together, 
and stammering, with some incoherence of idea as expressed 
inspeech. With these external signs comes on the remark- 
able adult sign of shyness or modesty, — blushing. These 
physical manifestations seem to be very largely survivals
-P-A-G-E-239
  
  Bashfulness and Modesty 213 
from the more overpowering bodily expressions of the 
young child’s bashfulness. They are to a great degree 
inhibited by the habits which go with adult self-control ; 
and they are not allowed to come out at the mere triviali- 
ties of social intercourse with strangers, as the child’s do. 
But in their character they affect the same members, and 
the occasion of their display is the same in kind. It is 
interesting, also, to observe in those whose adult shyness 
is extreme, as it sometimes is, how really childish the 
phenomena seem to an on-looker. Some young ladies, in 
particular, seem to be quite incapable of undergoing an 
introduction without such evident display of what we call 
‘self-consciousness’ that the meeting is embarrassing on 
one side and uncomfortable on the other. 
More positively, the appeal may be made to the sort of 
emotional consciousness which the expressions of social 
embarrassment carry with them in persons of sensitive 
social temperament.! 
To people who are thus constituted, the social relation 
is, purely from an organic point of view, the most exhaust- 
ing, nerve-trying relation which one can well imagine. It 
is quite impossible to keep up even the most trivial social 
contact, such as travelling with an acquaintance, sitting 
or walking with a friend, etc., without soon getting in a 
condition of such nervous strain that, unless one break 
the relation occasionally to be alone, even the ‘yes’ and 
‘no’ of conversation becomes a task of tasks. If, how- 
ever, the relation involve thought of an objective kind 
which does not bring the social relation itself forward,

sense in many respects, and the following remarks may be taken as giving

-P-A-G-E-240
  214 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
such intercourse is most exhilarating and enjoyable. The 
finer shades of emotional effect are associated with in- 
creased rapidity in the heart-beat, some slight setting of 
the blood to the head, more rapid breathing, a general 
toning up of the muscular system, and a peculiar static 
pressing inwards—from the front—of the abdominal 
muscles. This is accompanied, on the mental side, with 
what I can describe only as a ‘sense of other persons.’ 
This ‘sense of other persons’ may break up all the mental 
processes. The present writer cannot think the same 
thoughts, nor follow the same plan of action, nor control 
the muscles with the same sufficiency, nor concentrate 
the attention with the same directness, nor, in fact, do 
any blessed thing as well, when this sense of the presence 
of others is upon him. But there are other peculiarly 
social, z.e., conversational, etc., functions which are then at 
their best.1 
133. Apart from these more hidden organic changes, 
the one general effect due to the presence of other persons 
1 At the same time there is an extreme form of this social sentiment, when 
the mental processes are kept strictly objective, which amounts to a sort of 
exaltation of all the faculties and a stimulus to success. 
The only way that I, for one, can undo this distressing outgo of energy, 
and release these uncomfortable inhibitions, is to expand the abdomen out- 
wards by a strong muscular effort and at the same time breathe-in as deeply as 
Ican. But even the process of doing this is not normal, the very control of 
these muscles being in some degree under the same social ban. After such a 
siege of society, one must seek the rest of absolute solitude. The comparative 
relief found in expanding the abdominal muscles is probably due to the fact that 
it allows the contents of the body to fall, and so relieves the heart from any 
artificial pressure which may be upon it from the surrounding organs. Further, 
the increased heart-action which is itself a part of the reaction of shyness, 
requires all the space it can get. It is only in self-defence that such a person 
cultivates social coldness and indifference. Two recent studies of these effects 
are ‘Morbid Shyness,’ by H. Campbell, Brit. Aled. Journal, Sept. 26, 1896, 
p. 805, and L. Dugas’ ‘ La Timidité?

is that of blushing. The extent of the blush is described 
by Darwin with his usual thoroughness, ze., the parts 
of the body to which it extends, and it is an interesting 
fact that the blush proper is limited, in his opinion, largely 
to the surfaces which are exposed to the gaze of others, 
appearing mainly on the face and neck.) It begins in 
early childhood, about the time when we may say with 
confidence that the sense of self is moderately well devel- 
oped. I have seen my child H. blush vividly in the sixth 
year, but it is probably to be observed much earlier. 
Blushing is a general modesty reaction, since it is not 
limited to either sex, although it is usually stronger and less 
controllable in woman than in man (in the case of adults), 
and it is not due exclusively to any one occasion of mod- 
esty. The spheres in which it is most extreme are those 
which involve what is called shame in all its varieties, such 
as is caused by the thought of physical immodesty, seen 
in exposure of the covered parts of the body, by sugges- 
tions of personal uncleanness in body or mind, by the 
most distant allusions to matters of the sexual relation, or 
even merely to persons of the opposite sex, and by indeli- 
cate situations of any kind. 
There is also the sphere of moral ill-desert, the sug- 
gestion of disapproval or even lack of appreciation, of mis- 
taken inference, or harsh judgments; all these call out 
the blush in the party morally judged, provided he know 
that this opinion is entertained of him. The adverse 
judgment of othets is sufficient in many people to bring 
1 Mosso, however, thinks the blush is more diffused and is only the striking 
instance of the general vasomotor effect seen (in his experiments on animals) 
in the skin-vessels generally. Darwin supposes the blush to be due to ‘atten- 
tion to self’ (Zxp. of Emotion, pp. 331 ff.), and his discussion of the vaso- 
motor effects of the attention is still one of the best.
-P-A-G-E-242
  216 fits Instincts and Emotions 
a blush even though there be nothing to justify the opin- 
ion; and the calmest sense of being right is often not 
calm enough to prevent the appearance of guilt conveyed 
by the blush. This reaction is, however, in great part 
a transitory one in the development of the individual. 
The loss of bodily sensitiveness seems, for the most part, 
to go with the loss of moral sensitiveness. The dulling of 
the social sense in general, as seen in ethical decay, fre- 
quent violations of social requirements, and habitual relax- 
ation of attitude with reference to the claims of either 
physical or moral propriety, tends to make the reaction 
of blushing infrequent and unintense. We often hear 
of persons who have ‘forgotten how to blush.’ Yet the 
blush may grow more and more vivid as the social sense 
grows more and more refined. 
Again, it is interesting to note that the organic process 
of blushing may be brought about simply by the imagina- 
tion of social condemnation, or by a situation of real de- 
merit in which there is no witness but one’s own self. 
Self-condemnation may bring its own organic result. 
134. Coming from so much description of the facts, 
both physical and mental, of these modesty reactions, 
we may inquire into their possible construction on the 
evolution hypothesis. What light do they throw on the 
conditions of race-history, either in its animal stage or in 
its human stage? 
As to the meaning of these signs, it seems impossible to 
think that they could have arisen in the course of the 
intercourse of man with man, and especially of man with 
woman, which characterizes peaceful society. The sur- 
vival of organic effects of this definite and persistent kind 
must have had some profound justification which the his-
-P-A-G-E-243
  Bashfulness and Modesty 217 
tory of civilized man’s dealings with one another does not 
disclose. 
Assuming the correctness of the position taken above 
—that bashfulness is a differentiation of fear, the fear of 
persons present in ruder family or tribal relationships — 
and that bashfulness also has a strong ingredient of the 
reactions of mating, we may find in these points sugges- 
tions to carry further. I think that the differences be- 
tween the organic effects of bashfulness and those of the 
higher modesty reactions are to be accounted for as modi- 
fications due to the further social relations which were 
imposed, in the progress of evolution, upon these con- 
stant elements. Man continued to fear when there was 
occasion for fear, as also does the child. Man of course 
continued to mate; but certain regulations of his mating 
were established in his social progress. All these profita- 
ble variations became engrained in his nervous constitu- 
tion, and so tended to modify the simpler characteristic 
exhibitions. The general meaning of this may now be 
indicated, as far as we have ground for thinking that we 
can make it out. 
135. Certain general bearings of the facts may be set 
forth before we attempt to give more detailed inferences. 
1. The inclusion of the moral emotions in the class of 
mental experiences which call out such organic reflexes as 
blushing,! shows that these emotions are of social origin, 
and have arisen in the same movement with the other fac- 
tors of this entire group of effects. We have already seen 
that the ethical sense is a growth. The reconstruction by 
1 The sameness of expression of the more refined with the coarser emotions 
has been noticed before, and it has been discussed from an evolution point of 
view by Schneider, 7hierische Wille, p. 120.
-P-A-G-E-244
  218 Flts Instincts and Emotions 
the child, in his own experience, of the social relationships 
through which his sense of self gets its discipline and clari- 
fication, makes him ethical. The discovery, therefore, that 
the organic reactions to ethical relationships are included in 
those of the social generally, shows that the plan of race ac- 
quisition of the ethical sense is recapitulated, in its great 
outlines, at least, in the child. I find it impossible to see, if 
we assume the Darwinian theory of the origin of emotional 
attitudes and expressions, why the class of emotions which 
we cover by the term ‘shame’ should be cut in two, and 
those which are simply social should be said to have grown 
up in race-history in union with their expression, while the 
other half, those which are called ethical, although show- 
ing the same organic reactions, should be supposed to have 
acquired their connection with the organism in some extra- 
evolutionary way. This agreement, in fact, in the expres- 
sions of the ethical and social, taken with the social rise of 
the ethical emotions in the child, furnishes, to my mind, a 
twofold and irresistible proof of the evolution of the ethical 
sentiments in race history. No other theory seems to ex- 
plain the blush of moral shame. \ 
136. 2. These reactions point to conditions of actual 
and active personal relationship in which they were of 
utility to the individual or the species. It is evident that 
they are less useful than damaging in our present society. 
By the blush the criminal only betrays himself; by agita- 
tion the lover makes himself weak. The act of indelicacy 
thus carries its own condemnation, while the man or 
woman who is self-possessed escapes suspicion. The util- 
ity of these reactions could be established, therefore, only 
for a society in which the physical was in some way largely 
the measure of social efficiency, and the rushing of blood
-P-A-G-E-245
Bashfulness and Modesty 219 
to the head gave a respite or a resource which now we find 
in the ‘soft answer which turneth away wrath,’ or in the 
deed of moral restitution. 
_ Weare forced, if this be true, to look for the conditions 
in which these reactions had active and effective play, 
backward in the history of man, to the period of primitive 
culture at which the physical was the main social weapon 
and law. Indeed, anthropological study enables us, from 
the object-lessons which we still have from primitive com- 
munities, to see to what a degree the meeting of a fellow 
was loaded with possibilities of danger and need of self- 
defence. In rude societies, the women are often matters 
of strife to the men, and the contest is a physical one ;} 
and apart from the distinction of sex, with the causa belli 
which it affords, the rivalry of clan, the personal glory 
which accrues to the savage warrior, the element of 
treachery which makes the lone individual in the woods or 
at the camp-fire a legitimate victim,—all these things, 
which are most critical and striking factors in rudimentary 
social life, make it only natural that the association of man 
with man and of man with woman should leave certain 
well-differentiated effects in his organism. Nor is it sur- 
prising that these effects should be taken up and perpetu- 
ated, in less gross but still unmistakable forms, when the 
personal relationships are developed in the more subtle 
modes which we call ethical and social.? 
137. Allowing these two general statements to stand as 
sufficiently proved by the fact that these reactions are 
what they are, I may be allowed to go a little into detail 
as to the more particular elements which entered into the

  220 fits Instincts and Emotions 
social conditions of the environment in which they arose; 
at the same time saying that these details are matters 
of my own personal attempts at interpretation, and are in 
so far more liable to incur criticism. I would not have 
them endanger the two general statements, however, which 
are made above, and which I hold are well proved, pro- 
vided only the postulate of organic evolution be accepted. 
At the same time the points which follow furnish addi- 
tional illustration and evidence for these two main con- 
clusions. 
1. The most general elements in the organic reactions 
of modesty, shame, etc., are certain vasomotor changes, 
with inhibitions and confusions of muscular movement. 
The vasomotor changes—seen conspicuously in the blush 
—are analogous to those found in connection with other 
emotions, notably fear and anger. If we say, therefore, 
that these changes are rooted in conditions of personal 
experience which occasioned fear and anger, that may be 
our starting-point in the reconstruction of the social prog- 
ress which these reactions stand for. And the conditions 
of the presence of these vasomotor and muscular changes 
may be assumed to be those of fear and anger, ze., the 
strife which brought on physical struggle, involving 
excited heart-action and strenuous muscular exertion. 
Readers of the literature of emotional expression! since 
Darwin will be sufficiently familiar with this hypothesis 
and the grounds on which it rests. These considerations 
extend to both the aspects which we have found attach- 
1Cf., besides Darwin and Spencer, also Mosso (Fear), Mantegazza 
(Physiognomy and Expression), James (Princ. of Psychology, II., Chap. 
XXV.), Dewey (Psychol. Review, Nov., 1894, and Jan., 1895), Baldwin 
(Mental Development, Chap. VIII.).
-P-A-G-E-247
Bashfulness and Modesty 221 
ing to the modesty reactions, —the aspect which implicates 
the sexual relation, and that which pertains to personal 
defence; the former factor being very essentially one of 
high motor and vasomotor changes. 
138. 2. The beginning of differentiation of the reac- 
tions of fear and anger in the direction of modesty re- 
quires some very striking cause. Fear has, in its higher 
forms, some ingredient of self-insufficiency, it is true; 
after the idea of self and its relation to an alter arises, we 
have ground for considerate fear; but physical fear has 
very little reference to self, consisting as it does in an 
overwhelming sense of the presence of the fearful object. 
The same is true of anger; so far from involving any 
hesitation or retreat through considerations of pérsonal 
lack of power, worth, etc., it tends in quite-the opposite 
direction. Anger means precipitation upon the offending 
thing. The consistent development of these forms of re- 
action, therefore, in the progress of the race would have 
been in the direction of the more formidable equipment of 
the individual for defence and offence, with the eliminat- 
ing of the elements which tend to hesitation, embarrass- 
ment, and weakness. So we must look for some modifying 
factors in the environment —some sufficient reason for 
the development of these reactions in the direction of less 
personal aggressiveness, and more personal dependence, 
which we find they have actually taken. 
139. 3. This modifying influence is doubtless to be 
found in the tendency to family life! and in the germinal 
1Cf. Westermarck (History of Human Marriage, Chap. I.), who holds 
that marriage exists among animals as an instinct due to natural selection, its 
utility being the raising of the family: “Marriage is rooted in family rather 
than family in marriage” (p. 22). 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
  02 fits Instincts and Emotions 
beginnings of social and collective action which we see 
illustrated} in some degree in the animal kingdom. The 
consideration of the animal family is itself sufficient, in 
my opinion, to show the manner of pro-social develop- 
ment.» The qualities seen in the animal member-of-a- 
family —those which he must possess in order to make 
the family eligible in the struggle for existence — involve 
two factors. First, the degree of self-seeking or aggressive 
tendency which avails to keep selective competition sharp 
inside and outside the family life; for the family depends, 
for its food and drink, upon the individual’s courage and 
strength. And second, the development of the co-operative 
tendency, with the consequent suppression of aggressive- 
ness, as far as this is necessary for the essential family rela- 
tionships and for united action in the competitions which 
the family as a whole has to wage. These two opposite 
tendencies must be reconciled; and the development of 
further social life depends upon the way in which the 
organism succeeds in reconciling them. The gregarious 
instinct must exist outside the family also alongside of 
sufficient aggressiveness. Now the reactions which we 
are studying seem to me to be the survival and thus the 
evidence of this opposition, as I may go on to explain. 
140. 4. In the child’s bashful period, there are three 
epochs or stages: first, a purely organic stage; second, a 
free-and-easy social stage; and third, a stage in which 
a certain ‘self-exhibition’ seems to be struggling against 
the organic inhibitions and restraints. These periods are 
1Topinard (Monist, January, 1897) has recently collected evidence to 
show that these two tendencies do not always go together; that the most 
gregarious and instinctively ‘social’ animals are often those of least developed 
family life, and vice versa.
-P-A-G-E-249
  Ce eee rT ane eee Cree eae 
Bashfulness and Modesty 223 
not speculative, but real, as the actual study of children 
discloses, The last-named period is the beginning of real 
modesty, and involves the subjective sense which we call 
self-consciousness. The first of these epochs we have 
already identified with the fear-anger reactions of the 
animals, together with their sexual commotion ; these two 
things at least and in the main. The second of the child’s 
periods, I am inclined to think, represents a sort of organic 
resting-place, with the degree of social co-operation which 
terminated the extreme strife, struggle, hand-to-hand con- 
flict required by the purely biological operation of natural 
selection. The child becomes simple in his confidence; 
he is naive, unsophisticated, credulous to a great extreme. 
He seems to me then to have his parallel in the rest 
which man took after his release from the animal; with 
his dawning sense that he could exist without killing 
and being killed, with his discovery of the arts of tilling 
the soil and living, for some of his meals at least, on vege- 
tables. The social tide then sets in. The quiet of domes- 
tic union and reciprocal service comes to comfort him, and 
his nomadic and agricultural habits are formed. He lives 
longer in one place, begins to have respect for the rights 
of property, gives and takes with his fellows by the bar- 
gain rather than by strife, and so learns to believe, trust, 
and fulfil the belief and trust. Looked at logically, no 
less than historically, this is to me quite reasonable. 
The early ages must have had, sooner or later, a scene like 
that depicted in the life of the Hebrew patriarchs, when 
the flocks were the main care, and the wolves were the 
main enemy ; when the hand of some men ceased to be 
against every man; when the principle first came to take 
permanent effect in the consciousness of man that to 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  224 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
co-operate was rational, and to ‘fight continually was not 
convenient —as slow as this principle was and still is of 
recognition beyond certain restricted spheres, and as un- 
supported as it was by any effective sanctions but those of 
force. 
This need of rest from strife, on the part of the race, as 
an introduction to the occupations of peace, would seem 
to be testified to in the history of primitive times; and 
the anthropologist may be counted on to give the asser- 
tion some authority! I have already pointed out (Sect. 
93) the function of play as aiding such a growing sense 
of sociality. Of course it is more questionable whether 
there has ever been any such period over the whole earth 
at once. It may be in order, however, to say that the 
supposition is not necessary that such a stage was real- 
ized in the entire human race at the same time. The 
anthropologist is coming to put less and less stress upon 
the claim that certain stages must be reached by different 
families or groups in the same degree at the same time. 
Race peculiarities, as far as they exist and go back into 
prehistoric times, must have arisen just through the dif- 
ferences which different groups showed in their develop- 
ment under different geographical and historical conditions. 
This tribe may have been prevented longer than that from 
turning to the arts of peace, by the aridness of the soil, 
by the prevalence of wild beasts, by the conditions of the 
seasons, or by lack of useful inventions. Certain other 
1 Of course its confirmation would require much anthropological research 
which I am not able to bring to it. See the quotations, regarding this well- 
recognized period, however, in Appendix F. May this declaration of the 
hypothetical character of this parallel appease thee, learned critic, whose 
instinct is keen for theory! 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
Bashfulness and Modesty 225 
groups may have had to come into social co-operation sooner 
in order to subdue nature and drain the soil; or to protect 
themselves from common enemies! All these things, 
which anthropology is far from understanding in any 
detail, are yet clear enough to make it necessary that we 
look for types of human culture realized somewhere rather 
than for the realization of any type everywhere at once. 
The cat and the tiger are both, felines and both represent 
types of feline nature, although — for all I know — we may 
not be able to say that there was a time when either alone 
existed. The tiger may be alive all the time, and yet the 
requirement may be real that there should also exist a 
feline edition so mild in its character as to be capable of 
domestication. 
Saying, then, that there has been such an epoch of 
transition between the lower man who does not reflect, and 
the social agent who does, this epoch would seem to be 
represented well by that period of trustful sociability and 
unreflecting credulity which lies between the organic fears 
and tears of the child and his self-conscious shyness and 
modesty. 
141. It may be well at this point to designate the two 
periods in race progress which we have so far distinguished ; 
and I know of no better designations for them than these: 
first, the animal period, revealed in the reactions of the 
child which are mainly organic, we may call, from the social 
point of view, the period of ‘zustinctive co-operation.’ The 
second, that which brought in the reign of peaceful pur- 
1 Indeed, the competition of groups of men with one another (called above 
‘group selection’; Chap. V., § 4) was doubtless the means of the selection of 
the more socially endowed tribes, as, for example, those which applied the 
principle of division of labour in their internal economy.
-P-A-G-E-252
226 Fits Instincts and Emotions 
suits and the beginning of widened communal interests, 
represented in the child by the frank trustfulness which 
succeeds organic bashfulness, we may call the period of 
‘spontaneous co-operation. The word ‘spontaneous’ is con- 
trasted both with the term ‘zwsténctive’ and also with the 
term ‘reflective’ which we will find it well to apply to 
the period of distinctively intelligent social life which 
arose later on in the life both of the race and of the child. 
These terms apply as well to the child; better, in fact, 
than any other descriptive terms which I think of. His 
social attitudes are first zzstinctive, then spontaneous, and 
finally reflective. 
So we may now turn to the third or ‘reflective’ period 
in the development of both child and race, as it is exhib- 
ited in the reactions of modesty. 
142. §. The way the child has of coming to be reflec- 
tive is simply his way of getting his notion of himself; 
that is what reflection means, the distinguishing of the 
object, the alter, the not-self, from the self, and then the 
bringing of the self up to pass judgment upon the other. 
I reflect when I, the ego —to the best of my ability to be 
an ego or self—turn round and examine something in 
1 Of these sorts of co-operation, the ‘ instinctive’ belongs to animal ‘ com- 
panies’ (cf. Appendix D); the ‘spontaneous’ mainly and the ‘reflective’ 
almost exclusively to human ‘societies.’ Cf. the distinction between ‘com- 
panies’ and ‘societies’ made in Sects. 320, 320 a. I use the word ‘co-opera- 
tion’ rather than ‘association,’ which has some currency, chiefly because of the 
technical meaning which the latter term has in psychology. ‘ Association of 
ideas’ is a very important fact in the psychology of ‘co-operation’ and two 
distinct terms seem to be requisite for clearness. ‘Co-operation’ involves, 
besides, some degree of active attitude on the part of the individuals in dis- 
tinction from the ‘association’ by mere herding, so common in the animal 
world, which is a very static and unfruitful form of gregariousness, and which 
in the human mob is actually destructive.
-P-A-G-E-253
  
Bashfulness and Modesty 227 
my consciousness; my plans, my memories, my failures, 
my hopes, in short anything which I can represent in my 
consciousness and examine more or less coolly. The 
progress of my reflection is really the progress of my 
ability to hold myself together as an independent and 
critical being that judges.! 
The child’s progress in this has already had detailed 
attention. We understand that he reaches constantly a 
self of his own by understanding others better, and then 
understands others better by reason of his interpretation 
of them in terms of what he thinks of as himself. “These 
two poles of thought constantly occupy him; and he gets 
them generalized in some degree in what was called in 
an earlier place the ‘habitual’ self, on the one hand, 
over against the ‘imitative’ or social self, on the other 
hand. The habitual self is the reckless, bullying, bragga- 
docio of a self; and the imitative self is the docile, teach- 
able, retiring self. Both grow up together by the very 
opposition which presupposes them both. So in his 
inner world he reproduces the actual social world, and fits 
himself for an active place in it. 
Now the indications are that this is the case with the 
progress of the race. The elements called ego and alter thus 
present in the child’s consciousness are also represented 
in his organic reactions, in just the two factors which we 
have already found well to point out: the fear, anger, self- 
defence and offence, etc., inherited from the instinctive 
period, and then the other factor due to the peaceful 
learning of the communal lessons in co-operation which 
come down from the period of ‘spontaneous’ social life. 
1 Cf. the exposition of Bradley’s description of the self of reflection in 
Appendix E,  
-P-A-G-E-254
  228 fits Instincts and Emotions 
There are the same two factors in the individual’s 
equipment which we find the animal’s life to require: 
aggression and co-operation. The social development of 
the child, therefore, shows both the sorts of recapitula- 
tion which we should expect; both phylogenies have the 
periods which in the growth of the child we have called 
respectively ‘instinctive’ and ‘spontaneous.’ And then, 
besides, we now find that what the child goes on to be 
in his ‘reflective’ period is just the outcome of the ten- 
dencies of the other two. Reflection is born of the need 
of getting a sort of accommodation which will reconcile 
the personally aggressive or instinctive with the person- 
ally imitative or spontaneous; this the child attains by 
his development of personality, wherein he has to give, 
by the very movement of his own growth, due value to 
the two terms which lead him on, —the ego and the alter. 
So the race had to reconcile the instinctive tendencies 
which came down from the animals with the co-operative 
tendencies which social life prescribed; and z¢ was done 
by the race in the same way that it ts done iby the child: 
the race became reflective, intelligent, and so started on a 
career of social development in which two fundamental 
influences were to work together,—the private selfish in- 
terest and the public social interest. 
This leads to a topic which is of so great importance 
in the further development of the meaning of social life, 
as this book conceives it,! that I shall now leave its fur- 
ther consideration over until the other elements of equip- 
ment which have social expression have also been ex- 
amined. It is an interesting question to ask whether 
they —notably sympathy — give any further support to

Sympathy 229 
the conclusions to which the reactions of modesty have 
led us. 
§ 3. Sympathy 
143. The consideration of sympathy is made more easy 
for us since this emotion has always been considered a 
critical phenomenon for ethical, psychological, and socio- 
logical theory. It has been the central point of some of 
the most stubborn conflicts in the history of ethics; con- 
flicts which were sometimes remarkable for the lack of the 
attitude which the topic discussed would seem to encour- 
age. And when we come really to see how pregnant 
with meaning sympathy is, we are not at a loss for the 
explanation of the fact that it should have been used to 
support this view of man or that, to the neglect of the 
sympathetic consideration of opposing views. 
These discussions of sympathy have given us, indeed, 
a fairly clear view of the facts, and a generally adopted 
theory up to a certain point in its interpretation. Psy- 
chologists are generally agreed in finding a distinction 
necessary between ‘organic’ and ‘reflective’ sympathy, 
similar to the distinction which has been made in consider- 
ing modesty. The sympathy which the infant shows when 
its doll bumps its head, or when papa puckers up his face 
and pretends to cry, is very different from the sympathy 
which I bestow upon the wretch in the slums, or upon the 
widow who has lost her only son. The quick appearance of 
violent organic changes in the child, his unreasoning and 
indiscriminate expressions of the emotion, the passing of 
it as soon as the physical expression has to a degree sub- 
sided, the lack of any sufficient mental development, at the 
period when these reactions occur, to support a real sym-  
-P-A-G-E-256
  230 fits Instincts and Emotions 
pathy of reflection, —all these indications serve to justify 
the opinion that we are dealing in the former case with 
an inherited organic manifestation. This is further made 
clear by the fact that animals give very remarkable exhibi- 
tions of this sort of sympathy. The dog will howl at the 
calamity of his master, or at the disaster which befalls his 
fellow-dog before his eyes ; indeed, the phenomena are so 
well known and so much discussed by a humane public, 
that I need not cite evidence which may be found in any 
of the books on animal psychology. There is, then, we 
may safely say, an organic sympathy as well as a reflective 
sympathy. 
144. The physical manifestations of these two forms of 
sympathy are, however, again, as in the case of the emo- 
tions already cited, the same in kind. The expression of 
sympathy is akin to that of suffering in general. A certain 
subdued air is assumed throughout the entire muscular 
system, the corners of the mouth droop even to the ex- 
tent seen in weeping, —to which, indeed, the sympathetic 
feeling sometimes actually brings us, —the movements take 
on a general attitude as of proffering help to the individ- 
ual toward whom the sympathy is directed, and the voice 
reveals the peculiar quality characteristic of distress in 
man and of the cries of suffering in animals. The young 
child reveals his sympathy by at once falling into tears 
and vocal cries. The adult either bestirs himself, if on 
reflection he judges it well or useful to yield to the 
promptings of sympathy, or sets up counter movements 
of restlessness and aimless activity in order to relieve the 
uncomfortable tensions which his sympathies excite in his 
organic and muscular systems. 
145. The meaning of sympathy considered as a race re-  
-P-A-G-E-257
  
Sympathy 231 
action is reasonably clear, I think, and it falls in with the 
inferences which we have already drawn respecting mod- 
esty. Organic sympathy, being too early in the child for 
reflection, and being also present in the animals which 
give no sign of ability to reflect, must be considered as 
revealing instinctive reflexes in the child. Falling thus 
in the period which goes back in its reference to animal 
ancestry, it gives an instance of recapitulation from the 
animal series. And the meaning of it in the child, ob- 
scured as it is by his quick development in other and char- 
acteristic human directions, is the same as in the animals. 
In the animal family, sympathy is largely a part of the 
family instinct as such. It represents the extreme of 
animal blood-relationship; and in some of its manifesta- 
tions is among the most extraordinary phenomena in the 
whole range of life. For example, some ferocious animals, 
which delight in drawing blood, will nevertheless discrimi- 
nate the blood of members of their own species, and show 
subdued and sorrowful attitudes. 
Carnivorous animals will lick the blood from the wounds 
of their companions, with every expression of what is to 
us, in similar circumstances, gentle pity and fellow-suffer- 
ing; thus suppressing those more ferocious appetites of 
their nature which the taste of blood generally excites. 
And the more remarkable is it since other animals draw 
no such distinctions, eating their own kind with a good 
appetite. Indeed, the existence of cannibal tribes among 
men serves up a comparison which makes it allowable to 
suggest that, in going back to animals for our origin we 
reach a nobler lineage possibly, in some respects, than if 
we had stopped short of it. 
The human cannibal, however, is of course the excep-
-P-A-G-E-258
  232 Lfis Instincts and Emotions 
tion; and he may represent a relatively isolated trend of 
development or of decay; at any rate, his presence in the 
world does not stand in the way of our learning the lesson 
of the animal’s sympathy. Even the cannibal does not 
eat his own children, nor members of his own tribe. They 
are to him as himself just as the whelps of the mother-dog 
are to her as herself ; and as the human babe is to his 
parents as themselves. And we must look upon the sym- 
pathetic reactions of animals—and by analogy those of 
primitive human times—as showing the extreme form of 
the co-operating tendency, before the rise of the reflective 
faculty. 
146. Coming, however, to the reflective form of sym- 
pathy which the child so soon begins to show, and which, 
when once come, is one of the strongest and most saving 
elements of his human nature, we find a state of things 
strikingly similar to that depicted in connection with mod- 
esty and shame. Indeed, the facts are much clearer here, 
thanks to the analyses which psychologists and moralists 
have made. The rise of reflective sympathy is clearly a 
function of the rise of the notion of self. As we have 
seen, the thought of the ego, and the thought of the alter, 
having the same presented content at bottom, excite the 
same emotion in kind; and so the emotion of suffering, 
appeal, joy, rebellion, etc., which one feels for himself 
must be aroused also when the same thought of per- 
sonality comes up with the different descriptive term 
‘another’ attached to it. The progress of the child in get- 
ting the antithesis between ego and alter well fixed, and 
even bodily separated, does not impair this necessity of 
his thought. The motor processes which represent the 
thought of self must be, in the main, the same whether it  
-P-A-G-E-259
Sympathy 233 
be myself or yourself to which a particular experience re- 
fers ; so the reactions of relief, weeping, rebellion, subdued 
collapse, etc., must come to the front in the presence of 
the fate of others no less than when the victim is oneself. 
In the latter case, of course, the actual bodily sensations 
of present surroundings, or the actual requirements of 
consistency in my thoughts, memories, local escorts, etc., 
may be amply sufficient to prevent me from making a mis- 
take in my identity, and thinking the suffering is really 
my own; but even that is liable to be undone in cases of 
high sympathetic excitement. Sometimes the external, 
and indeed the internal, boundaries between you and me 
are swept away, and I feel your calamity really as my own. 
This tendency is, of course, the source of the emotions of 
the theatre, where every premium is put on the sort of 
self-illusion of which I am speaking. And in certain very 
frequent and persistent cases of such confusion of real 
suffering and fancied or historical suffering, we have to 
treat the patient as a victim of an abnormal process which, 
however, in its root and value, is normal sympathy. 
Reflective sympathy, therefore, is distinctly a social out- 
come. It is the inevitable result of the growth of reflection ; 
and reflection is just a relation of separateness created 
between the ego-self and the alter-self. If there were 
no alter thought, there could be no reflection, and with it 
no sympathy. In organic sympathy, the relation is a mat- 
ter of organic reaction due to natural selection, we may 
suppose ;! reflective sympathy reaffirms the social value of 
the reaction, utilizes it, and in discovering the relations of 
persons for itself, in a reflective and critical way, goes on 
to refine the reactions and embody them in the institutions 
1 Cf. Appendix D.
-P-A-G-E-260
  234 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
of social life. Refiective sympathy comes to replace 
much that is, in its earliest foreshadowings, biological and 
merely adaptive; and through it the laws of organic 
adaptation get a turn which is characteristic of a rational 
order. 
Under this head, finally, reference may be made to cer- 
tain other emotional states which have more or less value 
in the social life as over against sympathy. I refer to the 
class of emotions covered by the words ‘jealousy,’ ‘ pride,’ 
‘vanity,’ etc. These easily fall under the general concep- 
tion of a developing self to which I have referred the 
sympathies. The emotions of pride attach to the habitual, 
aggressive, domineering self, and are of importance mainly 
as illustrating that aspect of self-development. There are, 
however, certain social facts to be mentioned later, which 
make it well to refer to them in this place. 
In jealousy we seem to have an emotion in which both 
the resources of explanation are taxed to their full extent. 
Considering reflective jealousy in man, we should say that 
it represented a certain second ‘intension’ of the sense of 
self, a double reflection. For to be jealous of another it is 
not alone necessary to think of him as one also thinks of 
oneself, and thus to be thrown into the attitude which char- 
acterizes sympathy; this does not go far enough. There is 
besides the further consciousness that what he is experi- 
encing is different from what the self is experiencing, and 
more desirable. This is possible only on the ground of a 
contrast between the ego and alter thoughts as marked as 
is the identity on which the sympathetic emotion rests. It 
may therefore be described as a state of sympathy held in 
check and overbalanced by the egoistic tendencies aroused 
by the knowledge of the cause which is contributory to the
-P-A-G-E-261
  Sympathy 235 
other’s enjoyment. This on the side of the higher reflec- 
tive form of jealousy. 
We should be led to think, in view of the complexity of 
this state of mind, that it could hardly be found in the 
animals; yet organic jealousy is found in them in a 
remarkably striking degree. Dogs are proverbially jeal- 
ous of one another and even of other animals and of man. 
Yet it is impossible to say that dogs have this double 
play of attitudes about the thought of self. In fact, 
the existence of strong jealousy among the brutes avails 
both to emphasize the two sorts of emotional expression, 
and also to make it imperative that we recognize the two 
principles of their origin. In the origin of organic jealousy 
we have the complex but direct operation of natural selec- 
tion. When we think of it, we see that such an instinct 
is of direct utility to the dog; for it stirs him to throw 
himself upon his rival, and by overcoming him so to secure 
the good thing which was his rival’s. As a complication 
of sympathy, also considered as instinctive in the animals, 
this is what would seem to be a necessary outcome of the 
law of utility ; for the dog whose sympathies for another 
had no such modification would stand by and perish while 
others lived whenever the competition for food was sharp. 
His delight would be to see others eat! The organic 
emotion of jealousy, therefore, would seem to be a biological 
outcome, serving in the animal something the place of the 
reflective egoism seen in the higher jealousy of man. 
The general result, therefore, in so far confirms our 
earlier conclusions. Sympathy reactions run continuously 
up from animal organic utility adaptations, to the uses of 
reflective social life; and so furnish additional evidence 
that the highest sphere of our emotional nature is not

  236 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
separated by a gap from the more modest social beginnings 
of lower life-orders. The child passes with no rude shock 
— indeed, he never knows the transition —from organic 
to reflective sociality; and the presence of the former 
ministers to the latter all the way through, just as the 
existence of the former at the start makes the later exist- 
ence of the latter possible. The same appears also in the 
emotional reactions to which we now turn. 
§ 4. Social Emotion as Such: Personal Opposition 
147. The place of emotion in the mental life, and the 
purpose which it serves, would lead us to expect that, after 
social life has arisen and become fixed, there would 
be peculiar forms of emotional experience springing up 
about the relationships and adaptations which thus become 
so important in the life of man. Emotion is, by common 
consent, the accompaniment of habitual ways of action 
on the organic side, so fixed and regular that they 
have become stereotyped in the nervous system. Given, 
then, so constant a thing as the social rapport, in all 
its meaning, in the evolution of humanity, and it would 
be strange if there did not arise with it a characteristic 
emotion of society and a correspondingly instinctive way of 
action. There are two classes of phenomena generally 
recognized as thus distinctly social, and although, from 
their very nature, they show peculiarities which make it 
difficult to classify them under the term ‘emotion,’ used in 
a concrete sense, yet the remarks which follow may justify 
me, I trust, in bringing them forward in this connection. 
One of’them is the class of phenomena which fall under 
the term ‘suggestibility’ in current psychology, and the  
-P-A-G-E-263
Social Emotion as Such 237, 
other class constitutes the sense or emotion of play. These 
general topics are already in part familiar to us from the 
earlier descriptions; but there are further considerations 
to be made out in the present connection. 
148. I. In the first place, we may inquire into the facts 
concerning social ‘ suggestibility.’ 
The literature of suggestion, and of the social value of 
suggestion, is becoming adequate in recent years; and, 
indeed, the treatment of this topic has given to social 
psychology its most respectable showing. The writings of 
Tarde, Sighele, Guyau, Le Bon, and others, have set forth 
the truth that society is at certain times largely a mob 
ruled by suggestion and by suggestion only; and that 
this case is but an exaggeration of the action of the 
working of suggestion generally in the social relationships 
of man. Hypnotic suggestion has furnished important 
leading-strings of inquiry which have been followed with 
interesting results ;1 and finally the conditions of the child’s 
development have been shown to include a large ingredient 
of incitements of this order. In fact, certain sections of 
the foregoing chapters of this work show that the influence 
of suggestion in the individual’s progress is sufficiently 
great. The child’s personal growth is not only constantly 
stimulated by those suggestive influences which we have 
called by the general term ‘tradition’; but his progress is 
also constantly checked by the same system of influences. 
To say that he is liable to suggestion is therefore to cover 
with all-too-weak a word what is indeed the very method 
of his advancing life. Looking broadly at the child’s ways 
of action, we find that social give-and-take becomes a habit 
1 Yet both Tarde and Royce make perhaps too much of this, 
2 Baldwin, Mental Development, Chap. VI.
-P-A-G-E-264
  238 fits Instincts and Emotions 
to him, its indulgence a means of great enjoyment, and 
the denial of it, through isolation, a source of intolerable 
discomfort, irritation, and rebellion. The anticipation of 
it is again a constant element in his thought of the worth 
of life and its distinction. 
The social circle of a man, too, is the part of his environ- 
ment which arouses in him, even when he does not actively 
think of it, the most profound responses of his personal 
nature. And when he does think of it, it appeals to his 
highest sentiments of self-respect, dignity, and ideal activity, 
or the reverse. These subjective aspects of the social 
life have never been named as have the emotions which 
carry distinct organic reactions with them, for the reasons 
that they are so varied in their effects in the mental life, 
and that they have no precise physical accompaniments. 
The nearest that one may come to a classification of them 
in psychological language is perhaps to put them under the 
two headings of ‘Imitation’ — covering all the phenomena 
of social contagion and atmosphere, satisfaction with conven- 
tion, conformity to style, custom, etc.,— and ‘ Opposition,’ + 
using this latter word in its widest sense, as covering all 
tendency to revolution, all resistance to convention, all 
social obstinacy, love of innovation, etc. 
The two opposed aspects thus made out cover the 
antithesis between the ‘conservative’ and ‘radical’ ten- 
dencies; and yet, as we shall see, the present distinction 
is a somewhat different one, since the extreme of social 
suggestibility extends to novelties as well as to the estab- 
1 Since the text was written (and too late to be available to me) M. Tarde 
has published a work on ‘Opposition’ which deals with facts and laws con- 
trasted with those of ‘Imitation.’ The term ‘opposition’ may well be given 
this technical meaning in social science (see the writer’s Dict. of Philos, 
‘Social Opposition’),
-P-A-G-E-265
  Social Emotion as Such 239 
lished usages of society ; and the extreme of opposition, as 
used in this connection, goes so far as to lead to personal 
revolt as a habit, no less against what is established than 
against the newer courses of current suggestion. Both of 
these aspects represent constant and marked phenomena, 
which rise to a certain dignity. The former was called 
‘plastic imitation’ in my other book,1— the tendency sim- 
ply to yield to the impulse or emotion of conformity to 
social usage,— and it is under that phrase that I shall con- 
sider some of its phasesyafter the brief remarks which fol- 
low on ‘ opposition.” ff =F 
149. The phenomena of opposition show themselves on 
the side of the individual’s independence and self-suffi- 
ciency, as the phenomena of mob-action show themselves 
on the side of his sociality. Yet the former spring out of 
the same general movement of the personal sense as do 
the latter. There are certain phases of his growth which 
appear as more or less striking oppositions; and these I 
shall point out. They fall, however, under the less impor- 
tant and more incidental items in the inventory of social 
happenings, as the full consideration of the oppositions 
which may arise between the individual and society will 
make more evident in a later chapter.? 
(1) In the child’s ‘contrary suggestion’ we have a very 
early exhibition of social opposition. I have elsewhere 
pointed out that this sort of suggestion arises either 
through the association of ideas, together with certain   
1 Mental Development, Chap. XIL., § 2. Plastic in view of the mobile 
condition of the crowd under a strong suggestion. No other term has been 
proposed for it, so far as I know. Groos has since used the term ‘plastic imi- 
tation’ (Play of Man, Eng. trans., p. 313 ff.) for imitation of the ‘plastic’ 
(as in art, including drawing). 
2 On social sanctions (Chap. X.), where intellectual and moral conflicts are 
dwelt upon, 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  240 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
possibilities of muscular antagonism ; or through an actual 
tendency to the emphasis of the personal as such in the 
mind of the child. As to the first it may be passed over, 
seeing that it itself ‘passes over’ very soon in the progress 
of the child. The latter reason for his contrariness, how- 
ever, leads us to a second and more important aspect of 
opposition. 
(2) The child’s growing sense of self becomes subjec- 
tive mainly through his experience of agency, volition. 
This has been fully explained above. It is this sense of 
growing agency, power to work effects for himself, which 
urges him on in a career of relatively competent and fruit- 
ful invention. Now to the degree in which this is indulged, 
encouraged, or even, in some children, merely allowed 
to grow, it leads the little agent into a sturdy indepen- 
dence which shows itself as social opposition. He rejoices. 
in the ‘self of aggression’ which legislates for others. 
In the words of a correspondent,! “One of the great psy- 
chologically potent purposes of social life is the purpose to 
find the self different from any other self.” This is per- 
haps rather strong; but that the ‘purpose’ is a real one 
there can be no doubt. We see it in the attributes of 
character so much treasured under the terms ‘individuality,’ 
“personal pride,’ ‘self-respect,’ ‘private judgment,’ etc.? 
1 Professor Royce. 
2See also remarks made above (Sect. 75). “We find volition brought 
out on occasion of imitation, a higher kind of imitation called ‘persistent,’ 
in which the child does not rest content with the degree of success his old 
reactions provide, but aims ‘to try again’ for better things. Now the imi- 
tative instinct itself is thus, in this transition, brought to the bar, and vio- 
lated by its own passage into volition. In volition, the agency of the actor 
comes to instruct him. He learns his power to resist and to conquer, as well 
as his weakness and subjection to a copy. And the child comes, just in 
this conflict between imitation, an impulse, and suggestion, an innovation, to  
-P-A-G-E-267
Social Emotion as Such 241 
(3) There is yet another phase of social opposition 
which has also had some attention in our earlier pages: it 
is the sense of social esprit de corps which comes to attach 
to the circle or group within which one’s social conscious- 
ness grows up. The common self of my group, one 
thinks, is the proper common self; and in so far as other 
societies do not recognize its conventions and regulations, 
and the more if perchance they violate its essential prin- 
ciples, they are wrong. Their ‘socius’ is a mistaken one; 
there must be opposition between them and us. There 
thus arises a certain rivalry of clan, family, nation, with a 
vehement emphasis upon the features in which they are 
not at one. 
In all these cases it should be noted, however, that we 
are dealing with side-events, so to speak, by-products to 
the main progress, whether of the individual and of the 
group to whose common life his growth contributes. His 
imitative growth is the necessary basis of all these oppo- 
sitions. And in so far as the one is essential — the imita- 
tion —the other is non-essential. The main function of 
such oppositions, in the progress of society as in that of 
the individual, is that of keeping alive the sense of indi- 
viduality, of leading to strenuousness of purpose and en- 
deavour on the part of individuals, with a consequent 
enriching of the store of imitable materials through inven- 
break through and make himself an inventor and a free agent. In fact, we 
have found a type of action realized in the phrase ‘contrary’ or ‘ wayward’ 
suggestion, in which just this revolt becomes a way of action. The boy won't 
imitate. This simply means that he won’t imitate what other people ask him 
to, but prefers to imitate what he asks himself to. He imitates just the same, 
of course. But the difference is world wide. A ‘contrary’ boy has learned 
the lesson of volition, has passed from suggestion to conduct, has mounted 
from the second to the third level, and is available for genius-material” (Bald- 
win, Mental Development, p. 429 f.). See also the treatment of ‘ Personal 
Individuation’ in Thought and Things, Chap. VIIL., § 9.
-P-A-G-E-268
242 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
tion. It also leads to experimentation, and to a testing of 
rival schemes which forwards the growth of the fit. 
150. As to the facts of plastic imitation, they are so 
marked, and so commonly observed, that I shall be content 
to name certain of the more remarkable instances; and 
then refer to the writers who have treated them in detail. 
One great sphere is that of what is called ‘style’ in mat- 
ters of dress, methods of domestic usage, arrangements for 
social functions —such as calling, announcements of en- 
gagements, marriage cards, funeral customs, etc., in short 
all the affairs of our external social lives in which we ask 
1 The discussion of Social Progress, in Chap. XIII. below, makes due rec- 
ognition of this constant inventiveness, and of its necessity for social progress. 
A view which seems to make much more of opposition of this emotional type 
than I find myself able to do is indicated in the letter of Professor Royce just 
referred to, which I take pleasure in quoting here : — 
“T think that there is here one very general factor neglected which de- 
serves more study. One great region of social functioning consists in deliber- 
ately producing what I have called ‘social contrast effects” Questioning, 
criticism, social obstinacy, gossip about one’s neighbours, opposition, repartee, 
the social game of the sexes, in all its deliberate forms, —these are functions 
whose conscious purpose is, not to reduce to unity, not to decrease varieties, but 
to find, to bring out, and to dwell upon the differences amongst selves. Such 
functions make up a fair half of social conscious life, They obscure, for most 
people, the imitative elements actually so universal, so that to most people the 
discovery of the universality of imitation comes as a surprise, like the surprise 
of learning that one has always been talking prose. Well, as I notice, a 
great deal of an individual’s inventiveness is a function due to the appearance 
of social contrast effects. Light up my conscious contents by some new con- 
trast with the ideas of another, and I see, in myself, what I never saw before, 
and now I have ‘a new idea,’ 
“One of the great, psychologically potent purposes of social life is the pur- 
pose to find the self different from any other self. The purpose is often vain, 
and its conscious expressions are full of illusions amusing to the on-looker, but 
of all grades of social organization, from the children in the market place to 
the nations stubbornly holding aloof from one another prating of glory, and 
levying tariffs, one could assert with a force almost equal to that of Tarde’s 
definition, that: Society is a mutual display of mental contrasts.”
-P-A-G-E-269
Social Emotion as Such 243 
‘What is the proper thing?’ before we take action at all. 
The man who is in style illustrates plastic imitation. He 
shows a certain sensitiveness to the more trivial expres- 
sions of social judgment which may be passed upon him. 
All this is a matter of imitation ; for only in the great out- 
lines can these social arrangements be said to be deliber- 
ate. For the most part, and in matters of detail, they 
are conventions which have sprung up by accident or by 
the suggestion of some social leader, and have been estab- 
lished through the tendency to conformity which character- 
izes the average social man. The same tendency extends 
also to the intellectual life. There is in every community 
and in every age a style of thinking, a general preference 
for this sort of topic or that, which is a matter largely of 
social suggestion and imitation. This may extend only to 
the lighter things of the mind, in which the newspaper 
press leads the style; or it may be discerned as a deeper 
current in the history of literature and of human thought. 
Great ideas sometimes sweep suddenly over a people; ideas 
which had lain dormant for long periods, simply because 
no leader in the intellectual world had taken them up 
and made them the ‘style.’ M. Tarde has attempted to 
state the laws of these movements, and I may refer to 
his book for many details. 
In the emotional life the same sort of thing is. seen in 
what is called the ‘contagion’ of feeling. An emotion 
may sweep through a gathering of people with a strength 
altogether out of proportion to the occasion of it in the indi- 
vidual’s ordinary thought or life. Sighele has set this forth 
with much richness of illustration,? and a recent writer has 
attempted to work out a calculus of the effects upon an 
1 Tarde, Les Lois de 1’ Imitation. 2 Sighele, Za Foule criminelle.
-P-A-G-E-270
  244 fics Instincts and Emotions 
individual in a crowd of all the suggestions which he gets 
from the emotional and vocal expressions of the other 
members of the crowd. Le Bon? has also recently depicted 
very vividly the ways of action of mobs under the sort of 
social suggestion which enchains them to the pursuit of 
the one ear-catching and impulse-exciting idea. 
§ 5. Theory of Mob-Action 
151. With such adequate portrayals before us in the lit- 
erature of the topic, we may go on to find the place of this 
class of phenomena in the theory of social evolution. In 
the first place, it may be well to say with some emphasis 
that the attempt to build a fruitful conception of society 
upon the actions of the crowd under the influence of these 
imitative suggestions, seems to be crude and unphilosophi- 
cal in the extreme. If the reign of style in social custom 
and in thought and feeling, and the reign of suggestion in 
the crowd, are to supply the data for the formula on which 
the movement of society to-day depends, then the past and 
future movements of social development must also be 
explained on the same formula. Water cannot rise higher 
than its source. If mob-action be the level of modern 
social attainment, then the mob must society always have 
been and the mob it must remain. The real impelling 
forces must then be the individuals whose law or caprice 
rules the mob. 
That we may see the place of mob-action in the social 
movement, it is only necessary to put the emotional expe- 
riences which the individual feels when in the presence of 
strong social suggestion alongside the rest of his mental 
1 Le Bon, The Crowd,

  Theory of Mob-Action 245 
life, and ask how far it constitutes a permanent element in 
his sane activities, or even in the social activities which 
have become crystallized in the judgments and expectations 
of his time. When this is done, it is at once seen that 
these plastic influences are in themselves mere spontanei- 
ties, except so far as they get support from the deeper 
movements of the social environment, or represent the 
deeper movements of the person’s mental life. Then only 
do they get vitality ; but not because they are matters of 
suggestion in the crowd. Their value, on the contrary, 
comes from the fact that they represent forces already 
operative. I am disposed to say, trying to put the real 
character of this sort of social suggestion in a single sen- 
tence, that the mind of a crowd is essentially a temporary, 
unorganized, and ineffective thing. And its more partic- 
ular characters may be cited to show this. It is hardly 
worth while to go into the matter except that such a social 
phenomenon ought to be explained, and that the school of 
writers referred to think that in describing the mob they are 
solving the problems of social life. With it, we may hope 
to get light on the subtler phases of social suggestion. 
_ The characteristics of the social suggestions upon which 
the crowd act show them to be strictly suggestions. They 
are not truths, nor arguments, nor insights, nor inventions. 
They are fragments hit off, chips, often words and but 
words. The type of mental process which is required for the 
reception of these missiles of the mind is also very exactly 
characterized by the word ‘suggestibility.’ The sugges- 
tible mind has very well known marks. Balzac hit off 
one of them in Eugénie Grandet in the question: ‘Can it 
be that collectively man has no memory?’ We might 
go through the list of mental functions asking the same  
-P-A-G-E-272
  246 ffis Instincts and Emotions 
question of them one by one. Has man collectively no 
thought, no sense of values, no deliberation, no self-control, 
no responsibility, no conscience, no will, no motive, no 
purpose? And the answer to each such question would 
be the same: no, he hasnone. The suggestible conscious- 
ness is the consciousness that has no past, no future, no 
height, no depth, no development, no reference to any- 
thing; it has only in and out. It takes in and it acts out 
—that is all there is to it. It is receptivity gone to seed, 
and action gone mad. The most striking things about it 
are its utter thoughtlessness and its extraordinarily lively 
excitement. A meaningless suggestion to a crowd may 
bring an outburst of emotion and action which sweeps 
away some of the landmarks of a generation. This, again, 
has been set forth by recent writers. 
The real question is: What inferences are we to 
draw from facts which show that the most irrational, 
capricious, impulsive, and excess-loving man — is a collec- 
tion of men? Can it be true that these phenomena show 
either the origin from which society has sprung, as some 
recent writers claim, —drawing from it a conclusion fa- 
vourable to individualism, — or the goal to which society is 
tending, as others pitifully cry, in justification of social 
pessimism? Have we here evidence either that the indi- 
vidual is the wisest human resource, seeing the pitiful 
outcome of collective action of this type?—or. that de- 
mocracy finds its fulfilment in social confusion, seeing 
the omnipresence of the mob? 
152. Of course not, we reply to the first of these ques- 
tions. Social suggestibility could not be the original form 
of man’s life, for then there would be an absolute gulf be- 
tween him and the animal world, in which instinctive 
 
-P-A-G-E-273

equipment in definite directions is supreme. Moreover, 
the social organization we already have would have been 
as impossible from such a beginning as the pessimists fear 
it will be when such a condition of things returns in the 
reign of pure democracy. The mob which acts to-day and 
forgets to-morrow, kills to-day and sighs for life to-morrow, 
builds to-day and destroys to-morrow, would be a poor stock 
in trade for the spirit of social ideality to start its career 
of progress in the world withal. No, therefore, the ata- 
vistic theory of social suggestion is not the true one; 
the mob is not a reversion to an earlier type of human 
life. 
153. To the other view nowadays sometimes urged, 
we must also take exception just as decided. The phe- 
nomena of social suggestibility are not the key to the 
understanding of the future, in the sense that the mob is 
the typical and controlling social force. The progress of 
society is progress in education, richness of tradition, con- 
tinuity of growth; these are quite in opposition to the 
impulsive and casually explosive activity of the crowd. 
The loss of identity and social continence on the part of 
the individual, when he is carried away by a popular move- 
ment, is well struck off by the common saying that such 
a man has ‘lost his head.’ That is true; but then he 
regains his head and is ashamed that he lost it. His 
normal place in society is determined by the events of 
that part of his life in which he keeps his head. And 
1 It cannot be said to represent what we have called ‘spontaneous’ social 
co-operation, since being in the higher reflective epoch it has all the re- 
sources, especially for destructive action, of established and organized society; 
and more especially since it has not the sturdy characters which belong to the 
individuals at that epoch. The tendency to ‘contrary’ suggestion and indi- 
vidual ‘opposition’ are quite absent from the mob.
-P-A-G-E-274
  248 fits Instincts and Emotions 
the same is true of the events in the life of the social 
group as a whole. 
Such theories repose upon superficial views of the agen- 
cies at work in the moulding and developing of institu- 
tions. It is not the mob— whether the particular mob 
be a lynching party, a corn-riot, a commune, a Chamber of 
Deputies, or a Jingo Senate— which starts or directs the 
fruitful movements of a time; to say that would be to re- 
verse the connection of cause and effect. The real forces 
at work are heredity, instinct, tradition, intelligence, per- 
sonal power in particular men, etc. These are the causal 
agencies which, to be sure, give us also the mob and the 
set of performances which must undoubtedly be attributed 
to it. The principle of suggestion, which seems to have 
application in this field, is itself responsible for so much 
that is more profound, that to have all that undone at the 
capricious operation of the same principle in the casual 
intercourse of crowds, would be to refute our knowledge 
with our ignorance. 
154. With so much attention to the theories which 
mdke the extremest form of social suggestion and incon- 
tinence massgebend for social theory as such, we may turn 
to a more positive examination of the place which such 
phenomena really hold in human life. This place is 
clearly that of a Medbenconsequenz, a by-product, an inci- 
dental outcome of the general movement which bodies 
forth the progress of society. 
If, as has been said, the kind of temporary suggestive 
consciousness seen in the mob is not the original form, 
nor the final form, of social association, then it must lie 
somewhere between these two extremes and so represent 
a phase of social development itself. What this phase is,
-P-A-G-E-275
Theory of Mob-Action “1 2Ag 
and how it comes to be, is easily seen. The emotion 
of sociality, like all other emotions, has its normal kind of 
excitant; and when this is present in extreme degrees, 
the emotional movement is itself liable to be extreme. 
The presence of persons is the normal social excitant, 
and the extreme degrees of social influence come naturally 
over a man, when he is surrounded, hedged in, embar- 
rassed in his thinking, by the crowd. A man’s normal 
mental life may be paralyzed by over-stimulation of any 
kind. Frighten him by an impending physical calamity, 
and he ‘loses his head’; give him too much cause for joy, 
and he becomes ‘mad’ with his rejoicing; let an object 
of envy, jealousy, hate, remorse, repentance, occupy his 
mind too intensely or too singly, and his deliberative 
processes, his memory, his resolution, — indeed, all those 
‘saner aspects of his mental life which make him a man, 
—are temporarily impaired. It is simply a case, then, of 
the exaggeration of the normal. One element. in his 
make-up gets complete control of the man. 
The sort of social influence which a crowd exerts upon 
the single member of it is precisely the same. That ordi- 
nary requirement of social life — co-operation, with the sus- 
pension of private interest and judgment in some degree 
in the interest of a broader social point of view —is here 
enforced ; but the demand made is extreme. The suspen- 
sion of judgment becomes the inhibition of personal think- 
ing; the co-operation required for social life becomes the 
frenzy of social crime; the deeds of the individual are no 
longer his, but the crowd’s. So the whole series of facts, 
which are indeed so remarkable, may be explained on the 
view which treats them as excesses in processes upon 
which the very soberness and sanity of social man ulti-
-P-A-G-E-276
250 Fis Instincts and Emotions 
mately rest. If man were not able to take social sug- 
gestions at all, he would live alone in a cave and shoot 
his fellow-man at sight. But if he come out of this bondage 
to individualism into the promised land of co-operation 
through the give-and-take of social influence, then he must 
be prepared for the waxing growth of the new sense which 
his social freedom produces. The more social he becomes, 
and the more valuable the fruitage of his co-operation, 
as embodied in institutions, the more danger of excess- 
discharges in the new channel when the conditions of 
stimulation are artificial, and the more safeguards must he 
erect around his institutions, to protect them from himself.t 
The analogy with the individual’s own mind is an in- 
structive one. In order to think, one must have a certain 
impelling emotional trend, a certain sufficient interest, a 
plan to which he feels himself committed ; but these very 
things, the emotive aspect of thought itself, it is that on 
occasion dethrone his reason, lead him to the extreme 
excesses of passion, or land him in an institution for the 
insane. So social thinking, the normal engine of progress 
both in the creative and in the conservative processes of 
history, must have the sort of emotive impulse which we 
call social suggestion ; but to it, when it breaks its bounds 
and becomes a purposeless function, history owes its cata- 
clysms.? 
1 Sighele’s explanation of the tendency of the mob to action of a low type, 
is that a sort of average capacity is struck among all the individuals (Za 
Foule criminelle, p. 63). But if that were true, excess in crime would be as 
rare as great virtue in the crowd. 
2 Interesting cases from the life of the more social animals might be cited, 
going to show that with them this mass-action is a departure from their nor- 
mal life. The following quotation from Hudson aprogos of the violent setting 
of a herd upon its weak members lends itself to our view: — 
“The instinct is, then, not only useless but actually detrimental; and, this 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
Theory of Mob-Action 251 
155. With this explanation of those more wild and un- 
bridled exhibitions which men sometimes make of them- 
selves when acting collectively, we may see also the reason 
for the more partial and semi-reasonable obsessions which 
afflict society. The social tendency to be undeliberate, 
enthusiastic, to put up with the novelty which is most 
insistent in its claim, and most noisy in its self-commen- 
dation —this tendency is easily led by the schemer and 
agitator in our midst, whose only hope of a following is a 
following ex masse, when the force of the example of a few 
satellites carries the strength of overpowering suggestion 
to the unthinking crowd. For this reason the practice of 
demagoguery is much older than the theory of it. And 
then, besides, there are always lines of social influence 
running here and there in literature, in social theory itself, 
and in political party strife, which open a network of sug- 
gestions to the popular mind. All these things, to the 
degree to which they paralyze the individual’s judgment, 
stifle his thought, or appeal to his intellectual inertia, are 
really hypnotizing suggestions whose effects the general 
character of social life itself, with its openness to personal 
influences, sufficiently explains. 
156. II. Another ingredient, also, of the social emotion 
which we are now considering is to be found in the play- 
instinct. This class of phenomena has been characterized 
being so, the action of the herd in destroying one of its members, is not even 
to be regarded as an instinct proper, but rather as an aberration of an instinct, 
a blunder, into which animals sometimes fall when excited to action in unusual 
circumstances. The first thing that strikes us is that in these wild abnormal 
movements of social animals, they are acting in violent contradiction to the 
whole tenor of their lives — and to the whole body of their instincts and habits 
which have made it possible for them to exist together in communities.” 
(Nat. in La Plata, p. 340 f.)
-P-A-G-E-278
252 flis Instincts and Emotions 
in an earlier chapter, and their value in the early life of 
the child pointed out. It is easy to see that by play the 
child not only gets into the habit of being social in the 
normal ways and degrees which his after life requires, but 
he learns also to give himself up to the social spirit. In 
games there is the exact counterpart oftentimes of the 
action of the crowd. The imitative impulse is developed 
under the lead of the example and injunction of the older 
and more domineering children. The lesson of self-con- 
trol has its opposite in the lesson of mass-action and spon- 
taneous suggestibility. Any one who watches the games 
of a set of boys in the school-yard or in the streets will see 
that it is only a small part of the moves of the game which 
are provided for with any consistent or well-planned plot 
or scheme. The game is begun and then becomes, in 
great measure, the carrying-out of a series of coups et contre- 
coups on the part of the leaders among the players; the 
remainder following the dictation and example of the few. 
When a leader whoops, the crowd also whoop; when he 
fights, they fight. All this social practice is most valuable 
as discipline in serious social business; but it is also prep- 
aration for the excesses of social emotion. And a good 
deal might be said, I think, of the tendency of adults to be 
drawn together and to act together through the incitement 
of gaming.! 
157. Two general remarks may bring this topic to a 
close. The same relation which subsists between law- 
abiding and socially continent action, on the one hand, and 
the explosive action of the mob, on the other hand, also 
1The social influence of gaming should be brought out by some one 
writing on human games; I commend it to the distinguished author of the 
forthcoming work, Die Spiele der Menschen (a suggestion now realized by 
Professor Groos, The Play of Man).
-P-A-G-E-279
Theory of Mob-Action 253 
subsists in the impulses of the individual. One may sit in 
an auditorium, as the present writer has often done, during 
an exciting political or religious harangue, and endeavour to 
keep himself quite cool and unresponsive. He will then 
be convinced that he himself, even when he sets himself 
to be rational, is still a creature whose social suggestibil- 
ity goes deeper than his power of self-control. He feels, 
in spite of himself, and in the face of his great impatience 
with himself, the tide of social excitement rising within 
him; and the swelling of his bosom is evidence to him 
that there might ‘be an orator altogether too moving for 
his resistance. He feels that his footing is his only so 
long as he is enough alone to keep his thinking processes 
unentangled in the social emotions which are being stirred 
up around him. 
Another consideration, apropos of this general topic, 
seems of some importance. It is that the relation of the 
two tendencies thus found in the individual, and in every 
community, may vary indefinitely toward the excess of the 
one factor and the deficiency of the other. We can all 
point to individuals whom we characterize as suggestible 
and emotional. They are quick to catch a suggestion, a 
style, an opinion ; they go with the crowd; they are under 
such evident illusion as to the independence of their judg- 
ment that we smile behind their backs. Opposed to these 
we also know individuals who are as contrary as the way- 
ward child: men who will be original, ce@/wm ruat. And it 
is perhaps as often the occasion of remark that there are 
analogous differences in social communities springing from 
these individual characteristics. A society may be volatile, 
excitable, suggestible; or phlegmatic, stolid, inert. The Latin 
and the German races are often contrasted on these lines.

§ 6. Conclusions for Social Theory 
158. With so much consideration of the emotions and 
impulses which urge on the social man, we may now sum 
up the conclusions, of a general kind, to which we have 
been led by the consideration of his emotional life. 
These conclusions may be set forth somewhat as follows: 
(1) The beginnings of social life are found in the ani- 
mals. This is proved not only by the emotional life of 
the animals, but also by the {nbet pots expres- 
sions of the child (¢.g., bashfulness and sympathy), which 
point unmistakably to animal ancestry. This may be 
called ‘instinctive’ social life. 
(2) There is a stage of social life which ‘is, so to speak, 
‘spontaneous.’ It follows simply from the social impulse 
itself, considered as a tendency to co-operative action, 
which arises out of earlier social instincts. It marks an 
early stage in human social culture, when the arts of peace 
and the rudimentary forms of social convention proved 
themselves useful and served as a foundation for the 
larger social development based on reflective intelligence. 
This period is shown strikingly in certain stages of the 
child’s and youth’s modesty reactions. On the anthropo- 
logical side, it is confirmed by the existence of peace-loving 
primitive peoples, with the modes of co-operative activity 
seen in their industrial contrivances and in their rites 
and sports. 
(3) The child’s and the adult’s emotional expressions 
point to a further development, which mere spontaneous 
sociality is not sufficient to explain. It is marked by the 
adoption, with modifications, of the emotional reactions of 
spontaneous and instinctive periods, thus showing unmis-  
-P-A-G-E-281
Conclusions for Social Theory 255 
takably its origin; but it serves to introduce a further 
period, which in the growth of the child has its ground in 
self-consciousness. Conspicuous among the exhibitions of 
an emotional kind which characterize this period, are the 
modified expressions of modesty and sympathy which 
accompany self-consciousness. This is the ‘reflective’ 
period. 
(4) The general impulse of society, which is common to 
all the manifestations of co-operative life, itself gives an 
emotion which appears in the phenomenon of ‘plastic imi- 
tation,’ reaching its extreme form in the exhibitions of 
mob-action. If is an index of the fact of sociality which 
works by imitation rather than a cause of it, or its main 
outcome.! 
1 This directly antagonizes the view (Ball) that my criticism of mob-action 
holds against my own theory of social organization ; see the new Sects. 335 ff. 
(3d and later editions), defining the réle of imitation.

  CHAPTER VII 
His INTELLIGENCE! 
Tue preceding examination of the instinctive and emo- 
tional equipment of the social man has revealed the pres- 
ence in him of something not adequately expressed in 
terms of inherited reflexes. The growth of the child has 
also shown us his progress out of his inherited reactions 
into a higher sphere of invention and self-education, to 
which we have given the name ‘reflective.’ All this 
evidence of a higher part in man which draws out, utilizes, 
and controls the powers of his organic nature, and also 
regulates the assembling of men together for reasonable 
acts of a co-operative.kind, invites us to a more direct con- 
sideration. It will be well first to try to arrive at an 
understanding of the nature and sphere of operation of 
this intelligence of his, and then to seek out more espe- 
cially its meaning in the social life. 
§ 1. Nature of Intelligence 
159. Upon the first of these tasks we may not linger 
long, since it falls to theoretical psychology and_ since 
recent works have given us genetic principles which serve 
to bring the intelligence within the purview of natural 
history. Something of its character has also been seen 
1 This chapter is intended merely to give some empirical observations on 
the subject of the social nature and uses of the intelligence. 
256
-P-A-G-E-283
Nature of Intelligence 254 
in the chapter on ‘Invention.’ The intelligence serves cer- 
tain ends, in the economy of personal development, which 
may be stated in such general terms that the disagree- 
ments of opposed theories may not be aroused. I shall 
set forth these general functions of intelligence in the 
points which immediately follow. 
(1) It is by intelligence that complex knowledges are 
built up. The simple perception of a thing does, to a 
degree, involve intelligence; and this the animals have. 
So, also, have the animals association of ideas and a ten- 
dency to see their perceptions in related systems or general 
classes; the statement I am making, therefore, is not 
intended to mark off a human endowment zz any exclusive 
sense. But if we ask how far the animals go, as a matter 
of fact, in the development which gives intelligence its 
opportunity, we have to say xot far—that is, not far as 
compared with man. And the limitation seems to be, on 
the intellectual side,! just in this faculty of seeing things 
in groups, as complex situations, with relations of general 
extent and meaning, which require for their entertainment 
the use of symbols such as those seen, in their most devel- 
oped form, in speech. This, then, the ability to think in 
general terms, by using symbols which abbreviate and sum- 
marize detailed systems of associations, is the first charac- 
teristic of intelligence, as found in human social operation. 
(2) The other thing to be said of intelligence is cor- 
relative to this. J¢ zs the guide to action in complex situa- 
tions. All knowledge tends to lead to action. Even the 
reflexes of instinct are started by sensational processes 
‘ which discharge through the muscles. The perception of 
1 It is another aspect of the animal’s inability to judge with reference to 
self, spoken of in Sect. 86.
-P-A-G-E-284
258 ffs Intelligence 
an object leads the animal to act. And we find that the 
more complex the knowledges or perceptions are, the 
more complex also, the more varied, the actions become. 
And the variety shows itself in a certain show of acting on 
alternatives, or ‘choosing,’ as we say of the higher forms 
of intelligence. 
Further, in view of this possible variety and choice, we 
may ask after the motive or reason —the particular piece 
of knowledge —which tends to bring out an act of a 
given kind, calling it the ‘end’ of the action. It is charac- 
teristic of intelligence that the actions which it brings 
about are directed toward ends; that they are appropriate 
to realize, in whole or part, directly or indirectly, the 
events or situations which the knowledges depict. If 
directly, then we say the movement reproduces or rein- 
states the object which the actor is thinking about. This 
is plainest in a reaction of simple imitation, where the 
child actually makes his own hands or tongue reproduce 
the figure or sound which he sees or hears another make. 
If indirect, then the action is only a means to the end; 
only a first term in a series of actions which finally termi- 
nate in the reproduction or securing of the situation 
depicted in thought. Advancing intelligence quickly 
learns to turn all its knowledges into the channels fit to 
accomplish the ends now pictured, or then; and shows 
the ability to use means for its ends. 
It is evident, of course, to the psychologist that this is 
a very sketchy account of intelligence. So it is. But I 
am not aiming to justify any theoretical account of intelli- 
gence. The books do that, and I may refer to them for the 
justification of the points made and their genetic demon- 
stration. I am only stating the facts of the intelligence,
-P-A-G-E-285
Nature of Intelligence 259 
in their simplest terms, in order to use them in what 
follows. No one will deny that intelligence gives us gen- 
eral and abstract knowledges; nor that it is by our intelli- 
gence that we use means to accomplish ends. If one 
doubt this, let him look to the idiot or to the young child 
for illustrations of the inability to do one or other of these 
things, and then let him watch the same unfortunate weak- 
minded, or the same child, and see him learn to do both 
these things together; and he will have all the evidence 
he should require. So if we should throw the two points 
together, in a sentence, getting a single definition of intel- 
ligence which should answer our present needs, we should 
say: intelligence is the ability to understand complex situa- 
tions and to know how to act suitably in reference to them. 
160. With this very brief and schematic account of the 
intelligence before us, we may turn back on our path and 
notice that the growth of the child in learning to know of 
himself and of the world, as depicted in the earlier 
chapter, is simply growth in intelligence. We saw that 
his inventions were always just the attainment of ever 
broader and more complex knowledges, and we also saw 
that his tests and checks, in all the process, were just 
the appeals to action by which he learned to use what 
he had learned. Complexity of understanding and suita- 
bleness of action are the two points of interest and value 
in all his development. But the further definition of each 
of these aspects of intelligence now arouses further ques- 
tion. The child’s actual system of knowledges, apart 
from the more or less fixed relationships of external nature, 
is that system into which his social heredity leads him. 
We have seen how it is that he goes on constantly in the 
paths which the usages of society, the traditions of his  
-P-A-G-E-286
260 ffis Intelligence 
elders, the forms of accessible literature, etc., open up 
before him. It is impossible for him to make his system 
of truths for himself, and even the advances which his 
thought does make for itself are constantly brought to 
social tests, before he accepts them as valid and perma- 
nent acquisitions. There is, therefore, a large social 
ingredient in the truths which each individual learns; and 
he himself constantly testifies to its power over him by 
making appeals to society for confirmation. So it is only 
what we should expect, that his action should reflect the 
social aspect of his thought, as well as the purely personal 
aspect; that he should live normally as a social man in a 
social environment. 
This supposition leads us to ask more closely for a 
definition of the other aspect of his intelligence —that 
which relates to the ends of action. And the attempt to 
answer this question gets additional interest from the fact 
that it is an historical question, and that the discrimination 
and testing of many social theories now in the field is 
possible only when we get some consistent answer to it. 
We may state this question in two main inquiries: first, 
what is the end which intelligent action has in view? and 
second, what kinds of action are reasonable with reference 
to this end? ’ 
161. In coming to a discussion of these topics, we are 
not called upon to seek out a philosophy of ends, nor to 
bring harmony into current disputes on the topic. The 
main antithesis now current turns upon the supposition 
that one or the other of two views is true, to the exclusion 
of the other. One class of men say that the end of action 
is revealed by the action; that the end is nothing but the 
statement of the final term of the action itself; that intelli-
-P-A-G-E-287
  Nature of Intelligence 261 
gence has its natural history, as an agent in the evolution 
of mankind, and so the end of intelligence, like the end 
of the evolution process itself, is to be discovered only by 
seeing what the outcome really is. The question, to this 
theory, is a question of fact, depending, however, upon the 
truth of the genetic view of the mind. This is the theory 
of autonomy: the man as a whole is law-giving to himself, 
just because he can get no law which is not the outcome 
of the very process of development which he himself 
represents. 
The other class of theories hold that the end of action 
is set for the man by some instrumentality outside of him. 
They hold to heteronomy. The end is some real and abso- 
lute end, which it is his business to aim at, whether it 
arise naturally in his mind or no. 
‘The body of the doctrine already set forth in this essay, 
resting as it does on the general position that every psy- 
chological outcome must have its natural history and its 
preliminary stages, and that every function or activity 
must have its radson d’étre in a content which normally 
arouses it—all this forces us at once to espouse the au- 
tonomy view. The end of action must be a function of 
the content which arouses the action. The dog acts with 
reference to perceptions; they are the best he can do. 
The man acts with reference to concepts, with distant aims 
before him in space and time; he can do it because he is 
able to feel the value of the distant and the general. The 
nature of the knowledge, then, is that which determines 
the sort of action; and the action must terminate upon 
this knowledge, not on some other knowledge — be it 
better, or be it worse knowledge. 
- When we come to apply this, by examining the know- 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  262 fits Intelligence 
ledges which are actually found among us anywhere, —in 
the animal, in the man, in society, we are able to dis- 
tinguish three sorts of ends which come up as functional 
aims for action in the sense which I have set forth. They 
represent three stages in the progress of mind. We may 
say that the ends of action, are, first, zwpersonal or objec- 
tive, then they become personal or subjective, and, finally, 
and with the latter, they are social or eective. These 
terms may be described in more detail. 
§ 2. Impersonal Intelligence 
162. The distinction between the consciousness which 
has no reflection on self, no thought of a self as a separate 
being and as the source of the very thought which thinks 
it, and the consciousness which does have this reference to 
a personal self or thinker, has been fully set forth, and the 
development of the thought of such a self traced. The 
action of a consciousness, then, of the impersonal kind — 
the consciousness which has no such personal thought — 
cannot, of course, have as its end or aim suchaself. Ifthe 
self cannot be thought, zso facto it cannot be put forth as 
the end of action. The action is a function of the thought 
which is there, and if the thought of a self is not there, then 
it cannot produce action. On the contrary, the thought in 
a consciousness at this stage is always the thought of an 
object, this thing or that there in the world; the action ter- 
minates with this, and, as far as the consciousness dictates 
the action, that is all there is of it. We, of course, who 
speculate on philosophical questions, ask, further, what the

in Thought and Things, Vol. 1. The ‘prelogical’ stages of knowledge corre- 
spond to what is here described, from the point of view of self-consciousness, 
as ‘impersonal.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  Impersonal Intelligence 263 
place is of this action in the system of organic reactions 
which go to illustrate the evolution theory, and reach a 
view, perhaps, that the action which is selected and re- 
peated is that one which gives pleasure; and so come to 
say that the end of that action is pleasure. But that is a 
matter of our philosophy, not of the animal’s end. He 
does not stop to ask for pleasure nor to distinguish his 
actions on any such basis until he gets a certain association 
established between the action and the pleasure which it 
gives. And then he does not reflect upon the pleasure, 
and determine that he will pursue it. He finds his impul- 
sive reaction toward pleasure a function of the memory 
of pleasure, just as the reaction on objects is a function of 
the perception of the objects. 
163. But now we can see that it is the business of natural 
selection to determine the kind of action which shall find 
its most radical fulfilment in the world through this imper- 
sonal thought. As we have seen, this has required, as 
a matter of fact, that the family should arise; and that, 
in turn, required that actions of a so-called co-operative 
kind should be there. Thus arose animal instincts of a 
quasi-social sort; but even the complex family instincts 
and co-operation of the animals do not involve personal, 
self-conscious thought. They occur in appropriate refer- 
ence to the objective content of consciousness, and are 
always a function of this content. The instincts, how- 
ever inadequately they may seem to be represented in the 
actual sensory experiences which call them out, neverthe- 
less seem to have arisen by the growing adaptation of the 
organism to the stimulations of the environment. The 
conclusion, therefore, is that these also are impersonal 
activities. They have no personal end; neither the ego 
nor the alter, as such, appeals to the animal. The actual
-P-A-G-E-290
  264 fis Intelligence 
meaning to him of his actions is simply that they happen ; 
and their meaning in the doctrine of evolution is deter- 
mined by the complex setting of conditions of which the 
actions in question form a part. 
164. So when we come to ask the second question (cf. 
Sect. 160) concerning action issuing from such a conscious- 
ness, the question as to what is the ‘reasonable’ action, we 
find a certain embarrassment. The concept of reasonable- 
ness does not apply at all, seeing that the animal is not able 
to reason. If he does not have actions set before him on 
which he has to pass judgment with reference to their 
fitness to secure an end, then there is nothing for him to 
do but to act out each mental content which he gets, just 
as it comes up. All stimulations stand on the same basis. 
If he fail to act on each situation as his perception of 
that situation dictates, then he is but sick or maimed. 
That is all that we can say ; there is no question of relative 
reasonableness in his actions. So, as a practical result, 
we have to say that the co-operative actions by which he 
supports the family life, possibly at the expense of his 
own life,—-as when the mother starves herself that her 
young may be fed, — are just as reasonable as the actions 
by which he satisfies his own appetite. In each case his 
mental content is issuing in activity, and the different 
activities equally express his nature. 
This evident neutrality of his, — say of the companion- 
able dog that runs beside my horse, —as regards any pos- 
sible standard of reasonableness in his action, may be 
emphasized here, although no one would contradict it, 
possibly ; for when we come to the corresponding question 
about the higher stages of consciousness, we are apt to 
want just this sort of analogy to help us. It does not 
make the remotest difference to the dog what we adult
-P-A-G-E-291
    Impersonal Intelligence 265 
men may say about his folly in losing his life to save mine 
or yours, or about his acuteness in getting his dinner by 
stealing my leg of lamb. The two actions are equally 
reasonable from the dog’s point of view, because each is 
an adequate measure of his mental state at the time. The 
drowning man is his end in one case, because there is the 
master drowning, and action follows on this situation; in 
the other case, the meat is seen and smelt, and action 
follows on that. 
165. The corresponding case is plain in man. We 
have found in him also many actions to which the predi- 
cate ‘reasonable’ and its opposite do not apply. All the 
actions of his which he shares with the animals, as far as 
they represent in him tendencies which his reasonable 
thinking, his intelligence, does not pass upon, are of this 
character. This epoch in human development is seen in 
the child up to its third year or thereabouts, when he 
begins to grow reflective. We do not blame the child for 
acting on his impulses. We do not say he is unreasonable 
in not using means to ends, nor reasonable in accomplish- 
ing ends by those endowments shared with the animals, 
by which he sometimes reaches ends without means. 
He is simply a creature of suggestion, of action in terms 
of content, first-intention action, as the philosophers 
say. And, moreover, it is true of him, as it is of the 
animals, that the end which his actions do subserve, — 
the objective ends to which we by our philosophy find his 
whole life process to minister, —this is an affair of the 
examination of the data which the evolution process in- 
volves at that particular stage. If the activities of co- 
operative instinct are prominent along with the personal, 
aggressive, individualistic activities, then the end of the 
|
-P-A-G-E-292

evolution process must be conceived of as including both 
these classes of data. And the reasonable aspect of 
development, the end which it sets out to reach, must be 
broad enough to hold both these factors together in a 
single conception. But to justify any such view from the 
animal’s or child’s consciousness would be possible only 
in the later stage of development, in which intelligence 
becomes personal. 
§ 3. Personal Intelligence 
166. For the mode and method of the mind’s passage 
from the impersonal to the personal and social forms of 
thought, I must again refer to what has been said in 
detail of the child’s mental development. It has been 
traced all the way from ‘personality suggestion,’ which is 
the merest distinction of persons from other objects, on the 
ground of characteristic ways of behaviour, up to the full 
antithesis of ego and alter. And in it we have also 
pointed out the movement by which he thinks, in terms of 
one self, of the two, or the other. It now becomes our 
task to inquire how his intelligence makes these thoughts 
available in its general building up of knowledge, on 
the one hand; and then what of reasonable character the 
actions which result may consequently get. In short, the 
two inquiries are those suggested above: 7.¢., (1) what is 
the end set up in this personal form of consciousness? 
and (2) how and to what extent are the actions then 
performed reasonable with reference to the securing of 
these ends? 
Taking up the first of these questions at this higher 
level, we find that the trend of contemporary philosophy
-P-A-G-E-293
Personal Intelligence 267 
and ethics may be stated in a broad form, which steers 
reasonably clear of the discussions of the schools. The 
problem familiar to psychologists in the term ‘desire’ is 
not now before us;! but the use made of the notion of 
desire in many of the books on sociology and political 
economy justifies us the more in giving the topic the 
meed of attention which our present development needs. 
What is it that man desires? 
167. The doctrines of the end of desire now current 
fall together in a series which is in itself significant. We 
have the end of desire stated alternatively, ze, as ‘an 
object,’ ‘the possession of an object,’ ‘the enjoyment of 
‘an object,’ ‘enjoyment in general,’ ‘enjoyment of self,’ 
‘the self who enjoys,’ ‘self-realization,’ ‘the attainment of 
a better self.’ The theories, in other words, travel all the 
way from the object to the self. And it is the simplest 
thing in the world to say why they do so. It is because 
each of these formulations seeks to elevate the statement 
of some one aspect of desire into a general formula. 
As a matter of fact, every mature man of us has all of 
these desires. And not only so; there are epochs of 
development which are characterized by one or other 
of these ends, as then the great and prevailing sort of 
desire. 
The reason for this variety is that the desire is a function 
of the thought which lies back of it. The desire is the 
tendency to action which the thought arouses. So the 
examination of the thought is the necessary preliminary 
o the determination of the kind of desire and its end. 
iven the thought which terminates on objects, that 
1 See below, Chap. IX., § 3, where desire is considered with reference to the 
‘sanction’ under which it attains its ends. 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
268 fis Intelligence 
which is quite impersonal, unreflective, and the end of 
its desire is the odject. This in its purity is what is 
called above the impersonal stage. But given the thought 
which brings up pleasure strongly, with enough reflection 
to single out the pleasure and set it forward in something 
of an abstract way, and the desire then terminates on the 
pleasure. And yet again; given the thought of self 
as the constant being whose interests are represented in 
the pleasure, whose life demands pleasure, and whose per- 
fection is the goal of all the highest pleasures, then the 
desire terminates on the self, and perhaps on an ideal 
self. Allvery good. So we must again distinguish between 
the end of the particular action or desire itself and the 
philosophy which we reason out on the basis of those 
particular sorts of desire. The former is the progressive 
developing thing which the thought itself is; and the 
latter is the interpretation of one or other, or all, of the 
stages. 
This general position once taken, we have to do hence- 
forward, not with an attempt to get a philosophical theory 
of the end of human action which will satisfy all. the con- 
ditions, nor with the attempt to read into each of the 
stages of development the results of such a theory. Our 
task is rather to find such general distinctions in the con- 
tent of thought at the different epochs of human develop- 
ment as give differences of end at the corresponding 
epochs.! Whatever significance these epochs of develop- 
ment may have for a general theory of mind, they have 
1 Cf. the distinction made below, Chap. IX., § 3, on ‘Sanctions,’ between the 
‘world of fact’ and the ‘world of desire.’ Our object in the later chapter is to 
show that, at whatever stage of consciousness, the ‘thing of desire,’ or the full 
motive, rather than the mere object or ‘thing of fact,’ is what sanctions the 
resulting action. 
    
-P-A-G-E-295
  | Personal Intelligence 269 
direct significance for the attempt to arrive at a genetic 
account of the social life of man. 
The problem has been thus defined in the preceding 
pages. The three epochs of the genetic development of 
thought—the impersonal, the personal, and the social 
epochs — have been mentioned. The present digression 
is made in order to justify the use of them from the point 
of view of the demarcation of our present problem, as 
over against the philosophies of desire current in social 
and ethical discussion. To be sure, we might carry 
our claim further, and say that philosophy, in its search 
for general principles ‘of construction,—such as the 
theory of end requires,—should proceed out from the 
empirical examination of the actual course of develop- 
ment, and interpret action in terms of thought epochs. 
This would be true; and philosophers need to be told so, 
I think. 
| 168. So we come to ask after the meaning of the per- 
sonal and social epochs of thought for the theory of end. 
_ At the outset, certain points already made come to 
mind. First, we have found, in the preceding chapter on 
the ‘Emotions,’ that there is no break of an absolute 
kind between the epochs which, on the side of the in- 
stinctive life, we called respectively ‘organic’ and ‘spon- 
taneous’; and, on the. other hand, there is likewise none 
between the ‘spontaneous’ and the ‘reflective’ epochs. 
This was made plain from two points of view: the emo- 
tional expressions of the organic epoch are utilized in the 
higher epochs by a natural transition from the lower to 
the higher type of function. Further, the child shows no 
reat breaks in his development from instinct, through 
suggestion and direct imitation, to reflection; at least, on
-P-A-G-E-296
  270 flis Intelligence 
the side of the emotional movements of his modesty, sym- 
pathy, play-activities, etc. His progress is continuous. 
Each of his spontaneous activities grows right up out of his 
instinctive performances; and then each of his reflective 
emotional attitudes is only a further adaptation and con- 
firmation of the spontaneous ones. And a third line of 
evidence was suggested from the side of anthropology. 
The progress of race culture shows similar transitions 
from the savage to the gregarious and nomadic, and then 
to the reflective forms of co-operation. Yet we found it 
more difficult to conceive the transition from the sponta- 
neous to the reflective than we did from the instinctive to 
the spontaneous sort of activity. The reflective seems 
to represent a new trend of development, inasmuch as 
it involves, as we now see, the two great characteristics 
of intelligent adaptation,—the appreciation of general 
and abstract situations, with the drawing of inferences 
looking toward distant ends, and the adoption of means 
appropriate to the accomplishment of these ends. The 
burden of the case, therefore, —the cause of the transi- 
tion, — vests upon the intelligence, and its meaning be- 
comes the further problem. 
Turning to the other main development of the preced- 
ing pages, the child’s development on the side of inven- 
tion and personal interpretation, we have more light, I 
think. We found that the child’s imitations are a means 
to personal growth only in so far as he made the result, in 
each case, the basis of an interpretation for action. He 
reaches synthetic combinations of data constantly, and it 
is these which enable him to act more appropriately. He 
is like the genius, in that he reaches ever-changing and 
novel arrangements of the elements of presentation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
Personal Intelligence 271 
memory. By the laws of assimilation, motor habit and 
accommodation, he is quite unable to be stationary. He 
must see and react to new situations every day. 
His growth takes place under two general aspects. 
First, his tendency to generalize is a matter of growth in 
the facility with which he /earns to act upon things in com- 
mon or general ways instead of treating each individual 
fact and event in a special and peculiar way. His growth 
in ability to reach complex thought is a matter of growing 
unity of habit in his active life. But, on the other hand, 
with this comes also the ability to single out the particular 
and treat it in relation to the group in which it belongs; 
this is due to the fact that in his learning to act, in his 
successive accommodations of himself actively to the facts 
and events of the world in succession, he has secured a 
sense of their isolation and a mode of treatment of them 
in isolation. In this relation of the single fact to the 
eneral class, —a relation which arises through the joint 
Laker of habit and accommodation,!— we have the ger-   
minating tendency of intelligence to reach an interpreta- 
tion of each particular in the general situation which comes 
before the mind by the system of steps which we call 
inference and reasoning. 
This is a very summary characterization of the gene- 
sis of thought; and intentionally so, since the genesis of 
thought is not our problem. We might just assume that 
thought has a genesis, or, if you please, a beginning, and 
then go on to ask its sphere in the evolution of social life ;   1 See the detailed treatment of these principles of the genesis of the func- 
tion of thought in my A/ent. Devel, Chaps. X.-X1.; cf. also James on the 
‘Genesis of the Elementary Mental Categories,’ Psych., II., pp. 629 ff. See 
also Chap. III., § 3 above, on ‘Selective Thinking.’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-298
  272 flis Intelligence 
but I have preferred to state in outline what I believe to 
be the real genesis of thought, seeing that it has the 
peculiarity of making the motor accommodations and 
habits of the thinker the leading-string to his intelli- 
gence. This holds together the two positions taken that 
the end is a function of the thought-content, and that it 
is by acting to realize ends that thought develops. The 
child, for example, has the purpose to imitate my move- 
ments. He cannot have that purpose until he has thought 
of the movement; but he cannot arrive at a more adequate 
thought of the movement unless he act continually on the 
thought he already has. The former thought gives him 
his present possible act; and his present act gives him the 
new thought. So action and thought grow together as 
correlative aspects of intelligence. Now we may go on 
to consider the social interpretation of this state of things 
in the life of the child. 
169. Disregarding the interpretations which the child 
makes of the impersonal elements of his thought, and so 
of the progressive knowledges which he builds up of the 
external world, we may turn at once to the social element 
in his personal growth. With this distinction, however, I 
do not wish to deny that there are social elements also in 
his knowledge of the external world; there are. But the 
method of the child’s interpretations, in all his knowledge, 
is the same, and is a function of his personal growth; so 
by taking the knowledges which have specific reference to 
his social surroundings, and inquiring after the social 
factors involved in them, we bring out most clearly the 
sphere of social suggestion where it is most important 
both in itself and for our present line of thought. The 
question then is: what social elements enter into the
-P-A-G-E-299
Personal Intelligence 273 
child’s interpretations of situations of social value, and 
what uses does he make of these interpretations them- 
selves? Or, in other words, what is the content of the 
thought which stimulates the child to social actions, and 
what are the actions which are ‘reasonably’ performed 
with this end in view. These are the two questions 
already stated: the end, and the means to the end. 
As to the content to the child’s thought of social situa- 
tions, that is twofold. The concrete ego and alter thoughts 
fall together on one side, over against the thought of an 
ideal personality on the other side. So there comes to con- 
sciousness, when we follow the child up into the beginnings 
of his ethical life, a threefold sense of self, each a sort of 
net for the assimilation and interpretation of new experi- 
ences or suggestions of personal relationship. He has a 
thought of himself, the ego with a group of very well- 
defined emotions of self-interest;. this grows more and 
more solid, circumscribed, and compulsory upon all the 
candidates for position in his thought. Then he has a 
thought of the a/ter, who presents himself from time to 
time; and with this the group of altruistic emotions seen 
in modesty, self-shrinking, sympathy, etc. — another mental 
net always ready to entrap and assimilate the suggestions 
of personal presence, action, etc., which come and go in 
the environment. Third, the general or ideal thought of 
self, around which the higher sentiments spring up. Be- 
fore going on to speak of the third sense of self, with the 
sentiments which accompany it, we should define the other 
two and estimate their importance and relation to each 
other, recalling what has been said of them in an earlier 
connection.t 
170. It now becomes clear to us, both from the con- 
1 Cf. Sect. 29 a.
-P-A-G-E-300
  274 ffis Intelligence 
sideration of the emotional transitions which we have 
already studied, and from the actual observations of the 
child, that before reflection arises—that is, before the 
sense of a general self is clearly defined— this antithe- 
sis in relation to the alter is not fully distinct. The 
thought of you versus me is not there. It is, ‘my toy 
versus your toy, ‘my act versus your act,’ ‘my voice 
versus your voice,’ etc. The first person is usually in 
the possessive case. The materials of the antithesis are 
being gathered, in this way, from the single situations 
into which instinctive and spontaneous activities urge the 
child. 
But then as reflection arises there comes the movement, 
described above, by which the self becomes solidified by 
degrees; and the externals of personal identity also come 
in to hold the ego and the alter apart. Then, as the self 
becomes a separate thought, it tends, like every thought, to 
assume an attitude, and a series of personal actions mani- 
fest themselves. The child begins to act for himself first, 
and for the other afterwards. This again —this action — 
now also reacts to strengthen and harden the thought of 
self, and to emphasize its relative distinctness from the 
alter, by the reactive influence of action on thought spoken 
of above. This is the germinating development of reflec- 
tive selfishness. It means a self actually thought of as in 
opposition to the alter, together with a series of actions 
which are calculated to harden and perpetuate this op- 
position. The end is the self considered explicitly as 
‘my self, and not your self, nor anybody else’s self?1 And 
with this the general self is identified or contrasted in each 
case of action. 
1 This shows itself socially in what is called ‘ opposition’ above (Sect. 149).
-P-A-G-E-301
   Personal Intelligence is 
Let us see clearly, then, how real selfishness arises. It 
comes by the very movement which establishes reflectively 
the antithesis between the thought of me and the thought 
of you. Certain movement attitudes must arise on each 
side, attitudes which represent my gain with or without 
your loss, my pleasure with or without your pain, and the 
reverse. Now it is just these movement experiences, these 
active attitudes, which constitute, as we have seen, the syn- 
thesis of reflection as such. Through their appropriate- 
ness to the ego side of the antithesis in the one case, they 
fix that side and furnish what we call ‘desire’ for the main- 
tenance of that side of the self-antithesis. I reflect on my- 
self and act selfishly when I entertain the thought of the 
opposed actions, and then adopt the conduct which repre- 
sents the ego side. The ego then becomes my end simply 
because it prevails in the synthesis of reflection. The 
presence of so-called reflection is the presence of the 
clear antithesis of the two self-altitudes held together in a 
wider synthesis to which all the tendencies to movement, 
action, conduct, give rise; and the consciousness of the 
higher synthesis itself, representing a more or less estab- 
lished habit, is the general or ideal self 
171. With it reflective altruism arises also. It must 
arise just because the ego and the alter are antithetic 
thoughts, two poles in a wider thought process. The 
thought of the alter, as it becomes solidified over against 
the ego, prompts to a line of action different from that 
1It is ‘general’ when considered retrospectively, as finding concrete illus- 
trations in actual personalities, or as being experiential in its origin; so it is 
‘general’ when looked at ‘objectively’ or ‘ejectively.’ It is ‘ideal’ when 
looked at prospectively, as yet unfinished, not fully experienced, liable to 
further growth in experience, and so in its actual embodiment ‘projective.’ 
See Chap. L., § 4, also Thought and Things, Chap. X., §§ 5, 8.
-P-A-G-E-302
  276 _ Fis L[ntelligence 
which is liberated by the ego. This line of action comes 
to represent a policy in the active life which inhibits or 
interferes with the habits of selfish action; and again, by 
its emotional expressions it reacts to solidify further the 
thought of the alter. Sympathy comes to be an adopted 
channel of action to the reflective person whose experience 
is thus growing in organization and richness. And when 
he comes to a decision, after this contrast between the two 
self thoughts and their respective promptings to action 
has been sharply drawn, —as in the child of about three 
to four years of age, —then he becomes more or less cal- 
culating as to the consequences to be expected from the 
action itself, and from its social reception by others. 
172. Then there intervenes another stage of develop- 
ment which both sustains the characteristic distinction 
now before us, and also goes further. The child does not 
long rest merely upon the first effects of his action on 
himself and others. A new movement of his intelligence 
leads him to make use of ‘second causes.’ The fact that 
action has now become a means to an end—the end of 
reinstating and securing the ego-self or the alter-self — 
this does not remain undeveloped. It requires no great 
increase in the complexity of his thought to conceive the 
possibility of using other elements of experience to minis- 
ter to the same ends. Moreover, he is not left to himself 
to make this step; in this, as in everything else in the 
social heritage into which he grows up, he is initiated by 
his fellows. He sees mother and nurse handle things 
for the preparation of his food, bed, clothing, etc., —all 
actions which have three terms instead of two, as we may 
go on to explain. 
There is the thought of the thing to be done, the
-P-A-G-E-303
  Personal Intelligence 277 
thought of the thing by which it is to be done, and, 
finally, the thought of the action by which the latter of 
these thoughts is carried out. We find the child catching 
this idea at a remarkably early age. In fact, I think he 
learns it first by the ordinary processes of organic move- 
ment by which his thought of an object has to be followed 
by the thought of a movement, in order that the movement 
made may bring the object into reach, etc. By repetitions 
of this he is enabled to put a series of movement-thoughts 
in succession between the thought of the object and the 
actual end-movements by which the object is finally 
secured; it is likely, therefore, that there is a form of 
unreflective action on means to ends. But in this, too, 
the development is from a simpler to a more ideational or 
reflective epoch. Given the thought of self, — either the 
ego thought or the alter thought,—and the child then 
turns the machinery of earlier adaptations of means to ends 
to the pursuit of that. So he becomes not only a reflective 
egoist and altruist, but a plotter as well: an agent of more 
or less distant personal ends. 
Among instances of this in child life, I may note the 
fact that the child soon comes to see the social use which 
he may make of this turn of things. His egoism prompts 
him, in a sense, to victimize the alter; and in this we find 
another of the highly interesting cases of children’s lies. 
173. It happens in this way: The child’s thought of 
the alter is read back into the actual alter; and thus, with 
a great many contributing details, the child keeps himself 
and the other apart. He attributes to the alter — say his 
father — the set of actions with view to ends similar to his 
own; and his proof of this is the fact that whenever he 
acts in a certain way, his father responds by acting in a
-P-A-G-E-304
  278 ffis Intelligence 
way which fits into his own action and expectation. So 
common understandings are reached between the two. 
Not only does the child find that he can depend upon 
others for the suggestion of thoughts which fit into the 
surrounding conditions, but he learns that the alter depends 
also upon the suggestions which he makes, The sugges- 
tion-influences he sees to be reciprocal. So he has a way 
before him of bringing the father’s actions into the series 
of events which contribute to his own ulterior thought. 
For example, one of the earliest instances I have ob- 
served is this: the child’s crying leads the mother to bring 
food; the cry is the suggestion upon which the mother 
can be counted to act. So very early we find the child 
using the cry to obtain food or other favours from his 
mother, even when he is in no need. Pleasurable memo- 
ries hover before him, possibly simply that of his mother’s 
presence. With them comes up the thought of certain 
actions of his mother which bring the pleasure; then he 
remembers that his cry will be the appropriate suggestion 
to start his mother. So he makes use of the means and 
attains the end. The cry is a means to an end once re- 
moved; and the interesting thing, from our present point 
of view, is that the first link in the chain which the child 
uses is a social link. It really involves using his intelli- 
gence to direct and employ, for his own private ends, the 
social influence which we call personal suggestion. 
Here we have possibly the first use of the social bond 
by the individual’s intelligence; and in it there lies, by im- 
plication, a// the conscious power and function of thought in 
the manipulation of society. It means that in thinking self 
the child-agent thinks a social situation, and that he then 
uses the other elements of the situation to realize the ends 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  Personal Intelligence 279 
of the self; this is the social function of thought every- 
where when considered as the instrument of the thinkers 
use of soctety in contrast with society's use of the thinker 
and his thoughts. We shall have to return to this later 
on in this chapter ;1 at present let us trace a little further 
the child’s use of this social resource. 
174. It is not morally a lie, of course, when the child 
cries for what he does not need, and by crying gets it. 
It is not moral, because, like almost all the proceedings 
which come to be reflective, it is at first merely a matter 
of association and active adaptation to an associated train 
of thoughts. It does not matter to the child that it is 
another person that his cry appeals to. It is simply an 
accident that the whole train implicates his thought of 
the alter together with other and impersonal terms. 
Other trains of thoughts also exist which implicate only 
his own ego thought and certain external objects, and 
he acts in exactly the same way upon them; as, for 
example, when the thought of a satisfaction arouses his 
sense of the reaching movements of grasping, and he goes 
through this series of means to that end. The two cases 
are just the same to him; and he can work them equally 
well, provided that he find the mother’s movements fol- 
low upon his action, just as his own movements would 
have, if his own had been all that were required in the 
case. It is then at first a spontaneous use of the social 
bond by the child. It does not involve any degree of 
what we call reflective cunning or craft.? 
1 The other question, .¢., that of the function of the intellectual output of 
individuals in affording to society its matter for adoption and absorption, is 
treated in Chap. XI., ‘The Social Forces,’

Yet it does not retain this simplicity very long. The 
child soon gets away from the associated trains which 
originate in real wants, and involve only real wants and 
their satisfactions. And the step which he first takes in 
the path of reflective deception is usually, I think, one of 
a negative kind; he uses the social bond to deflect pains 
and penalties from himself. This, again, is a slight 
thing in his mental growth, proceeding somewhat as 
follows : — 
The trains which lead to disastrous consequences, both 
when he alone is involved and also when the alter per- 
sonality is one of the mean-terms to the result, get very 
strong marking and great adhesiveness in his conscious- 
ness. Anything which comes in as a further term, in the 
same series, to deflect the result or to lead to other and 
less disastrous consequences, is again a mere matter of 
learning by association, and of learning of exactly the 
same kind as that by which the train was originally 
started. He then takes one of two methods to supple- 
ment these disastrous trains. One method is to interpo- 
late a term which will prevent altogether the action which 
he wishes to avoid; the other is the employment of fur- 
ther means to supplement the train and so render it 
neutral. The first case is seen plainly in the repressions 
of his own activity, or of his normal expressions of him- 
self, which are tell-tale indications to father or mother. 
Thus he may directly escape punishment, a dose of bitter 
medicine, or the like. The other is seen in his actually 
misleading other people by word or action, when the 
real facts are unknown to them. Instances are common 
master coming down-stairs, quickly jumped beneath a table near by, and lay 
quiet, as if asleep.

enough.! It involves some invention and social know- 
ledge. The following example may serve to illustrate it. 
The two children, H. (five years) and E. (three years), 
were playing in my empty study. I heard E. cry out with 
pain, and came to the door just in time to see H. clapping 
her hands with joy and laughing mockingly at E. (whom 
it appeared afterwards she had slightly hurt in wresting 
away a toy). As soon as my footstep was heard, H.’s 
face and manner changed with marvellous quickness, 
from joy to keen sorrow and sympathy. She dropped 
the toy, and before I reached the scene her attitude 
was one of profound sympathy, commiseration, and dis- 
tress. Then, not satisfied with this, she turned quickly 
and pretended to be occupied in another part of the room. 
In this case, not to dwell upon a lesson which is so plain, 
H. not only suppressed her joy, but feigned grief, and 
then adopted other means to avert the penalty she ex- 
pected from me. 
It is evident that this line of operations brings out 
various direct conflicts of egoistic and altruistic impulses. 
So clear is this, that the proper pedagogical method of 
correction in such cases would seem to be that of strength- 
ening the latter impulses over against the selfish ones. 
But that aside, the conflict is itself fruitful to us in en- 
deavouring to trace the child’s development. Inasmuch 
as the alter thought is involved in the bonds which the 
child thus learns to manipulate, he must have emotional 
impulses of a generous kind, to some degree, in all his 
use of the social bond for his own purposes. And these 
impulses in turn grow strong enough to lead him on occa-

avoid complying with a command (/oc. cit., p. 270 f.).

sion —and in some children this occasion is very frequent, 
as against the selfish use already spoken of —to use 
the same means to accomplish purposes of truth and 
generosity. The imitative child will find out new ways 
of being docile and good, and will often surprise his 
parents with his early tendency to self-reproach and 
confession directly in the teeth of his fear of penalty 
and expectation of suffering. All this must be accred- 
ited to the growth of the alter thought and its emotional 
value, as expressed in action. 
175. Then on both sides—as concerning his selfish 
actions and also as concerning his generous actions — 
he grows more his own master, and makes bolder excur- 
sions into the realm of social manipulation. The use 
of the social bond which I have described as negative, 
tends to enable the child to escape unwelcome events 
and realities; he makes the same use of the social bond 
also to secure positive results. 
He suggests terms in the series, in order to arouse 
states of mind in his social fellows which will be fruit- 
fis in good things to himself; and he does this, again, 
in both of two ways: (1) in the suppression of the 
real facts of his knowledge—the way of negative mis- 
representation; and (2) by putting forward suggestions 
of a positive kind which he thinks w’l mislead. All 
this follows so evidently from the method of his growth 
into the use of social relationships that I need not dwell 
upon it in detail before the next event to be signalized, 
which shows it in its fullest illustration, z.¢., the beginning 
of the use of language for consciously social purposes. 
1 As when a child comes and asks to be punished for a fault which he is 
sure has not been witnessed by any one.   
  
-P-A-G-E-309
   Personal Intelligence 283 
176. In language, as we have seen, the child finds 
ready for him a system of nets-for-thought, actually in 
use about him. He sees, among the first uses of speech, 
the way others convey their meanings to one another; 
how an emotion, an action, any social expression, passes 
from one person to another with the passage of a word. 
So it is not at all surprising that the beginnings which 
he makes in the employment of social suggestion for 
cettain more or less remote ends, should be realized in 
his speech. He has more than an imitative impulse to 
make progress in his speaking. He has that certainly; 
but besides he has, in all likelihood, also an hereditary 
tendency in the same direction. And as soon as his 
sense of the possible use of social means to personal 
ends gets at all advanced by his employment of facial 
expression, active attitudes of body, etc., he finds that 
most extraordinary instrument of the same utility in his 
hands — or rather in his mouth—the forms of language. 
Here it is, I think, that all the progress which the child 
has been making in his personal growth, as a being with 
the thought of ego and alter, with tendencies to the 
series of actions which these personal thoughts stimu- 
late, with all the groping after self-possession in the 
relations of his social life,—here it is that all these 
things fall together in a great insight achieved, again, 
through action. When he speaks and others understand, 
then he has meanings; then he is using symbols; then 
his plots to catch social influences and hold them to- 
gether in forms of personal utility of both the selfish 
and generous types, become adequate to the purposes 
of real reflection. I think, when the child tells a lie of 
reflective import to lead another astray, — that is, with a
-P-A-G-E-310

social motive, not merely by mistake, through misunder- 
standing, or from concrete association,—then at any 
rate, however it may have been adumbrated in his earlier 
struggles, he takes his place as a social factor on the plane 
on which all intelligently social activities are displayed. 
This develops through speech with its verbal symbol- 
ism; the general province of speech pointed out above,! 
where it was considered as an aid to invention. Here 
we find that the invention which it aids is also social. 
The child becomes thinker of social thought; and all his 
later attainments, from the planning of a snowball-fight 
to the occupancy of the chair of the Speaker of the 
House, is a matter of detail He now illustrates the func- 
tion of private intelligence in social development; namely, 
as thinking the definite, communicable, and imitable thoughts 
which furnish the matter of social organization. 
177. The method of development, on the intellectual 
side, has led us to see just what relation the two classes 
of ends which we call selfish and altruistic have to each 
other. And it is interesting to recall the relation be- 
tween the impulses to self-assertion and generosity in 
the earlier period, in view of the further statement of 
these opposed tendencies now. We found that the emo- 
tional states exhibiting themselves in aggressive actions 
of an instinctive kind were the intrinsic outcome of the 
1 Chap. IV., § 1. 
2 The following illustrations of this all occurred in five minutes’ conversation 
when H. was just four years old. “Baby mustn’t have the pictures, she wants 
to tear them —that’s what she wants, mama.” — “Oh, mama! baby has the 
red book that papa said I couldn’t have —shall I take it away ?”—“I’m 
going to table with you, mama; but baby hears and she’ll want to go too— 
so we won’t talk about it now, mama.” These instances also illustrate the 
intelligent use of the social bond for private ends pointed out in Sect. 173. 
8 This is carried further in Chap. XII., on ‘Social Matter and Process.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
       Personal Intelligence 285 
child’s nature as a creature of hereditary adaptation; and 
the same is true on the side of the sympathetic impulses 
and emotions. These, latter represent the sort of ances- 
tral experience which involved co-operation and communal 
life, as in the family circle. Both, we found, were equally 
primitive; and both, inasmuch as they did not involve 
reasoning or self-determination of any kind, equally rea- 
sonable for the child to do; for in the case of each the 
concept of the reasonable did not get application at 
all. 
We now find a similar state of things at this higher 
or social stage of the use of intelligence. The child’s 
actions have become reasonable in so far as they are out- 
come of a process of personal self-conscious adaptation 
to social ends; and so now the question as to what acts 
are reasonable for him to perform, is a legitimate ques- 
tion. But the answer that we see, as the outcome of 
the child’s growth, still requires us to say that neither 
of the two kinds of action is reasonable to the exclusion 
of the other. For the thought which the child thinks 
leads to the type of action suitable to the realization of 
the end which this thought represents; and this is true 
both of the thought of the ego-self, with the train of 
selfish performances which it stimulates, and equally of 
the alter-self with its train of altruistic performances. In 
the one case, selfishness becomes reasonable to the child; 
and in the other case, generosity becomes reasonable. It 
would be unreasonable—in any adequate psychological 
sense of that term—for the child to be selfish when his 
thought of the self-ego is not the dominating factor in 
the emotional and impulsive state which leads him to 
act; and it would be equally unreasonable for him not to    
-P-A-G-E-312
    
    286 fits Intelligence 
be selfish when it does. His action conforms to the pat- 
tern of the present thought. 
But even at this stage, before we pass on into the 
development of the ethical and so-called ‘ideal’ states 
of mind as such, we should note the great complexity 
of the processes involved. Every dominating thought 
is a complex thing, a compromise, an adjustment. For 
the thought of the ego is, as we clearly saw, in the 
main the same in content as the thought of the alter; 
the differences are more external and extrinsic than the 
similarities. Given emergencies in life when the human 
as such is assailed, when our esprit de corps is called 
out, —as we see it called out in the child’s conscious- 
ness sometimes, —and we learn that ‘blood is thicker than 
water.’ The self-notion rises, in all its generic sublimity, 
and the differences of personal quality, habitation, physi- 
cal conformation, etc., disappear. So the state of mind, 
in each act for self or for another, is really a thing of 
emphasis rather than of essential variety in the thought 
process. The selfish act can be turned away by a gener- 
ous suggestion. The soft answer brings out the balance of 
the altruistic factor, and causes the motive to wrath to 
turn its back. Mere physical conditions are often enough 
to throw the balance on one side or on the other, in this 
delicate adjustment of claims. Or a personal presence 
may, simply by its intensity of reality, drive out a wicked 
intention, which the mere memory of the same intended 
victim did not suffice to keep down. How many crimes 
are planned among the images of imagination, which 
never get executed in the realm of fact; and alas, how 
many virtuous actions also! 
The real antithesis between reason and unreason, there-
-P-A-G-E-313
   Personal Intelligence 287 
fore, here as earlier, does not cut through consciousness 
at the line between the selfish and the generous, although 
in life the practical considerations are often so momen- 
tous that we assume that it does. Either of them may be 
reasonable on occasion, as we saw above. The real line 
lies between deliberation, reflection, and the lack of it. 
The question is in each case one of action: was there 
sufficient balance of tendency, sufficient self-continence, 
sufficient motor unity, to reflect a ‘reasonable’ show of 
intelligence? Or was the action on the other hand so 
dominated by suggestion, so led by the haste of the 
crowd, by the quick reaction of an emotional storm, by 
the sharp onset of a paralyzing desire, that no clear and 
steadily embraced end was present at all? That is the 
true distinction between what is reasonable and what is 
not. 
178. Then we find, also, when we recall the social func- 
tion of the intelligence, — the uses which the intelligence 
makes of the social suggestions and informations which 
come in its way, —that these suggestions may be turned 
to the profit of either of the two kinds of reasonable action. 
Just as it is sometimes reasonable or intelligent for the 
child to act for himself, in a selfish way, and then on 
another occasion it is equally reasonable for him to act 
for another, in a generous way; so either the one or the 
other of these kinds of intelligent action may make use 
of social factors as means to its end. The child may 
excite his father with the conscious end that he may join 
with him in a romp which is pleasurable for himself, the 
child; or he may do so to the end that the father may 
observe and clothe a poor boy whose hands are blue with 
cold. The latter, again, is as reasonable an action on the
-P-A-G-E-314
  288 fits Intelligence 
part of the child as the former is. And, further, when 
these factors come into conflict — when, for example, the 
child wishes to hand over his own gloves that the beggar’s 
hands may be warm, while his own grow cold,—that is 
reasonable as well; it shows the dominance of the alter 
thought and the active function which its dominance 
secures; to do the opposite, would be also reasonable on 
occasion, since it would involve the dominance of the ego 
thought. If the father thinks it is unreasonable for the 
boy to give the beggar his gloves, it is because the father 
is not thinking the son’s thought; the only way he can 
make it seem unreasonable to the boy is to secure in the 
boy the dominance of a different self-thought, either by 
showing him the grounds for that thought, as they lie in 
his own mind, or by the force of direct suggestion upon 
the child, as by command, example, injunction, etc. 
179. If these things are reasonable, then the function 
of the reason is to accomplish these things. And we are 
now able #o formulate a general conclusion as to the place of 
the intelligence in social development. The complexes of 
knowledge which the individual builds up are what, in 
the earlier chapters, we called ‘inventions’: the putting 
together of the elements of presentation so as to reach 
new interpretations on the basis of them. But the differ- 
ence between the inventions which involve only or mainly 
the forces and facts of nature, and those which involve 
social forces, are somewhat sharply marked. There is 
no invention without some social reference; we have seen 
that social reference is made by the inventor himself in 
every case. But when he is dealing with the objective 
world, his materials, the actual cast of the knowledge- 
elements in his thought, are socially neutral in themselves
-P-A-G-E-315
       Personal Intelligence 289 
But not so with the line of inventions which we have 
been tracing in this chapter. The child uses the self- 
notion at every step. He thinks with subjective mate- 
rials; and his knowledges are, in each case, interpretations 
of the way he expects persons to think and act. So he is 
now dealing with socal material —suggestions, actions, 
words, etc.—as such. The function of the intelligence in 
his social life is accordingly this: zt uses social materials 
and interprets them. Each individual in society has in 
himself a more or less adequate picture of the social play 
going on around him. He acts with reference to this 
play. He conforms his own actions to his expectation 
that others will understand him; and he directs his actions 
with the thought that he understands others. 
Intelligence, therefore, in its social activity, has for its 
Sunction invention with social material. This gives it a 
twofold importance, both aspects of which we have now 
considered. (1) It is a means of the individual’s own 
growth and an instrument for his use (Sects. 173 and 
179). And (2) it creates the thoughts which have cur- 
rency in society and become embodied in its institutions 
(Sect. 176). In this latter function, it has to do with 
co-operation as such. It is social co-operation become 
aware of itself. It represents, therefore, when its effects 
in the body social are considered as a whole, an engine of 
extraordinary and critical power. We have only to con- 
sider the mutuality of the exercise of intelligence in a 
community to see what intricacy its use may be expected 
to bring about in the history of social progress. I may 
be allowed to dwell upon this thought at a little more 
length. i 
180. The conception of mutuality or reciprocity has    
-P-A-G-E-316
   
    290 ffis Intelligence 
far-reaching implications. It has pressed in upon us at 
every stage of our inquiry. The family instincts are 
reciprocal; and their effectiveness depends directly on 
this element. Each instinct is shaped to fit into the same 
instinct in other individuals. This is what co-operation 
means. It is the essential meaning of family and gre- 
garious community life. Again, in the reactions of an 
emotional kind which we have considered — modesty, 
sympathy, play, etc. — the result is what it is because 
of their generality in the species and their mutual exercise 
by all the individuals. The very existence, indeed, of the 
phenomena is conditioned upon it. So always of all 
social equipment. 
The intelligence, to be socially available, must also be 
a thing of mutual exercise. But it is not so evidently 
so; and it is well to return upon our description of the 
social element in the work of the genius, to point out one 
of the phases of the mutuality. We found that the law 
of social heredity brought the genius under the require- 
ment that he have the kind of sanity of judgment which 
represents, in the main, the social judgment which is 
‘going’ in his time and place. His intellectual endow- 
ment, unless it is to go to waste from a social point of 
view, must not show too great a variation from the stand- 
ard or level which the social judgment erects. This in- 
troduces a social element, an element of mutuality, or 
reciprocity, into the very endowment which we call reason 
or intelligence. The lines of development of judgment 
itself, on its sesthetic and teleological side, are lines of 
common action; and in his very preferences the actor is 
moving in paths of least social no less than least personal 
resistance. In short, every individual in society is in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
       
    
      
   
               Social Intelligence 291 
measure—and the measure frequently measures his com- 
petence and influence — the organ of the social movement 
which conserves tradition, sets public opinion, and reacts 
upon his sense of values and upon his preferences, inciting 
him to work, think, fight for institution, country, and social 
ideal. ; 
It is on account of this more recondite and intimate 
element of mutuality that the individual welcomes the 
more open and practical reciprocity of suggestion which 
he actually finds in the environment, all through the 
course of his personal growth. We have seen the extent 
of this latter. He finds the lessons of the actions of 
others actually available and convertible into his thought 
of self; he finds it possible to understand what the 
actions of others mean; he is able to anticipate their 
conduct by happy guesses, drawn from analogies of his 
own feeling; and he finally comes to depend so confi- 
dently upon the constancy and regularity of the simi- 
larities between his own inner life and the life of others 
that he is able to bend their actions to his own personal 
ends. This has now been sufficiently described. 
        
        
  
        § 4. Social Intelligence 
   181. We should remember that there is always a tradi- 
tion element, and, besides, a personal element, in every 
situation of social import into which the individual comes. 
The tradition element represents the use which others have 
made, or are making, of their intelligence as its gains are 
handed down; the personal element represents the use 
which the individual is making of his. And in the mass 
of suggestive copies, rules, conventions, styles, etc., which      
          
       
-P-A-G-E-318
   
    292 flis Intelligence 
  sum up, in any particular case, the tradition element, 
there is also the second or personal element not his own, 
corresponding to the particular personal source through 
which the tradition is administered to the individual. 
There are differences of temperament, character, personal 
mood, methods of thought, among the associates of each 
individual, and to these he is keenly alive; they tend to 
check his action and to secure differential attitudes when 
his action is finally led forth. This leads, in the child, 
to a further development of certain zdea/ selves in his 
thought, whose origin, in the conflicting phases of sugges- 
tion, we explored (Sects. 16 ff.) when discussing the origin 
of the ethical sense. This progress of his is of essential 
moment, both in his personal development and in the 
social complex in which he plays a part. 
The sense to which he now attains may be likened 
crudely to a composite photograph. The variety of per- 
sonalities about him, each impressing him with some one 
or more peculiarities, exaggerations, deficiencies, inconsist- 
encies, or law-observing regularities, gradually leave upon 
him a certain common impression which, while getting ap- 
plication to all personalities as such, yet has to have sup- 
plementing in the case of any particular individual. I 
have traced above, in treating of the ethical sense, certain 
of the emotional tendencies which this general personality 
arouses ; and the topic recurs later on when we come to con- 
sider the sentiments which the social agent brings to his 
life-tasks. It is enough for us now to see that this 
general notion of personality does arise in the child’s 
mind, and to inquire into the method of his intelligent 
use of it. 
182. He ‘ejects’ it into all the fellows of his social
-P-A-G-E-319
    
Social Intelligence 293 
group. It becomes then a general alter, a sort of speaking 
social companion on whose characteristics as a thinking, 
feeling, approving, criticising agent he stumbles whenever 
he meets his fellow-man. And, further, he cannot sever 
this bond nor escape its hold; for his thought of his own 
ego is always an illustration of its reality, just as much 
as is any other person. The latter he may avoid; but his 
own presence he cannot avoid; nor can he rid himself 
of the thought of himself. So the thought of himself 
stands also for the thought of the general ‘other’ of society ; 
and he must share the field with him, hear his opinions, 
feel reciprocal emotions with him, etc., whenever he thinks. 
This shadowy being, the general self, is his other in the 
realest possible way. We call the evidence which we have 
of its presence ‘ public opinion,’ Zeztgezst, etc., and we find 
ourselves actually responding to its existence by having a 
great and powerful set of emotions directed toward it. 
The practical value of this thought of general person- 
ality, in our every-day life, shows itself whenever the atti- 
tude of the ego thought is at variance with this general 
thought. The discrepancy is felt most acutely. It is 
during the formation of this contrast that the child begins 
to show those states of mind which arise in consequence 
of his subsequent reflection on his own actions. All the 
states covered by the terms ‘repentance,’ ‘self-reproach,’ 
‘personal regret,’ ‘ personal disappointment,’ ‘ remorse,’ etc., 
arise then, and must arise then. They could not arise 
sooner, because the child did not have sooner the antithe- 
sis in the thought he thinks which might issue in the 
double stream of personal tendency which consciousness 
shows at these times. It is a new stage of thought before 
it can be a new stage of emotion. 
   
-P-A-G-E-320
  294 ffis Intelligence 
183. It is also a new stage in the management of the 
social forces. It is the child’s deepening hold upon these 
that gives intelligence its place and power. So the other 
aspects of this growth in reflective thought may be passed 
by now, in order that we may look more closely at this. 
The child applies his intelligence directly in making use 
of this thought of a general self; he uses it as means 
to his own ends, and also as end when it suits him. This 
appears from certain situations which I may mention, know- 
ing that the observer of children may readily verify them. 
The child’s intercourse with other children shows direct 
attempts, on his part, to assume the part of lawgiver, and 
hold his playfellows up to the requirements of the code 
which he finds it possible to prescribe. This code is the 
application to each situation, as it arises, of the general 
sense of the requirements of the ideal or social self, as far 
as there are in his actual experience analogies upon which 
he can go. He repeats the current moral maxims of the 
family life whenever he thinks they get application.) For 
example, I am accustomed to keep in check the tendency 
of my children to hasty action and intellectual guessing 
by telling them in critical junctures or situations — such 
as the opening of a package after a trip to the city —to 
‘wait and see.’ This became a formula to the younger of 
the children in her fourth year. She not only learned, in 
a measure, the uselessness of haste, but she took my 
place, in the games and on many more serious occasions, 
and urged upon the other children, nurse, etc., to ‘ wait 
and see.’ It was her sense of the proper attitude of 
a wise and judicious personality, in anxious and exciting 
situations, to await the outcome with calmness; and the 
way she brought the injunction in for the benefit of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  
  Social Intelligence 295 
other children was amusing in the extreme. This example 
shows the general tendency of which I speak. No sooner 
does an aspect of personal behaviour, shown in word, in- 
junction, suggestion, or action, get some generalization, so 
as to apply to a variety of instances, than the child seizes 
upon it and makes it a weapon of social use.1 Under the 
show of benevolence the child often hides little intrigues. 
H., when five years of age, hid her own pictures and then 
took her sister’s in order to ‘arrange’ them for her. 
The employment of such formulas for the securing of 
personal advantage over others is very common. (Chil- 
dren playing together will often themselves suggest the 
device of ‘taking turns,’ in order to satisfy the sense of 
justice and equal rights which is rising within them. ) But 
I have known one of mine to go further. H. has often 
(fifth to sixth year) secured the ownership of an article of 
play by the device of suggesting that she have the first 
turn, and then afterwards suggesting that the game be 
changed, or that the sides be reversed. (Moreover, a child 
of five or six years will often take advantage of a younger 
companion’s limited insight into personality, or of the other’s 
susceptibility to suggestions of desire, by placing a loud 
verbal value on an article which he does not want, in order 
to arouse the sense of value in the younger child, and thus, 
by leading off the scent, secure the possession of some 
coveted thing from which the attention of the playmate is

regularly together ~we have not only the growth in one 
of the children, the eldest say, of a sense of the general 
attributes of character, the essentials of character as such, 
but also a remarkably acute estimate of the state of the 
other children’s minds in this respect. A will know what 
B thinks of character and of A’s character; and A will 
act toward B with insight into the limitations of B’s sense 
of A’s character. The moral adjustment of my two children 
to each other as they are both growing up into the sense 
of the general self, one some way in advance of the 
other, is a source of great instruction. As the elder 
grows to understand character better, she practises her 
new knowledge constantly on her sister. But this very 
practice, by which the elder often seeks to circumvent 
the younger, is an influence of pedagogical value to the 
little one. Her lessons in the meaning of personality, in 
the use of intelligence, in the ways that people may be 
used for personal ends, are set by all the childish schemes 
of her sister, instead of by the examples of her elders, for 
which she would otherwise have to wait. Here is one of 
the great benefits to the child of many companions and 
constant companionship. 
184. Another phase of the same class of situations is 
brought out when we inquire into the two forms— egoistic 
and altruistic — which the child’s use of his intelligence in 
this way takes on. From the instances which I have cited 
immediately above, and from those cases given earlier, 
in which the methods of the child’s lies were illustrated, 
it would seem that the egoistic use of the intelligence 
is more striking than the altruistic. And in spite of 
what was said above to the effect that the two personal 
attitudes are on a basis of equality, and that as far as
-P-A-G-E-323
   Social Intelligence 297 
reasonable action is concerned, both are equally reasonable 
or unreasonable, we find appearances taking on a some- 
what different form at this further stage in the child’s 
progress. It is evident that even in the earlier stage, in 
which both of the attitudes are unreflective, one of them 
might, as a matter of fact, be the prevailing or usual one, 
especially if there were no adequate expression of the 
other in the situations of the personal environment. I 
think the egoistic impulses do tend more constantly to 
fill consciousness, even at the unreflective period, since 
the child is so new to thought, and the trend of the 
organic period from which he has so freshly emerged is 
toward the preservation and satisfaction of his private 
tendencies. This drift has to be in some degree overcome 
before his thought of the alter can come so strongly to 
consciousness as to lead to regular self-denial. The 
organism secures this, in a measure, as we have seen, by 
the provision of organic sympathy and modesty ; and yet, 
except when these are actually discharging, the bent of 
action seems to be toward those forms of action which, in 
their reflex effects, tend to keep the thought of the pri- 
vate self more prominently before the contemplation of 
the budding individual. So we should expect to find the 
progress of the child toward generosity and justice and 
mutual fairness, in the use of that engine of means to 
ends, the intelligence, somewhat handicapped by the less 
developed forms of action which he inherits from his own 
personal past. 
This is borne out, in several ways, I think, in the actual 
behaviour of children at this difficult period, when the ten- 
dencies toward real personality are just beginning to show 
themselves. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
298 ffis Intelligence 
(1) The child’s inventions in the management of other 
personalities and of social forces are prompted more 
largely by his sense of personal advantage or disadvan- 
tage. It is true of all invention, that it is the most 
urgent situations which bring out the most effective 
thought; and this is the case with the child. Sympathy 
may be abolished by the simple expedient of withdrawing 
the gaze, or refusing to attend. We adults know this. 
But personal pain cannot be escaped so easily. The child 
finds his personal collisions with others vital and pungent 
with pain and pleasure. It is his own interest which is 
so often in the balance. It is not so moving when it is 
the interest of another for whom his sympathies are 
excited. So the former case has an urgency which brings 
out his violent and resisting, or evasive, or scheming, or 
dissembling actions, on occasion, as well as his truthfully 
direct and franker ones. We do not often find the child 
scheming to secure an advantage for the sister and 
brother as he schemes for himself. When he does, it is 
normal, to be sure; but it rather surprises us. Differ- 
ent children differ in this respect, and cases sometimes 
seem to show that a child may be more active on the side 
of generosity than of self-aggression; yet generally it is 
the contrary; and the fact simply shows that while both 
attitudes are equally possible, and from the child’s point 
of view equally reasonable, yet the selfish attitude is 
liable to prevail. 
(2) There is reason for this, also, in the method of his 
progress toward ethical and social standing. He must 
be personally efficient in order to be socially efficient. 
Man must live and accumulate for himself and his family 
1 See the instance of an inventive social lie given above, Sect. 71.
-P-A-G-E-325
      Social Intelligence 299 
before he can be a public servant. And in the child’s life 
this means that he is to become a man, at all events, 
whatever else he may become. He must grow up to be 
an individual; that is incumbent on him at all hazards; 
what more he may attain in the way of being a good or 
wise or social individual is based on this first presuppo- 
sition. 
(3) This is reflected, moreover, in the movement by 
which his inner development proceeds. It will be remem- 
bered that we found the child going through three stages 
of personal thought, called ‘projective’ (his sense of others 
before he distinguishes between them and himself), then 
‘subjective’ (his sense of himself as distinguished from 
others), then ‘ejective’ (the sense of others as like him- 
self). These three thoughts, we had occasion to say, are 
not strictly chronological; the dialectic movement be- 
tween the first and the second, and between the second 
and the third, being a constant process all through life. 
But the logical order is that named; and it is also a 
chronological order when looked at from the point of 
view of the accretions which the child constantly makes 
to the thought of self. The new elements which he ac- 
quires from the environment must be first projective 
before he can duplicate them in his thought of himself; 
that is, before he can realize them subjectively. And 
then they cannot be ejective until after he has made them 
his own in the subjective way. So there is a real chrono- 
logical movement which takes these three phases. 
The point of importance in this connection is that, in 
this quasi-chronological movement, the thought of the 
subjective self stands midway between the other two 
thoughts. It is the nucleus of which he is permanently 
       
-P-A-G-E-326
  300 Lis Intelligence 
possessed. It is the measure by which he tests persons. 
The unknown elements of personal suggestion which claim 
his attention must have already the signs which he finds 
in his own thought; and, on the other hand, the known 
elements of personality which he attributes to those about 
him must have gone through the testing processes of his 
own more or less experimental action. So there is a con- 
stant return upon his own ego thought from both the poles 
of this two-membered relationship. This being the case, 
we should not be surprised that his sense of his own exist- 
ence, rights, appetites, pleasures, pains, property, etc., 
should be keener than his sense of the similar passions 
and possessions of other persons. 
(4) There is yet another reason for this fact. In this 
threefold thought of personal elements, the actual alter 
comes last, considered as a finished person, with an inde- 
pendent existence, and independent rights under the social 
bond. Each new accretion to the whole complex personal 
sense has its first application, in action, to the real ego. 
It is only by this active appropriation of the suggestions 
from the environment, that the growth seen in the dialectic 
process can go on at all. So the method of getting the 
attitudes which come to stand for the relations of personal 
agents brings them into more or less habitual exercise first 
in connection with the more private life of the ego. The 
generalization of the sense of personality really involves 
something of a new process of accommodation, which 
must be made first of all by the thinker to whom they are 
personal. 
For example, our attitudes for self-defence are simpler 
and more direct than those for the defence of another 
or of several persons. Just as it is easier to hold an 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
         Social Intelligence 301 
umbrella over one than over two,—no matter how large 
the umbrella may be, — so it is easier to strike an attitude 
of self-defence than to interpose in an effective way to 
shield some one else. Apart from any literal meaning 
attaching to such examples drawn from our adult lives, 
we may still use them as analogies in our present discus- 
sion. The self-preservative actions are more reflex, as was 
seen above on the purely physical side. The child’s atti- 
tudes are set first by his life-adaptations of instinct, 
thought, and emotion; and the extending of these to in- 
clude the welfare of others involves some modification 
and extension of them. The simple fact that the thought 
of self, when it has become ejective, is more complex and 
involved, makes it clear that it must be a little later and 
less spontaneous in its modes of expression and action. 
There is, therefore, a period of relative selfishness in 
the child extending from the third into the fifth or sixth 
years! It is an incident in his growth. It is different 
both from the unreflective and spontaneous aggressive 
period, before the child becomes aware of himself as 
a personal agent, and also from the real reflective self- 
ishness which comes to be one of his moving principles 
when he grows to enough maturity to think out schemes 
for his own advantage at the expense of the interests of 
1Jt is not at all difficult to imagine the place the sort of semi-reflective 
cunning and craft corresponding to this must have played in the conditions 
of early social life. The treachery of ambush and broken truce, existing side 
by side with internal tribal organization and inter-tribal unions for defence, 
based on ‘duties and rights’ —as for example in’ the experience of the early 
settlers with the North American Indians —shows both sides of this mental 
condition. It involves both the factors required in the process of ‘group- 
selection’: some sociality, with competition (see Chap. V., § 4). Indeed a 
chapter might be written on the critical utility of advancing intelligence in 
the competition of social groups with one another. 
     
    
-P-A-G-E-328

  others. It is, rather, a period of naive cunning and sub- 
terfuge. It is not real craft, nor deliberate plotting; and 
wherein the child seems to be a victim of ‘original sin,’ 
this is about all his sin. He has certain unorganized 
impulses of an organic kind, which, simply from their lack 
of organization and their tendency to be reflex, get the 
credit of being bad; and with them he has, on the mental 
side, the quasi-reflective selfish tendencies just described, 
which, if not actually immoral, are going on very fast to 
be so. 
185. Coming to consider further the actual attainment 
of reflection by the child, we find the transition ten- 
dencies already remarked upon taking form in a complex 
and most elusive result. It is elusive because its descrip- 
tion cannot be a matter of general statement in brief for- 
mulas; it is a series of phases each of which represents 
a host of more elementary forces. The preceding investi- 
gation of these earlier tendencies gives us, however, as far 
as it is true, the main lines of influence to which the child 
is still to respond in the environment, and with them also 
the main lines of tendency which his responses take on. 
It is by his natural growth, whereby he becomes reflective 
and ethical, that he escapes the relatively egotistic use of 
his intelligence described in this chapter. His further 
progress we shall discuss under the head of ‘ Sentiment.’   
-P-A-G-E-329
CHAPTER VIII 
His SENTIMENTS 
WE have reached a point of view, in the preceding 
discussions, which gives us an outlook upon those impor- 
tant aspects of human life which are called sentiments. 
We need not stop to justify any psychological definition 
of sentiment; it is only necessary to say what we mean 
by sentiment and what its place is in our scheme of social 
phenomena. 
§ 1. The Genesis of Sentiment 
186. We have seen the child’s mind showing a finer 
sort of appreciation of the meaning of the actions of 
his social fellows, as he grows into the more adequate 
realization of personality ; and we have found him gradu- 
ally forming a thought of self which is above the exam- 
ples of personality which men as individuals show. He 
reaches on to an ideal self, which represents his best 
accommodation to self in general; the regular, law-abid- 
ing, sanction-bringing, duty-observing self hovers over 
his thought, inspires it, and regulates its tendencies to 
action. I say that it represents his accommodations, 
since, as we have been seeing all along, it is by his 
action on the ‘copies’ which he gets that he realizes 
and interprets their meaning in his own growth. } This | 
general notion of self is, like all general notions con- 
sidered as general, not a presentation, not a mental con- 
303 
   
-P-A-G-E-330
  304 fTis Sentiments 
tent, but an attitude, a way of acting; and the child 
has to bring all the partial personal tendencies to action 
which spring up on the thought of the partial more 
isolated selves of his habit, into the way of action which 
we call ethical conduct. The growth of the ethical sense 
is a growth in motor accommodation. Viewed on the 
side of what it has already hardened into, on the side 
of habit, it shows the man’s or the child’s actual morality, 
his degree of actual conformity to the ethical ideal; and, 
viewed on the side of the ideal itself, its unrealized part, 
its tendency to perfect lawfulness and complete submis- 
sion without revolt, it shows his obligation.! 
187. Of course both of these phases tend to terminate 
on actual persons; all attitudes have to have objective 
termini. The child’s actual mental picture of what is 
good in a person is made up from his own acts and 
the acts which he conceives as possibly his own; this — 
is the concrete body of his ethical ideal. And then, 
so far as he feels it to be inadequate, he seeks to find, 
in the persons projective to him, some one or more 
whose actions are better than his. This means ‘better’ in 
the vague undefined way that all ‘projective’ experience 
must be. He knows that the father, for example, is good 
in the way that he understands goodness; but he feels 
that the father is also better, in the goodness which is his 
alone, z.¢., which the child cannot yet understand nor illus- 
trate by his own acts or thought. 
Now this latter aspect of his attitude is, I think, what 
we mean by sentiment: it is the emotional or active 
tendency of consciousness away beyond the confines of 
1Cf. the latter parts of Chaps. I. and VII. with which the sections im- 
mediately following make close connection.   
-P-A-G-E-331
      
    The Genesis of Sentiment 305 
its actual interpretations. It represents the further drift 
of habit toward its own completion; it is the way we 
discount, in feeling, our own future progress in personal 
attainment and growth. It is essentially ‘prospective’ 
in its nature. Just as we get the thought of the ego 
as a fact, as a thing which is, by a growth upon which 
we are able to look back in retrospect, and say, ‘this is 
my history; here is the road which I have travelled up 
to personality, and to my social place;’ so we get the 
ego that is to be, that ‘ought to be,’ by a prophecy of 
similar growth along the same path. We hie us onward 
by anticipation. We long to think of other men as 
being further on, and we give them reverence by turn- 
ing toward them the sentiments which stand in us as 
the guerdon of our hopes. Imitation runs through it 
all; imitation is, indeed, the essential method of growth 
in this active stretch of our energies toward the ideal.1 
For the interpretations which our past actions express 
were secured by the imitative absorption of the personal. 
suggestive copies of the social environment; and the 
projective part of the ideal set us by others is, in so 
far as we picture it at all, a reconstruction, in an imita- 
tive way, of the same material. And when the actor 
goes on to attain the new growth which brings him 
further towards the ideal, it is again by actually finding 
in the social circle better illustrations of righteousness, 
beauty, etc., which he takes to himself by imitation. 
This I need not enlarge upon. But the actual phases 
1In my Handbook of Psychology, 11., p. 201 f., I have defined ideals as: “the 
forms which we feel our conceptions would take if we were able to realize in 
them a satisfying degree of unity, harmony, significance, and universality.” In 
the province of ‘ideals’ we have the general class of ‘zsthetic inventions’ 
referred to above (Sect. 112). See also Thought and Things, Chap. X., § 81.

    306 fis Sentiments 
  of the sentiments which thus arise about. the ideal 
growth of personality may now claim some attention; 
since they will be seen in the sequel to be factors of 
the greatest importance in the organization and progress 
of society. 
§ 2. Ethical Sentiment 
188. The most general and important phase of ethical 
sentiment is that known in theoretical ethics as the 
sense of obligation. Defining this sense, in general, as 
' we have found it right to do (Sect. 29, note 2), as the 
sense of the lack of unity in the highest region of motor 
function, we may point out a little more fully its mode 
of working and its bearings in the mental and social life. 
The growing habit which is seen in the thought of 
an ideal self stands as the goal of assimilation for the 
partial expressions of personality issuing in particular self- 
ish or generous actions. The fact, however, that these 
particular actions are not inhibited or modified in view 
of the ideal, but get performed in spite of the need of 
further co-ordination and assimilation to the ideal copy, 
is felt as a state of tension and lack of equilibrium, 
which accounts for the real antithesis of tendencies which 
appears in every ethical situation. The sense of obli- 
gation brings to consciousness two antithetical thoughts 
of personality: that of the self as it stands, more or 
less complete in habit, with its well-known tendencies 
to action; and over against this the sense of the ideal 
self, the being perhaps tefmporarily embodied in father, 
priest, or whoever-else, the better self from whose actions 
the copy is to come for the further reduction of the self- 
ishly or generously capricious self to order and good-
-P-A-G-E-333
     Ethical Sentiment 307 
ness. I feel that I ought to be like the better person; 
and even though I cannot see how this better person 
will act. in this case or that, yet I have enough of a 
habit of submission to him, or enough reverence for his 
ideals, to feel my personal actions tending to lose their 
independence and their adequacy in my own eyes. In 
the mind of the child, this sense of ‘oughtness’ arises 
in a very interesting way, as soon as he has learned to 
obey in measure sufficient to set the habit of submission 
on its feet; for, in so doing, the beginning of assimila- 
tion to the larger copy set by the injunction of another 
is secured; and on that basis, the further growth may 
be expected to proceed by the internal injunction which 
this very tendency to a larger assimilation creates. 
From the first, this growing sense of obligation is a 
social thing in several ways; and our development requires 
their statement even at the risk of some repetition of the 
intimations made in the earlier pages. 
189. I. Ln the first place, the leading-string in the child’s 
ethical growth is, all the time, the presence of other per- 
sons from whom the ‘word of command’ and the sugges- 
tion and example of goodness, directly come. The very 
strenuousness of command at first breaks in upon his 
personal capricious reactions, and so starts his sense of 
a larger order. Then the constant teachings of the 
actions of others, their conduct toward each other, to 
which the child comes. as a curious spectator, their ways 
of leading him out into his imitations, and their com- 
ments upon the interpretations which he makes when he 
comes to act more complexly for himself, all this—in 
this sphere as in the wider sphere of personal attainment 
in general, in which we have already traced the influ-   
  
-P-A-G-E-334
    
    
   
                                                                                308 fits Sentiments 
ences which he experiences— stimulates, confirms, and 
controls his growth. Further, he finds two social ways 
of showing his progress. He constantly exhibits his 
attainments in this direction, as in others—that first; 
and then he lays down the crude law of his own right- 
eousness to the other children, and even seeks occasion 
to find his elders violating what they have taught him. 
(My child says to me at the dinner table: ‘Papa, what 
do you do with your hands while you are waiting?’ or, 
‘Papa, you should take off your hat in the house.’ This 
is a natural and necessary movement in the growth of 
the ethical sense. It indicates that the child’s sense 
that my assimilation of the self of habit, the self which 
he has ejected outward and lodged in me, must go on 
just as his does; and that the conduct of this myself-of- 
habit which does not show proper reduction to the grow- 
ing ideal of a self ‘ought’ not to act as it does. The two 
applications of this ‘ought not’—that to me and that to 
him —are not really two; they are one; for the very 
exhibition of self to which the ought-not applies is the 
same in me as in him. 
This latter it is which gives its social value to the 
experience. It elevates the social basis of the emotions, 
and attitudes generally, right up into the ethical sphere, 
and shows the moral sense to be essentially a social thing. 
The child’s exhibitions of his morality, and his require- 
ment that we shall recognize and confirm them by our- 
selves conforming to them, is an outlet for the intimate 
and hidden movement of his growth. Without this social 
appeal and its consequences, he could not be sure of his 
progress, or have that sense of social security in his 
judgments which makes his morality really a part of the
-P-A-G-E-335
    Ethical Sentiment 309 
world morality. In short, what, on this subjective side, is 
a spontaneous appeal. of the child to the social environ- 
ment for confirmation and support, is on the objective side 
evidence that the child is growing under direct social con- 
-trol. His attainments in morality represent at each stage 
a social level or stratum. As far as he does not thus keep 
his head up, the waves of social influence may go over him 
and swamp him. 
190. II. The second general social feature of the child's 
subjective ethical experience is seen in the possibility of his 
further progress at any time. As he gets more adequate 
views of morality, and incorporates them in his own self- 
sense, under stress of the sense of obligation, his sense of 
the ideal grows too. His obligations, instead of diminish- 
ing, only increase. 
This is again a social phenomenon; and we have seen 
the ground of it in the remarks made above on the imita- 
tive character of the ideal standards which consciousness 
sets up. In order to grow, the ethical sense, like every- 
thing else, must be fed; and itsonly food is personal 
food, social food. The child can gain new levels only 
provided society show the strata which these new levels 
represent. He must have relationships which give him 
room to do right, if he would do right; and the very 
sense that he should do right can get its growth only in 
the environment in which it has higher illustrations already. 
As a matter of fact, the young child’s ethical environ- 
ment is usually so far ahead of him that he is drawn on 
by strides. His sense of an ideal self is fed so constantly 
in all his social relationships that his learning is limited 
only by his own power of assimilating ‘copy.’ This is 
the normal case; the actual way that the child gets his
-P-A-G-E-336
  310 fits Sentiments 
ethical sense. The further question as to what kind of 
an ethical sense he gets, and what its variations are for 
good or bad in consequence of variations either in physi- 
cal or social heredity, —that is not now before us. 
These two social features of personal growth have had 
so much emphasis in the earlier discussions of the child’s 
progress, that it is sufficient to have suggested them in 
this connection as applicable to the ethical sense as well. 
There are certain aspects of the case, however, which get 
further value from the objective point of view, —that 
which looks upon society from the outside rather than 
from the individual’s own personal experience, —and I 
wish to set them in evidence at this point, again giving 
résumés of earlier positions for the sake of the special 
ethical applications. 
191. The objective social bearings of the ethical sense 
come under the wide class of facts which we have con- 
sidered under the phrase ‘social heredity.’ By this, it 
will be remembered, we designated the mass of organized 
tradition, custom, usage, social habit, etc., which is already 
embodied in the institutions and ways of acting, thinking, 
etc., of a given social group, considered as the normal 
heritage of the individual child. And it is at once seen 
that the lines of theory which have been already laid 
down for the interpretation of this group of phenomena 
(Chapter II.) must include and explain the content of 
ethical tradition and custom; for they also involve rela- 
tionships which the individual must grow up to inherit and 
maintain. From this point of view we get a view of race 
solidarity and progress analogous to that already reached 
in the lower spheres of emotion and instinct. This is evi- 
dent in the following ways : —
-P-A-G-E-337
  Ethical Sentiment 311 
192. (1) The physical heredity of a man represents a 
compromise, as we have seen, between organization, on 
the one hand, and plasticity on the other. The organiza- 
tion element fits him for the instinctive actions and atti- 
tudes which have grown up as useful in race-history, and 
have not been superseded by the activities of the later 
periods. So in the case of emotion, we found that certain 
emotional expressions which were to be accounted for 
as utility reactions in a simpler and different environment, 
still survived in whole or in part in the realm of intelli- 
gence and social organization, and were still associated 
with the same kind of mental experience as formerly, 
except that they now serve higher social and intelligent 
purposes as well. Whatever of the organic period the 
progress in the new directions did not efface, this was 
left. Where it was useless, it became vestigial, as the 
showing of the teeth, lifting of the hair, etc., in certain 
emotional seizures; and where it was useful, if only for 
the purposes of expression itself, there it remained, both 
to bear witness to the utilities under which it originated, 
and also to those for which its new stimulations call it out. 
Blushing has been shown to have arisen in this way, and 
to have survived, in spite of the apparent inutility of it in 
socially organized society; and that the ethical sentiment 
requires the same theory on this point is shown by the 
fact that ethical shame brings the same blush that physi- 
cal shame does. 
But that these survivals are really a compromise be- 
tween the two tendencies represented by personal growth 
on the one hand, and social organization on the other 
hand, is evident from the modifications which they have 
undergone. Most detailed instincts of the animal world 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
        Bs 
312 fits Sentiments d 
have entirely disappeared in man. ‘He has, at the best, a 
lot of so-called impulses which merely show the direction of 
his former adaptations without leading him to carry them 
out. They are the merest fragments of instincts, each 
a torso; none can find its adequate expression in un- 
inhibited discharge. All the newer requirements of social 
and dawning ethical life call upon the organism to 
develop self-control, to make itself docile, to forget the 
violent, straight-away kinds of action which formerly 
characterized it; to become, in short, intelligent, delibera- 
tive, volitional, social. This means the snubbing of in- 
stinct, the putting of a premium upon the sort of heredity 
which produces creatures who could and would learn new 
adaptations by social means. This is what is meant by 
plasticity ;1 and the hands in which the child must be 
plastic, the hands which mould him, 7 he is to become 
ethical, are the hands of society. 
As a matter of fact, in this highest sphere of personal 
development —the ethical sphere —there seems to be 
very little natural heredity, and a great deal of plasticity ; 
in short, a great deal of social heredity. Apart from the 
characteristic temperamental differences which denote 
individuality, the setzments are common to social equals. 
The children are at first forced into conformity to the 
rules of conduct of society; and by this forced submission 
the habits are begun which they afterwards cultivate by 
their own imitative responses to the further examples, 
precepts, regulations, etc., of the social environment. 
193. (2) In the fact of plasticity, in this high ethical 
sphere, we find, therefore, the real bond between the 
social whole and the individual. As the child grows up,

under the influence of teacher, friend, companion, his 
spontaneous reflections and judgments agree, in the main, 
with those of his social mz/éeu. His ethical insight, as his 
intellectual inventiveness, — only much more, — is limited 
by his limitations of social growth. And since these limi- 
tations are set by the system of influences which bear 
in upon him in the social group, and which he cannot 
transcend, his own opinions and judgments are as strictly 
a matter of general acceptance as if he and others had 
been born with a set of ready-made ethical intuitions in 
common. But it is because these so-called intuitions 
are progressive things, that society and the individual 
in society do not stand still in the ethical life any 
more absolutely than in the intellectual, or in the 
purely social life. Ethical phenomena are phenomena 
of organization, —that is, in their origin, —and the soli- 
darity of the results, the apparent universality of ethical 
sentiment, is due to the fact that this sentiment is a thing 
of common and united attainment. It is in society be- 
cause it is in ag the individuals; but it is in each indi- 
vidual because it is already in society. It is one of 
those genetic circles by which nature so often works 
out her development problems. Of course we must not 
leave ut the actual increments of progress which the 
individuals make, the ways in which the best individuals 
improve upon the lessons which they learn from society, 
and so go on, in turn, to teach society; but that is apart 
from the topic of our present interest, —the topic which 
we set ourselves when we inquire into the individual's 
method of attaining to ethical sentiment and character. 
The point here is that he learns his ethical lessons from 
society; and that means that he learns them from his  
-P-A-G-E-340
  314 fits Sentiments 
ancestors to the same extent that he would if they were 
knit into his original endowment; and further, that they 
are of the same general and universal character as if they 
had been imposed by some authority upon both the indi- 
vidual and society, instead of coming by the natural process 
of learning and growth. 
194. This solidarity, in the ethical realm, of the indi- 
vidual and his social fellows may be shown by the ex- 
amination of a claim recently made by Mr. Huxley in his 
well-known Romanes Address, already referred to. Mr. 
Huxley’s point, put in social terms, is that if the ethical 
sense were the outcome of social relationships, then obliga- 
tion’ would attach equally to both the sorts of action which 
the ethical sense takes cognizance of, z.e., we should feel 
obligation to perform the bad in which society indulges, 
equally with the good. Put in genetic terms, this objec- 
tion would read somewhat like this: if the sense of obli- 
gation arise from the lack of assimilation of new elements 
to old categories of actions, — of new actions to old habits, 
—then all such cases of lack of assimilation should give 
the sense of obligation. How, then, do we come to say 
that we are under obligation to perform certain established 
actions, and under equal obligation to avoid others which 
are equally well established ? 
This objection holds, I think, as against the theories of 
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Spencer which Mr. Huxley prob- 
ably had before his mind; and it is the same objection to’ 
those theories which we also have had occasion to urge 
above.! But it does not hold against all genetic theories 
of the ethical sentiment. If we account for the rise of 
the sense of obligation in terms of lack of assimilation, 
1 Above, Chap. I., § 2 (Sect. 20).
-P-A-G-E-341
Ethical Sentiment 315 
pure and simple, then of course all such lack of assimila- 
tion should produce it. But that is not the true account. 
For example, if a new action did not assimilate to my ego 
sense, then it would be obligatory upon me to make it 
assimilate, or to avoid doing it; and if another action did 
not assimilate with my altruistic self-sense, then the same 
of that. This would at once introduce contradiction and 
confusion into the life of the child; and this state of 
things zs actually realized in the life of the child before real 
ethical obligation dawns upon him ; it is the simple fact of 
suggestibility. The child does feel impelled to do every 
action on both sides. A selfish action arouses his selfish- 
ness, and a generous action his generosity. It is:-only 
the concrete cropping out of the general law which has 
become embodied in the, tendency to imitate. 
And further, we may concede to Mr. Huxley that 
this state of things is a necessary stepping-stone to real 
morality. 
Yet the fact is that we do not call moral this general 
call to act by imitation, to assimilate every kind of action 
indiscriminately; and for the simple reason, that if. all 
acts are moral, then none are —we have no need for the 
category ‘moral’ at all. I think, indeed, the state of things 
which Mr. Huxley depicts is universal in the animal 
world; especially striking is it in the gregarious animals, 
where ‘He antithesis between unreflective egoism and 
sociality is well marked. These animals have, no doubt, 
a very strong sense of the impelling character of actions 
of both kinds. And it seems to me that the ethical 
theories which base the sense of obligation only on these 
instincts signally fail, as Mr. Huxley says, to account for 
the fact that our human ethical sense does distinguish 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
316 fits Sentiments 
between acts which ought to be done and acts, equally 
impelling by physical or social impulsion, which ought not 
to be done. We have one sense of obligation which covers 
both the positive and the negative instances. Mr. Huxley 
seems to think that no further statement of natural his- 
tory factors can account for this;! and he gives up the 
solution from an evolution point of view, except to leave 
open the door for ‘spontaneous variations,’ which may 
bring morality in. 
In this opinions may differ, as may be inferred from 
the foregoing. The child’s imitative growth into a sense 
of ideal personality sets a higher category of action than 
either of the two concrete categories recognized by Darwin, 
Spencer,? and the naturalists generally, z.2., those of spon- 
taneous egoism and equally spontaneous generosity or sym- 
pathy. It is in the higher realm of assimilation, where it 
is a question of the assimilation of a new action alterna- 
tively to a higher or to a lower® category of habit, that the 
sense of ethical obligation really takes its rise. The child 
feels the impulsion of all examples, both the selfish and 
the social, and if this impulsion were the ‘ought,’ then in- 
deed he would have two ‘oughts,’ as on occasion he has 
two ‘musts’; but he now feels—after the ideal thought 
of personality has a good beginning in him—that some 
1 And it is in this that he seems to give support to the intuitionists, as also 
do Mivart and Wallace on somewhat similar grounds. 
2 I know that Mr. Spencer reaches a social derivation of obligation, but it 
remains a feeling due to customs of obedience, etc., in social life; it lacks the 
publicity arising from the imitative assimilation of actions to a higher self- 
thought, as brought out in the next paragraph. See the criticism of Hegel in 
Sect. 331 below. 
8 use these words ‘ higher’ and ‘lower’ in a genetic sense, with reference 
to amount of organization in the normal progress of consciousness, keeping 
‘shy’ of their question-begging meanings.

of these actions on both sides will assimilate to this ideal, 
are called for by this, will strengthen and reinforce this, 
while others will not; then comes the sense that these 
are good and the rest in comparison with them are bad. 
He says: ‘I ought to do ¢hzs, since the good man, my 
ideal personality, does this; I ought not to do ‘hat, 
because he does it not.’ And further, the reason that 
he does it not, is just because the action which he does 
not do represents one of the lower concrete habits, one 
whose indulgence would tend to set more firmly the 
antithesis between the partial selves on the one hand, 
and between them and the higher ideal self on the other 
hand: To act selfishly—or to act capriciously, even 
though the action be a generous one—is to undo my 
growth toward a law-abiding, reasonable, and, in its high- 
est sense, social person. 
195. And as with the individual, so with the race. 
Society puts a premium on assimilation of conduct to 
certain types of action which become formulated in law, 
convention, institutions, constitutions. Society has its 
right and its wrong, as the individual has. In society, 
as in the private sphere, the generous act, as well as the 
selfish act, may be wrong — may violate law. The social 
ideal represents the reduction of partial ideals, found in 
this man or that, to a common basis. Each man might 
say: ‘I will do this, and I will do that; we will all 
return to nature and do what we please;’ this is the 
state of things in society that the theories mentioned would 
require — corresponding to the equality to the individual 
of all actions in virtue of their equal impelling force. 
But the alternative here, as in the case of the individual, 
is not between this force and that law imposed a@é extra.
-P-A-G-E-344
  318 fits Sentiments 
Not at all. Society simply goes on developing, and gets 
the higher form of impulsion, authority, organization ; 
saying then to every man: ‘This is the type of action to 
which you are expected to conform voluntarily.’ The his- 
tory of mankind shows the same gradual refinement of 
the social ideal, as the history of the individual shows 
in respect to the personal ideal. This comes up again;1 
but I may add that I think Mr. Huxley would again be 
right in saying that on the basis of the factors and pro- 
cesses recognized by Mr. Spencer, no genetic account of 
social life would be forthcoming. For the individualist 
and the anarchist would be each his own justification, in 
the same sense as would the collectivist and the philan- 
thropist: the justification which comes from actual exist- 
ence with the law of growth through habit. Any higher 
arbiter, which men would voluntarily recognize, would be 
wanting; and all social ideals would stand on the same 
footing. 
196. (3) The relative balance between the two factors, 
hereditary fixity and plasticity, gives room for the varia- 
tions which the actual differences of men show in respect 
to their moral character and temperament. Greater natu- 
ral fixity is at the expense of plasticity ; and this greater 
fixity may be either in the direction of less intelligence 
and personal power of adaptation to social conditions, or 
of the reverse. The first case gives the atavistic ten- 
dency: the lack of moral character, due to innate unbal- 
ance in the direction of nervous discharge of a lower 
and less inhibited kind. This represents the more inde- 
pendent action of single reflexes and tendencies; but it 
shows greater stability in the particular function which 
1 See below, Chap. XIII.
-P-A-G-E-345
   Ethical Sentiment 319 
is brought into excessive action. The material at the 
disposal of such a person for learning and for new organi- 
zation during his personal education is less because of 
the lower functions whose independent organization holds 
the nervous substance locked up. 
The other variation in natural heredity is in the way of 
better social and moral temperament. It may be simply 
greater plasticity, with greater inventiveness on the intel- 
lectual side, or greater docility and imitativeness in the 
emotional life. This last may go to extremes in the direc- 
tion of slavish suggestibility, especially in an environ- 
ment —in the home, school, etc. — where the lessons of 
imitation are not supplemented by those of self-control, 
independence of mind, and sturdy assertion of personal 
conviction. 
It is not my aim, however, at this point to determine the 
details of these and other possible cases; but only to show 
that there is room for the ethical differences actually found 
among men, in the possible variations of these two factors, 
natural and social heredity, to each other. And it may be 
well to point out that. while the tendency to atavism, or 
lower organization, puts a premium on an unethical type 
of character alone,! the other possibility, that of greater 
plasticity, docility, suggestiveness, is not solely or to the 
same degree operative on the side of the ethical type. 
For the variations in the direction of plasticity tend simply 
to make the person open to personal influences of all kinds, 
not to those alone which inculcate morality, but to those 
also which set examples of wickedness. In this latter case, 
the most that can be said is that the child is susceptible to

the influences of his environment; but then his environ- 
ment may be good or it may be bad. There seems to 
be, therefore, in this a brake on the growth of the ethical 
in human life considered from the social point of view.! 
There is a tendency of individuals to run down hill under 
the influence of suggestion, and this is notably the case, 
as we have seen, in the case of suggestion reinforced 
from the crowd. 
197. With this general view of the sentiment of ethical 
obligation, we find it unnecessary to inquire in detail into 
the more refined phases which it presents in the varied 
ethical situations of life. The psychologist has to describe 
such emotions as remorse, jealousy, repentance, moral 
pride, etc.; but we may pass over them with the meed of 
emphasis of the social element which they have in com- 
mon with the generic feeling of obligation. They repre- 
sent special phases of that sense, as different combinations 
of social circumstance and relationship call it out. Re- 
morse is retrospective obligation; repentance has a pro- 
spective strain; although each of these, and each of the 
other ethical emotions, is subject to the most delicate 
variations and combinations.

We have found in actual life certain phases of emotion 
which were called ‘social emotions as such.’? There are

ethical life. On the social side they are seen in public 
opinion. This rather indefinite aspect of social organiza- 
tion has its justification in the movements of personal 
growth which have already been spoken of. It may be 
well to speak further of a group of phenomena whose 
influence is so real, confining our remarks, however, to 
the ethical form of it, called pudlic sentiment First, 
we may point out one or two of the main bearings of 
public sentiment upon the individual. 
198. It is notorious that the ethical sentiment itself is, 
in some degree, modified by public opinion. ‘Dare to be 
a Daniel, Dare to stand alone,’ is by no means a useless 
exhortation to any of us. The sense of social isolation 
is usually a direct cause of the weakening of moral deter- 
mination. This extends itself in other directions. The 
moral judgments which we pass on men and actions 
are more or less open to influence from the knowledge 
which we have of their standing in the community, and 
of the treatment which they receive from others. Even 
the more subtle and intimate judgments which we pass 
upon ourselves are liable to the same influence: we judge 
ourselves in some degree by the meed of reproach or 
commendation which we receive from the people who 
know us. Our first feeling of self-condemnation, for 
example, is often tempered and rendered less acute when 
we find that it is not entirely supported, in the judgment 
of society, at the high notch where we have placed it.) A 
potent influence on the side of repentance and reform is 
the knowledge that our fellow-men await it on our part; 
and this, not with reference alone to their opinion as such, 
1 See, besides, the remarks on public opinion in Chap. V., § 3; also Chap. 
My $123), 
   
-P-A-G-E-348
  322 flis Sentiments 
but because our own subjective demand upon ourselves 
grows and maintains itself through this factor. The actual 
growth of ethical sentiment, in the consciousness of a 
man, especially the sense of self-condemnation, with the 
growth of his knowledge of the judgment of his associ- 
ates, is a familiar personal experience to us all. There 
arises a peculiar sense of personal uneasiness, with the 
vaguest and most detached images of this man or that 
whose opinion reproves us. The uneasiness increases 
rapidly, simply from the persistence of these pictures 
of personal attitude on the part of others. The state 
finally grows excessively painful, and we seek some 
mitigating circumstance, either by arguing the case in 
self-defence with the pictured reprover, or by making 
appeal with confession to some other friend or acquaint- 
ance. This latter resort, especially if the ministrations 
come voluntarily from another, is the best balm to our 
lacerated self, even though, again, the new opinion have 
no new facts of any kind to urge. The simple sense of 
social approval—apart from the ground of it—leads us to 
tend toward the same point of view; just as the simple fact 
of social disapproval— also without statement of ground 
— carries with it the beginning of self-condemnation. 
Furthermore, there is often a lack of sharp condemnation 
of ourselves as long as our sins remain private; we are 
aware of the sinfulness in a general way; conscience gets 
in a timid voice, especially just at the time of commission 
of the deed, and more timidly each time that it is com- 
mitted; but there may be no lively emotional reaction, 
no great agitation of remorse, no desperate attempts to 
justify oneself by argument, no ‘call to repentance.’ 
Indeed, there is in such cases often a subtle sense of
-P-A-G-E-349
Social Sentiment as Such: Publicity 323 
secrecy, of the social approval of one’s general character 
as a whole, which comes in to assure the sinner that his 
sin is not likely to come out; and that he need not trouble 
himself about it. But let it once come out; then his nature 
asserts itself. The sense of publicity immediately reacts 
upon his own private standards of judgment. He awakes 
to the grounds of public condemnation and enforces them 
on himself. It is now not that he gets new information 
from the public; not at all. He finds himself, however, 
going over the grounds on which his friends are pos- 
sibly basing their judgment of him. He feels that while 
alone, he, as an interested party, did not care to see 
these damning reasons, yet society will now care to see 
them; and so he goes over them, picturing them as 
thoughts of others. This makes the thoughts his own, 
and the emotional results his own also. The wave of self- 
condemnation sweeps over him — genuine, profound, ethi- 
cal; not simply reflected. The social factor has become 
a real stimulus to his ethical nature. His own best judg- 
ment is now for the first time elicited. He says with the 
most profound earnestness: ‘Wretched man that I am’; 
and with it: ‘What a fool I was to wait till now to 
see it.’ 
These and many other aspects of the intimate depend- 
ence of the ethical sense upon its social support —and 
many such interesting relationships might be pointed out 
—may be put under two very general heads. First, we 
may say that ethical approval, both of oneself and of 
others, is never at its best except when it is accompanied, 
in the consciousness which has it, with the knowledge or 
belief that it is also socially shared. And second, the best 
ethical judgment of disapproval is liable to the same state-  
-P-A-G-E-350
  324 ffis Sentiments 
ment. The word ‘best’ here refers to the intensity, sure- 
ness, directness, unqualifiedness with which the ethical 
attitude, in the particular case, is taken. We may see 
what this is, and also why these two general points are 
true, from the application to the case of the psychological 
principles already put in evidence above. A word or two 
on this application may be in place. 
199. When we come to set out fully the psychological 
factors involved in the growth of the ideal self which is 
involved in all the ethical emotions, we find an aspect of 
it which so far in our study has had no emphasis. The 
subtler facts of social value in practical life, as now men- 
tioned, however, serve to bring it out. It is this: the sense 
of a self that is good, regular, law-abiding, ethical, the 
standard of all my judgments of right and wrong, must 
be, in my consciousness of tt, a public self. 
This means that when I think of this ideal, when I bring 
a given action to the test of assimilation to it, —for I cannot 
think of it in any circumstances which do not call for its 
application to a concrete case of action,—a part of the 
content of my thought is necessarily the thought that the 
judgment is one of social generality, that others are also 
making the same assimilation of this act to the same ideal. 
In case, then, I know that the action is quite private, quite 
secret, absolutely unknown to anybody else, then the full 
reinstatement of the conditions of an ethical judgment are, 
ipso facto, not present. My ideal category of action is not 
brought out; for to bring it out requires the very sense of 
publicity which my knowledge of privacy contradicts. If 
this be true to psychology, then it is no wonder that 
privacy destroys much of our ethical competence. This 
conclusion not only accounts for the facts which we have
-P-A-G-E-351
    
                                                        Social Sentiment as Such: Publicity 325 
cited, but goes further, in that by it we discover a phase 
of social emotion which introduces into our lives a remark- 
able element of solidarity, and gives full significance to 
the expression ‘social sentiment as such.’ Let us see then 
what the psychological factors are which justify the con- 
clusion. 
200. The sense of the publicity of the ethical self as 
defined immediately above follows from the fact, which 
we have found it necessary to recognize, of the unity of 
the self-content in all its development. We found that 
the ego and the alter were in great part identical, espe- 
cially in the part which constitutes them selves as opposed 
to mere bodies. We found that when I think of myself, 
I think zso facto of you; and that the emotion which 
the thought arouses, and in view of which I take the 
active attitudes that I do, rests upon that thought, no 
matter which the real ego in the case may be, as deter- 
mined by the actual conditions, z.¢., be it me or be it you. 
If we go back to the child of two or three years, we 
find that a difference of emotion and attitude does arise in 
view of the real objective differences, and he finds him- 
self acting in the two ways called selfish and generous 
respectively, according as the thought of self is objec- 
tively determined in one way or the other. But these 
two sorts of action or attitude — guaranteed as a matter 
of fact by the inborn expressions of the organism — re- 
main each in so far unreflective ; each takes its cue from 
the personal environment and assimilates its own appro- 
priate material from the events of life. So far, the child is 
independent of the opinion which other people may form of 
him?!; he has no sense of ‘publicity,’ no requirement that 
1 Except as there is a demand for social confirmation after the deed.  
-P-A-G-E-352
  326 fis Sentiments 
his act of spontaneous sociality should be known to be 
what it is. Others are important to him, as giving him 
personal copy, by example, precept, etc., and for the rati- 
fication and confirming of his deeds; and their influence is 
seen in his growth in these two ways. 
But the very necessity of making further use of society 
it is which leads the child on to the additional step seen in 
the growth of a general or ideal sense of self. This means, 
as we have seen, the formation of a category of action 
which assimilates the essential content of self as repre- 
sented by both the earlier partial thoughts. He thinks of 
self again as independent of the private objective marks 
of individuality, bodies, locality, etc. To this thought all 
personal actions should conform; and the concrete rela- 
tionships between the two selves called ego and alter 
tend to disappear as this form of union is secured. 
This is what we call reflection. The higher thought of 
self is brought to judge the lower thoughts. But it is itself 
a function of the lower. It could not rise except for the 
unity of content which holds the two together. So the 
result of the assimilation, the actual attitude taken in any 
particular concrete case toward one or other in the lower 
self-thoughts, —the attitude which constitutes the sense of 
ethical well- or ill-desert, —this is identically the same atti- 
tude for all the concrete selves. I condemn the act of you 
as well as that of me, or approve it, no matter whether it 
be objectively determined in a particular case as really 
mine or really yours. And the reciprocal nature of the 
relation carries the sense over into a general application 
simultaneously to all the possible other people whose ego 
the identical thought may stand for. This, then, brings in 
the ejective thought of you as reaching the same sense
-P-A-G-E-353
Social Sentiment as Such: Publicity 327 
of approval or disapproval that I do.| Or: the thought that 
the judgment passed is actually in the inind of some other is 
necessary to a full ethical judgment as such. 
This may be put in a different way. My thought of the 
ideal self is general; it must apply in all the particular 
cases. Whatever mental movement it gives rise to, must 
be present in all the particular cases. I find it giving rise 
to a feeling of condemnation, in my case, when a certain 
action is before me. It must give rise to the same condem- 
nation in the mind of each of them. But, it is said, this 
is very different from saying that I must think that it is 
actually present to them. Certainly; but we must remem- 
ber that I cannot think of myself with anything reflectively 
before me without in the act thinking ejectively on the same 
content; hence, to think of myself with this case before me 
is to think of other men also with this case before them. 
To fall short of this is to think, not in terms of the general 
thought of self, not with reference to the ideal; but in 
reference to some particular partial self to whose know- 
ledge the case before me is restricted. So it is not enough 
that I feel what others would say if they knew; 7 must 
feel that others are judging because I judge. ' 
201, If this is so, then in the case in which I am con- 
scious that no one but myself knows the act which I am 
committing, this consciousness really contradicts an element 
in the mental psychosis which arouses the ethical sentiment ; 
and as long as I fully assure myself of this, I cannot get 
a completely moral judgment./ Of course it is impossible 
to maintain this state of mind in its purity ; the drift toward 
the general statement of the case in social terms tends to 
1 See the formulation in Appendix D, 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
328 Lis Sentiments 
establish the proper ethical sense, and imagination supplies 
the needed elements by whispering what my friends would 
say if they knew my conduct. But this does not take the 
place of actual knowledge; although it often brings on 
most tragic illusions and hallucinations of persecution, dis- 
covery, pursuit by priests, bodily occupation by devils, etc. 
These latter cases indeed would serve, I think, if ade- 
quately investigated by ethical writers who give themselves 
to casuistry, to show two very instructive points in the 
social nature of the ethical sense: first, the point that hal- 
lucinations of social opinion may come to take the place 
of personal social thought and of real social tests; and 
second, that actual social opinion may create illusions of 
conscience where the personal ego thought is weak or 
deranged. In other words, there are necessarily the two 
ingredients, the subjective and the ejective ingredients, in 
the general thought of personality; either may be de- 
ranged, to the extent which we describe as hallucination, 
in different types of real moral insanity. This might be 
made the topic of detailed remarks based upon the cases 
to be found in current pathological literature.1 
202. The essential publicity of the ethical sense teaches 
us that in the growth of this sense the meaning of the 
claim that man is a social being gets itself very much en- 
larged. In this kind of sentiment the ‘ejective’ phase of 
the self-thought is incorporated, as an intrinsic element, 
Here we have a right to say that the private ideal or end 
of the individual is one with the social ideal and end as such; 
just for the reason that the social end can get no state-

ment apart from this ‘public’ personal construction which 
the individual is now making. This again we must reserve 
for further statement, when we come to consider the ques- 
tion of social progress.? 
§ 4. Practical Reason 
203. One thing, however, we may add. This incor- 
poration of the ejective person, the alter, into the very 
body of the thought from which the ethical, social, and 
other sentiments arise, leads, necessarily, to a new function 
of the intelligence, in its relation to the social forces as a 
whole, It appeared in an earlier connection that the 
child uses his intelligence to bend and manipulate the 
actions of persons around him; he anticipates the obser- 
vations, opinions, attitudes, of others, and acts to mislead 
them, or, at least, to utilize them for certain private ends. 
This also characterizes an early epoch in the development 
of man. This is the natural use of intelligence, so long as 
there is relative independence in the two thoughts of self, 
the ego thought and the alter thought. They are, in a 
measure, rival occupants of consciousness; and when such 
a new instrument of utility comes to hand in the intelli- 
gence, developed, as we must think, with greater view to 
the personal adaptations of the individual, —and so tempt- 
ing him into original sin, — it is natural that one of these 
rival thoughts should get the balance of benefit from it. 
But now, in the growth of sentiment, —social, ethical, 
religious, —this is no longer so. The very growth of reflec- 
tive intelligence is growth in generality of content. The 
content of the sense of self upon which the sentiments de- 
1 See Chap. XIII. . Be
-P-A-G-E-356
  330 Fits Sentiments 
pend in order to become general, must have reference to all 
examples of personality, to the alter as well as to the ego 
thought. There comes into consciousness, therefore, as 
this proceeds, a direct call to the inhibition of all the 
private ways of using intelligence characteristic of the 
earlier period. The demand for conformity to an ideal 
is made upon all these partial tendencies; for, as has been 
said, the newer growth of the content of self, representing 
ipso facto the newer function of intelligence, supersedes 
the old; so both acts of intentionally designed selfish 
appropriation and acts of intentionally designed generos- 
ity now yield spontaneously to this demand for conformity 
to the higher personal thought, which is of public value. 
We reach here, therefore, a great turn in the course of 
personal development —a turn which is rich in implica- 
tions for the interpretation of the social movement. This 
crisis is to be, in our further study of social development, 
perhaps the most important factor. It has its match in 
interest and importance, perhaps, only in the dawn of 
intelligence itself in the earlier period, whereby the in- 
stinctive and organic co-operation of the animals yielded 
to the conscious and intelligent co-operation of men. 
204. The fact which stands out most plainly is that 
already described, in the chapter on the development of 
the sense of self, as the growth of the ethical self. The 
sense of relationships of right and wrong is, of course, 
most momentous, both in the history of the individual and 
in that of the race. We found (see Sect. 19) that the 
theories which state the ethical self — the thought of a self 
who does right or wrong —in terms of either of the two 
selves characterized as ‘habitual’ and ‘accommodating,’ are 
equally inadequate. This result now has support on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
Practical Reason 331 
plane of the intelligence; and our results are available to 
refute the school of thinkers who say that the ethical end 
is some form of intelligent self-interest —the Utilitarians. 
An appeal to the ethical consciousness is sufficient to show 
that the content thought of, when the mind is full of emo- 
tions of right or wrong, cannot be described as the thought- 
content of a purely intellectual being exercising his ‘ per- 
sonal’ intelligence—far from it, despite the finished 
analyses of the Utilitarians. : 
On the lower plane we found that their analyses, being 
strictly genetic, depend upon the validity of the reduction 
of the sympathetic impulses to the egoistic ones. This 
reduction is shown to be quite incorrect by all the facts 
now presented, which prove that the two tendencies extend 
alike down into the life of the animals. On this higher 
plane the attempt to reduce the ethical forms of action to 
those of personal reflective intelligence, goes no further 
than is justified by the one-sided uses of the intelligence 
described in the last chapter. 
On the other hand, the claim that the generous impulses, 
the sympathies and altruistic emotions, give exclusive 
content to the ethical consciousness is equally mistaken. 
Sympathy is a capricious and lawless thing. Suggesti- 
bility characterizes the sympathetic psychosis to a remark- 
able degree. And again, sympathy may be present when 
there is no adequate deliberative process to support that 
adjustment of personal claims which the ethical con- 
sciousness calls for, and which the Utilitarians so prop- 
erly emphasize. This we saw on the lower plane above; 
and now when intelligence is born we find it promptly 
taking the helm and using the emotions for its own social 
ends. So if reflective sympathy were all that the advocates 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
  332 fits Sentiments 
of disinterestedness in conduct had to fall back upon, sorry 
would be their case. The ‘good’ would characterize the 
kind-hearted, and benevolence would sit on the bench of 
justice. 
We come to see, therefore, in view of the incomplete- 
ness of both these historical theories, that we are under 
the necessity of examining anew the thought of self found 
in the ethical consciousness, in the light of our genetic 
results. This leads us to discover that the child goes on 
further in his personal growth, and really reaches a thought 
of an ideal self which overcomes the antithesis between 
intelligent self-seeking and reflective sympathy. It would, 
indeed, have been a pity, so to speak, if nature had led 
man out of the appearance of righteousness, represented 
by his instincts, into the scheming devices of intelligence, 
and had then taken him no further.! 
On this point, the child’s growth seems to throw direct 
light. The Utilitarians have seen it, in a measure, in their 
emphasis of the ‘word of command.’ But they have failed 
to see that there is a new organization of the child’s 
personal thoughts, an organization which leads to the 
psychological result found, in us adults, in the sense of 
law. Law, to the child, is personal in all his transition 
period to a true ethical self; it is an embodiment, a self, 
which is essentially ‘ projective,’ which he cannot represent 
nor anticipate in detail. It has its analogies, its illustra- 
tions, in his experience, and on the basis of these experi- 
1 It is the recognition of this higher reach of self-consciousness which has 
given the Intuitionalists in ethics their historical advantage. But they are set 
against the genetic point of view, and so throw away their best resource. 
(Cf. my article, ‘The Origin of a Thing and its Nature,’ Psych. Rev., Vol. IL, 
1895, pp. 551 ff.). Many Idealists, on the other hand, revert to Utilitarianism 
by making the ethical ideal an intellectual construction which is pursued under 
what is called later on (Sects, 247 ff.) the ‘sanction of success,’ 
i
-P-A-G-E-359
    Practical Reason 333 
ences, actively appropriated by his imitations, he grows to 
understand it more and more. But it is always an ideal, 
an unfulfilled expectation of the ultimate developments of 
character; and as such it is a forward-reaching attitude, 
which presents, to the novelties of experience, nets for the 
assimilation of the newly evolving phases of personal sug- 
gestion and teaching. 
This the Idealists have taught; but this is not all. 
The gradual formation in the child of the thought of 
self which is law-abiding, regular in its behaviour, not-at- 
all-capricious, but lawgiving to him and to others — this 
thought zs ztself subject to the method of growth that we 
found the earlier personal thoughts of the child to be. 
The elements of it must also continue to come from the 
personal environment; they must be assimilated to the 
earlier thoughts; and they must be read back into the per- 
sons who stand in relationship to the agent. And when 
we come to see the child doing these things, we see the 
formation of complexes, in his attitudes, which are the 
germs of the forces of, life and history. But this is xo 
longer simply personal intelligence, the exercise of which 
we have been illustrating; it is now ethical intelligence; 
thinking for complex social ends; finding it unnatural and 
unreasonable to be either self-seeking or other-seeking as 
such; but finding it both natural and reasonable to be 
dutiful. This is the highest reach of intelligent growth 
and gives its true significance, as I take it, to what ethical 
writers call ‘practical reason.’ 
205. We need only add certain brief corollaries. There 
are two ways that the child’s assimilation of personal sug- 
gestions might go on. His egoistic, aggressive self might 
assimilate the actions of other persons and wrest them to
-P-A-G-E-360
  334 fTis Sentiments 
its advantage; thus leading the child to be an individualist 
pure and simple. But it is plain that even on the supposi- 
tion that this might be, he would find a certain embar- 
rassment. His nature has a fund of organic emotional 
expressions which he would have to suppress in order not 
to be generous in spite of himself. He would have to 
undo the progress which even biological evolution has 
made toward a social type of person. And more than 
this, we have seen that the two sorts of impulse rep- 
resented by his spontaneous activities are both equally 
reasonable to unreflective intelligence; so such a selfish 
person would have to indulge in generous conduct on 
occasion, merely in order to be selfish. There are certain 
unpleasantnesses of continued sympathy, for example, 
which he would be wise to avoid by relieving the dis- 
tresses which are thrust upon him. This picture is not 
a speculative and artificial one, altogether. There are 
men whose reflection does lead them very near to it, — 
men whose generosities are remedial agents to the wounds 
of their selfishness. But this is, to be sure, the finished 
result of a certain sort of reflection. 
Another way that the child might develop is that which 
would constitute him a purely altruistic being —a being 
of generosity gone on to perfection. This is, however, 
also contrary to the facts which we have just pointed 
out; facts which show that he has more properly a selfish 
period, and that he gets to be generous only by the con- 
temporary growth of the alter sense. 
The way he does grow has already been explained at some 
length, and only two remarks remain to be made. 
206.\ First, the ‘practical reason’ is a thing of social 
gvowth.\ This is to say that it springs up in an environ-
-P-A-G-E-361
Practical Reason 335 
ment to which it expresses intelligent adaptation.) The 
sense of what ought to be cannot be divorced from the 
sense of what is.) The thing that ought to be is a direct 
reflection of the conditions which have produced the know- 
ledge of what is; and while that which is, and is known to 
be, sums up the experience of the individual on the side 
of science, the sense of a possible ought expresses with 
equal reality and validity the trend of science toward a 
new statement of further social conditions.1 All this is so 
purely a matter of ethical theory that I cannot stop to 
follow it into its bearings; but an essential fact for social 
science is found in the group of phenomena upon which 
the ethical intelligence works. This namely: when the 
child reflects on his social relationships and arrives at the 
beginning of a habit of intelligent submission which he 
then in turn prescribes to others also, he shows a new sort 
of end not before found in him. None of the partial 
thoughts — none of his private schemes — is now his end; 
no person completely fulfils his new ideal, his ideal of per- 
sonality, long or very well. He is now launched on a sea 
of intellectual turmoil and endeavour, which by its very 
restlessness and change, its setting of ideals and its viola-' 
tion of them, make social life and progress possible. 
‘He now, secondly, urns and judges all things from this 
ideal point of view., Is it right? is now his question of 
conduct; and, Is he good? his question of man. And 
his own disquieting thoughts of himself turn on the same 
questions as applied to his own conduct and his own pres- 
ence. Nothing is so urgent in his life as the call to duty ; 
nothing so utterly upsetting as the penalties which attach, 
in his own mind, to the neglect of this call. It would not

Fragments in Philos. and Science, Chap. V.). 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
336 fits Sentiments 
be possible to put too strongly the revolutionary meaning 
of this intelligent morality. It is not only a great event in 
life-history; it marks also a new turn in social develop- 
ment—a turn away from the intellectual as such to the 
social as such, just as the period of early reflection marks a 
turn away from the instinctive and emotional as such to the 
intellectual as such. 
It may suffice to say in closing that it is dy the develop- 
ment of intelligence that this has been ushered in; that 
there is therefore no possible theoretical divorce between 
intelligence and sentiment; that the child comes up into 
the theatre of sentiment by a natural process of growth, 
which, while our philosophy may not have anticipated it, 
we can still trace when we see it taking place before our 
eyes. 
§ 5. Religious Sentiment 
A further differentiation of the emotional tone arising 
about the ideal constructions which we have been con- 
sidering, manifests itself in the so-called religious senti- 
ments. In classifying these as sentiments, I am, of course, 
taking the position that religious emotion is a phase of the 
wider mental state of which we have had an account in 
the earlier pages of this chapter. I need not dwell at 
length, therefore, upon the origin and development of reli- 
gious sentiment; since it would be a repetition of the fore- 
going. But certain explanations are necessary to justify 
the classification of these sentiments with the ethical and 
social sentiments, and to mark the points of differentiation 
both as to origin and as to nature. 
207. Confining ourselves at the outset, as before, to the 
child’s development, we find a lack of objective material for
-P-A-G-E-363
  Religious Sentiment 337 
arriving at a correct view. Taking what is available from 
our knowledge of the child’s conception and thought, 
however, and weighing it carefully in comparison with 
adult emotion of the religious kind, we may make certain 
remarks which suffice at least to show that the inclusion 
of the religious emotions under the foregoing account of 
the origin of the ethical and social sentiments is just. 
The child’s earliest expressions of reverence, love, devo- 
tion, trust, dependence, are directed to the actual persons 
of his environment. It is impossible, in these early mani- 
festations, to distinguish what is ethical from what is reli- 
gious; that is, it is impossible to see any marked phase 
of the expressive attitudes of the child which can be called 
religious in a distinctive sense. He has one and only one 
series of attitudes toward the persons about him: that 
which we have already seen in his personal develop- 
ment. He reaches a constantly enlarging sense of the 
richness of personality, by growing up into the lessons set 
by the actions of others; and he attains greater intima- 
tions of the depth and possible meaning of the persons 
about him through his own reactions to them. So the 
great line of development of his personal self, with its 
more and more refined sense of personal character in 
others —this is his one and only source of sentiment. 
It is evident, however, as was said above, that there 
are two great phases of his sentimental life, both of capi- 
tal importance in his higher growth. One is the subjec- 
tive phase, the growing sense of a self which is he, which 
he realizes when he has emotions, and for which he is 
responsible when he uses his organism. To this self the 
ethical emotions attach, since they arise from a direct 
sense of the relative poverty and imperfection of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  338 Lffis Sentiments 
self as compared with the ideal personality which is the 
standard of personal lawfulness and excellence. The 
ethical emotions arise about my actions, my will, my atti- 
tudes, my selfishness; it is always my, my, my, or your, 
your, your; the deeds of single concrete persons. The 
emphasis is on the subject-sense, considered distinctly as 
subject. The very essence of the ethical movement is, 
as we saw above, just the lack of assimilation of the self 
we know we are and are capable of being at the present 
moment, with the ideal self which comes from all our 
lessons of personal obedience and law. And we have 
also seen that this subjective aspect of the child’s growth 
has had its prophetic phases even in the instinctive life. 
It has grown up by utilizing the very reactions of bash- 
fulness, modesty, sympathy, etc., which were there in the 
lower eras of mental development. 
208. But all our study has shown that there is another, 
correlative and equally important, side to the whole growth 
into the full sense of personality; the phase of it which 
refers to other persons. 
This takes on two forms: (1) what was called the eectéve 
person. There is a constant outward reference of the per- 
sonality sense, an identification of it with real outside per- 
sons. And with this is always associated (2) a projective 
element: an element which the child has never adequately 
learned, which is not understood, which even the ideal 
derived from all the lessons of personal intercourse has not 
availed to exhaust. Personality remains after all a pro- 
gressive, developing, never-to-be-exhausted thing. Now it 
is these two phases of the personal sense and its growth, 
I think, which combine to give the basis of religious senti- 
ment in the child. So there are two elements in it.
-P-A-G-E-365
   Religious Sentiment 339 
First, there is the tendency to make ejective the ideal 
person reached by the road already traced; to make it 
real, a separate being or personality. There must be 
somewhere, feels the child, a self which answers to all the 
elements of the law: to the charity, the love, the beauty of 
the ideal, whose presence in my thought makes my own 
self morally so incomplete. It is not a new movement of 
the mind. We have found it always present, and always 
necessarily present, if the child is to attain ethical and 
social personality at all, in the proper sense of those terms. 
He must go on to eect this highest of all personal thoughts 
just as he does the lower also. The great spirit becomes 
the way of speaking of this being —that is, it is the race- 
child’s way. 
Second, the other element is also important in religious 
emotion; it is the child’s expectation of yet more manifes- 
tations from this highest of all persons — manifestations 
which he cannot anticipate nor cope with; which he must 
submit to when they come, learn of only when they have 
come, propitiate in the ways that please persons, and 
stand in awe of from first to last. This is also not at all 
a new mental movement; it also has been present as an 
essential motif of his progress from first to last. The 
projective elements of personality, indeed, were his very 
first stock in trade, his first social copies for imitation. 
At each and every stage of his growth he has been able 
to make progress only as new elements of personal sug- 
gestion have presented themselves to him. So it would 
be quite wrong if we expected this attitude of expectation, 
accommodation; of readiness for the novel, the self-dis- 
turbing, the ill-understood ; the lesson of arbitrary obedi- 
ence —if we expected all this to stop suddenly, and
-P-A-G-E-366
  340 LfTis Sentiments 
not urge itself into the realm of the mysterious, Char- 
acter has been all along to him the mysterious thing. The 
filling in of the mystery, sufficiently for his life-needs, has 
taken all his pains; but there is always the sphere of 
mystery still, from which are constantly emerging the 
unexpected attributes of personal character. Here is the 
profounder element in religious emotion. 
The ejective, personifysng element, which the history of 
primitive peoples puts so clearly in evidence, gives positive 
content to the religious sentiment as mentioned above ; 
while the projective or negative element, as seen thus in 
this latter aspect of the child’s growth, ts the awe-inspiring 
something-over of mystery equally emphasized in the rites 
and cults of primitive ceremonial,  Disregarding now 
the anthropological point of view,! we may examine some 
of the more prominent emotional movements in the child 
which this general characterization of the religious senti- 
ment leads us to expect. 
209. (1) The two greater factors now pointed out may 
be further distinguished in referenceto the current theories 
of the nature of religion; and the factor which arises on 
the side of content, or of ejective personality, may be 
designated, as the school of Schleiermacher have done, 
by the general phrase ‘feeling of dependence.’ Paulsen,” 
in his excellent treatment, calls this side of the religious 
life the side or element of ‘trust.’ Considering the great 
variety of stages which this factor in the religious life goes 
through in the course of the child’s religious development, 
we may better adhere to the broader phrase of Schleier- 
1 Intentionally, from lack of personal fitness; the anthropological references 
made being suggestions, which are liable to criticism from experts.

    Religious Sentiment 341 
macher, and discuss the matter as below under the head- 
ing ‘Feeling of Dependence.’ 
(2) The other factor, which finds its raison d’étre, as 
we have seen, in the projective tendency in personal 
growth, corresponds to the element of the religious life 
which the students of anthropology, such as Spencer, 
Tylor, etc., call ‘wonder,’ and which Paulsen generalizes 
under the heading of ‘fear.’ Neither of these terms seems 
to me sufficiently general to cover the wide projective 
consciousness in all the course of development through 
which the child and man go; so I shall discuss this aspect 
of religion under the general head of ‘Feeling of Mystery,’ 
only venturing to do this for the reason that we are then 
enabled to classify together all the phenomena which the 
development of this side of the religious consciousness 
really shows at whatever stage.! 
These two general topics may therefore be taken up in 
order. 
210. I. Feeling of Dependence. —It is only necessary 
to recall the stages in the development of the personal 
sense to see what epochs this aspect of religious emotion 
may be expected to show. That these epochs are not 
only legitimate inferences from the fact that we are deal- 
ing with the ejective phase of personal growth which is 
present all through the course of the child’s development, 
but that they really are, is observable in the child’s life.? 
The stages through which the child’s ejective sense of 
personality goes, and some of the facts which justify the 
1 It will be seen lower down that by this method we escape the intermina- 
ble discussions which turn about a ‘definition’ of religion. Such definitions 
usually characterize different stages of the movement.

tion, with records, in my own family.
-P-A-G-E-368

delineation, have already been presented above; and we 
may recall that we found reason for saying that three 
such stages might well be distinguished, arising from the 
epochal changes found respectively at the dawn of intelli- 
gence in the first place, and at the dawn of the ethical 
sense in the second place. Both of these events mark 
great deviations of development from its previous course. 
The rise of the intelligence brings in the reflective and 
intentional co-operation of men together for social pur- 
poses, and thus supersedes the organic and instinctively 
gregarious co-operations of the animals. The develop- 
ment of emotion through this great transition has also 
claimed our attention. The other great transition, z¢., 
from the merely intelligent to the ethical as such, has 
been the topic of the present chapter; and we found 
reason to conclude that it again marks a striking deviation 
of the development of mankind from the purely intel- 
lectual uses of social co-operation to the truly social uses 
in which the ethical and social ideal becomes, in virtue of 
its own intrinsic moving force in every man, the end of 
progress. If, now, the religious emotions really have their 
root, in part, in the ejective movement of the mind, which 
continues to play an essential réle all through this devel- 
opment, then we should expect to find three great epochs 
in the feeling of religious dependence: first, the epoch 
of instinctive or spontaneous dependence upon personality, 
as the child apprehends it; second, a period of depend- 
ence connected with the exercise of his intellectual activi- 
ties, what might be called the period of rational or 
intellectual dependence; and third, the period in which 
his ethical sense calls upon him to eject the ideal thought 
of self, and clothe it with the attributes of ethical worth —
-P-A-G-E-369
  Religious Sentiment 343 
the period of ethical dependence. “We may look, for a 
little, at the facts of the child’s development with these 
distinctions in view. 
"aut. (1) The period in which the child’s sense of per- 
sonality leads him to what we are calling ‘spontaneous 
dependence’ is generally recognized. It has been called 
by different names according to various ways of approach 
to it. Bain finds in the child a certain ‘primitive credu- 
lity’; poets speak of the beautiful trustfulness of chil- 
dren; parents, if they are alive to their responsibilities, 
are weighed down with the sense that the child tends to 
make quasi-deities of the father and mother. The period 
begins in the child as soon as he starts in his career of 
discrimination of persons. The actual person whom he 
selects as the object of this primitive emotion of depend- 
ence depends upon the incidents of his rearing. The 
father is more often his first divinity, since he is not 
exposed so constantly to the child’s scrutiny, is often the 
bringer of the gift or the healer of the larger woes of the 
household, and also because the lessons of obedience are 
likely to be enforced in his case by sterner and more 
inflexible sanctions. All the evidence which is reported 
in the books on child-psychology to show that father, or 
mother, or whoever else, is such an ideal personality, is in 
point here. For it is just the emotional side of this 
manner of reading of a real person, in which this earliest 
form of quasi-religious dependence consists. The child’s 
constructions of deity in answer to questions as to what 
God is, etc., all bear out the truth that his anthropomor- 
phism at this period is not in any sense an abstract thing ; 
for all the concrete content that his deity notion has is 
made up, as his whole personality concept is, from the  
-P-A-G-E-370
    344 fits Sentiments 
imitative copy-elements which he has learned from persons, 
stories, and events.! 
It is directly in line with this interpretation, also, that 
we find the child showing the remarkable tendency to 
myth-making, liking for fairy-stories, love of heroes and 
their exploits, in which the ideal man or monster is always 
victorious, or in which the good divinity overcomes the 
evil monster. All this has its emotional side, and the sort 
of emotion is in kind that which, in its later manifestations, 
when the ideal has become more refined, we call religious. 
At the start, the sense of dependence takes its rise, I 
think, in actual physical helplessness. The child learns 
the distinction between persons and things largely through 
the stress of his physical needs and the succour which 
persons bring him. Persons then go on to be the re- 
sourceful elements of his environment, the source of the 
gratification of appetites and of the alleviation of dis- 
tresses. There springs up in the child the sense that in 
the presence of mother or nurse there is comfort, and in 
her absence discomfort. It is only a step further to see 
that this attribution of relief-agency —so to characterize 
the good person in the environment —is a large part 
of the child’s actual thought of persons. And this expec- 
tation of help, in its various forms —shown in reflex 
movements toward the person, with sense of pleasures in 
anticipation, with the accompanying stress of present 
unrelieved pain—all terminates on the presentation or 
memory of persons. This is the rudimentary feeling of 
dependence.

certain possibilities which are not entirely physical.) His 
“expectations are not always fulfilled in physical terms, 
There appears a certain capriciousness in the actions of 
persons, and it taxes his dawning intelligence to reduce 
it to any sort of order. And the influence upon his 
dependence of the newer and less physical conditions of 
his personal intercourse with others, issues from certain 
outstanding realities. Punishment is one of the rude 
awakening factors in the growth of dependence. All 
sanctions and penalties which issue from persons tend at 
once to stimulate his intelligence, and to increase his 
sense of his own helplessness. It is just his helplessness 
in the presence of natural things which is now reinstated 
on the higher personal plane. He learns now to think of 
the other not only as a being who succours and relieves, 
but also as one who snubs, pains, and refuses to relieve. 
And this element of capriciousness, or lack of order in 
the behaviour of others, is for a long time, I think, the 
dominating motive on this side of the developing religious 
sense. It comes up more particularly below, in the con- 
sideration of the ‘projective’ element of his growth in 
religious personality. 
With punishment, however, and the obedience which he 
learns through it, and with instruction, comes the dawning 
of the more intellectual period. Just as in his spontane- 
ous imitations the child reaches his own inventive inter- 
pretations of events, and so learns to be intelligent; so 
by obedience he is pushed along the same road. But in 
obedience the emphasis of the personality element is 
differently placed. In imitation the child gets an em- 
phasis laid on his own initiative, his own power, his own 
private self-worth and capacity; but in obedience the per-
-P-A-G-E-372
  346 fis Sentiments 
sonal emphasis is all on the personality whom he is forced 
to obey; on the ‘law’ element, as we saw in considering 
his ethical growth. He stands and waits for the com- 
mand with fear and trembling, and then gazes upon the 
terrible other person for reward or blame of his result. 
Then with this transfer of the emphasis in his develop- 
ment, from the annoyance of physical pain and depend- 
ence for its relief, to the annoyance, embarrassment, con- 
fusion of personal imitation and obedience, and with the 
lack of information to anticipate results, there comes the 
transfer of the relief to be expected from the sphere of 
physical comfort to that of intelligent apprehension and 
instruction. The child comes to look upon the father or 
mother as the all-wise, the explainer of problems, the 
solver of riddles. His sense of dependence comes to be 
confidence in a higher intelligence than his, and this 
higher intelligence he places, of course, in the persons 
who relieve his uncertainties, who compel his obediences, 
who administer sanctions, who give explanations. 
213. This development of the sense of dependence, 
from the physical up into the intellectual realm, serves 
to bring out two very marked characteristics of the child’s 
thought of persons. We find the child’s thought ex- 
pressed in two great categories, say from his third year 
on into his youth: the categories of cause and design. 
Statistical inquiries into the way children define objects? 
show these two great features: the causal definition tend- 
ing to develop before the teleological definition. The 
causal definition tends to be stated in terms of some more 
or less comprehended personal agency. A table is ‘the 
thing that the carpenter makes’: the bread is ‘what the 
1 Binet, Barnes.
-P-A-G-E-373
    Religious Sentiment 347 
cook bakes’: the doll is ‘what I play with,’ etc. This 
shows the very strong tendency to think of a person 
in terms of what he does, of his agency, and to think 
of things as subordinate to this all-embracing causal activ- 
ity of persons. This gets a response in emotion and per- 
sonal attitude from the child himself, and this attitude is 
one of dependence upon the causal activity of the persons 
whom he knows. 
Then there comes, a little later, the period of design: 
springing, as it seems to me, from the fact that the 
father’s explanations follow generally only after the exhibi- 
tions of his power. The father explains why he did this 
or that; leads the child to construe results in terms of 
their utilities, of means to end, of design; and the child 
quickly generalizes the cases, reaching the wider point 
of expectation that everything will have its purpose, and 
that the person who is greatest can give him the teleologi- 
cal key to each and every situation. 
214. Both of these phases of the child’s intelligent 
growth in his sense of dependence upon other persons 
for the solution of his difficulties, are strikingly seen in 
the questions asked by the child in the epoch called the 
‘questioning period.’! 
His questioning takes on two very distinct phases; the 
first directed to the ‘what,’ and the second to the ‘why.’ 
‘Wa’ dat, Wadie?’ (‘what's that, Father ?’) was the cry of 
the house when my child H. had begun the first period; 
and a little later, after language was further on in its 
development, and when the inquiring turn of mind had 
become more intelligent, ‘why ?’ was the word which rang 
1 Sully (oc. cit., p. 75 f.) gives many entertaining anecdotes from the child’s 
‘questioning age.’
-P-A-G-E-374
  348 - Lfiis Sentiments 
incessantly in our ears. In the first stage of this ‘ques 
tioning mania’ the causal tendency is prominent, inasmuch 
as the child tends to be satisfied with any ‘what’ which 
reveals some sort of living agency. In the later ‘why’ 
period, this tendency to seek personal agencies so blankly 
retreats somewhat, only to conceal itself behind the notion 
of design. It is no longer enough to tell the child that 
a thing is what it is, even though the answer convey the 
idea of a living person or animal acting in his presence; 
he goes further and seeks the reason that the action is 
what it is. To be sure, even in this later period, the 
anthropomorphic solution is the most satisfying one to 
every ‘why.’ Ifa personal use can be pointed out, some 
human or animal need which justifies the action of which 
he asks the why, then so much the more satisfactory is 
the answer to the child. 
The bearing of the two main ideas which the child 
uses in this process of ejecting personality into his 
environment—the ideas of cause or power and design 
—upon the character of his own dawning religious senti- 
ment is evident enough in itself, and becomes increasingly 
so in its anthropological aspect.1\ They both illustrate 
dependence; but they differ in-fespect to the stage of 
development which they respectively characterize. In 
the sense of cause or personal power the physical anal- 
ogy predominates; the force of a person in compelling 
obedience and bringing succour is, in the main, physical 
force. And the power illustrated in the general answer

       Religious Sentiment » 349 
to the ‘what’ question terminates in the immediate envi- 
ronment of fact, either physical or mental. But the other 
idea, that of design, which is seen in the series of ‘why’ 
questions, shows the dependence of the child with refer- 
ence to intellectual explanations. It illustrates the diffi- 
culties into which his dawning intelligence gets; and so 
the emotion which he has in this case is a higher and 
more complex thing. The dependence on persons for 
information as to facts is, of course, intelligent; but that 
which seeks, from the same persons, explanations as to 
the ‘why’ of the facts, denotes a further and more human 
attainment. It is then in the latter, mainly, with the use 
that the child makes of his own intelligence in a reciprocal 
way upon it, that we find realized the second great stage 
in the ejective development of religious dependence. 
215. It is noteworthy, also, that at this stage of the 
development of the sense of dependence, there is little 
or no ethical ingredient. That is a later thing. The 
evidence that it is so is found in the child’s actions in 
this intellectual period. We saw earlier that the child 
is apt to make all the use of his intelligence that he 
can in what we would describe, from our more advanced 
point of view, as an unethical way. The child is, from 
the third to the fifth year or longer, more intelligent than 
ethical; and he does not hesitate to use his intelligence 
for purposes of personal gratification, and for the decep- 
tion of other persons. He anticipates his father’s reproof, 
and to avoid it covers his deed under a mask of innocence, 
or creates an actual device to avert punishment or to gain 
undeserved reward. He uses his little brother as a screen 
for his own sins, laying the blame for wrong-doing where 
it does not belong, claiming as his own actions which he 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
    
    350 fits Sentiments 
did not perform, concealing his own thoughts and actions 
when it is to his advantage to do so All of this is 
the reverse side of his feeling of dependence. If his 
father did not have the power or the will to punish or 
to reward him, all motive for guile, deception, double- 
dealing, pride-exhibition, vicarious claims, etc., would be 
taken away, as a matter of course. 
This is proved by the actual differences of attitude 
which the child strikes in the presence of different per- 
sons. He does not resort to the same social uses of his 
intelligence in the presence of persons who do not have 
the authority or the strength to inflict penalties or admin- 
ister rewards. He shows an altogether rational degree of 
independence as to their opinions of him and of his con- 
duct. Often the differences of attitude toward the father 
and mother, respectively, on the part of the same child, 
show which it is that excites the strong feeling of depend- 
ence of this intellectual kind. 
There seems to be, therefore, in the life of the child 
a period of development in which circumvention, pro- 
pitiation, deception, of the object of his fear and depend- 
ence characterize his quasi-religious attitude. It must 
be called, I think, in a broad sense religious, if we are 
to recognize it as a real phase of the feeling of depend- 
ence which characterizes religion. Of course we may 
define religion in such a way as to make the presence 
of a developed ethical sense necessary to it; but then we 
find the difficulty, which has confronted the historian no 
less than the theorist, of disposing of those phases of 
primitive rite and ceremony which are mainly self-defen- 
1See the passage above in the chapter on ‘Intelligence’ (Chap. VIL, 
§ 3).
-P-A-G-E-377
  Religious Sentiment 351 
sive, propitiatory, and egoistic, both in the child and 
especially in the race; and which show the tendency of 
the devotee to escape the penalties of his deeds by decep- 
tion, sacrifice, vicarious substitution, or some other conven- 
tional or intellectual device, which he has found effectual 
in his intercourse with his fellow-men. The same need 
of recognizing some such mainly intellectual— largely 
unethical— period in the development of the religious 
sense, is seen also on the side of the other element 
which goes to constitute it—the element of mystery — 
which is to be spoken of in a moment. 
216. (3) The final form which the feeling of dependence 
takes on is ethical. It does not arise until the fulness of 
time has come in the child’s growth. The mental move- 
ments which we have seen to be necessary to ethical 
sentiment — the construction of the material of personal- 
ity in the general way called ideal—must be there in 
sufficient force to arouse a positive attitude of mind 
toward the persons who illustrate the good in the social 
environment. 
When it comes, it takes on the several forms which 
theological writers mention, forms which are such acute 
factors in the religious life of mankind. The feeling of 
ethical dependence involves the same personal helpless- 
ness which the individual felt before in the presence of the 
excellence of the other person, except that it is now also 
ethical helplessness: defect of a permanent kind in the 
presence of the ideal and its demands. This takes the 
form of the sense of szzfulness, as soon as the matter of 
obligation crystallizes in the presence of law. And with 
the sense of sin come various qualitative shadings of emo- 
tion; such as remorse, moral shame, repentance, guilt, etc.  
-P-A-G-E-378
  352 ffis Sentiments 
All this is emphatically an ethical ingredient in the sense 
of religious dependence. 
Then there is with it the element of undeserved help 
and favour which constitute the ejective elements as such, 
characterized in theology as grace ‘and mercy. Here we 
find the strains of emotion felt as sense of forgiveness, 
redemption, moral acceptance and favour, religious as- 
surance, peace, communion with and reliance on tiie 
Higher-than-we. In the lower stages, the need is physi- 
cal and then intellectual; and the dependence is for the 
providing of these needs —the supplementing of our per- 
sonal inadequacy by physical and intellectual succour and 
help. Here, on the contrary, the need is ethical; and 
the dependence is for ethical succour and support. In 
this dependence upon the other for those ethical qualifi- 
cations which we feel to be incomplete and inadequate in 
ourselves, the full religious sense of dependence comes to 
view, and takes its place in the development of man as 
a factor of the first importance. And this in two ways. 
217. First, it is now that the ejective personality toward 
which the religious emotions are directed takes on the 
predicates of ethical meaning. In the earlier stages, to 
be sure, the object of worship, reverence, and reliance 
has been personal; the growth of the sense of person- 
ality lies at the basis of the whole growth of the sense 
of dependence. But the person thought of has not been 
—by necessity could not be—richer or fuller than the 
thought of self which the worshipper himself has attained ; 
and that has not hitherto been ethical. The limitations of 
personality have been proscribed by the worshipper’s own 
personal growth: how can he reach a thought of person- 
ality who shall be ethical before the dawn of that ideal
-P-A-G-E-379
  Religious Sentiment 353 
self in comparison with which the very sense of ethical 
worth takes its rise? 
An the physical period, we should see the deity to 
be the great man, the powerful hero, the giant, the being 
most in likeness to the greater manifestations of physical 
nature, while yet personal. This to the child is likely to 
be his own father, the potentate of his circle. In the 
later intellectual period, again, the deity takes on the 
attributes of cause, arch-plotter, and designer, a being 
in which wisdom waits on wrath, and fore-knowledge 
ministers vengeance to enemies and favours to friends. 
Hence the singular tendency on the part of the child 
in this period to anticipate the dictates of authority and 
propitiate its demands in advance—a period which has 
its illustrations also in some of the most remarkable 
religious rites of the race. Then comes the ethical 
period with its great overturning of things in the presence 
of new ideals. The object of reverence, awe, worship, 
now becomes also a good person, a person who embodies 
the law of duty and right; and the sense of a deity who 
exhibits ethical perfection comes to be the permanent 
acquisition of child and man. 
218. Second, beside this progress in the way the object 
of religious emotion is thought—from the physical up 
through the intellectual categories of cause and design to 
the ethical forms which characterize the higher religious 
consciousness —another general thing may be remarked 
on the social side. We must say, of course, in regard 
to the social value of the sense of dependence, what 
we have said of its religious value—that it varies in 
depth and meaning with the stages of development of the 
child’s sense of personality. In the earliest stage —that
-P-A-G-E-380
  354 ffis Sentiments 
of the first distinction between persons and things in 
the environment—+there is no clear separation of the 
influence of persons, in its results, from the action of 
the physical agents. The amount of community and co- 
operation which is present is largely instinctive and spon- 
taneous. In the next later period, that called intellect- 
ual, the intelligent co-operation of the child with others 
takes the form of a recognition of the others as like 
himself. They are creatures who suffer and enjoy, very 
largely; who use their intelligence for personal ends as 
he uses his; and who, not being subject to general laws, 
are essentially capricious. But now in the last period 
we find the social feature becoming reflective. As we 
saw in considering the ethical sentiments as such, the 
ideal self, which the ethical attitude presupposes, involves 
the thought of another as having the same thoughts of 
himself and the world as the present thinker has. I 
think of myself with praise or blame in a completely 
ethical way, only as I think of the other self, the alter, 
as thinking of me with equal praise or blame. This 
attribution to the other of the same reference of par- 
ticular actions, events, etc., to ideal standards, makes the 
social ingredient an essential factor in ejective personality 
in the ethical world; a place which it does not hold in 
either of the lower stages in which we have found rudimen- 
tary forms of the religious feeling of dependence. The 
ejective ideal self is now thought, necessarily, as in relation 
to me and to you. The religious bond becomes a social 
relationship. Deity is thought as a supreme ‘Socius,’ a 
being who makes certain social and personal require- 
ments of each individual person. And this is to say 
that the deity cannot be thought out of this relation- 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  Religious Sentiment 355 
ship. To attempt it is to attempt to think of a self 
without the ethical attributes. Just in so far as a per- 
son who has himself reached the ethical stage of devel- 
opment attempts this, he constructs a deity which he 
himself cannot worship, a deity which can only excite 
the sort of physical or intellectual compulsion which 
arouses the lower forms of the feeling of dependence 
in the undeveloped child; or, on the other hand, the deity 
becomes an intellectual abstraction. 
It is only in this meaning, I think—this social and 
ethical meaning —that deity can be considered what we 
mean generally by the term ‘divine.’ This term sums up 
the requirements of the religious consciousness. It carries 
both (1) the physical and (2) the intellectual reference, 
under the attributes of omnipotence and ommniscience ; but 
(3) it goes beyond these in having the ethical and social 
meanings of justice, mercy, grace, love, righteousness, which 
exhibit the feeling of dependence in its highest and richest 
form. 
219. Finally, it may be remarked that the tracing of this 
feeling of dependence through the development of the 
child reveals everywhere the essential anthropomorphism 
of the religious consciousness. /The idea of personality sets 
form everywhere to the thought of the being to be wor- 
shipped; and the only possible thought of a person to the 
child is,.a thought which goes out from his own sense 
of self. This supplies the form of the notion of deity 
throughout. We shall see, however, that the other ele- 
ment involved in religious emotion—the element of 
mystery—tends to set limits to the anthropomorphizing 
tendency, while it nevertheless springs directly from it. 
To that aspect of religious sentiment we may now turn, 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
    356 fits Sentiments 
220. II. Feeling of Mystery.—The feature of religious 
emotion which is indicated by this phrase is equally 
striking with that already treated under the head of de- 
pendence. Especially do writers on the history of religion 
find it necessary to dwell on the element of mystery which 
the products of the religious consciousness of mankind 
manifest. From this point of view, as well as from one’s 
private appreciation of the religious state of mind for him- 
self, we are led to think that the phase of the religious 
experience which is usually covered by the terms awe, 
fear, reverence, adoration, etc., is very essential and must 
have had an important place in the entire development ~ 
of this great motive in human experience. Turning to the 
child’s development, we find this expectation fully realized. 
221. In each of the periods of the child’s growth 
already mentioned as respectively the ‘spontaneous,’ the 
‘intellectual,’ and the ‘ethical,’ we find very striking mani- 
festations of the sense of mystery. In the first period, 
in which the movements of the mind are largely under 
the lead of the instinctive and hereditary impulses mani- 
festing themselves in physical actions, the sense of 
mystery is, unlike that of dependence, very undevel- 
oped. |The child suffers from the unexpected and the 
unknown, or enjoys its sudden revelations when they 
are of an agreeable kind; but, inasmuch as these events, 
in order to affect him at all, must be largely in the physi- 
cal world, the reactions which they occasion are in great 
measure expressive of their immediate impressions on his 
organism. 
We very soon begin to find, however, a certain sense 
of the possible hidden meaning of phenomena revealing 
itself in the child. The fear of the dark may be an in-
-P-A-G-E-383
  Religious Sentiment 357 
stance in point. It seems to have no adequate explana 
tion in the child’s actual experiences. And even though 
we should find that the child gets this fear by association, 
the dark would still seem to have its fearful aspect from 
the fact that it symbolizes the unknown and mysterious. 
The child from the first year on also shows the rising 
sense of mystery in his attitude to new toys, mechanical 
contrivances, and events which he cannot understand.!. He 
waits to test the new toy until father has shown him that 
it cannot hurt him. He exercises his curiosity with a wise 
caution, especially when his attention is fixed on living 
things. 
- The child’s first great puzzle of a general kind is pos- 
sibly that of movement. As soon as he gets the regu- 
larity of the mechanical movements of the external objects 
of his environment suitably reduced to order — losing his 
sense of mystery in respect to them, out of sheer famil- 
iarity with them — his sense of the essential strangeness 
of the movements of animate beings is only made more 
emphatic, in contrast with the lawfulness and easy self- 
revelation of things.2 This first shows itself strongly in 
his experience with persons, for they are for a long time 
the only animate beings with which he has anything to 
do. Persons are par excellence the mysterious things to 
the child, and in his early years he strives with might 
and main to understand them. 
This sense is also, from the first, associated very closely 
1 Young children often show fear of strange or unexplained noises. E., in 
her third half-year, was greatly frightened by the mechanical ‘ moo-ing’ of a 
toy cow, and also by the creaking sounds of a doll’s movable legs.

-P-A-G-E-384
  358 Fis Sentiments 
with the sense of dependence which we have already 
traced. ‘The father comes to the boy’s rescue and saves 
him from pain; this arouses both these feelings in a 
complex emotional state; He is made more dependent, 
in his own thought, by his father’s rescue of him when 
he himself was helpless; and, at the same time, he is 
the more mystified by the resources of his father.) As 
he understands more, and reads more of this understand- 
ing into those about him, — making his knowledge ejec- 
tive, —he also grows more aware of their complexity, of 
his essential inability to anticipate their action; and he 
becomes more and more sensible of the profound abyss 
of the ‘projective’ and ‘prospective’ future-of-experience 
of which he stands in ignorance. 
This last is a higher sense of mystery. The intel- 
lectual elements then grow prominent, taking on the 
two great features of content already pointed out as 
characteristic of the intellectual categories of religion, 
those of cause and design. The child busies himself, in 
the second or intelligent period, with the what and the 
why of things and persons; understanding the things 
largely in terms of the persons. We have seen that his 
questioning period is full of these two sorts of knowledge. 
And when we come to ask as to the elements of con- 
tent which these two types of question represent, we see 
again that the question ‘why’ is both later and more 
recondite. As soon as he begins to think much,. he 
begins to ask the ‘why’ even of the things and events of 
which he already understands, or thinks he understands, 
the what. In the great ‘why’ period of the child, from 
the third, say, to the sixth year, his sense of mystery is 
expressed by a perfect siege of the citadel of the parent’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
    Religious Sentiment 359 
personality to explain the commonest occurrences of life. 
The ‘why-question’ is not only the instrument of intel- 
ligence that we have found above; it is also a perpetual 
index of the child’s mystification. 
With all this the sense of mystery tends to lose some- 
what its uninstructed and timorous character, and to take 
on the form of a more intelligent reverence for personality. 
The category of personality becomes in itself, as we have 
seen, a somewhat familiar resort of the child for explain- 
ing both the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of events, and with 
the answer which leads him back to a living agency he 
tends to rest satisfied. This category of personality, 
therefore, in this period, seems to absorb and supersede 
both the other two categories — those of cause and design; 
The child’s mysteries in the universe are largely pooled in 
the one great mystery of personality; and this in turn 
ceases to be the simple mystery of a terrifying outburst 
of force, or a blind agency of wisdom without counsel; it 
becomes the sort of agency of which the child himself 
seems to have an inkling in his own action. 
222. It is natural also, for other reasons, that at this 
period of growing intelligence the child’s sense of the 
obscure and unknown should be turned mainly toward 
persons. It is then that he is most evidently becoming 
aware of the social influences, such as those of the family, 
the school, etc.,-which lead out his own personality in its 
growth through imitation and social absorption. | Social 
heredity is first of all a training in personal appreciation 
of self and others, and an acquiring of social independ- 
ence through the closest sort of personal dependence. 
Invention and independent judgment are only gradually 
achieved ; and all comes through the mysterious leading
-P-A-G-E-386
  360 fits Sentiments 
of others’ personality. So the child does not pool his 
mysteries of his own choice, nor. is it by any conscious 
process of his own that it is done. It is done for him by 
the very conditions of his growth’ up into the ready-made 
conditions of social organization. He cannot help finding 
persons the interesting, instructive, difficult-to-understand 
objects; and there springs up in him, spontaneously in 
the first place, and reflectively in the second place, a sense 
of the potencies and obscurities of personal life, which 
only grows more profound as he himself grows more 
intelligent and better informed.! 
This puzzle of persons shows itself at this period in 
certain concrete social situations. Having found a sort of 
solvent of his intellectual difficulties, as respects the what 
and the why, in the ascribing of personal agency to all 
mysterious things—a general anthropomorphic way of 
reading the events of nature —he finds the mystery again 
in the singular actions of personal agents; in their treat- 
ment of each other and of him. Before his ethical sense 
struggles up to the light, the ethical situation is an abso- 
lute puzzle to him. His understanding of the actions of 
persons is, in the main, a reference of them to one of two 
of his thoughts of self — what have been called the 
‘habitual’ self and the ‘accommodating’ self. He can 
understand the actions of others which are frankly selfish, 
and also those which are frankly generous; but those 
which do not go clearly into either of these two categories 
now excite his sense of mystery. 
/This mystery tells very heavily upon the child’s life, 
1 So also in religious systems, the profoundest mysteries are those arising 
about the construction of divine personality, such as incarnation, human and 
divine natures in one, the trinity, etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
  Religious Sentiment 361 
in very truth. No one can watch a four-year-old in the 
household without remarking his embarrassed anxiety in 
the presence of the ethical controversies, arrangements, 
arguments, perhaps disputes, which inevitably arise in the 
family circle from time to time. The elders will some- 
times come through an earnest conversation on good or 
evil only to find the forgotten auditor from the nursery in 
tears in the presence of the mystery of their conversation. 
Or again, the little fellow will appeal to you to help the 
beggar, and show his mystification that you do not follow 
out the generous impulses which you have encouraged 
him to show to his playmates. The little girl of five fails 
to understand why the visitor should be allowed to take 
the biggest sugar-plum in the dish while she has been 
forbidden to do so. This is the beginning of a standing 
mystery; a mystery of all life which we never really un- 
ravel, although we get to reflect on it more maturely, 
and to introduce consciously a higher series of personal 
values called the good and the right. But to the child 
the mysterious elements have no solvent, and he can only 
see in the persons who act in these complex ways beings 
to revere, depend upon, and ‘wonder’ at. 
So in the light of all that has been said, it is clear that 
the sense of religious mystery is, almost from the first, 
felt in and about personal action and character; and in 
the period of growing intelligence it becomes an intense 
straining toward the revelation of personal and social life 
which goes on to be made in the ethical epoch following. 
223. Coming, then, to the third or ethical period in the 
child’s development, the feeling of mystery is seen, like 
1 The anthropological or racial manifestations of this early mystery-feeling 
or ‘wonder’ have been given full description by writers on primitive religion.
-P-A-G-E-388
  362 fits Sentiments 
that of dependence, to take on its highest form. Again 
here, as with the feeling of dependence, we might inquire 
whether real religious sentiment has been present before. 
And we can only answer by saying that lower forms of 
the feeling of mystery have certainly been present earlier ; 
the rest is a matter of definition. But that aside, as the 
ethical sense now grows up, the growing sense of person- 
ality becomes the theatre of new and still more profound 
mysteries to the child. He now gets within himself the 
new thought of personality called the ideal, which de- 
mands recognition over and above the rival selves which 
have hitherto played back and forth in his mind. 
Here, now, the call to conformity to a set of examples 
which are essentially mysterious, is xo longer altogether 
outside him; but the real scene of its rise is ix his own 
breast. The ethical and the social, properly so called, 
are distinguished from the lower emotional states in just 
this, that they contain both the ego and the alter sense 
held in one general ideal thought. The ethical predicates, 
duty, responsibility, rightness, etc., come up about the 
relationships which hold between the partial selves on the 
one hand, and this supreme ideal self on the other. Now, 
therefore, when the child comes to make ejective this 
highest reach of his personal thought, the resulting postu- 
late of the ethical and religious nature is a divine being 
whose perfections call out the more refined emotional 
attitudes of ethical dependence and mystery. All these 
feelings are now directed toward a being whose nature 
is essentially e¢kical and social. The content of the notion 
of deity in the child’s mind, from the time when child- 
hood is passing into youth, is an ethical and social content. 
Mystery then becomes ethical reverence and awe; the
-P-A-G-E-389
Religious Sentiment 363 
reverence felt by that great philosopher who found ‘the 
moral law within me’ one of the objects of his most 
profound meditation. 
This period is so pregnant with lessons that I venture 
to throw them into certain formal statements which may 
stand as our concluding words on the development of the 
religious sense, inasmuch as in them the lessons of both 
the phases of religious experience are had in view. 
224. First, the ethical child — and man too — must think 
of God as thinking of him; as having a positive ethical 
attitude toward him. His own mysterious but imperative 
self-judgment can only be clear when the child thinks 
also of the other person as sharing his own self-com- 
mendation or self-condemnation. The element of social 
publicity is, as we have seen, a real part of the content 
on the basis of which the ethical emctions go forth. So, 
in the process which follows in his ejective religious 
life, he must think ‘Thou God seest me,’ just as he 
thinks in his daily life ‘father and mother are judging 
me.’ 
225. Second, in this highest stretch, therefore, of the 
religious life into which the child is now entering, God is 
a real person, standing in real relations of ethical approval 
and disapproval—says the religious sense—of me who 
worship him. My worship is a recognition not mainly 
of his existence, —that cannot even be a question in the 
spontaneous religious development of consciousness, — 
but of his excellence. The divine person is, in the 
religious life, very much the same sort of a postulate that 
the social fellow is in the ethical life, and that the world 
of external and personal relationships is in the intellectual 
life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
364 Fits Sentiments 
226. Third, yet in the interpretation of this postulate, 
in the attempt to pass from the stage of sentiment into 
that of dogma—the attempt which is a necessary mental 
movement, and which even the child makes — the intelli- 
gence is baffied both by the limitations of its own growth, 
and by the very ‘projective’ and ‘prospective’ nature of 
the movement upon which the religious sense rests. With- 
out the mysteries, religion would be knowledge to be re- 
cited —the individual’s mind would be the only thing in 
the universe to reverence — which is to say that the ideal 
would be no longer an ideal, but a fact of experience. The 
child shows this in his very temporary satisfaction with 
the personal embodiments of his reverence. He must 
pass on to the stage in which the real thing about char- 
acter is just the general or ideal thing which no single 
character completely shows. When he comes to eject 
this ideal, we see him struggling with the essential con- 
tradiction which this involves from an intellectual point 
of view — the attempt, z.e., to think a particular individual 
who yet has not the limitations which it is essential to 
his knowledge of individuality that they should have. 
Omnipotence, omniscience, spiritual presence with no local 
body, social wisdom, ‘ethical perfection, all sorts of infini- 
tude,—these attributes trouble him; and it is just the 
need of thinking them to which he is driven, at the same 
time that he cannot find categories of imitative or experi- 
mental knowledge for thinking them, which plunges him 
into the most profound sense of mystery, and initiates him 
into his most stirring religious experiences. 
227. Fourth, the essential mysticism of the religious 
consciousness lives to the last. It takes on certain semi- 
differentiated forms for which we have words of more or   
-P-A-G-E-391
  Religious Sentiment 365 
less adequate import. We have seen that the sense of 
dependence throws the child into certain emotional states 
which go by different names; it is only a proof of the 
oneness of religious sentiment, and of the oneness withal 
of the intellectual and personal growth which reaches its 
highest fruitage in it, that the sense of mystery shows 
itself everywhere in similar attitudes. Here we find rever- 
ence, which is none the less a sense of mystery because the 
Mysterious is at the same time that which we trust: awe 
whose object is none the less good and trustworthy because 
it is awfully mysterious; fear, which is none the less whole- 
some because it leads to deeds of submission, of propitia- 
tion, of confession, and of faith. 
228. This brief survey of the elements involved in the 
development of the religious consciousness may be brought 
to a close by a word as to the real matter of which reli- 
gion, as an institution, takes cognizance. Looking broadly 
at the result of our thought on the subject, we may gather 
up our view in the general position that the religious senti- 
ment is everywhere dependent upon the personal growth 
of the individual as a whole —his intelligence, his conduct, 
his emotion. The growth of his intellectual constructions 
of personal reality gives him a basis for anticipating moral 
and social events, and for endeavouring, by what we may 
call an act of faith —the outreach seen in all the prospec- 
tive references of his growth, toward the newer event of 
that on which he depends, and the newer manifestation of 
that of which he stands in awe, —to put himself in har- 
mony with the general and ideal personal realities of the 
universe. His striving shows itself in the institutions of 
religion ; and his justification of it is his faith. So instead 
of the formula of Matthew Arnold: ‘ Religion is morality
-P-A-G-E-392
  366 ffis Sentiments 
touched with emotion,’ I should prefer to say, from the 
study of the psychology of development: Religion is emo- 
tion kindled by faith, emotion being reverence for a Person 
and faith being dependence upon Him. 
So the child who gropes for his father, the savage who 
bows before his stock, the ecclesiastic who enforces a 
dogma, the pietist who lives on herbs,—all these, as 
well as the mystic who contemplates the unseen, and the 
rationalist who still believes something that he does not 
see, all of them are religious! 
229. The place of religion in social development is, in 
view of its dependence upon the growth of self at all its 
stages, that of emotion of the social sort. It becomes 
most important in its alliance with the ethical life in the 
higher reaches of human development. This is discussed 
further under the head of the ‘Ethical and Religious 
Sanctions,’ below (Chap. X., § 4). 
1 The various aspects of Religion (its evolution, its psychology, etc.) are 
gone over in encyclopedic articles by various hands in the Dict. of Philos. to 
which reference has already been made. My own contribution in that place, 
as well as here, emphasizes the ‘ Unity of Religious Experience, its develop- 
ment as exhibiting the evolution of an intellectual content, the ‘Idea’ of God 
as a person, as over against the varieties of religious experience as illustrated 
in Professor James’ book of that title. The way to understand religion in my 
opinion is to interpret its advance to the highest and richest intellectual and 
emotional content; not by a study of its abnormalities and obsessions, to 
‘understand’ it in terms of the crude disorganized nervous processes of 
hysteria.

THE PERSON’S SANCTIONS? 
CHAPTER IX 
His PERSONAL SANCTIONS 
230. We have now attempted to trace the development 
of the social individual in such a way as to get a tolerably 
complete idea of his equipment at each of the critical 
epochs of his life; our inquiry has also, in some degree, 
indicated the character of the social environment in which 
he disports himself. Coming to look a little more objec- 
tively at his actions in society, we see that another very 
important question arises for consideration. 
This question has to do with the individual mainly, and 
concerns the disposition he shows to accept the conditions 
of social life, and live his life as a citizen good or bad. 
As a matter of fact, we find that he usually accepts 
things as they exist. Philosophers have attempted to 
argue that he should not};,that his life is not worth his 
while; that he has his fate in his own hands; and that 
it is at least an open question\to each, as he grows to 
maturity and gets an intelligent view of the human tur- 
moil called life, whether he will enter the lists or volun- 
1On the general topic of ‘ Sanction,’ considered in its social bearings, the 
reader should consult Stephen on ‘ Theory of Social Motives,’ Sctence of Ethics, 
Chap. III.; and Mill, Usi/itarianism, Chap. III., with whose distinction between 
‘internal’ and ‘external’ sanctions may be compared that between the ‘ per- 
sonal’ and ‘social’ sanctions of this work. See the topic ‘Sanction,’ in my 
Dict. of Philos.

tarily withdraw. Yet, as I have said, men do not 
generally withdraw, although the means of self-destruc- 
tion lie ready at hand. This is the fact, and there must 
be reasons for the fact; reasons which in some way 
actuate the man himself in maintaining his life and social 
place. Moreover, we may see, by a little more reflection, 
that these reasons are of two general classes according as 
we take the point of view of the single man, or of society 
as a whole. If we call all the reasons which are really 
operative on the individual, in keeping him at work and 
at play in the varied drama of life, his ‘sanctions,’ then 
there seem to be two great classes of such sanctions. 
(1) We may try to find the reasons which a man sets 
before himself, the conscious objects which he sets up for 
pursuit, the ends of life as he is accustomed to pursue 
them, 47s own sanctions for the activities in which he 
engages. Let us for the purposes of discussion call these 
his ‘personal sanctions,’ and ask: what are the personal 
sanctions ? 
(2) The other class of influences which bear on the 
individual man, to keep him in line with the requirements 
of life, are those of a social kind which he does not him- 
self take into account consciously nor attempt to reckon 
with. They are the agencies which in a measure—at 
least we may say so at the start for the purposes of dis- 
tinction —lie outside his own thought and control, but 
which he actually recognizes simply because they are 
there. Such, for example, is the civil law. These in- 
fluences we may call ‘social sanctions,’ and ask: what 
are the social sanctions ? 
Besides these two great topics, there is then the third 
and most important of all, in the sequel; the topic as to 
          
    
    
    
    
        
           
-P-A-G-E-395
  
ffis Personal Sanctions 369 
how these two sorts of sanctions are related to each other, 
and how the man comes to act as he does under the 
influence of the two together. In this chapter we shall 
consider the Personal Sanctions. 
231. We have now grown sufficiently familiar with the 
general method of development in the mental life to lead 
us to think that the notion of sanction, in order to have 
general application, must be wide enough to describe, 
from its own point of view, each of the great epochs of 
mental evolution in the individual. The child at six, no 
less than the youth at sixteen and the man at sixty, must 
have sanctions for his acts. There must be a develop- 
ment in the idea of sanction —if it is to be a real thing 
—as there is in the mental life to which it applies. The 
neglect of this distinction seems to have been the source of 
many fallacies to be found in the works of Hobbes and 
Comte, on one side of political theory, and those of Thomas 
Hill Green, on the other! The tendency has been to limit 
the concept of sanction to the meaning which it has in the 
higher reflective life: either to rational motives in the indi- 
vidual, or to formulated statutes and penalties in social life. 
Thus many writers have been accustomed to understand 
by a man’s sanction his own conscious justification, the 
reasons which he himself has in mind, in a more or less 
clearly formulated way, for having an end, rathet than the 
mere having of the end, considered as its own sanction. 
The difficulty with such a form of thought is that it 
draws artificial limits by constraint of narrow definition. 
The theory of political life has suffered from this, much 
as the theory of ethics has suffered from a narrow reflec- 
tive definition of the word ‘motive.’ In the discussion of 
ends, above, we have seen how the conception of the mind, 
     
-P-A-G-E-396
  370 fis Personal Sanctions 
as a developing thing which never loses its connection 
with the vitality of the physical organism, leads us to the 
further thought that mental growth never proceeds fer 
saltum. The broader and more generic we are able to 
make all the concepts of mental life, the more adequate 
and unembarrassing will they be. The biologist has long 
since learned the necessity of this in dealing with prob- 
lems of evolution. Claiming the right to do so in this 
case, —and leaving to the result to justify the use of the 
term given below, — we may go on to show the actual in- _ 
fluences which work as sanctions in the inJividual’s mind - 
at his successive stages of development. The conclusion 
will show better, perhaps, than words could at this stage 
of our progress, that the individual’s formulation of the 
reasons for his action are in no sense always the same as, 
the actual reasons; and that the very distinetion between 
his ability and his inability to formulate his réasons is in 
itself a vital distinction in his personal and social growth. 
In other words, the matter is not one of definition only; 
but one of material content. The following pages, there- 
fore, will use the term in this s@.se: @ sanction is any 
 gtound or reason which is adequate to initiate action, 
whether the actor be conscious or jot that this is the ground 
| or reason of the resulting action. 7x example, the senseld s 
outcry {) 4he lunatic has its sanction in the disord- ut 
condition of his faculties, although he think himse™ 3} 
and the voluntary calculation of the burglar has <s saric- 
tion in the reward which he sets before himself. The :e 
two cases are given, from the opposite “nds of the sca 
to illustrate the limits of the term as I am going on -.o 
use it. 
  232. When we come with so much of introduction to
-P-A-G-E-397
  His Personal Sanctions 371 
cast a wide glance over the details of mental development, 
certain milestones, which we have now grown accustomed 
to look for, show out white and make the course before 
us less difficult. We have already had much evidence, 
both in theory and in practice, for the position that at 
least three great epochs of human life unroll themselves 
in order in each growing child; I have called them the 
spontaneous, the intelligent, and the ideal or ethical 
epochs.!' This way of looking at the epochs of personal 
growth, it will be remembered, arose not from conven- 
ience, much less)from theory, but from the actual stretches 
or levels of mental attainment on the part of the child, 
which are, as a magter of fact, so clearly distinguished that 
it is impossible to overlook them. 
To illustrate, in the matter of sanction, we may cite 
three actions: the two-year-old’s (or the dog’s) cry for 
_food, the five-year-old’s run to avoid the punishment due _ 
“to his:lie, and the nun’s act of attachment to the consola- 
tions of religion. I do not mean that these typical men- 
tal states are on the surface different-looking merely, nor 
that their differences «jight not be differently construed 
oy. different competent judges; but what I mean to si 
is that from the point pea of development, the: actor _ 
of che first could not with 
wit ent in him — perform the second action, ne <y SEC- 
Ou a, YW, the third’action. All the reasons for the dif- 
feience: reed not be exhausted; but the real one which 
in-judes the rest has been found, I think, in the progress 
ithe actor in th: thought of his own personal self. 
rt 
1 In considering the emotions, we found an earlier ‘instinctive’ period, and 
then spoke of the intelligent and ethical together. We here have no need to 
separate the so-called ‘instinctive’ and ‘spontaneous’ periods, 
    eason— with any sanction then BS
-P-A-G-E-398
  372 fis Personal Sanctions 
So assuming the former characterizations as in a meas- 
ure at least true, we should expect to find three great 
classes of reasons for action in these periods respectively, 
three great personal sanctions for conduct; they may be 
called by analogy with the epochs in which they arise, 
respectively, the Sanction of /mpulse, the Sanction of 
Desire, and the Sanction of Right. 
$1. The Sanction of Impulse 
233. It is not necessary that we should stop long upon 
this lowest of all the categories of human action; espe- 
cially as it is not realized in its purity outside of the 
nursery and the reform or criminal institution. In the 
child we find impulse at its best. It is there not compli- 
cated by the wreck of higher faculties, as in the insane; 
nor by interference from them as in the sane of an older 
growth; nor is it restrained by the agencies which give 
society its influence at a later period. We are amused 
at the child’s innocent impulses, put a screen about him 
to keep him from toying with the hurtful, and give him 
the privileges due to his extreme youth. This very toler- 
ation of impulse, where it is all the endowment to be seen 
in the creature which shows it, is in itself a sufficient war- 
rant for the owner’s own confidence in his sanction. . T, 
natural and the normal is its own sanction, we say, 1 
effect; and in so far as this is not true, we let it show 
its own incompetence. It is thus we tolerate the beasts 
about us. We do not seek to lead them out of what we 
might think to be a very inferior and imperfect realization 
of the possibilities of life. The defective classes and the 
lunatics of the types whose impulses are magnified in
-P-A-G-E-399
    The Sanction of Impulse 373 
dangerous directions, we shut up, it is true, yet not for 
their sakes, but for our own. But if we were all at their 
level, if we were all children of the same age, or animals 
of the same flock, or lunatics of the same lack, even this 
limitation upon impulse would be impossible. 
Yet when we come to ask for the reason that such 
impulsive action, when uncomplicated by higher pro- 
cesses, seems to carry its own sanction, we see that it 
is still incumbent upon us to seek it out. In this case 
it reduces itself very largely to the biological and psycho- 
logical question as to the terminus ad quem of the impulse. 
Even the blindest, most unpremeditated, action has a mean- 
ing in the scheme of life which has some vague representa- 
tion in the creature’s consciousness ; how rich a meaning it 
may become and still be blind is seen in the creations of the 
instinct of certain insects. So the question as to the sanc- 
tion here may carry with it also that of the life-function 
of the actions of which the question is asked. And it is 
the more important, since, as we shall see below, this low- 
est sanction, which expresses simply the general teleology 
of the life-processes as a whole, never in all the higher de- 
velopments gets entirely vacated of its force. It is largely 
replaced, modified, inhibited, and much hidden in the 
child’s later life when volition, thought, sentiment, come 
in to enrich it; but the man never ceases to be, with it 
all, in some degree, a creature of impulse acting with the 
biological machinery which he has in common with the 
babe and the beast. 
Coming to inquire, accordingly, into the meaning and 
reason of the impulses of the child in this earliest stage, 
we are able to invoke a recent formulation of psychology 
which puts the case in general terms. It is now a widely
-P-A-G-E-400
  374 ffs Personal Sanctions 
accepted doctrine that all motor activities have risen through 
adaptation to environment; that is, as affording appropri- 
ate response to stimulation. The fixing of motor processes 
in the individual is through repetition or its equivalent; 
and this repetition is secured by the tendencies of the 
organism to acquire habits of keeping up actions which 
have proved themselves vitally beneficial. The species, 
we may assume, perpetuates such actions through natural 
selection. It follows that we may at once make the gen- 
eral statement that any form of action which a creature 
habitually shows must be directed toward a more or less 
definite class of sensory conditions or stimulations which the 
environment furnishes, as a suitable zerminus of the acts in 
question. Generalizing this, we may say that the mean- 
ing and value of the particular action is found in the 
stimulus which it aims to reach and secure. The sanction, 
then, if we care to call it such, at this early stage of devel- 
opment, is found in the objective conditions under which 
the action of the organism comes into operation; and this 
for two reasons. First, it is by adaptation to these con- 
ditions that any particular action has come to be what 
it is, and to differentiate itself from other actions; and it 
is only by such a differentiation, and on the ground of it, 
that we can ask the question of sanction of the particu- 
lar reaction at all. And second, the future adaptation, 
progress, and very life indeed of the organism rests upon 
the continuance of the stimulations which its reaction alone 
serves to secure. There seems to be, therefore, both a ret- 
rospective and a prospective reasonableness, so to speak, 
in the thought that the biological sanction of the reaction 
is the beneficial experience which the reaction serves to 
absorb, continue, and render permanently available.
-P-A-G-E-401
The Sanction of Impulse 375 
    
                                                          But this is evidently not in the mind of the organism, or 
of the child himself. Whether we ask why he reacts or 
why he thinks, still his mind is not filled up with the bio- 
logical or psychological value of his act. At the lowest 
stage —the purely impulsive — when the question is one 
simply as to what antecedents in the child’s own mind 
issue in this action or that, his mind is thoroughly objec- 
tive. The object before him fills up his consciousness; he 
thinks nothing adout it, he simply thinks 77. His action 
goes out in the channels of inherited tendency, directly 
upon the object. So in it we have the justification of his 
conduct. Everything is so simple in his mind that it is 
impossible to make a complex thing out of it. He acts 
because it is his nature to —that is his only and adequate 
reason. He himself, when we ask him why he acted so 
and so, says: ‘I don’t know,’ or ‘I couldn’t help it.’ And 
we say the same of it when we behold the child or an 
adult of weak mind or overpowering impulse. 
234. These two ways of looking at the matter may be 
distinguished with some emphasis for reasons of clearness 
in the subsequent epochs of growth, when they become of 
some importance. Let us call the former — the biological 
or psychological reasons for action which we are able to 
find out, from our theory of development, but of which the 
child himself is finely ignorant—the odjective sanction ; 
and then we may go on to call the reasons which the 
agent himself sets before him for his action the subjective 
sanction. This is a distinction which ethical writers have a 
to maintain in their doctrine of ends; a doctrine with 
which our present topic has much in common. We then 
may say, in view of the suggestions made above on the 
condition of things in the impulsive epoch, that the sanc-  
-P-A-G-E-402
  376 fits Personal Sanctions | 
tion in this epoch is of two sorts: the objective sanction, 
which is the sanction of fact or of theory; and the sub- 
jective sanction, which is the sanction of necessity. The 
sanction of fact or theory in the case of all ce prod- 
ucts is, in the current state of biological opinion, what is 
sometimes called the sanction of fitness, or the sanction 
of survival! The sanction of necessity, on the other hand, 
is, like the other, equally ultimate from the psychological 
point of view, since it represents the final psychological 
fact—the initial form of activity which we find accom- 
panied by consciousness. 
We may say, therefore, after these explanations, that 
we have here two ways of looking at the conditions of 
the problem. Both are at their simplest in this stage of 
mental development. And we may give them simple com- 
mon-sense terms throughout the discussions which follow; 
z.¢., let us call the psychological sanction which is ordi- 
narily described very justly under the term necessity, as 
the ‘sanction of impulse.’ Such usage will carry its own 
meaning, and be readily understood by psychologists. 
The other sort of sanction may best be described, apart 
from biological and philosophical theory, as the ‘sanction 
of fact.’ 
In tracing the development of the ‘personal’ sanction, 
—as we have called the individual’s reasons for action, 
as contrasted with those which arise from social organiza- 
tion, -— we will have little to do with the ‘sanction of fact’ 
as such; the further development of the person’s private 
1It is evident that ‘fitness’ would apply both to the individual’s functions 
and to the racial qualities which survive; and if we agree that the individual’s 
actions are also selected by ‘functional selection’ from over-produced move- 
ments, the test of ‘survival’ would also apply to them. Cf. my Mental De- 
velopment, pp. 174 ff.

    The Lower Hedonic Sanction By 
mental life is mainly an evolution proceeding out from the 
‘sanction of impulse.’ 
§ 2. The Lower Hedonic Sanction 
235. Even in the impulsive life the great facts of pleas- 
ure and pain encounter us; facts which no theory of the 
active life can ignore. However we may be disposed 
to argue about the place of these facts in psychological 
theory, we may for our present purpose —taking advan- 
tage of the distinction just made —look simply at these 
states as elements of consciousness which come in to influ- 
ence action. And throwing the two, pleasure and pain, 
together under the phrase ‘hedonic consciousness,’ we 
may say that the first departure from the simple sanction 
of impulse which we are able to observe in the child is 
toward what may be called the ‘hedonic sanction.” The 
child begins very early to act with reference to the hedonic 
quality of his experience. He no longer takes impulse at 
its face value, and all impulses at equal value. His experi- 
ence is wonderfully coloured by pain and wonderfully illu- 
mined by pleasure. Quick associations are formed between 
acts and their consequences for the mental life; and where 
association is too long a process to wait for, certain ap- 
pearances suggestive of pain or pleasure are sufficient to 
warn, counsel, and instruct him. All this is a matter of 
such general recognition as fact — apart from the theories 
by which it may be explained — that we may simply state 
it without fear of dispute. 
The direct result of this injection of the hedonic element 
into experience is the modification of impulse, not only as 
regards the purity of its issue in action, but as regards the

form of the impulse itself. The hedonic ingredient does 
not follow upon action simply as its result; it is, by the 
quick associative and suggestive processes spoken of, 
welded upon the stimulations to which the organism is © 
called upon to react. The stimulus arising from an object 
becomes the stimulation of a pleasurable or painful object. 
And the reaction which follows upon it now represents 
not the attitude to the object per se, taken alone, but to 
the whole source of stimulation, including the hedonic 
quality which the object has acquired. So the object 
serving as terminus for reaction is now different ; the 
child is now sharply conscious of the pleasure or pain 
aspect of the things with which he deals, more conscious 
in some cases of this aspect than of the mere cognition or 
presentative elements which before appealed to him for 
recognition. 
As a result of this we find a very marked and subtle 
sense growing up in his mind; a sense of the worth of the 
things and events of life in terms of their hedonic aspect. 
It is an advance upon the simple impulsive consciousness 
which we have described — more or less artificially, it is 
true — in the earlier pages. And to this we have to give 
recognition in our progress toward a further statement of 
his personal sanctions. 
236. This early effect of pleasure and pain must not be 
confused, however, with what is ordinarily called love of 
pleasure and fear of pain; that is more complex and 
comes later. At the stage of which we now speak, the 
influence of pleasure or pain is not an influence distinct 
from that of the object upon which the child acts. On 
the contrary, it is a part, an aspect, of that object. In 
any case of urgency, the situation as a whole it is which
-P-A-G-E-405
    The Lower Hedonic Sanction 379 
appeals to the child for action. He does not weigh the 
object over against the pain and choose between them. 
He takes an attitude appropriate to the situation as a 
whole. And even in the case in which the pain prospect 
does seem to stand out in opposition to the remaining ele- 
ments of the stimulating situation, and draw him in a con- 
trary direction, even then he does not picture to himself 
the pain as such, as a reason for acting or refraining from 
action; even here his hesitation is due, I think, to the fact 
that a new object with a different hedonic colouring comes 
to oppose an old one; and he has a conflict of impulses of 
which one is more especially identified with the highly 
coloured hedonic cause or event. The cases in which 
pleasure is intelligently pursued and pain avoided come 
under the later sanction of desire. 
237. I think, therefore, that we may safely say that the 
individual finds himself sometimes in a position in which 
the sanction of impulse is complicated by a further hedonic 
sanction. And the effect of this is that there is instituted 
an inhibition upon the purely impulsive action. The he- 
donic sanction comes in to replace and annul the sanction 
of impulse. The child reaches for the fire by impulse; 
that alone, apart from experience, is sufficient sanction for 
the act; but the pain that follows comes, on the next 
occasion, to be a part of the very stimulation which the 
fire as a situation presents; and now the newer sanction 
of pain comes in to inhibit the reaching movement. So 
it is throughout all the life of pleasure and pain. It may 
suffice to remark that this much is sufficient for the theory 
of sanction at this stage, far as it may yet be from an 
adequate statement of a theory of pleasure and pain 
reactions. The question as to how far the reaction to
-P-A-G-E-406
  380 Fits Personal Sanctions 
pleasure or pain is itself impulsive, is of course an open 
one, and a theory from the psychological point of view 
should answer it. Here it is just our object to avoid these 
psychological questions and to aim only at putting plainly 
out the actual stages through which the child goes in his 
development toward a full consciousness of the grounds 
of his conduct. 
This so-called ‘hedonic sanction’ is not confined to the 
life of the young child. On the contrary, it is a very 
gross and prominent feature of our common unreflective 
life. We say to the man who is wild with toothache that 
he may be excused from the amenities of polite social 
intercourse; his pain sanctions any amount of brutality 
to the unfortunate who comes in his way. We excuse 
the man to whom a fortune has been left if his feelings 
are expressed in a way which annoys his neighbours. The 
banging of crackers and noise of rioting is*excused on 
occasions of patriotic demonstration— high feeling is their 
sanction. And some of the subtler processes of sympathy 
and tacit justification, in society such, for example, as 
the sending of flowers to condemned criminals, the hero- 
worship of the successful gambler, etc. —seem to reflect 
the sense in some that a desperate or a brilliant hedonic 
situation is in some degree its own sanction. This is true 
to the greater extent, according as we are able, at the 
same time, to reduce the situation, as it takes shape in 
the actor’s mind, to a form which excludes from his cog- 
nizance all more intellectual and sentimental elements. 
It is very difficult to punish the boy who commits an act 
of daring crime, after the examples of criminal literature ; 
for we feel that the highest elements of the boy’s nature, 
then so immature, really united in the general hedonic
-P-A-G-E-407

situation which success presented to him. While on the 
pathological side the expression ‘crazed with grief or 
terror’ really shows that suffering or joy may sanction 
almost any conduct, by breaking down for the moment the 
higher barriers which intelligence and morality commonly 
erect. 
§ 3. The Sanction of Desire 
238. The next epoch of the child’s life is that which 
has been called the epoch of intelligence. We need not 
stop to trace the development of this stage of his progress, 
since we may assume, from the former analysis, some- 
thing of the method of it. The characteristics of the 
period, considered over against the earlier or spontaneous 
period, have also been described. It remains here to 
analyze out a little more closely the reasons for action 
which prompt him in this great period of his attainment, 
and see what relation they bear to the earlier forms of his 
personal sanction. 
The word ‘desire’ covers an essential aspect of intelli- 
gent action both in popular speech and in psychological 
science. In popular speech intelligent action is action 
which shows foresight. In psychological terms it is 
action which is directed to an end. The main thing in 
both these usages is the distinction which they make 
between such action, and that which does not show fore- 
sight, or does not have an end in view. The nature of 
this end we have touched upon briefly on an earlier page, 
where we saw the difference between the simple sug- 
gested or impulsive action which looks only to the ter- 
minus present in the immediate situation or stimulating 
event, and that which has foresight for what is to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  382 fits Personal Sanctions 
degree distant in space and time. So when we come to 
ask the sanction for the action which we call intelligent, 
we are led to ask how the fact of having a more or less 
remote end complicates the consciousness of action. 
239. Appeal to fact shows that there are again two 
cases which should be carefully distinguished. In the 
first place, there is the action which is still of the impul- 
sive type; and second, there is the action of the hedonic 
type (applying that phrase to acts which are influenced 
by the presence of the hedonic colouring, as already de- 
scribed); both, however, being now at the higher level 
of desire. 
In the one case the simple thought of the end or object 
sets agoing the desire to compass or attain it. This we 
may call ‘spontaneous’ desire. It is relatively compli- 
cated, and follows more or less deliberation on alternative 
courses of action, with voluntary choice of the particular 
end or thought which the actor goes on to realize. But 
still it has in common with impulse the character that it 
is the objective terminus —the thing or event — on which 
the energies of realization are bent. The object is for- 
ward and soul-filling in the lower forms of desire. There 
is very little thought of self, of the remote ends to be 
striven for, of distinction and choice of means, of de- 
sirable or undesirable consequences. The child sets his 
face toward an object, a thing, and lets the action neces- 
sary to its attainment take care of itself, very largely 
by the same impulsive and semi-automatic outgo which 
characterizes the epoch of impulse. As before, the sanc- 
tion is almost or quite contained in the necessity of im- 
pulse and suggestion, but these are complicated. 
240. But we soon find a change coming over the youth-
-P-A-G-E-409
   The Sanction of Desire 383 
ful consciousness with the growth of his reflection. We 
have seen this growth most richly and normally in the 
development of the child’s own personal self; in the 
thought he has of himself, and the antithesis which he 
gets between himself and the ‘other-self’ of his playmate 
or parent. This is so all-embracing a growth that other 
concerns of the child, in the epoch between the second 
and fifth years, say, sink into relative insignificance. This 
growth in personal completeness shows itself in ‘reflective’ 
desire. 
To be brief, we may say that in ‘reflective’ desire there 
is a growing tendency to the implication of the sense of 
self. The slowly developing synthesis which stands for 
self is set over against the partial events of experience, 
the whole against the isolated parts, and just as the syn- 
thesis of self has already grown to be what it is by the 
incorporation and assimilation of new elements from ex- 
perience, so the process tends to complete and extend 
itself. The measure of success in the past is reflected in 
the attitudes toward the events of the future. Discrimi- 
nation in the value of events is due to the operation of 
the assimilating tendencies which former syntheses have 
established. The hedonic colouring of the former experi- 
ences has arisen from the degree of adaptation, or the 
contrary, of detached experiences to the demands of per- 
sonal growth; the ratification of the adaptations, and 
revulsion from the misadaptations, gives just the twofold 
attitude of desire. So there comes now into conscious- 
ness a tendency on the part of the child to reflect — to 
weigh the new as well as the old—by the standards of 
reference supplied by his thought of self. Can I apper- 
ceive this thing consistently with the former apperceptive  
-P-A-G-E-410
  384 ffis Personal Sanctions 
system built up in experience, or will it tend to disintegra- 
tion? The former demand is presented by my states of 
positive desire, which are indices of the advantage, the 
pleasure, of living as a person. The latter represents my 
repulsions, — my negative desires, my states of pain, as I 
think of myself in the light of my own history. 
Reflective desire, is, therefore, the concrete determination 
of the sense of self. It represents motor integrations about 
to issue in particular pathways. It is the conserving, 
assimilating, compacting engine of experience, by which 
the old adjustments of materials in the unity of a self are 
reinstated; this on the side of habit, of retrospective 
reference. But desire is also the agent of the further 
development of the self-sense, since it is through the 
imitative aspect of desire, the aspect under which desire 
secures new accommodations, new satisfactions, that new 
increments are made to personal attainment, and the self- 
nucleus is enlarged. It has thus always a prospective 
reference as well, which is very prominent in the psy- 
chosis itself. 
241. Now if this is what desire is, considered geneti- 
cally as a state of mind, what shall we say of the sanctions 
which arise for the intelligent actions prompted by desire? 
In answer to this question it is well to look at the so-called 
“end of desire’ a little more closely. 
Remembering our earlier result as to the end of intel- 
ligent action !— that it is simply the content itself which 
furnishes an appropriate terminus for the act—that is 
a sufficient determination also of the end of desire of 
the spontaneous kind. But certain of its implications 
in the case of reflective desire should be pointed out. 
3 Above, Chap, VII., § 1 (especially Sect. 161).
-P-A-G-E-411
   The Sanction of Destre 385 
If the genetic function of reflective desire is to set action 
in directions which conserve and forward the assimilative 
and progressive synthesis of self, then, is not the end of 
desire what the idealistic thinkers are telling us — self 
realization? Undoubtedly, it seems to me, when looked 
at from a theoretical point of view. But is it not equally 
clear that, from that point of view, as illustrated by this 
philosophy, it is impossible to get at the subjective end of 
desire at all? We may say that by his desires the child 
is reflecting the sort of a self he has found out the way to 
be, and that his future self is to be gained and enriched 
through the reactions in which his present desires lead 
him to indulge. But is not that very far from saying that 
the child desires to conserve, extend, and realize the self 
which his present desires are calculated to secure? This 
is just the confusion into which, in the mind of the writer, 
this formulation of the end of desire in ethical theory 
usually falls. And the confusion becomes all the plainer 
when we take the child as our subject of investigation at 
a time when it is evidently absurd to say that he has an 
adequate sense of any general end which his different 
desires conspire to realize. 
If, therefore, we say that self-realization is the end of 
desire, in the sense that it is the meaning of all the pro- 
cesses of desire looked at from the point of view of mental 
development as a whole, we may then call it the theoretical 
or philosophical end, as before in the epoch of impulse we 
found a theoretical or biological end. This is so much to 
the good in our theory of sanction, since in self-realiza- 
tion we have the theoretical or philosophical sanction for 
acts of reflective desire. But then we may inquire further 
into the subjective end as the child himself conceives it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
386 ffis Personal Sanctions 
242. In the first place, it seems essential to the integrity 
of the objective generalized end which we find to be self- 
realization, that the individual, in his concrete choices and 
desires, should not know it nor aim to realize it. For it is 
a generalization based upon the details of many specially 
differentiated functions, each of which must do its normal 
part in the scheme of the whole. Each particular act and 
desire represents such a partial function, with its own con- 
crete end. Suppose the child did reflect on its good as a 
whole, and did come to judge between the desires which 
normally arise, might it not divert the energies of life into 
channels very far from the realization of a complete self ? 
And is not this just what men of mature years actually 
do, when they come by reflection to construct theories of 
life, and to set up ends which they wish to realize ? — thus 
interfering with the spontaneity of desire, and deranging 
the relative adjustments to one another of the different 
moving springs of our personal nature. 
In the second place, and more positively, what the child 
does aim at is still just things and situations. Yet we find 
a new development in the constructive processes by which 
he reaches his sense of things and situations. Distin- 
guishing, as we may, between his sense of things as facts, 
and things as objects of desire, we may look more closely 
at the latter as related to the former, and at the meaning 
of the antithesis between them. 
243. In general, there is to each of us, both a world of 
things as facts and a world of things as desirable objects. 
They are very different, considered as worlds. The world 
of facts is common to us all very largely; the world of 
desires is very different to us one and another. In a 
general way, these two worlds coincide both with each
-P-A-G-E-413
  
The Sanction of Desire 387 
other and in different persons, since the world of desires 
has its points of origin in the world of facts ; and different 
men are constituted enough alike to make the trend of 
their desires the same. But in any concrete case, when 
it is a question as to the desirableness here and now of a 
particular thing or action, we differ largely in our choices 
and decisions. 
Considering the individual, however, we find a sharp 
distinction between the thing as it exists and the thing as 
it is desired. A preliminary of desire is a sense of 
unreality, want, tendency toward a thing that is pictured, 
but not accomplished. Let us call the thing, object, event, 
which is now real before me, A; and let us call it when I 
desire it, in its absence, a; then let us see what the differ- 
ence is between the former, considered as a thing that 
exists, an A, and the latter, the thing that is desired, the a. 
The difference is this, that the one, the A, is a hard and 
dry skeleton of rigid reality held in the grip of so-called 
mechanical law, whose operation is indifferent to my needs 
and satisfactions. In its origin, as a fact, I get it just by 
stripping off my experience of its personal aspect to me, 
by reading out the personal equation element from it, and 
leaving out there, in space and time, only what is common 
to many experiences and to all experiencing individuals 
who come that way, and get the perception of this thing, 
this A. Such is the what, the object, the thing, apart 
from my desire. 
But the a, on the contrary, the thing as desired, is very 
different from this. That bare A, out there in space, is 
not what I think of when I set it forth with urgent desire. 
I set toward the fact, the A, it is true; but I think of a 
very different sort of thing. What I think of, in desiring, 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  388 fits Personal Sanctions 
is an experience, a rich full state of existence, of which 
the thing of perception is the nucleus, but which flows 
over and around this nucleus with an overflowing that is 
peculiar to me. The hard, dry, impersonal fact, A, rigid 
in its obedience to law, and common alike to all men 
in the world—this is replaced in my thought by a 
thing which awakes all sorts of reminiscences of pleasure, 
excitement, association trains, social intercourse, self-satis- 
factions, etc.; and all this is there—a great bursting 
mind-full of treasurable personal meaning. 
This means what we saw above: that the apperception 
system which we call se/f, is involved in the ‘thing of 
desire,’ the a. It is the echo of my personal thought 
of reality, of all my dealings with it, of all that I have 
suffered and enjoyed in my life with things of”the A series, 
that now gives desire its meaning. It is an assimilation 
function, a struggle to get at the personal meaning ; this it 
is that moves me. All this comes over me when the thing 
is not present, by the very thought of its possible pres- 
ence ; and I desire the object, the bare thing, only in the 
sense that it is the consciousness of that, and of the need 
of that, which serves to excite all this moving turmoil in 
my breast. 
If this is so, there seems to be some ground for the his- 
torical controversy, already referred to, as to the ‘object’ 
or ‘end’ of desire. 
Some have said that men act directly to secure the a, 
the thing of the world of desire. They wish to bring 
back all the rich fulness of this experience. Others say 
no, that is not what men consciously strive for; if they did, 
they would never get it. They strive for the thing of fact, 
the object of external value; and only so do they come
-P-A-G-E-415
    The Sanction of Desire 389 
into the gain of more, through the gain of it. This point 
has already been before us,! and our examination shows 
that the distinction is largely one of development. The 
pursuit of the object A is typical of what we have called 
‘spontaneous’ desire. Yet for our present purpose it is 
important to see that the distinction involved is a real one. 
Generally, when most spontaneous, men act directly 
with reference to the object of fact—that seems plain. 
Yet, in that case, there is most often a vaguely conscious 
distinction between what they pursue, and what they have 
in mind as motive to the pursuit; that latter is the a, the 
‘thing of desire.’ This is usually called ‘motive,’ in the 
best use of that word; and I shall call it so, reserving 
the word ‘end’ for the actual image, the thing pursued, in 
most cases the A, the thing of fact.” 
244. So much preliminary to the question of sanction 
in this field of desire. In this epoch, the motive is the 
sanction. What else could be the sanction? There is no 
other possible sanction, except the thing of fact, toward 
which desire is directed. But this is not eligible because, 
except in cases of purest ideo-motor automatism, it is not 
the real content of consciousness. Even spontaneous 
desire and pure impulse, we have found merging, as soon 
as experience widens, into that state in which a hedonic 
element enters into the motive-complex. Besides, the 
thing of fact is a common element in many states of con- 
sciousness, perhaps, and in many persons at once; and 
the differing attitudes and acts which result call for very 
1 Above, Chap. VI., Sect. 167. 
2 That is, ‘motive’ includes all the affective, subconscious, and motor 
processes additional to the intellectual or representative images which consti- 
tute the ‘end.’ The felt self is largely a ‘ motive,’ and not an ‘end’ element,
-P-A-G-E-416
  390 Fits Personal Sanctions 
different sanctions. In other terms, the rigid stationary 
A, the thing from which all character for consciousness 
and personal life has been abstracted, just for the purposes 
of abstract and common indifference in multiplied situa- 
tions, —the bare thing, which is simply there at all times 
and for all men,—cannot be at the same time the justi- 
fication for the varied and differentiated actions which 
different men, at the same time, and the same man at 
different times, perform with reference to it. 
The only sort of intelligent activity that it could sanc- 
tion would be the pursuit of itself, found in the description 
of the facts of the world as such; that is, in science. 
Science is justified of her own children, the A’s; but desire 
may rebel against science, and inevitably seeks to supple- 
ment it. Science cannot be called upon to legitimate 
the children of desire. 
245. The pursuit of science, however, represents a real 
and normal sanction. For it is typical of the more general 
use of intelligence seen above in what we called ‘selective 
thinking.’! The selective criteria of the value of his 
thoughts, considered as survivals, are generalized in the 
thinker’s mind under the wider term ‘truth.’ The corre- 
spondences discovered and tested between the thoughts 
and the things of fact are held in a system of truths; and 
the activities of the man, no less in society than in the 
private laboratory, or in the fields of external nature, must 
terminate first of all upon this system of truths. Seeing, 
further, that the satisfaction of desire —the realization of 
the motive entertained — is conditioned upon the attitudes 
suitable to reinstate things of fact inside the relationships 
of truth, truth itself becomes a recognized subjective or 
1 Chap. IIL, § 3. 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
    The Sanction of Desire 391 
personal sanction. Truth, thus defined, is one of the great 
and controlling sanctions of desire, since it thus becomes 
motive. 
246. If this be really the psychological sanction of 
desire, —z.¢., the motive, defined in the broad way that it 
has been above, — then an act would seem to have objective 
sanction just 2% proportion as it is really the action to which 
the present motive in its fulness prompts. Does this action 
which I now contemplate really carry out the desire which 
I have toward a given object of fact? Normally it must, 
if it issue from the full state of consciousness which con- 
stitutes the desire. Then, in that case, the appropriate- 
ness being granted, the action secures the thing, in greater 
or less degree, and with that the desire is satisfied. The 
sanction, then, is maintained in consciousness in propor- 
tion to the success of the action to which the thought 
prompts; and we reach the general truth that, for intelli- 
gent action, prompted as it is by desire, the objective sanc- 
tion is success. 
247. Success becomes the subjective sanction also when 
it is made motive in reflective consciousness; and it so soon 
becomes the individual’s criterion of the desirableness of 
an action that we may speak on occasion of the sanction 
of success as representing the individual’s motive. 
Of course there are cases in which the action which 
follows on a desire is not really appropriate to it: cases 
in which the action does not succeed. Then the man 
laments his conduct, seeing that he has not done well. 
1 This simply means, from the point of view of the imitative character of 
volition, the reinstatement of the ‘copy’ (motive) series which releases the 
action. It illustrates also, i concrete cases, the philosophical sanction of self- 
realization.
-P-A-G-E-418
  392 ffis Personal Sanctions 
In such cases we have really no departure from the 
formula reached just now. For in that case the man is 
lacking in intelligence or in experience. For him the 
action was sanctioned; for us it departs from the intelli- 
gent type. He may say, ‘what a fool I have been to 
do this,’ or ‘how I was misled in this scheme’; but 
objectively his object of desire was not attached to the 
proper objects of fact; or his construction of the object 
of desire did not proceed by a proper interpretation of 
experience; or the train of action was so complex that 
he could not trace out the end from the beginning, and 
so missed a link or two; or perhaps he did not estimate 
the bearing, upon his scheme of life, of the influence 
of the desires and conduct of others, or the presence of 
his own changing emphasis upon other things of fact. 
All these influences and many others make his actual 
success problematical and so seem to take away the sanc- 
tion when his consciousness comes to take an er post facto 
point of view. At the time, doing the best he could, 
his action was sanctioned for him by the motive; but in 
its results, both for the on-looker and for him, it finds its 
sanction in the success which it proves more or less suited 
to bring. - 
Success considered as personal sanction is also rein- 
forced by the sanction of truth. For every truthful corre- 
spondence between thought and fact represents the suc- 
cessful carrying out of the thought in the world of fact. 
So we are the more justified in speaking of success as the 
sanction of intelligence, seeing that it is operative in both 
spheres, z.¢., those of fact and desire. 
248. There are further psychological questions which 
arise here; but I shall only take up a phase or two of the
-P-A-G-E-419
    The Sanction of Desive 393 
case by which our inquiry may be advanced into the social 
life, at this epoch of intelligence. 
The child’s thought of self is, as will be remembered, 
identified with two somewhat opposed systems of emotional 
and active expressions. It was one of the results of our 
examination of the early sense of self, that we found it 
showing a certain duality in the midst of its growing 
definiteness. There is in action a necessary distinction 
between the self of aggression, self-assertion, selfishness, 
in short; and the self of imitation, sympathy, accommoda- 
tion, altruism. If this be true, then what we have found 
about the sanctions, both in the impulsive and in the in- 
telligent period, must be held to with a view of these two 
forms of the thought of self. If actions are so different 
as to be worthy of the two opposed terms ‘egoistic’ and 
‘altruistic,’ then the motive-sanctions from which they 
spring must be different too. 
As to the impulsive period, the difference is not of much 
theoretical importance, since the whole active life is given 
over to impulse; but it is then a question of great practical 
importance whether the facts show both these two kinds 
of reaction in the child. Is he a creature of so-called gen- 
erous as well as of so-called selfish impulses? The facts 
give no room for doubt, as I have had occasion to point out 
above in some detail. The child acts under the sanction 
of impulse or necessity whether he act in one way or in 
the other. This we may leave here, only stopping to say 
that the consideration of the social sanction which is to fol- 
low in the next chapter takes it as its point of departure. 
But coming to the epoch of intelligence, to the ques- 
tion of the sanction of desire, we find it necessary to 
make further distinctions. If, as we found reason for
-P-A-G-E-420
  394 fits Personal Sanctions 
| 7 
believing, the motive, the object of desire, the thing of the 
world of desire, as opposed to the thing of the world of 
fact, is a construction in which the sense of self is the 
assimilating thing; if it is this thought which goes out in 
its own power of attractiveness to absorb the things of 
fact into its forms of personal construction, then we have 
to ask at once, which of the two normal thoughts of self 
is it that does this. Is the thing-of-desire an egoistic thing- 
of-desire or an altruistic thing-of-desire? Is it I, the self- 
ish, aggressive, self-asserting, domineering self which 
desires; or is it I, the imitative, teachable, generous, altru- 
istic, self-denying self which desires? Or is it both, or is 
it neither ? 
Of course it must be both, either separately or together. 
It cannot be the two together at the earlier stages of 
the growth of the sense of self; since there has not yet 
arisen the assimilation of the partial thoughts of self which 
brings them together. But it is the characteristic of the 
later epoch of sentiment — ethical, religious, etc.,— as has 
been said, that there grows up a generalized thought of self 
in which the combined motive influences of all the personal 
thoughts take form in an ideal thought to which the par- 
tial semi-detached thoughts are more or less consciously 
subordinated. If, then, we keep over the examination of 
this ideal epoch for separate inquiry in the matter of sanc- 
tion, defining the epoch of desire strictly in terms of the 
growth of intelligence, and the ability to use intelligence 
for personal purposes; then we must say that the two 
thoughts, representing self, the ego, and self, the alter, 
both act in turn to stimulate conduct, and so each gives 
its own sanction to the sort of action which it begets. 
249. If we look at these two cases in a somewhat
-P-A-G-E-421
The Sanction of Desive 395 
artificial way at first, we see what sorts of personal action 
would thus get sanction. Action done from personal 
aggression, pride, self-assertion, eager egoism, would have 
the private ego thought as its motive —assimilating to 
itself the things of fact, the circumstances of social life, 
the acts of others, the content of experience generally ; 
and success in bringing all these agencies and materials 
into subjection to the selfish movements of the individual 
would be its reward. This seems to be realized, in the 
_ main, in the period of childhood from the second to the 
fourth years (say). I have already cited some of the facts 
which show the selfish use which the child makes of his 
intelligence when he is just learning that he has it and 
can use it to his personal advantage. He hoodwinks his 
juniors, circumvents his attendants, attempts to deceive 
his elders. The use of intelligence in this way is one of 
the first reasons for the genuine ‘lie’ in child life. His 
sanction is success; simply that. That is his rule of 
action, and he has no reason for hesitating to apply it, 
except as his acts themselves or the copies which he is 
called upon urgently to imitate bring out the other and 
different thought of self, so arouse his sympathy, and 
bring on a conflict for temporary supremacy between the 
two thoughts of self. There are also men in society whom 
we instinctively class as selfish, and often they are very 
gifted in the matter of intelligence. Such men use the 
social environment for their personal advantage. And 
there is, of course, the criminal whose selfish line of con- 
duct not only illustrates his life under the sanction of 
personal success, but who also puts to defiance the sanc- 
tions which society attaches in the way of penalties and 
rewards to actions of a different kind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-422

While not intending to discuss social theories at this 
point, yet it may not be amiss to point out here the ground 
which an individualistic theory of society has to rest upon 
when we consider man simply from the point of view of 
intelligence operating under the sanction of personal de- 
sire. The stress of individual competition tends directly 
to justify the pursuit of success. ‘Nothing succeeds like 
success’ is its motto. There are great departments of 
human competitive life in which this sanction is never 
repealed nor even much modified. 
250. Yet to say that this is the only sanction of intelli- 
gent conduct is to deny the other motive which is correlative 
with this. The thought of self as an ego is psychologically 
impossible without its correlative, the thought of self as an 
alter. The reaction of emotion and conduct to this latter 
is as original as that to the former. The child does seem 
to show a great liking at the period of dawning intelligence 
for the selfish exercise of his newly acquired power. But 
the other side of his nature does not die. I have already 
pointed out reasons for the one-sidedness of his develop- 
ment for a time at this epoch. It is mainly for purposes 
of exercise, training, practice, strengthening, that the intel- 
ligence is used so much for selfish ends at this period. We 
very soon find in the child a sort of reaction to the other 
pole. He begins to widen the circle of his concern. His 
selfishness varies according as he is in the household or out 
of it. He begins to show actions of meditated generosity. 
All this has already been dwelt upon. The essential thing 
is that this generous conduct also has its sanction in 
exactly the same sense that the selfish conduct has. The 
self which now constructs the things in the world of 
desire is an alter; it fills consciousness; its normal issue   
-P-A-G-E-423
    The Sanction of Desire 397 
is in sympathetic, disinterested action; the sanction belong- 
ing to this type of motive is success in the sort of action 
which is normal to it; and that makes success in being 
generous a thing of normal intelligent sanction, It is 
quite analogous to the normality of impulsive action of 
both kinds, —that which seems to be selfish and that 
which seems to be generous; both are so elementarily 
natural that the presence of each is the sanction of each. 
So in the sphere of intelligence, where a construction of 
desire is induced upon the thing of fact on which the 
desire terminates, the construction takes two equally nor- 
mal forms. 
The theoretical determination of the sanction of desire, 
therefore, in terms of success must include both cases, and 
extend to action of the two distinct types: action of the 
strenuously selfish competitive type and action of the self- 
denying, generous, co-operative type. Each represents an 
intelligent form of success. 
251. Another point may be taken up before we go on 
to more complicated stages of development. It is the rela- 
tion of the sanction of intelligent action to that which jus- 
tifies impulsive action. 
The former supersedes and inhibits the latter, whenever 
it is a question between the two; or it tends to do so. 
In case it does not, then there is a violation of all sanction 
in the mind of the actor. Impulse is the servant of reason. 
If it becomes the master by its intrinsic intensity or by the 
weakness of the sanction of intelligence, then action be- 
comes unreasonable, and impulse is again the only justifi- 
cation as before the intelligence arose. But when the 
intelligence recovers itself and begins to judge the situa- 
tion from its own point of view, then the absence of any 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
398 ffis Personal Sanctions 
  sanction higher than that of temporary necessity comes 
into consciousness as a sense of profound regret. Again 
the actor says: ‘What a fool, child, lunatic, I was.’ 
When taken in the general economy of personal develop- 
ment, this is a thing of great importance; for it repre- 
sents the passage of consciousness into the new and 
all-important sphere of intelligent adaptation to men and 
things. As long as impulse is uncontrolled, there is no 
governor on the wheels of the human machine. The bio- 
logical justification is the only justification. Impulse is a 
thing of blind action, save to the theorist on the principles 
of biological development. But when intelligence comes 
upon the scene with its selection of means to ends, and its 
utilizing of the forces of life and impulse for the accom- 
plishment of designs all its own, thus bringing some meas- 
ure of control and balance into the warfare of impelling 
activities, then a new era begins, not only in the individual, 
but, as we have had reason to think from the point of view 
of his social equipment, also in society. Think of the dif- 
ference between self-control and license, between the judge 
‘and the mob, between the child kicking against the pricks 
and the man removing them by his genius, and you have 
something of what the entrance of the sanction of intelli- 
gence means in the history of man. Consistency arises 
out of chaos, steady purpose and plan of life succeed 
capricious indulgence in fragmentary enjoyments, econ- 
omy of mental and vital energy follows reckless waste 
and unavailing struggle. What a wonderful thing is 
self-control, even where it is directed to ends not the 
best! How great is success even when its sphere is igno- 
ble! And how the man with a distant end lays his game 
for the self-betrayed man of impulse and emotion, not only
-P-A-G-E-425
     The Sanction of Desire 399 
maintaining ends of calmness and sobriety, but using the 
other’s forces perhaps wherewith to accomplish them! 
252. Finally, it may be pointed out that the distinction 
between the world of things and the world of desire extends 
itself into the realm of social activity as well; and in it we 
find certain of the most subtle and interesting movements 
which inspire and agitate the individual. Persons as well 
as things are different in the kind of existence which they 
have. A person may be to another an 4 in the world of 
fact, —indeed must be,—and also an a in the world of 
desire. A person as a mere 4, a fact, a thing, from which 
experiences are expected, as they are from a chair or a 
door, is only a recognized object; and he may also be 
a matter of desire, or he may not. His existence may be 
as indifferent to me as that of the chair; but it may be as 
vital to me as is the mother to the child, or friend to friend 
when ‘help faileth and the mourners go about the streets.’ 
The ego may knit this or that alter to itself, so that there 
is one self and I am you; or the alter may be the enemy 
to life and peace, and tolerance of him cease to be a 
virtue. 
This development of the personal presences of others 
into objects of desire, while they remain also things of 
fact, is fruitful of much of our intelligent action. I may 
treat you as a thing, in order to win you as a person. Or 
I may cater to you as a person with a pretence of affection 
when to me really you are as a thing, and my end, my 
real desire, goes beyond you. In other words, intelli- 
gence may manipulate its personal material, as it does the 
external world, bending the things to secure the desires; 
and having the same sanction for so doing as in the former 
case —as merciless as it seems — the sanction of success. 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
    400 fits Personal Sanctions 
Except—and this is where there arises one of the 
subtleties of the situation— except that in this case the 
use of the person as a mere thing, a means to some remote 
end, tends to conflict with the necessary thought of the 
alter as one himself having desires, and intrinsically 
arousing sympathy. This is a complication which actu- 
ally arises in society as well as in individual conduct. For 
example, the opposition to vivisection, and in general the 
unwillingness to use living animals for human purposes, 
illustrates just this case. Here the intelligent end requires 
the use of living things simply as things, as means, deny- 
ing them the right to be elevated in themselves to the rank 
of objects of desire, or of personal worth. But the sympa- 
thetic impulses go out by necessity toward the thought of 
a suffering alter. So a conflict. Of course there is no 
reasonable conflict. Sympathy is an impulse, and its 
sanction is necessity, — considered apart from any ethical 
sanction which other elements may give it,— while the 
intelligent end is a thing of adaptation, and so claims the 
right to precedence. The end sanctions the vivisection, 
z.e., the successful solving of the biological problem that is 
set. Whether the solving of the problem in a particular 
case is a worthy end—that brings in again the ethical 
standards at a higher level; but if intelligence sanctions 
vivisection, that is sufficient as against merely impulsive 
sympathy. 
The complication is seen also in the cases where we give 
pain to an individual for his own good. Many a mother 
knows the fearful character of this situation; when she is 
driven to torture her child for his larger happiness, as in 
the case of a necessary surgical operation. In this case 
there are no less than three thoughts of the same child in
-P-A-G-E-427
  The Higher Hedonic Sanction 401 
the mother’s mind: the child of fact, diseased; the child of 
sympathy, suffering the knife; and the child of desire, 
cured. The first of these, the child of fact, is in a meas- 
ure an abstraction; but unless he be enough a reality to 
lead to the inhibition of the impulsive action of repelling 
the surgeon which finds its sanction in the child of sym- 
pathy, the action of intelligence could never be. For then 
there could not be constituted the child of desire from 
which this action of intelligence proceeds. 
These situations are sufficient to illustrate the embarrass- 
ments into which consciousness may fall, even at the rela- 
tively low stage of development before the rise of ethical 
and social sentiment. How weak appear the constructions 
of the political and economical writers who treat desire as 
a sort of constant quantity, which may be multiplied into 
the number of individuals, and so serve as a basis for a 
theory of value; or identified with ‘demand’ and so be 
correlated with ‘supply.’ And this complexity is nothing 
to that which develops in the higher realm into which con- 
sciousness grows, as personality takes on its ideal forms. 
§ 4. The Higher Hedonic Sanction 
253. The development of consciousness in the way now 
depicted leads to a refining in the sense of pleasure and 
pain to the actor. We saw that the hedonic colouring of 
experience goes over largely into the sense of self, pro- 
ducing attitudes of the personal self toward individual 
things. And this is the basis of the ‘thing of desire’ as op- 
posed to the ‘thing of fact.’ The thing of fact remains a 
thing of knowledge, science, observation; the thing of 
desire becomes that rich hedonic experience with which 
the self is immediately identified. 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
    402 Fits Personal Sanctions 
But in the reflective consciousness another movement 
often takes place; indeed, always takes place in reference 
to some one or other type of experience in this mind or 
that. The discovery is made by the actor himself that there 
is just this distinction between things as facts and things 
as objects of personal desire. He comes to see that it is 
not the object per se that he strives for, but the states of 
self which come through the realization of the things of 
desire. The state of happiness which this involves is thus 
isolated, in a measure, in his thought, and set up as itself 
a thing of desire. He generalizes the hedonic experience 
as such, sets it before him as an end, and pursues the 
objects of fact, and even also the customary objects of 
desire, for the sake of this new and derived object of 
desire, — pleasure. In this form of reflection we find, 
therefore, for the first time realized, a pure hedonism of the 
subjective consciousness. It is an outgrowth in the sphere 
of desire, as the corresponding lower hedonic sanction 
already spoken of is in the sphere of impulse. The child 
acts first impulsively toward objects as things, then comes 
to act impulsively toward them as painful things, and even 
as pure pains (and pleasures), but still impulsively. So in 
the sphere of desire, the first action of reflective desire 
is toward the object of desire, which takes the place of the 
simple thing of fact. The object of desire is constituted 
by the clustering up upon the experience of all those highly 
coloured pleasurable and painful states which go to pro- 
duce the personal attitudes of the self. Then, finally, the 
pleasure as thought comes to be itself the object of pursuit, 
and the agent is, when acting thus, now a refined reflective 
hedonist. For such a person there would really be a 
‘hedonic calculus.’
-P-A-G-E-429
    The Sanction of Right 403 
This is, then, the final and much-talked of hedonic 
sanction, the pursuit of pleasure as such. It represents 
the most refined egoism, in the sense of individualism.!_ It 
shows the culmination of intellectual development consid- 
ered as affording a type of sanction for conduct. We shall 
see, later on, under what conditions it is actually present 
in social life. 
§ 5. The Sanction of Right 
254. In the earlier, more psychological consideration of 
the development of the personality sense, we saw that the 
growth of a general or ideal self is gradual, coming through 
the continuation of the process of imitative accommodation, 
which is the engine of all mental progress. It is by assimi- 
lation that growth proceeds; and when consciousness is 
able, under the leading of the personalities which illustrate 
and enforce law, to assimilate both its partial thoughts of 
self —the selfish and the generous self —to a new ideal 
thought which stands for this law, then it enters the sphere 
of duties and rights. Following up this progress in the 
child with the question as to the sanction of conduct done 
at this highest epoch of personal development, we find 
before us a set of conditions of great complexity and diffi- 
culty. The interest of the topic, however, culminates here, 
as do also the practical bearings of it in social matters; so 
we may try to get some glimmerings of light on the sub- 
ject, mainly from the carrying out of the principles which 
we have found reason for accepting in the simpler con- 
ditions already explored. 
1 Yet not necessarily as anti-social or unaltruistic in the channels of its 
expression ; for the pleasures of society or of benevolence might be pursued 
simply as pleasures. Cf. also Sect. 260. 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
404 His Personal Sanctions 
The subjective sanction of right, that which impels the 
agent himself to recognize and perform duty, is just the 
sentiment called ‘ought,’ of which we have endeavoured 
to find out something, from the genetic point of view, in 
earlier pages. In theory, it has been called the ‘ categorical 
imperative’; in popular language it is called ‘conscience.’ 
It is not within our province to pursue speculation further 
about this sentiment, but only to ask how the presence of 
this sanction in the individual’s own breast modifies the 
reasons for action, and consequently the actions themselves, 
which we found him performing in the earlier epochs. 
Impulse leads to action by ‘necessity’; intelligence leads 
to different action, with view to ‘success’; both of these 
remain, the latter modifying the demands and the author- 
ity of the former. Now what new complications arise in 
the operation of both of these, when oughiness comes to 
its fruition, and roan feels impelled to do ‘right’? 
255. The first thing to be remarked about this new 
sanction is its similarity, in the person’s own mind, to the 
sanction of impulse. It comes with no adequate or detailed 
construction of content by the thinker. He cannot ex-   
plain his reasons for pronouncing conduct right; he has no 
reasons. He cannot picture to himself or communicate 
to others a general plan of life which will cover the details 
of action, as new circumstances arise; he only gets a 
single morsel of sanction at a time —a morsel appropriate 
to the emergency in which he is immediately called upon 
to act. In this, ethical action is impulsive. It represents 
habit facing toward law. And it is impulsive, also, in 
respect to the form of quasi-necessity with which its in- 
junctions come upon him. In this case, it is true, it is a 
new form of necessity; it does not play itself out in con-
-P-A-G-E-431
  The Sanction of Right 405 
duct through the immediate pressure of nervous conditions. 
But its imperative is categorical, and it executes its com- 
mands under the form of penalties as real, though not the 
same, as those which the lower impulses inflict.- It is from 
this character, as quasi-impulsive, that the ought-sanction 
gets its relation to the others. 
256. The sanction of right tends to supersede the 
earlier sanctions, in the main, and that because it repre- 
sents a more inclusive form of mental synthesis. The 
generalization of the thought of self cannot proceed with- 
out the subsumption of the healthful and normal but par- 
tial selves. We can have no ideal thought of self without 
using the partial thoughts which contribute, in particular 
instances, material for the ideal. The impulsive self, with 
its self-seeking and its capricious sympathy, must be there; 
and the crafty, intellectual self must be there; and each 
must urge its own sanction, for it is only through the rela- 
tive claims of these thoughts and the fitness of their cor- 
responding appropriate actions, that the lawful, regular, 
ethical thought, and its appropriate action, can be con- 
stituted. If it be true that the ideal thought requisite to 
the rise of ethical sentiment comes by the generalization 
of the partial and lower thoughts, then the emerging forms 
of action which now get sanction must be, in some way, 
a reduction of the earlier forms to a single novel type. 
This leads us to the recognition of two conclusions: first, 
that the conduct which is sanctioned by the ought-sense 
exists normally and naturally by the side of the other 
forms of action in the same person; and second, that it 
is only through the vitality of impulse and intellect and 
their normal pressure out into conduct, that this new union 
and higher adjustment of elements can take place. 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  406 fits Personal Sanctions 
257. The entire normality of the ethical sentiment, and 
the sanction which enforces it, deserve emphasis in con- 
trast with the tendency of certain writers to look upon 
them as in. some way foreign to humanity, and as only 
kept in operation by divine agencies, belief in supernatural 
penalties and rewards, etc. As opposed to this concep- 
tion, we see that the sanction of duty arises from the 
natural play of the impulses and intellectual operations 
among themselves, just as we have also seen the higher 
forms of religious sentiment come up naturally from the 
ethical. The growth of intellectuality, considered as 
breadth of view and competence of personal judgment, 
carries with it normally growth in sensitiveness of feeling 
and rightness of ethical attitude. Intellectual power is 
primarily growth in the sense of personal worth and char- 
acter based on widened social experience. This growth 
involves the entertainment of the sanction of the gener- 
ous desires and impulses no less than that of the selfish 
desires and impulses. So the outcome —the higher and 
more adequate understanding and organization of the 
material of personal and social life — brings, by its very 
happening, the sanction of duty. The sanction arises 
just in this way, and in this way only; its adequacy and 
fulness of influence are functions of the adequacy and 
comprehensiveness of the synthesis on the intellectual side. 
Hence no dualism of thought and action can be held in 
this highest realm. It is as untrue as would be a corre- 
sponding dualism in the realm of intelligence and desire, 
z.e., a dualism which should hold that the picturing of an 
object is natural and normal, but the tendency to desire 
and struggle for it is a thing of extraneous origin. The 
only possible opposition between the intellect and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-433
  The Sanction of Right 407 
sense of right, is that which arises, as in particular cases, 
when the intellectual process represents the lower synthe- 
sis of personal and social values whose sanction is success 
or pleasure. Then the opposition is sharp enough. The 
assimilation of the act which intelligence, at this lower 
stage, urges for performance, with the ideal personal 
thought about which the sense of duty hangs, is hindered 
or thwarted. It was therefore a real intuition of the Greek 
moralists that they made ethical insight, zsight—reason, 
a perfection of apprehension, in opposition to the opinion 
and perception and illusion of the lower cognitive pro- 
cesses. Practical reason is reason still. But the Greeks 
shared the view which we are now criticising, on the side 
of the origin of this intuition, inasmuch as they found it 
necessary to account for it by a principle of illumination 
which could not come by the development of the natural 
processes of experience. A dualism between reason and 
sense or opinion ran through Greek thought very much as 
the dualism of thought and sentiment is current now. 
As opposed to both dualisms, we must hold to a develop- 
ment process with two aspects, —a constructive aspect and 
an active aspect. The constructive aspect undergoes de- 
velopment from sense to thought; and with it, representing 
the constant outcome of it, the active aspect undergoes a 
corresponding development from impulse to conduct, from 
necessity to duty. 
258. The other point mentioned above is also suggestive 
of certain reflections. It opens the question of actual con- 
tent and play of functions in the healthy ethical conscious- 
ness. The determinations already made show us that 
impulse and intelligence must be there, and that the 
normal growth of the ethical sense depends upon their 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  408 fits Personal Sanctions 
growth. But it is evident that further definition may be 
made of the influences which give more subtle colouring 
to the phases of the life of duty— phases whose variations 
produce the various inequalities and pathological tenden- 
cies in the moral life. 
The first great distinction which comes up, in prosecut- 
ing this inquiry, is that which we have already found 
between things, considered as objects merely, things as 
facts ; and, on the other hand, things considered as more 
or less implicated in the progressive thought of self, zhings 
as objects of desire. We saw that, even in the life of intelli- 
gence, a comprehensive distinction exists here. The world 
of things, opposite to the world of desire, constitutes a 
series of reasonably constant manipulable terms, which 
‘remain put,’ so to speak, in certain relationships, are capa- 
ble of more or less exhaustive description for personal and 
social purposes, and have a relative neutrality of presence 
to us, as respects our active lives and attitudes. It is only 
as these things, on the other hand, take on certain rela- 
tionships to persons and personal uses—to society, in some 
way or other, in short —that they are then constituted ele- 
ments or details of the world of values. The mere judg- 
ment of existence, which is a mental attitude of the widest 
generality and of the least importance in the progress of 
our development, — since it is the presupposition of it all, — 
yields to certain graduated judgments of value which are 
the measuring rods of desire. 
It follows from this that there may be two very different 
courses of development in the intellectual life according 
as the material with which it prevailingly deals belongs in 
one or other of these fields, —the world of facts or the 
world of desire. One person’s life-development may be   
-P-A-G-E-435
    The Sanction of Right 409 
typical in that it is the pursuit in the main of facts, truths. 
The pursuit, of course, is motived in desire; but not in 
things as objects of desire, or as elements in the social 
world of desire. This sort of intellectuality we have al- 
ready recognized in the scientific tendency which, as such, 
scouts utility and seeks only truth. The self-thought is 
ignored largely by the very statement of the material; the 
ideal of apprehension is without prejudice of personal 
interest. The only reason for mentioning this here is 
that in such intellectual development we see the absence 
of values just in so far as all human and social desire is 
absent. Value comes only from the introduction of the 
personal thought, and the measure of it is the measure of 
the possible assimilation of the new knowledge which a 
thing affords, to the attitudes of desire. When this is 
done, we reach the opposite pole of intellectual operation, 
and in it we find certain obtrusive characters which involve 
the ethical sanction. 
259. The ethical life is pre-eminently a life of values. 
Its objects are things of desire, and things of desire at the 
highest level, where the self-thought is general or ideal. 
As to the line between thoughts of self which are general, 
and those which are not, it is usually —certainly in the 
developed consciousness — quite impossible to draw it. 
After the ethical sentiment has once arisen, in conscious- 
ness, through the assimilation of the partial self-thoughts, 
a habit is started of just such general assimilation ; and it 
is then doing violence to the normal drift of growth to 
isolate either the ego thought or the alter thought and 
attempt to adjust the issues of life to either alone to any 
great extent. The whole life of desire takes on a normally 
ethical character. ‘What ought I to do?’ becomes the
-P-A-G-E-436
  410 fits Personal Sanctions 
mind’s spontaneous response both to the demands of 
impulse and to the attractions of success. 
This leads to the recognition of a social value in all the 
acts of life, except those whose performance is so usual 
or so trivial that we call them indifferent. But it should 
be noticed that real indifference cannot be predicated of 
any actions which have a personal motive. All actions 
which have such a motive are ethical and social, whether 
they be egoistic, altruistic, or seemingly neutral, simply 
because after consciousness has once fallen into the way 
of referring the partial personal thoughts to the ideal 
thought, all actions which are personal at all have a 
tacit or overt value as compared with action from the 
ideal point of view. 
The result then is this, that all action which is in any 
sense interested is ethical; and upon it falls the ethical 
sanction, after the person has once entered the ethical 
epoch of growth. The intellectual sanction of success, 
and the impulsive sanction of necessity, both have to 
yield to the higher requirements of duty, or to violate 
them. But in either case, the requirements are there, 
and consciousness is different by reason of their pres- 
ence. The ethical sanction has a direct inhibitive influ- 
ence upon the operation of the lower sanctions, inasmuch 
as no one of them is to be considered the final sanction 
of the act which emerges from the crucible of ethical 
deliberation. That is the province of the sense of ought 
or of duty; and it may ratify any or none of the actual 
courses of conduct which the earlier sanctions would 
otherwise have called out. 
260. This leads us to see that even the relative conflict 
between the intellectual and the ethical which seemed 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
The Sanction of Right 411 
to arise under the hedonic sanction (Sect. 253) is seldom 
real. The pursuit of the dictates of self-interest may seem 
to represent a form of rational conduct in full opposition 
to the forms enjoined by the ethical sanction. The 
sanction of success may be enormously developed in an 
individual and in a society, without a corresponding devel- 
opment of the ethical. This refinement of individualism 
would now seem to be in some degree abnormal. Such 
intellectual development, as far as it is self-interested, 
‘must involve normally the conscious violation of the 
rights of other persons, and so must arouse some ethi- 
cal feeling after such an individual has once come to 
be ethical. Pure intellectualism may arise, as we saw, 
before the conditions are such that the ethical is devel- 
oped; but after that, the very violation of moral require- 
ments—the very antithesis which we are discussing — 
is, in the individual consciousness, a lively sense of the 
ethical sanction. The sanction is then negative, as re- 
morse, sense of ill-desert for the outrage done to the 
imperative; but it is ethical. The very dissatisfaction at- 
taching to success is evidence that success is no longer the 
only sanction which consciousness has come to recognize. 
261. The relation of this sanction to the other and 
lower ones, together with the variations which these rela- 
tions may show, suggest interesting problems for the 
moral pathologist and the criminologist. The latter sci- 
ence, criminology, has to deal with the social applications 
and bearing of the ethical sanction, to which we come 
again below; but there are certain derangements of the 
individual’s private moral life which may lie at the foun- 
dation of his public conduct, and these it may be well 
to point out very briefly.

The pathology of the moral life seems to be, like 
mental pathology generally — apart from hereditary de- 
fect in the same direction, — simply lack of normal organ- 
ization or systematization of experience. The works of 
recent pathologists find in impairment of mental synthesis 
or organization the method of decay, and psychologists 
find the relative success of the particular mind or of the 
particular mental function in effecting unity of attention 
and thought, the measure of sanity and of moral probity.! 
The work of the French pathologists, headed by Charcot,?, 
has shown that alterations of personality, will, moral 
sense, etc., are due to the falling apart of the material 
of acquisition into different or disaggregated centres and 
syntheses: to the failure in ability to get hold by attention 
of all the material of experience and memory, and so to 
order life from the basis of the whole. 
The sort of mental disease found, in each case, depends 
upon the sphere or class of the experiences in which the 
disintegration takes place. In the ethical sphere dis- 
ease manifests itself when the synthesis of social and 
personal materials, necessary to the form of organiza- 
tion called the personal self, is not normally effected. 
Diseases in the moral life are essentially diseases of 
self-consciousness. And all diseases of  self-conscious- 
ness are moral diseases, in so far as they disturb the 
sense of social and moral values by impairing the ideal 
thought of self, or the normal subordination of the par- 
tial thoughts of self to this ideal. All these perturba- 
1] have gathered evidence for this general position in my Mental De- 
velopment, Chap. XIII., making much use of the researches of M. Pierre Janet 
(Automatisme Psychologique) on the pathological side.

tions find direct social reference in the disturbance of 
balance between the sense of the alter in relation to 
the ego, and misadjustments in their common relation- 
ships in the community. 
In practical cases many interesting instances show the 
reality of this sort of disturbance and the havoc which 
it plays with the balance of sanctions in the moral life. 
The individual may become exalted in his thought of 
his personal self, with a corresponding debasement of 
the alter and violation of social and ethical rules. Or 
he becomes melancholic, through debasement of self, 
with correspondingly exaggerated sense of the impor- 
tance, domination, persecution, etc., of others. In these _ 
cases, the intellect is likely to be sharpened into cunning 
and subterfuge at the expense, and in consequence of 
the failure, of the ethical. There is always a tendency, 
through the general loosing of the bonds of higher inhi- 
bition and synthesis, to lapse back into the life of craft 
and impulse. There results often a creature of impulse 
and suggestion. His fixed idea leads the rest of his 
mental life a wild chase; or the failure even of one 
idea to intrench itself firmly leads to the general besot- 
ting of the powers in a life of animality. All sorts and 
varieties of pathological conditions arise, and the general 
concept of the azzz-social comes in to play its important 
part, and to set the social problems which arise about 
the criminal insane.! 
  1So also the case, spoken of in Sect. 201, in which the relative balance 
between the private and public ingredients in the ideal self is disturbed.

CHAPTER X 
His Socrat Sanctions: Socrat Opposition 
262. THE social sanctions are those reasons for action 
which bear in upon the individual from the social environ- 
ment. They are the influences which have become ‘in 
some way representative in social life, and which consti- 
tute the more important elements in the moral atmosphere 
of the group in which a particular individual lives. It 
will be remembered that we have already had a concept 
similar to this in the matter of so-called ‘social heredity,’} 
except that social heredity has reference to the bearing 
in of these influences upon the individual to affect his 
inherent and normal personal growth; that is, social 
heredity describes the individual’s indebtedness to the 
social influences and the method of his reception of them. 
It does not attempt, however, to define the specific forms 
which they take on as motive influences in the mind of 
the individual. Nevertheless to answer the question of 
social sanction is to carry further the theory of social 
heredity. 
We have also had before us another topic which comes 
into close connection with the present one: the topic of 
the ‘social aids to invention.’ These ‘aids’ we found to 
be certain instruments of social use which the child ac- 
quires, and which serve as indispensable helps to his 
1 Chap. II., § 1. 2 Chap. IV.

growth into the social heritage. The conclusions, as well 
as the methods of analysis of the section on ‘social aids,’ 
may be taken as showing the channels through which the 
social environment administers its lessons for the indi- 
vidual’s growth—especially, it will be recalled, in the 
great spheres of language, literature, art, and play. 
263. Allowing these more or less adequate develop- 
ments, therefore, to set us our further problem, we find 
the task now before us somewhat shortened. It becomes 
the question: what are the leading objective categories of 
social life through which the elements of the individual’s 
‘social heritage’ have crystallized into representative insti- 
tutions during the growth of society? and in what way do 
these institutions normally exercise sanctions upon the 
active life of the individuals ? 
We find, as a matter of fact, the following sets of insti- 
tutions in society, each exerting in its own way a sanction - 
upon the acts of individuals : — 
Institutions exercising Social Sanctions 
1. Natural. 32 Civil: 
2. Pedagogical and Conventional. 4. Religious. 
These different types of institutions we may pass briefly 
in review, not at all for purposes of description nor of 
theory, but simply to show the way in which they do, as a 
matter of fact, bear in upon each member of the com- 
munity and afford him more or less urgent sanctions for 
his conduct. 
§ 1. The Natural Sanctions 
264. By the ‘xatural’ institutions of society I mean 
those sorts of social organization which arise directly out 
   
-P-A-G-E-442
  416 Ais Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
of the nature of man. Such, primarily, is the family. 
The relationships of the family are typical of a set of in- 
fluences which have already been briefly indicated. They 
are characterized by natural esprit de corps. The family 
esprit de corps has such a firm root in the breast of the 
individual that family action is as necessary to him as 
action in his own private interest. The naturalness of 
such action from family esprit de corps is seen in the 
powerful place it has in animal life. 
The natural sanctions extend, however, beyond the 
family. The influence of kinship may be traced out into 
all‘the ramifications of blood-relationship. Not only so, 
but a similar natural bond, which the historians of society 
trace back to the family, extends to the various natural 
aggregations into which the social body falls at different 
periods in its development from the family to the village 
community, then through the various stages of tribal and 
patriarchal organization. This we need not dwell upon. 
Nor is it necessary to follow the development through the 
more enlightened periods for which we have the historical 
records—from the feudal in Europe, the civic unit in 
Greece, and the other forms of restricted communal 
organization all based upon the natural bond, up into the 
forms of higher political and social institutions. This 
esprit de corps shows itself also sentimentally in patriotism, 
race feeling, colour prejudice, etc. 
Students of philosophy, also, need not to be reminded 
that the race was many ages getting its concept of uni- 
versal brotherhood. The distinction of Jew and Gentile, 
bond and free, Greek and Barbarian, in its innumerable 
forms, is not yet entirely obsolete in the popular mind. 
National spirit is only a form of natural esprit de corps.   
-P-A-G-E-443
    The Natural Sanctions 417 
Each successive widening of the bond only serves to show 
its reality. The family bond remains, although the family 
relationship is no longer massgebend for all social organiza- 
tion, nor prohibitory of wider social attachments. Civic 
pride, which in our modern life is near to family pride, 
yet allows the wider forms of natural organization to per- 
fect themselves beside it. National life, with all its fly- 
ing of flags and blowing of horns, nevertheless does not 
supersede the family nor the city attachments; nor does it 
altogether deaden that most sublime of all the natural senti- 
ments, — the sentiment of humanity and universal brother- 
hood. So not only has this natural social sanction had its 
history ; it has become more varied and influential the far- 
ther down in history we trace the evolution of humanity. 
265. It is only a step further to recognize the forms 
of sanction which the natural esprit de corps of man brings 
to the life of the individual, reflecting themselves in his 
conduct as immediate reasons for his action. They are 
generally unconscious or subconscious. We do not hear 
a man questioning with himself as to whether he shall 
expose himself to the weather for his child, nor whether 
he shall go out to defend his city. The school hero whom 
we had occasion to cite before does not ask the question 
which school—his own or the one around the corner — 
is more worthy of his devotion and of his fists. And hav- 
ing settled that point on more direct grounds than argu- 
ment, he does not fall to arguing before he pitches into 
the town boy who reviles the school which he himself has 
just before attacked. So it is in the larger affairs of the 
adult, who fights for country when country is attacked; for 
race when race questions succeed those of country; for 
family when its honour is impugned; for himself when
-P-A-G-E-444
  418 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
his brother treads upon his rights. He does it all with 
the spontaneity which shows the action in each case to 
be natural in the most intimate sense of the word. Its 
naturalness is its justification. To say that he has no 
justification is to say that things which are not natural 
to him might yet come to him with a stronger appeal. 
The only solution in such a case is the solution of a conflict 
of sanctions —a condition which is common enough. 
But admitting that men do act on these direct natural 
sanctions, the important further question then is: what 
relation does this social or public sanction have to his own 
private sanctions, those which we have been pointing out 
in the preceding chapter? This question introduces us 
to the line of inquiries which bring in a contrast between 
the sanctions and actions upon sanctions of the individual’s 
own nature and those of society; a topic which serves 
to focus the main theoretical positions of the earlier chap- 
ters. I shall, therefore, take it up here, and also again 
in connection with each of the sorts of social sanction 
which we have to consider. 
266. What relation, then, exists between the natural 
sanctions for actions done from family and other forms 
of esprit de corps, and the private sanctions which the 
individual has for his personal acts? Evidently these are 
not two classes, but one. It is clear that in actions done 
from natural esprit de corps, the individual is acting simply 
and only from impulse. The fact that he does not reason, 
that he does not hesitate, nor ask even for ethical or social 
justification — these facts show that he is now in the region 
of just that form of compulsion which we called, in the 
consideration of his impulses, the sanction of ‘necessity.’ 
To be sure, the arena of his action is now a different one;
-P-A-G-E-445
  The Natural Sanctions 419 
it is now the social arena. His action has reference to 
a wider circle, — family, school, league, city, state, — and 
he is conscious of this reference. The content of his 
consciousness is different, for his mind is filled up with 
the being or beings for whom he is acting. But that 
does not alter the fact that the sanction is simply that 
of impulse. To make it anything else is to say that he 
appeals to other sources of influence for his reasons; 
and it is quite impossible to point out any other sources. 
When we ask him why he fights for his brother, he re- 
plies simply, as was said above, ‘because he is my 
brother.’ He cannot tell you by what law a man should 
defend his brother. He may be quite willing, indeed, to 
confess that his brother is, from the point of view of reason- 
able desert and ethical worth, quite unworthy of his pains; 
but then — he stzll fights for his brother! The sanctions 
drawn from more remote social regions or from the re- 
gions of his own higher social and ethical nature simply 
fail of application. He acts because he must, and there 
he stands, saying with that devotion to his personal nature 
which Luther put in words for all time: ‘I can do no 
otherwise.’ 
We have seen reasons, in our study, for the coincidence 
between this form of social sanction and that of the 
individual’s impulsive nature. The instincts of natural 
affection, of natural esprit de corps, are engrained in the 
very nervous organization of man. They stand on the 
basis of private possessions to him, much as his more 
self-seeking and defensive reactions do. Their relation 
to the other and, in many ways, higher influences of life 
are just those which subsist between all his impulses 
and his higher sanctions, —the relation spoken of above, 
   
-P-A-G-E-446
  420 Fis Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
where something was said of the interaction between the 
different forms of personal sanction. 
The conclusion, then, to which we come in reference to 
the relation between natural social sanctions and personal 
sanctions is this: that the former are identical with the 
sanction of necessity in the personal sphere. There are 
not two spheres of personal action in this realm of spon- 
taneous conduct, one private and the other social; the 
antithesis is a false one; there is only one sphere, that of 
the sanction of necessity. The social reference of the 
action is as natural to the individual as are his private 
references; and the sanction is one. 
267. A case illustrating the extreme force of these 
natural sanctions — perhaps the most striking case —is 
found in the care taken by parents for the next genera- 
tion. ‘Why is it,” we are asked, “that a man will sub- 
mit to all sorts of social restrictions, will work his fingers 
to the bone, will deny himself comforts and necessities, 
that he may lay by money for his children?” It is not 
the sanction merely of personal success or happiness that 
prompts him, for that would lead him to calculate the 
chances on the basis of reflective egoism, in most or all 
cases, and, if carried to an extreme, lead to the neglect of 
his children — or to the suppression of the family instinct, 
that there might be no next generation at all. But we 
do not find men acting commonly in that way. The sanc- 
tion of the impulsive nature comes in first to decree other- 
wise. The denial of that would, as the event shows, be 
to most men harder and lead to more distressing conse- 
quences — especially when we come to see that the family 
instincts are immensely reinforced from the social im- 
pulses as well—than the gratification of it.
-P-A-G-E-447
    The Natural Sanctions 421 
Nor can it be called unreasonable to indulge it. The 
sanction even of intelligence is not, as a matter of fact, 
necessarily on the side of egoism; this we have already seen. 
Purely selfish and egoistic action is the exception ; and con- 
sidering the entire equipment of the average man, z¢ zs un- 
reasonable. On the contrary, the intelligence comes to ally 
itself normally with the impulses of social and family life. 
The care of children, with all the social consequences 
which it entails, is as deep-seated as the impulse to think.! 
The measure of intelligence, in these matters, is seen in 
the degree to which the self which is identified with the 
end of desire and choice is the full self, with all its normal 
springs of action.? It is intelligent to act for this self ; and 
this self is also, as these social impulses show, in great 
measure such a social self as is the father of children. 
1 Phylogenetically, of course, it is more so, 
2 See Chap. IX., §§ 3, 5. The claim (cf. Kidd, Social Evolution) that 
action for posterity has no ‘rational sanction’ contains a further confusion 
arising from the failure to distinguish between the ‘ philosophical’ and the 
‘subjective’ ends attributed alternatively to the actor. To the utilitarian or 
chedonistic theorist the gain would be on the side of the suppression of the 
sexual instinct, for example: philosophically that would be ‘rational’ ; but to 
the actor, himself, the only real end present before him is the psychological 
end which the instinct itself brings up. If he has no other strongly impelling 
end in consciousness, how could he ‘rationally’ adopt any other? The only 
practical result from his considering family life irrational—in case he adopts 
the philosophical or the hedonistic sanction —arises from the possibility of 
his adopting preventive measures before the natural sanctions arise in force; 
that of taking occasion, while he is not socially moved, to provide for his own 
‘rationality’ when his social movings come on, There must be something of 
this kind at work in what we may call the diminishing family returns among 
the higher classes, and in France notably among the people, as statistics re- 
port. It seems to be due to a mixture of pessimistic social philosophy with 
practical hedonism; a combination of sanctions which being possible in indi- 
viduals would, in the case of such a question, have direct results upon society. 
On this form of so-called ‘ Malthusianism’ see Guyau, Mon-Religion of the 
Future, Chap. VII., and the remarkable statistical study by Karl Pearson, 
Chances of Death, Vol. I., 3.
-P-A-G-E-448
  422 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
When, indeed, the thought of self has once become ethi- 
cal, the extreme egoistic reference of the intelligence is 
normally inhibited in this sphere as in others. 
§ 2. The Pedagogical and Conventional Sanctions 
268. The second class of social institutions which claim 
our attention are those which we may describe as peda- 
gogical, in the broadest sense. The word has reference 
to the training of the individual member of society for his 
place and activities in life. It is evident, from a survey of 
society, that such institutions play an important place in 
the social economy, that they bring a most important 
series of sanctions to bear upon every sane member of 
the community. 
With these go also the ‘conventional’ institutions, by 
which I mean those which owe their continuance to pub- 
lic opinion, economic and industrial necessities, etc., stop- 
ping short of the legal and civil, which have executive 
agencies to enforce their enactments. 
No detail of the institutions of education or convention 
is necessary here, since the sanctions which they bring 
are the same in kind, whatever be the varieties of organi- 
zation which they show. The school, the university, the 
apprentice’s bench, the clerk’s desk, the business rule, 
all require the individual to submit to certain regulations, 
both positive and negative in nature, which are vital 
to his success in becoming an effective member of so- 
ciety, in the way which his choice of life-conditions pre- 
scribes. These ways, in which the fact of having to 
learn in order to act comes to set the reasons for the 
actual course which the person pursues, are the essential
-P-A-G-E-449
   The Pedagogical and Conventional Sanctions 423 
considerations to us now; and the ‘reasons’ themselves 
are social sanctions. 
269. For preliminary purposes, we may contrast the 
cases of action from these influences into two great 
classes: the actions of submission to regulations to which 
the person is compelled to submit, on the one hand; and 
those, on the other hand, to which he voluntarily or spon- 
taneously submits. The latter class, it is evident, will 
include many sorts of restraint, discipline, etc., to which 
it is necessary that he should submit; but the fact that he 
chooses to do so voluntarily suffices to throw them into 
the second class mentioned.! 
First, as to the influences of an educational kind — in 
the broadest sense —to which the individual social learner 
bows his head submissively that he may learn. These 
actions evidently belong to the pedagogical discipline, 
which comes rather late in life, when the student or 
social actor has free choice of the course he intends to 
pursue, and of the means, degree of excellence, etc., 
which appear to him good. The reason that we find it 
well to throw all these influences together for remark, is 
that they are not in any sense peculiarly social influences 
after the individual has once made them personal to him- 
self by choosing them. . This is the more evident when 
we throw the consideration of them on the side of sanc- 
tion. The sanction becomes at once personal, in becom- 
ing the conscious reason on which the individual acts, 
although they remain also social. They are always 
social, since they are the prescriptions which society 
1 Many of the regulations to which he is compelled to submit fall under the 
class of ‘ civil sanctions’ (see Sect. 275), a class which cannot be separated by 
any strict division from the present, as the final result will show. 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
    424 fis Socral Sanctions: Social Opposition 
makes for success in this or that career. But it is not as 
social prescriptions that the individual pursues them; nor 
are the sanctions which society brings to bear on him 
operative only because they are prescriptions of society. 
By making choice of this line or act of conduct, he sets 
them up in his own mind as objects of desire; and thus 
makes himself, in these particular spheres of action, 
liable to the personal sanction of desire. 
The consideration already given in the earlier section 
(Chap. IX., § 3) to the sanction of desire, therefore, covers 
this case also. And we may at once say that, as for the 
social prescriptions of a pedagogical or conventional kind, 
which the individual voluntarily embraces as objects of 
desire, they are without further change personal prescrip- 
tions, and so have his personal sanction. Any antithesis 
between the social and the individual in regard to these 
influences, and the actions to which they lead, is #s0 facto 
impossible. 
270. Passing, then, to certain remaining pedagogical 
influences, — those to which the individual submits by 
example or by suggestion, without choice or without 
knowing that he is under them,—we have to inquire 
into the kinds of sanction which they bring, and the re- 
lation of these to his personal ones. It may be well 
to indicate the fact that this class and the foregoing are 
not mutually exclusive in their actual range with different 
individuals, or even in the case of a single individual. 
The same social prescriptions may be accepted voluntarily 
by one man, and rejected by another; such cases are 
common enough. And the same prescription may be 
now accepted and now rejected by the same man. In 
disposing, therefore, of the class of cases already spoken
-P-A-G-E-451
    
The Pedagogical and Conventional Sanctions 425 
of, we have not settled the place of any particular social 
regulation; we have merely found that, in all cases of a 
certain conscious attitude, on the part of the actor, toward 
a regulation of whatever kind, his sanction is then deter- 
mined by his attitude. 
In this second case —that is, in cases in which this atti- 
tude is absent — we have a series of interesting instances. 
All the phenomena of social heredity, already spoken of in 
detail, come in here; phenomena which show the child or 
adult absorbing without effort or explicit choice the details 
of his social birthright, from the earliest lessons in deport- 
ment to the last imitative responses which he makes to the 
‘copies’ in style, dress, opinion, etc., of those about him, 
and in all the larger spheres of literature, art, political 
opinion, humane and philanthropic sentiment, and general 
social conformity. What are the sanctions for these per- 
formances? 
271. There are two general concepts which have about 
equal application to these phenomena; both concepts with 
which we are now fairly familiar. These instances of 
action seem to get their sanction about equally from the 
individual’s ‘social emotion as such’ —as we have found 
it well to call it (Chap. VI., § 4)—on the one hand, 
and from his sensitiveness to ‘public opinion’ on the 
other hand. 
By ‘social emotion as such,’ it will be remembered, we 
understood the phenomena of collective action, contagion 
of feeling, mob-influence, etc., which is a favourite topic just 
now with psychologically inclined writers on social themes. 
Our earlier examination of the phenomena enables us to 
give these factors of collective action their right place 
with reference to the individual. We came to the con-
-P-A-G-E-452
  426 His Soctal Sanctions: Social Opposition 
clusion that the phenomena are only exaggerated instances 
of the gregarious tendency or impulse, upon which all social 
life rests, and consequently that they arise through the imi- 
tative relation. This is the type of function to which all 
these tendencies may be reduced.!_ The whole growth of 
the individual, both in his instruction and in his inven- 
tion, proceeds by imitation. It is the law of his acquisi- 
tion. The socially characteristic attitude in man must, 
whatever else it include, include the impulse or instinct 
to imitate. Once give this impulse a chance to operate 
without restraint or with encouragement in a group of 
men, and free action of the collective or co-operative type 
results. 
Besides the opportunities to show itself afforded to this 
impulse by collective suggestion, — the extreme case being 
mob-action, — the sphere of education gives it all the while 
its chance to get in its work. In education, not only is 
imitation not restrained ; it is, on the contrary, constantly 
appealed to and encouraged. The child that does not 
imitate does not learn. It is only a short step, therefore, 
to the conclusion that the individual’s reason for acting in 
accordance with the educational and conventional prescrip- 
tions is simply that he feels moved to imitate spontaneously 
whenever he can; and his reason, that is his sanction. 
272. The same follows, also, from the analysis of the 
individual’s process of conceiving himself. It would be 
trite to repeat that the sense of self grows by constant 
absorption from the personality suggestions thrown in 
the way of the child by his social fellows. He must 
learn of his fellows if he would grow in knowledge of him- 
self. But the only way that he can learn of his fellows is 
1 See also below, Chap. XII., § 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-453
The Pedagogical and Conventional Sanctions 427 
by doing what they do, so as to feel as they feel and know 
what they know. Again, the only way — after he has made 
his imitative interpretations in his own self-thought — that 
he can enrich the personalities of others with the same 
attributes, is to read back imitatively into them the things 
he knows about himself. The point of value to us now 
is this: that both of these are imitative processes. They 
proceed by imitative steps; and the real sanction that the 
child or man has for all the acts of general social con- 
formity; represented by his personal emotions and _ atti- 
tudes, is the sanction which his imitation expresses. 
Imitation, however, is an impulsive and spontaneous 
thing. In all the forms of action to which it gives rise 
it falls under the head of impulse, and so has the sanction 
that impulse in general has: the sanction of psychologi- 
cal necessity! We reach the conclusion, therefore, that 
the sanction of all those elements of action, in the 
pedagogical realm, which spring from the spontaneous 
conformities of the individual to the imitative lessons 
of the social body —the sanction of all these actions is 
necessity; and we come round again ¢o the personal type 
of sanction. 
273. The same reduction to the personal sanction holds 
also, it is just as well to say at once, of the other ingre- 
dient in these acts of educational and conventional con- 
formity: the element spoken of above as the influence of 
public opinion. This has already been described and 
treated in connection with social and ethical sentiment.? 
1 Where it becomes voluntary, as in ‘persistent’ imitation and volition, it

428 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
The word ‘publicity’ has been used to describe the social 
reference which characterizes ethical actions. Its place 
in the growth of the ethical and social sense has been 
indicated; and we have only to recall the position which 
the alter thought holds in all the personal development 
of a man, to see that public opinion gets its sanction not 
from the fact that it is public (in an objective sense, as 
common or open to all men), but from the fact that it is 
privately conceived to be public (has publicity ascribed to 
it in the individual’s private thought). All social know- 
ledge must have both public and private value to me, if it 
is to have any influence on my actions in the way of giving 
them sanction. The private aspect then makes the sanc- 
tion personal. 
To make this plain, we may recall the truths that even 
in the spontaneous period of action the child cannot treat 
others with the deference due to personality —the defer- 
ence due to their opinion, his public’s opinion — without 
taking the personal attitudes which make the thought of 
the alter, of the public, also the thought of himself. His 
thought of an act, as good, or sanctioned, for them to 
perform, is necessarily the thought of it as also good, 
sanctioned, for him to perform. It is good to perform, 
that is as far as he goes; and it is a matter of indifference 
whether the performer be he or they. This follows from 
the oneness of the sense of self. 
When we track the matter of public opinion into the 
intellectual period, we find it possible again to utilize at 
once our earlier results. The sense of public opinion 
may be distinguished from the simple fact of public opin- 
ion. Public opinion may influence a man’s intellectual 
processes, although he may not be thinking with refer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
    The Pedagogical and Conventional Sanctions 429 
ence to public opinion, nor even know that it is influ- 
encing him. Each such case is one or other of those just 
considered: either a case of unconscious social conformity 
by imitation, so falling under the sanction of impulse, or 
a case of social and ethical judgment and sentiment which 
falls under the sanction of desire. 
But the man may act with explicit reference to public 
opinion in one or more of certain other ways which we 
have come to recognize. Either he acts with a view to 
changing, appeasing, persuading, his fellow-men, — in 
which case his action has again the personal sanction 
of desire,—or he acts from the vantage-ground of more 
or less adequate knowledge of others’ approval or con- 
demnation. This latter case proceeds upon the analysis 
just made above, where we found that his sense of another’s 
judgment involved himself, as passing the same judgment 
through the reciprocity of the relation of the ego and alter 
personalities. This makes the sanction, now ethical, a 
personal one. We come upon it again later, in considering 
the more ethical influences which society exerts upon the 
individual. 
Or yet again, the man may act with a view to utilizing 
public opinion, or some other form of social influence, for 
some indirect personal end,—a process which we have 
described at some length as characterizing the child’s 
advent into the intelligent period. This, it is clear, brings 
the influence of public opinion out of the social sphere alto- 
gether into that of private ends; and makes the sanction 
again clearly one of desire. 
So we have to conclude that the influence of public 
opinion is exerted entirely through sanctions private to 
the individual in the first instance, however common they 
 
-P-A-G-E-456
  430 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
may be to different individuals; and that, in this realm, 
the antithesis between personal and social sanctions is 
again false, since there are no exclusively social sanctions 
as such. 
274. There remains only one other aspect of the peda- 
gogical problem which bears upon this matter of sanction: 
that of the compulsory social conformities. There are 
certain things which the child and the adult must learn 
in order to live socially; just as there are some things 
which he must do—certain duties to society — in order to 
live. The things of his learning, however, fall really in 
the other category, that of doing. Learning is a thing 
that he must do. And as the sanctions of our next cate- 
gory, called the ‘civil’ sanctions, take cognizance of these 
cases of doing in the compulsory meaning of the term, 
this sort of learning may be brought up again under that 
head. 
§ 3. The Civil Sanctions 
275. We come now to consider those great institutions 
of social life which exist from generation to generation as 
monuments to what is most human: institutions of gov- 
ernment, law, justice, etc. It is evident, of course, that 
we cannot attempt within the limits of the present essay 
—even if we were prepared to do so—to develop a 
philosophy of these great permanent social and political 
institutions. The very classification of them together in 
the scheme of treatment now proposed shows that it is 
only a single aspect of them which is to be brought 
forward. That aspect is their sanction aspect, so to speak. 
And the justification of the grouping together of things 
otherwise so disparate is here. I mean to say that the
-P-A-G-E-457
    The Civil Sanctions 431 
sphere of all those institutions of a social kind to which 
the individual must submit as a good citizen—and to 
which he must still submit in a more imperative sense if 
he be a bad citizen — is the same from the point of view 
of their sanction, which we may call the ‘civil sanction.’ 
The question which comes before us, therefore, in this 
connection concerns the nature of this civil sanction. Do 
we find here, in the things which society and its institu- 
tions require of the individual man, a reason or sanction for 
action which is distinctively social, that is, a sanction for 
which the individual has no equivalent in his own nature 
as a personal actor? 
276. At first sight, it looks as though we should have 
to answer this question in the affirmative. And those 
who are familiar with the socialistic literature of the pres- 
ent day will see that the affirmative answer to this ques- 
tion is the first and unanimous assumption of modern 
socialism. It is, of course, characteristic of the nihilistic 
and anarchistic positions to claim that society represents 
in its great institutions of law, justice, vested property, 
etc., a great power which is enforcing its regulations upon 
the individual against his will, and, in many cases, against 
his reason and judgment. It is as well to recognize the 
extreme form of this doctrine in order to trace it also in 
the milder forms in which it presents itself in socialism. 
The socialistic propaganda to-day seems to me to get its 
strength from two elements in its teaching: first, its real 
return to individualism: that is, its full recognition of the 
autonomy of the individual; acting under the personal 
form of sanction; and second, its supposition of a real 
antithesis between the interests and sanctions of the indi- 
vidual and those of the social group as society is at
-P-A-G-E-458
    432 fis Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
present constituted. The first of these elements is seen 
in the assumption that the individual is capable of gov- 
erning himself without the compulsory machinery by 
which society administers the accumulated and still de- 
veloping wisdom of the ages. This position, of course, 
opens the socialist doctrine to the criticism that the indi- 
vidual is a very poor creature after all; that to trust him to 
do better, after he has undone the work of the past, is not 
convenient. Yet I do not care to discuss this question, 
since it is the other element of the socialistic position 
which principally concerns us. 
This other element — the assumption that there is a 
real antithesis between the demands made upon a man by 
the civil order of the time and the demands of his own 
nature —seems to me to be present in all this modern 
development. And there must be in some sense a real 
antithesis here, since these writers seem to illustrate such 
an antithesis in their own personal attitude.t 
The relations of the individual to his social environment 
are such, however, that we are led to make two state- 
ments, under which we should expect the different aspects 
of the case to fall, if our previous discussions have brought 
us to correct views. These we may state and then de- 
velop, in view of the asserted antithesis between the two 
factors. 
1It should be said, in order not to be unjust, that the socialistic zdeal 
involves only the first assumption: that of complete harmony between the 
individual in society and the central bureau by which he would allow the 
collective affairs to be administered. But it is just this assumption which his 
practical attitude toward civil institutions seems to contradict. Such an ideal 
could be approached only by some show of harmonious action on the part of 
the two interests, through which society and the individual might grow together 
toward their common goal.
-P-A-G-E-459
    The Civil Sanctions 433 
I. We find reason for distinguishing between the average 
man and the exceptional man ; the man socially normal on 
the one hand; and, on the other hand, the man socially 
remarkable, such as the genius at one extreme of mental 
variation and the mentally defective at the other. 
II. The antithesis between the sanctions of the civil 
and those of a personal kind arise only to the exceptional 
man, or to the exceptional judgments of the average man. 
277. We may consider first the ‘average man’ with 
reference to both of these statements, dwelling a little 
on the first; for, while no one would deny that there are 
average men and exceptional men, yet the sense in which 
it is to be enforced below requires that it be clearly under- 
stood from the social and ethical points of view. 
I. The socially ‘average’ man is the man who passes 
normally through the stages of social learning represented 
by the pedagogical sanctions already spoken of. We saw, 
in asking as to the qualifications of the candidate for the 
heritage which society offers, that they were two: he must 
be born to learn, and all must be born to learn the same 
things.’ Only on the assumption of these qualifications in 
the individuals is the development of social institutions at 
all possible. For, as we also saw, if a large proportion 
of the young of any generation should be born to rebel 
against the pedagogical sanctions of their group, or with 
strains of heredity which make it impossible for them to 
profit by the teachings of society, so soon must society 
go to pieces; unless, indeed, it have some resource apart 
from the appeal to individuals for the enforcement of the 
sanctions which its organization prescribes. There must 
always be an average person who represents two things: 
1 Chap. IL, § 1.
-P-A-G-E-460
  434 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
first, the degree of social hereditary endowment which 
normally develops in the channels of established social 
usage and requirement; and second, he must represent 
in his mature opinions the usages, sympathies, and formu- 
lated demands of social conformity as such. 
This latter requirement is more difficult to see, but it 
is real. The development of the ethical, and of the pecul- 
iarly social sense which goes with the ethical, gives that 
‘publicity’ to the ideal judgments of the individual which . 
(as we saw in Sect. 200) means that the public knows of the 
private act and agrees with the private agent in his judg- 
ment of it. This is a necessary thing in all the maturer 
members of society. The decrees of society get their pas- 
sage, in the first instance, only through the recognition 
by many individuals of this publicity of judgment with 
the objective agreements upon which it rests. They then 
pass into legal enactments and so become crystallized in 
institutions. But back of them there still remain, and 
must remain, the individuals who represent just the aver- 
age social attainment embodied in the public civil enact- 
ments. 
In these individuals, who establish the social level, so 
to speak, society finds the court of appeal; not as indi- 
viduals, but as the standard bearers, in their collective or 
public capacity, of her own standards. Of course, the 
two qualifications of the average individual are not dis- 
tinct; it is only through the first that he gets the second. 
Only through his pedagogical training can he grow into 
the judgments, sentiments, etc., which make him finally 
a fit bearer of the public standards of his time. And the 
psychological reader will see the meaning of it all in the 
individual’s own development. It is the essential growth 
   
-P-A-G-E-461
The Civil Sanctions 435 
of his personality which is concerned in the attaining of 
social conformity of personal judgment, in the first in- 
stance; and his growth into that ‘publicity’ of judgment, 
which makes him at once a loyal supporter of the social 
institutions of his day and place, is an equally essential 
and momentous phase of his personal development. 
278. II. The second of our points may be raised in 
reference to this average man. Can there be an antith- 
esis between the social sanctions under which his life 
of conformity is lived, and the personal sanctions which 
his own nature lays down? Is it possible that he may 
conform to the civil enactments of his country and time 
under protest of his personal nature? 
We have in this matter one of the most subtle phases 
of the developed social consciousness, and we may not 
hope to say anything final. I think, however, that the 
distinctions now made serve to give us the, main lines of 
a partial answer. The distinction between the normal 
and the exceptional has to be carried further in two ways. 
1. First, individuals vary in their normal, about one or 
other of the personal standards of sanction which all have 
in common. We have already remarked that some prefer 
the intellectual sanction; in them it rules the impulsive, 
and, in some degree, also the ethical. Others, on the 
contrary, naturally live lives of impulse; while a third 
class exhibit a most refined ethical sensitiveness. 
This distinction in individuals — within the class of aver- 
age men — represents one possibility of a conflict between 
the social and the personal sanctions; that shown by the 
theorist or dissenter as such. Here is the man who 
argues about society on the basis of the intellectual sanc- 
tion alone. The majority of socialistic writers —to take 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
  436 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
one case only-—seem to me to fall here: men who them- 
selves represent, in their training, the average which 
comes from a life of normal social conformity, and who 
generally represent standard judgments also, as to the 
usages and customs of society; but who proceed to reason 
beyond these standards by their application of the intel- 
lectual sanction to problems which do not permit of purely 
intellectual solutions. For their argumentation does vio- 
lence to other sanctions which are still in force, and upon 
which the institutions of society are built. 
The important thing to be noted in this case is more 
than the antithesis between the social and the personal; it 
is the antithesis between the two sorts of personal sanction. 
There is an average social judgment, but it is unsupported 
by the intellect: a conflict of personal sanctions results. 
The individual theorist gets a result from the joint action 
of his personal sanctions, different from that which the 
average man gets; an adjustment in favour of new intel- 
lectual conclusions, with their social corollaries. This 
leads him to raise his voice, on intellectual grounds, in 
opposition to the existing social order; at the same time 
that his personal endorsement of the social sanctions 
keeps him within the sphere of practical conformity. 
As an extreme example of this interesting strife of 
sanctions we find the anarchist. Here is a man whose in- 
tellectual, hedonic, or economic sanctions lead him into 
open rebellion against the social order. He seems to me, 
however, to fall outside the class of average men, since 
his private reproduction of current social sanctions is so 
inadequate. 
279. 2. The second way in which the distinction between 
the average and the exceptional gets application, in the
-P-A-G-E-463
    The Civil Sanctions 437 | 
sphere still of the average class, is in the judgments of the 
single individual himself. The average man’s judgments 
vary from the usual to the exceptional. Here is the com- 
mon case of the Zobéy. Many of us are practically insane 
on some one topic. Our friends grant us indulgence when 
we strike our hobby. The psychology of hobbies is well 
written ; it is the case of a preferred apperceptive system 
grown to an inordinate size. And it is not difficult to con- 
strue it in terms of the play of sanctions. A man may see 
so clearly the reasons for a thing—be they personal, 
social, intellectual, ethical—that he allows that thing to 
overshadow in his mind other things for which he would 
also see the sanction if he once gave their thought a chance.! 
And inasmuch as these other things do get a chance in 
the minds of others, and perhaps get a more urgent sanc- 
tion than the one thing upon which his thought dwells, he 
comes into conflict with them and their institutions. The 
current revolt — fortunately largely literary and theoretical 
— against marriage is a capital case in point. The senti- 
mental sanction which the emotional life seems sometimes 
to give to the violation of the law of marriage gets, in the 
mind of Mr. Grant Allen,—to take an instance of one 
who, by publishing his opinions, has made himself fair play 
for criticism,—an importance which justifies a revolt 
against the social prescriptions of established society. The 
social sanctions for marriage seen in the existence and 
separate life of the family — with all that this means to 
the theory of social sanctions, especially in its pedagogical 
and ethical aspects, —all this is overweighed in the mind 
of such a writer, we may suppose, by the sanction of a

however, should be viewed ina larger whole of truth,

-P-A-G-E-464
  438 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
personal kind represented by the opinion: /e mariage, 
cest Vinjustice. But this is not primarily an antithesis 
between social and personal sanctions; it is rather again 
a controversy among different sanctions arising about a 
particular problem, in the mind of an individual who is, in 
other respects, a man of conformity to the judgments 
which the institutions of society represent. In so far as it 
does come to the test of argument between men, it fur- 
nishes a case of the opposition between the intellectual 
and the social sanctions, to be spoken of again below. 
There is here also a form of conflict which takes its rise 
in the ‘ private opposition’ of the individual, whether from 
contrary suggestion, exaggerated self-competence, or mere 
love of social contrast between himself and others; a set 
of phenomena pointed out in an earlier place. This con- 
flict is quite on the plane of private impulse, except in so 
far as it takes on intellectual and ethical form. The sanc- 
tion for such actions of private opposition is, therefore, in 
any case, personal. 
280. The general conclusion already intimated seems 
just, therefore, that so far as the average man is concerned, 
his sanctions are not of two kinds, one set social and the 
other set personal, between which there arises chronic or 
acute opposition; but on the contrary, he has only one set 
of sanctions, those which he regards as his own. The 
actual oppositions which do arise in his life and opinion 
are rather apropos of questions regarding which he finds 
room for discussion, and for the more thoroughgoing appli- 
cation of the intellectual sanction. 
281. 3. Before we leave the consideration of the aver- 
age man, however, a single further point may be indicated. 
1 Chap. VI, § 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-465
    The Civil Sanctions 439 
We see that, so far from finding opposition between the 
social requirements of life and his personal sanctions for 
conduct, his tendency is quite in the opposite direction. 
As a general thing, he lives so well under the shadow of 
the social roof, that a certain social discount is put upon 
originality of view, and more still upon originality of 
action. The average man is reduced to the size of the 
social crevice into which his rearing and his obedience 
have thrust him. So far from finding it a trial to con- 
form to society’s requirements, he finds himself in tor- 
ment when he is forced out of them. There is a certain 
benumbing effect upon the individuals in this social rela- 
tionship; an effect which is conspicuous in the type of 
attitude already called ‘conservatism.’ This great force in 
society becomes crystallized in a prevalent spirit of con- 
ventional conformity to type, and a certain veneration for 
age and rule which make social excellence out of the 
average, and put a discount on progress. If further evi- 
dence were needed to prove the absence of opposition 
between the ‘social and the personal sanction in general, 
and in the average man, it would be found in this con- 
servatism. It becomes a habit of mind. It makes a 
virtue of dulness and a vice of invention. It is but 
another case of that tendency of which we have seen 
several examples before, —the general tendency to social 
inertia and habit. 
It is largely in reference to this, it seéms, that the 
intellectual opposition between the personal and the 
social, as just pointed out, gets its development. The 
oppositions which arise through the use of intelligence 
upon social and political questions is first of all joined 
in an issue with the formulations of the conservative
-P-A-G-E-466
    440 is Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
extreme. And many of the oppositions really cease 
there. The opposition is very sharp, however, in many 
cases; and it is often in the intolerance of conservatism, 
with its social tradition, that ‘radicalism’ finds its oppor- 
tunity. I do not mean to take up again! these two 
opposed forces in social and political life,—a topic 
worthy, however, of fuller consideration, — but only to 
point out that the actual opposition of the acute kind 
seen in political strife, and in the many controversies 
which have marked the path of human progress through 
the ages, has had much of its motive in the artificial 
intensity of these two habits of mind. Real as may 
be the opposition of the intelligence and its sanctions 
to the established forms of government, religion, and 
social convention, and its reality is of the first im- 
portance for the life and progress of the social as such 
when the intelligence is on the side of the higher and 
the ethical, — yet it must not be considered as finding its 
true measure in the tide of passion arrayed on the side 
of one or other of these two habitual attitudes of mankind. 
282, Coming now to the exceptional men, we have a 
very different state of things. Men may be social ex- 
ceptions in many different ways; and possibly the best 
method of describing some of them—as well as the 
shortest way of answering our question in reference to 
them — is by looking first at the cases for which society 
has special or exceptional forms of treatment. It would, 
of course, be impossible to deny opposition between the 
personal and the social sanctions for conduct in cases 
in which society takes direct cognizance of just this op- 
1 Cf. what has been said on ‘ conservatism’ and ‘ liberalism,’ above, Chap. 
Vi § 3.
-P-A-G-E-467
  The Civil Sanctions 441 
position. The treatment may be brief, however, seeing 
that some of these social variations have already been 
mentioned.! First of all, there are the defective classes. 
These do not recognize the regulations of society simply 
because they cannot. Their presence does not affect the 
progress of society, because they are not elements in 
society one way or the other. They are a problem for 
society to use its wits on, that it may carry them with as 
little loss of energy as possible; that is all. Among the 
defectives we may include all kinds of defect, physical, 
mental, and moral, up to the cases in which the defect 
becomes of actual or threatened damage to others in 
some way; in this case, we begin to have various sorts 
of violent and criminal persons. These, again, society 
deals summarily with. The opposition is real; but it is 
not fruitful. 
And what I mean by saying that it is not fruitful is 
this: that these men have no following, they do not rep- 
resent an influence of vitality to come into opposition to 
the organizing and reducing forces of society. They fur- 
nish problems both to society and to the individual, but 
neither finds in them an ally. 
283. Yet there is one interesting aspect of the defect 
recognized as moral, which brings it in some degree 
within the range of our earlier topics. Crime is con- 
tagious. Crime is a defect which becomes, from the 
sphere in which it develops, essentially anti-social. So 
the contagion of it, the following that it gets from the 
fact of ‘plastic imitation’ already spoken of, leads to a 
semi-organized revolt, in some cases, against the highest 
sanctions of society. It is clear, however, that such 
1 Above, Chap. II., § 3.
-P-A-G-E-468
  442 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
movements of contagion in crime, as similar movements 
in the acts of the mob, fall within the sphere of impulse 
in the individual’s consciousness. That is all that need 
be added to what has already been said.} 
284. There remain, however, two great classes of the 
‘exceptional.’ They are the intellectually exceptional and 
the ethically exceptional When we come to put the 
question whether in these there is any opposition between 
the personal and the social sanctions, certain truths imme- 
diately come to mind, drawn from the consideration of 
the genius in the earlier chapter. 
We found that the man of exceptionally good intellect- 
ual endowment might be a variation in one or both of two 
ways. He might bea great thinker and a man of good 
social judgment —the true genius—or a man of great 
intellectual ability and of poor judgment—the pseudo- 
genius. We also saw that a man of either of these 
types might come into direct conflict with the sanctions 
of society: the genius, to instruct; and the pseudo-genius, 
to rebel. Let us rest for the present in this conclusion, 
referring for its justification to the earlier section of our 
essay; and say, as a net gain to our thought, that real 
opposition may arise between the personal and the social 
sanctions of a man on the side of his intelligence. He 
may not judge true what society judges true; and he may 
not submit voluntarily, or at all. 
This may take two forms from the point of view of such 
a man’s sanctions. First, the ‘sanction of truth’ may be 
invoked by him in his theoretical thinking, and he may 
adopt ends different from those currently pursued. Second, 
he may invoke the ‘sanction of success’ both with refer- 
1 Above, Chap. VI, § 5.
-P-A-G-E-469
    
The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 443 
ence to the action which society requires of him and with 
reference to the regulations which are social — by success 
understanding the expediency and appropriateness of the 
results secured to the ends which he and society agree in 
setting up. 
This conclusion may be added to that of the same kind 
reached above, where we considered the case of the excep- 
tional judgment of the average man; and we have the 
view that there may be direct opposition between the sanc- 
tions of the two kinds, social and personal, in the intel- 
lectual sphere, —a confirmation of the general statements 
made at the beginning of our consideration of the civil 
sanctions. 
The consideration of the corresponding ethical conflict 
which is due to the individual’s moral variations follows 
on a later page.!_ It implicates the entire theory of social 
progress, which is still to be expounded. The normal 
ethical and religious sanctions, however, are considered in 
the next paragraph. 
§ 4. The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 
285. Coming, finally, to ask about the ethical and reli- 
gious sanctions which the social life imposes upon men, 
we find it possible to be very brief; for in this sphere the 
distinction between the personal and the social is not 
generally made, even in society itself, in our day. 
It seems evident from the discussions of preceding 
pages that there can be no opposition between society 
and the individual in the matter of the essential demands 
of the moral and religious consciousness. The fact of 
1 Chap. XIV., §§ 3 4.  
-P-A-G-E-470
  444 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
‘publicity’ in all religious and ethical thought makes it 
necessary that the same ideal should be erected in the 
individual and in the community in which the individual 
is reared, since the growth of the ideal self-thought in 
the individual depends constantly upon the absorption of 
moral and religious suggestions from the social environ- 
ment. This has been spoken of at sufficient length. 
Both the individuals and society must be moral and reli- 
gious, and similarly moral and religious. Speaking, then, 
of the ‘matter’ of the ideal consciousness, as it is realized 
in the ‘ought’ judgments, on the one hand, and in the feel- 
ings of dependence and mystery, on the other hand, we may 
say that opposition does not normally arise between society 
and the man. Their sanction is the same, —a function of 
the necessary movement of the human mind in its devel- 
opment toward an ideal self-thought.! In the ethical judg- 
ments this sanction is administered exclusively by the 
individual conscience. It is a personal sanction; yet the 
‘publicity’ of it makes it also a matter of mutual judg- 
ment, to which each individual is, as we have seen, 
peculiarly sensitive. 
The same may be said in the main of the religious life. 
Historically, it is true, there has been a real question here; 
and history shows us the possibility of an acute opposition 
in the religious sphere. Religion has been given an arti- 
ficial civil sanction. But yet it is true, as a matter of fact, 
that there is now, at least in the countries which separate

religious sanctions, since religion is no longer a thing of 
recognized social sanction at all. 
286. As far as there is, however, in informal urgency 
about religious conformity,—a sort of sanction exerted 
upon the individual through the social usages and strenu- 
ous beliefs of his community, —this comes under the head 
of pedagogical sanction of the more conventional type 
seen in public opinion, of which we have already said 
enough. The average man yields so readily to suggestion 
in this sphere, and goes, indeed, so readily to extremes in 
his suggestibility, that the sphere of religion becomes and 
has always been a stronghold of the conservative spirit. 
This is the more emphasized in history by the dogmatic 
claims of religious systems, which amount to civil sanc- 
tions of a supernatural kind, so to speak, coming to rein- 
force the pedagogical sanctions, and so to create what 
may be called a new sanction altogether, —that of divine 
authority. The relation of this to the other forms of 
sanction does not concern us directly, except as raising 
the new question as to the autonomy of the individual in 
his action under the sanctions which he finds personal to 
himself. Considered in this light, it is well to look a little 
more closely at what I may designate the sanction of 
religious authority. 
287. It is when we come to what may be called the 
‘form’ of the religious sentiment, —the institutions, and 
more especially the doctrines, in which it is cast at this 
time or that, — that we find this influence in operation. A 
genetic theory of doctrine — of which religious doctrine is 
the best instance —remains to be written. But when it 
is written, it will have to answer the question as to the 
general relation of the human intelligence to human senti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  446 ts Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
ment, and the social uses made of the intelligence in influ- 
encing sentiment. The problem of the rise, progress, and 
sanction of religious doctrine really rests upon that of 
the relation of these different personal functions to one 
another. 
In the first place, we have seen that the essential utility 
of the intelligence, both in race development and in the 
individual’s personal growth, is its use in opening the 
avenues and directing the expressions of feeling, emotion, 
and sentiment. This appeared in the checks and inhi- 
bitions which we saw the child exerting upon his own con- 
duct as soon as he came to act intelligently. It appeared 
also in the social uses which we saw him so acutely 
making of the attitudes, emotions, actions, of others in 
his social environment. We saw reason to believe also 
that this is so important a factor in social progress — 
this intellectual control of the social agencies — that its 
advent marks one of the great crises in race-history. 
We should expect, if this be true, that this all-directing 
power—the power of thought — would not leave this 
highest province of our emotional nature free from its 
constructive endeavour, either in the one province —the 
individual’s private judgments— or in the other, the reli- 
gious judgments of the race. 
This expectation is realized in the very relation which 
intelligence bears to sentiment. This has also been inti- 
mated. The content of religious sentiment takes on, by 
the very conditions of its rise in and with the individual’s 
personal growth, certain forms of rational statement. The 
categories of personality, cause, and design are among these 
constant intelligent moulds of the religious ideal; and the 
concrete filling which they get, once and again, has its char-
-P-A-G-E-473
  The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 447 
acter from the degree of refinement which the personality 
constructions, sustaining the ideal, show at this epoch or 
that. There must always arise, therefore, religious doc- 
trines in the individual and religious dogmas in society. 
288. We have also seen that there is a necessary ¢ec- 
tive postulation of the intellectual content of the ideal; 
in this case, of the religious formulation. The existence 
of the object of worship is a function of its very thought ; 
for there is no divorce between personal thought and per- 
sonal belief. Reality comes only by an artificial abstrac- 
tion from thought. So there is always a direct objectifying 
of religious sentiment in the world. Men are theists in 
some form. 
289. And man is not isolated. His sense of the pub- 
licity of his beliefs makes him, in a sense, a legislator 
for others. His own sense of ethical obligation is just 
this element of publicity itself reflected subjectively. So 
the obligation to do what he ought and to make others 
do what they ought is never absent from his sense of 
the divine being who is the embodiment of what ought 
to be done, and the source of its sanction. 
There arises, therefore, ipso facto, with the religious 
sentiment, some public religious institution. It is a social 
institution. In early times, before the differentiation of 
the sentiments, it is also a political institution. This 
institution becomes, from the element of publicity, more 
a rallying-place for conservatism than any other institu- 
tion. It has the supernatural sanction direct from the 
personal divinity. The individual who is so far excep- 
tional in his personal growth as to reach an intellectual 
construction of the religious ideal different in its form 
from the form thus divinely sanctioned, is a rebel against
-P-A-G-E-474
  448 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
society and against God. And it is only a step for society 
to conclude, in such a case, as it concludes in all the cases 
of anti-social individuals who are harmful to established 
institutions, that such an individual should be suppressed. 
History bears witness to the strenuousness of this convic- 
tion. 
290. Religious doctrine is an attempt to put into in- 
tellectual formulas the ideal which shall satisfy the sense 
of dependence, mystery, sin— and all the phases of reli- 
gious and ethical emotion — once for all. It must be once 
for all, since its very ideal demands its finality. But this 
once-for-allness, with the legislative character for all intel- 
ligences which goes with it, makes it impossible that it 
should provide for the very process of development which 
its own genesis and social progress require. So when 
there arises a reformer, a prophet, a new systematizer, 
he can get recognition only in one of two ways, both of 
which are interestingly represented in great historical per- 
sonages; either (1) by making the revelation which he 
brings purely practical, z.e., in the social and ethical sphere 
of personal attitude, in which improvement is directly en- 
joined, or (2) by showing that his doctrines are but new 
interpretations of old truths, serving to confirm the faith 
of society and the teachings of the ecclesiastical circle. 
But it is evident that either of these may be a subter- 
fuge; a surrender to the finality which the supernatural 
sanction attaches to religious formulations. It remains to 
ask how religious progress is possible, if this supernatural 
sanction continue in force. 
291. I think the solution of history goes far to prove 
the theoretical solution of the conflict between the per- 
sonal and the social sanctions given above. There has
-P-A-G-E-475
  The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 449 
been a gradual reduction of the social form of religious 
* sanction, claiming both supernatural and civil authority, to 
the ethical form of personal sanction. As long as the 
supernatural sanction had its locus in society,! so long did 
it necessarily weigh on the side of conservatism and lead 
to social stagnation and decay. For then the formulas in 
which it was embodied, having no part in the progres- 
sive social movement which the individual’s personal 
growth represented, remained final, dogmatic, and extrin- 
sic as well to the more refined and subtle movements 
of social and ethical sentiment. It has been just the 
growth of ethical sentiment, with the ever renewed and 
revised adjustments in the social body, to which it tends 
to lead, which has made possible the reduction of the 
supernatural sanction to the personal form. This has led 
to a gradual entrainment of the religious sentiment in the 
channels of ethical culture, with a corresponding emphasis 
upon the religious autonomy of the individual, while 
this in turn has strengthened the personal form of the 
religious sanction, as of course it must; since it has 
brought to an end the conflict between the sanctions of 
personal duty administered by conscience and those of 
religious rites and observances administered by an infal- 
lible but external authority. The place of the social reli- 
gious sanction, therefore, in human progress has been, like 
all other social sanctions, available and advantageous for 
progress — that is, apart from its conservative function — 
only in proportion as it has reflected essential ethical 
growth; and so it has been constantly undergoing restate- 
ment, as the demands of the developing ethical conscious- 
ness have been enlarged. In so far as it has tended, in 
1 Generally in the state. 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  450 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
this epoch or that, to divorce itself from the ethical sense 
of the community, and to crystallize into dogmatic state- 
ment to which consent and submission were arbitrarily 
enjoined, so far has religion, or, more properly speaking, 
theology, been a limitation to be transcended —a strait- 
jacket to be thrown off. It is thus that the great reforma- 
tion movements of religious history have arisen. 
292. Finally, it should be remarked that the reduction 
of the social sanction of religion to the ethical form of 
personal sanction reverses the relation which is often 
assumed between morals and religion. The higher forms 
of religious sentiment arise by the same mental movement 
which issues in ethical sentiment also; that of the devel- 
opment of the ideal or public self-thought. Hence it is 
impossible to separate the two sanctions except in the 
way just indicated as that of early history, by which the 
religious sanction was lodged in society, whether in Church 
or State. So the question as to which has priority in 
the purely personal realm is largely a fictitious question. 
Yet inasmuch as the ethical involves positive mental con- 
struction, and reflects the actual thought of the social situ- 
ation, it must be the nerve-element in the development of 
the individual, and with him, as we shall see later on,! of 
society also. The religious sentiment is in a sense an 
added thing: not mechanically added at all, but considered 
as lying less near to the centre of personal growth, and 
as being a further outcome, in the life of emotion, of the 
process of growth. The individual could not believe in 
a good deity until he had conceived the good person and 
become aware of the obligation in his own breast impelling 
to the achievement of like good personality. Before this 
1 Chap. XIIL., § 3.
-P-A-G-E-477
  
  The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 451 
the thought of deity is without the attribute goodness, 
because the self-thought is without it. There is then a 
continuous upward progress in the religious life keeping 
pace with the progress of the ethical life. 
If the question should still be put, therefore, in the form 
in which a recent writer, already referred to, has put it, 
making his answer the keynote to his theory of social 
progress, we should be obliged to answer it in a way which 
directly antagonizes his theory. Instead of considering 
the religious sanction as the leading motive to human 
progress, and that despite the lack of support from the 
‘rational sanction’ so called, we should say that the 
religious is an outgrowth and constant index of the ethical 
sanction, that its social value is mainly on the side of its 
conservative influence, and that the ethical is the most im- 
portant as well as the most ‘rational’ of all the springs of 
human action, whether public or private. 
293. It has been said that the identification of the 
religious and ethical sanctions in the breast of the indi- 
vidual tends to emphasize the religious and give value to 
it; a further word may be in place to show that this is 
true. 
We have seen in our earlier expositions of the ‘dialectic 
of personal growth’ that the social tests to which the grow- 
ing results of personal interpretation and thought are all 
along brought, are essential to the growth of personality 
itself. A function of the ejective personalities, which 
are our social fellows, is just to afford constant confirma- 
tions, checks, touchstones, to the individual with respect 
to the value of his creations. It is through the operation 
of this intrinsic social checking, that the judgment of the 
1 Mr. Benjamin Kidd. 
 
-P-A-G-E-478
  452 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
individual upon the worth of his personal thoughts arises 
and grows to be more and more adequate. 
If this be true of the lower stages of development in 
which the concrete personalities of our environment serve 
as monitors and guides, how much the more in the higher 
reaches where the ejective personality represents the ideal, 
the good, the perfect, the Deity. The subjective move- 
ment whereby the ejective ideal of the religious life is 
constituted and given real existence and personality, is 
essential, at each stage of ethical progress, to the continued 
erection of the subjective ethical ideal itself. The religious 
consciousness is, therefore, in its integrity both a cause and 
an effect. It is the effect of the ethical construction which 
has gone before, and which is embodied in the content of 
the accepted religious beliefs. But it is cause in respect 
to the complete acceptance and loyal pursuit of the ethical 
ideal; and it is also, in so far, cause in respect to the fur- 
ther progress of the ethical construction, which involves, 
among the elements which go into its establishing, the full 
social confirmation derived through personal relation to 
the ejective personality which the religious life postulates. 
Religious faith and with it religious institutions are, 
therefore, indispensable to humanity, because they repre- 
sent normal and essential mental movements. They are 
necessary at once to ethical competence and to ethical 
progress. Yet it still remains true, as we saw immediately 
above, that in social progress they exert their influence 
indirectly, through the ethical sanction which is personal 
to the individual. 
294. So much for the philosophy of the religious sanc- 
tion. It bears directly on our present topic. It shows 
historically the possibility of a direct opposition in the
-P-A-G-E-479
  The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 453 
ethical and religious realm between society and the indi- 
vidual; and for us its main lesson is there. In our present 
stage of civilization, as was said above, it does not com- 
monly take this form; yet it sometimes does, as is seen 
in religious, ecclesiastical, and even ethical ‘boycotting,’ 
and other forms of interference with the individual’s per- 
sonal life. We are emancipated from this form of the 
opposition, so far indeed as we are, only through the bat- 
tles which individuals have fought, largely single-handed, 
with society and its institutions. 
The reality of this conflict between authority and thought 
is now to be found in our own bosoms. 
We feel the finality of the religious teaching of our 
childhood very strongly perhaps; it has all the weight of 
social heredity and the formal shape into which our social 
growth has moulded it; and if so be that through"that rest- 
lessness of thought which makes man at once the inventive 
and the social being that he is—if once through this we 
find our ethical ideal taking on another embodiment than 
that which the religious sanctions of our training have ear- 
lier given to it, then is the conflict a long and hard return, 
in our own life, to the scenes of strife which have marked 
the saddest periods of human history.? 
1] think it may be said, also, that purely ethical conflicts between society 
and the individual are largely reduced in number by the tendency of social 
morality to clothe itself in religious form, and so to get a further sanction 
from positive religious authority. The reverse is also true. The ethical re- 
former becomes the religious prophet, thus adding to his word of social and 
ethical reformation the sanction of divine revelation. 
It may not be amiss to say here, also, that this discussion brings nowhere 
into debate the possibility of an actual supernatural influence in human prog- 
ress. However that may be, the human mind works as it does. Suppose, for 
example, that the Christian Scriptures contain an actual revelation with a super- 
natural sanction, the content of the revelation would still have to undergo 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  
454 His Social Sanctions: Social Opposition 
295. We have now completed our survey of the so-called 
social sanctions. We have found that, while it is right to 
call them social sanctions, their opposition to the personal 
sanctions is largely fictitious. Indeed, we are justified in 
saying that there is no social sanction which does not — 
both in its origin and in its function — rest upon the per- 
sonal ones. Y The oppositions which may arise between 
society and the individual are, in each case, capable of 
being construed as oppositions between the sanctions 
which the individual’s own personal nature prescribes at 
different periods of his growth, or by reason of shifting 
emphasis in his mental operations. 
Of these oppositions, only two cases stand out as real 
factors in the social problem on the one side, and in the 
ethical problem on the other side. These two oppositions 
are those which represent the individual (1) 2 intellectual 
and (2) iz ethical revolt against the prescriptions of society. 
The revolt of intelligence is the motive of the theoretical 
reconstructions with which men wish to reform society or 
to instruct it, in this matter or in that. The ethical re- 
volt takes the form of protest or of attempted reconstruc- 
tion in the spheres of the ethical, religious, and generally 
sentimental usages to which society is committed. In each 
of these realms, the opposition brought out by this revolt of 
intellect or sentiment is so sharp that its meaning becomes 
the outstanding problem of social and ethical theory. It 
remains to see whether the further application of psycho- 
logical principles will throw any light upon its meaning, 
successive reinterpretations with the growth of ethical consciousness, and the 
sanction would be ineffectual and quite lacking in vitality unless made over 
into the personal life of the individual and so reinforced. The law of God 
could not be law to man until man legislated it, so to speak, to himself.
-P-A-G-E-481
      The Ethical and Religious Sanctions 455 
and upon the terms under which its ultimate solution may 
be expected. 
296. This application of psychological principles, how- 
ever, leads us to undertake a broader examination of the 
historical movement of society itself, in which the oppo- 
sitions between the individual’s intelligence and sentiment 
and the requirements of social conformity naturally show 
themselves. We may then hope to see the function of the 
very opposition itself; finding that 7¢ contributes a factor to 
the philosophy of the whole movement. In that case, we 
may finally find @ sanction for the opposition —a sanction 
of the philosophical kind. So we may now turn to the 
question: what place in social development, if any, has the 
opposition between the personal sanctions and the social 
sanctions ?

THE PERSON IN ACTION 
CHAPTER XI 
Tue Sociat Forces 
WE have now come to a point in our study at which the 
varied lines of inquiry concerning the individual may be 
drawn together, and certain indications of a general kind 
made out for the main topic which concerns us; the rela- 
tion of the individual’s thoughts and actions to those 
which society adopts. We may call it, in a sense, a syn- 
thesis of the earlier chapters, in that the positions now to 
be developed include the points of view arrived at in the 
foregoing pages. 
297. If we use the phrase ‘social forces’ to indicate the 
more broadly distinguished influences at work in society, 
when it is considered as a progressive organized whole, we 
may distinguish those influences which have their locus 
of origin 2 the individual, from those which seem to have 
their point of departure zw the social organization. The 
presence of the individual—thinking, struggling, buying, 
selling, loving, hating, quarrelling, peacemaking — indicates 
a type of activity of which we have seen many illustrations 
in the foregoing chapters. This is a constant presence, 
and it constantly serves in many respects to interrupt and 
modify the social organization and its movement. The 
459
-P-A-G-E-486
  460 The Social Forces 
genius we have found to be such an influence; and so also 
is the criminal. These are exaggerated cases. But all 
individuals have some degree of social initiative; so we 
may put the individual on one side as representing a@ type 
of social force. Then over against him we find the social 
body existing as an organization, with a set of laws, con- 
ventions, institutions, customs, etc., all its own. The 
movement which it represents we may characterize briefly 
as a movement also actuated by a social force: that in- 
herent in the existence of organized society itself. 
These two types of ‘social force,’ the more exact defi- 
nition of which is to follow, do not represent a dualism 
in the social body. All our conclusions have been in quite 
the opposite sense. No such dualism is possible in the 
philosophy of human life; if, indeed, such a philosophy be 
possible. On the contrary, the social body represents 
formulations which in some way aggregate or synthetize 
the progress made by individuals. On the other hand, 
the individuals, considered as embodying a social force, 
only give particular and variable statement to the social 
outcome, through the process of social heredity. This truth 
has become evident in the foregoing chapter, in which the 
oppositions between the individual and the social body 
have been seen to reduce themselves to two, representing 
the revolt of the individual’s intelligence and sentiment 
1 As ordinarily used the expression ‘social forces’ denotes a great con- 
geries of agencies of different orders, physical, mental, industrial, military, etc. 
I see no hope of results in this field while such use of terms prevails. The two 
‘forces’ which I speak of are both psychological; and inasmuch as only psy- 
chological functions can be intrinsic to a psychological movement, there can 
be no further social forces. The geographical environment, for example, may 
condition — limit or hinder or advance or direct — social life, but it cannot be 
a force or moment in that life; only the processes in somebody’s mind can 
be that. Cf. the topic ‘Force and Condition’ in my Dict. of Philos. See 
also § 4 of this chapter, on ‘The Socionomic Forces.’   
-P-A-G-E-487
    Distinction of Forces 461 
against the social sanctions. This being admitted, it now 
becomes our task to see whether, in this very revolt, with 
the relative and partial dualism which it seems to create, 
we may still find any constant principle binding the two 
factors together. 
§ 1. Distinction of Forces 
298. There is a further line of distinctions which comes 
up to help us; also based upon fact. It will be remembered 
that it was the average man whose individual activities 
were found to equate so snugly with the social demands 
of his environment. And the reason was found to be that 
the demands of the social environment reflect historically 
just the social activities of the average man. The law of 
the majorities in political life and the need of ‘campaigns 
of education’ to effect even the most evident social reforms, 
show that society is on the side of the average, as we 
should expect from our theoretical considerations. The 
will of the majority is not an abstraction. It is a great 
fact, both from the point of view of what society has 
already effected, and in view of what it is still to accom- 
plish. We never hear of society suddenly making up its 
mind, in a collective way, to do this or that; it is always 
individuals who work upon society through other indi- 
viduals. The result is reflected in society through the 
growth of public opinion, and in those other forms of 
social outcome in which the exertions of individuals get 
themselves recorded and made vital for collective action. 
So it is safe, at the outset, to say that the force found 
operative in the collective social body corresponds to the 
average, conservative, less original, and more suggestible 
individual activities in the community.
-P-A-G-E-488
  462 The Social Forces 
Leaving this statement in its general form, and its fur- 
ther justification to follow, we find a corresponding fact on 
the side of the force represented by the individual person 
as such. Just in so far as he is a separate social force, in 
so far is he the exceptional individual; the man who by 
his personal endowment or attainment finds himself stand- 
ing relatively alone, with the peculiar duties and satisfac- 
tions which such a position creates. If this be so, and if 
such men represent any general tendency in the social 
movement, — have any general meaning anywhere in the 
history of humanity,—then it is to them that we must 
look for the redemption of society from the conservatism 
and hard and fast solidification which would come from 
the law of the average, seen in the social outcome due to 
the activities of the majority. This again seems so evi- 
dent that we may content ourselves with this general inti- 
mation of it; and now go on to make a closer formulation 
of the two general functions which have thus been assigned 
to the two sorts of social force. 4 
299. I may first state the formulations which I shall 
maintain, and then attempt to justify them : — 
1. The individual is the particularizing social force. 
2. Society is the generalizing social force. 
300. The best way to get a broad general view of the 
activity of these social forces, in their operation together, 
is by using a biological analogy. Biological progress is, 
as is now believed, the result of two co-operating agencies, 
both of which come to view in the phenomena of heredity. 
Galton and Weismann have shown that there is a law of 
‘regression,’ called by various names, by which in the case 
of the cessation of the process of natural selection together 
with the continued free intermarriage of individuals having
-P-A-G-E-489
    Distinction of Forces 463 
all sorts of characters, — as in human society, — the further 
perfection! of any specific line of characters is rendered 
impossible. There is a tendency to the recurrence of what 
Galton has called the ‘mid-parent,’ a fictitious quantity or 
individual, who represents the average or mean between 
the two parents, in each case of offspring. When this 
state of things is continued through many generations, and 
with many pairs in each generation, there is a certain set- 
tling or establishing of values, in respect to each function 
or character, about a constant mean. In human society 
to-day this is true of our physical characteristics; since 
the artificial preservation of the unfit of all kinds —the 
diseased, halt, and weak— gives approximately a case of 
free intermarriage of all degrees of perfection and imper- 
fection. 
In animal companies, however, in which there is still 
the struggle for existence weeding out the inferior cases, 
a chance is given to another, and second factor. It is 
the principle of variations, which has already been cited 
above. Nature produces both fit and unfit, and all degrees 
of each. Reproduction, moreover, is the source of count- 
less individuals, among whom are some which would rep- 
resent a higher type, in this direction or that, if they could 
escape indiscriminate intermarriage, and with it the law of 
regression. Among the animals nature secures just this. 
The weaker and more unfit do not live to intermarry at all; 
there are no hospitals nor physicians in the animal kingdom 
to keep the diseased alive; no free dispensaries to supply 
the hungry. So the stronger which survive intermarry 
only with the stronger which survive, and a stronger race 
1 Whether or not we accept Weismann’s view that positive decay of estab- 
lished characters arises from this state of things, called by him ‘ panmixia.’
-P-A-G-E-490
464 The Social Forces 
  is the result, since the next generation tends now to a 
higher mid-parent represented by the mean between two 
representative individuals, each of whom is more excellent. 
Progress in biology, therefore, hangs upon two things: 
(1) the regression of the whole body of characters in a 
species to the mean or mid-parent value, and (2) the sur- 
vival of the best individuals. Without the regression fac- 
tor, there would be no central mass of relatively fixed 
characters representing the species as such, and establish- 
ing the mean about which the individuals might vary within 
safe limits in the given environment and conditions of life. 
Without the variation factor, on the other hand, there 
would be no individuals of unusual excellence to set higher 
up, by their intermarriage, the value of the mid-parent or 
collective mean. The assumptions, moreover, are at least 
two: physical heredity, to give regression its opportunity, 
and xatural selection, to give the variation its opportunity. 
301. In the biological sphere, therefore, we see the two 
sorts of influence at work which I have called, in the formu- 
lations above, the ‘ particularizing ’ force and the ‘ generaliz- 
ing’ force. The tendency to the mean or mid value is 
the generalizing force in biology. It is accomplished by 
physical heredity. The new values introduced by variation 
show the particularizing force. It gets its value through 
natural selection. The generalizing force, in the progress 
of a species or character, is represented by the mean or 
average values of the individuals or characters taken gen- 
erally or collectively; the particularizing force is seen at 
first only in the particular individual. 
This is not the place to go into a discussion of the rela- 
tion of social progress to biological progress, or the pos- 
sible identity of the two. Yet I do not see how, as long as
-P-A-G-E-491
   The Particularizing Social Force 465 
we have bodies, the laws of biology and of heredity should 
cease to be operative. Butit is equally plain that in human 
society certain other influences, springing from intelligent 
and social life, come to modify the outcome. We may 
simply say, therefore, that biological laws do hold all 
through human life, but that we sometimes find reason for 
saying that they are interfered with by other devices or 
laws. Taking the biological analogy, therefore, in this 
case under these limitations, we may apply it to the social 
factors as such; finding later on in the sequel that we can 
formulate a more exact estimation of it. 
§ 2. The Particularizing Social Force 
302. In the first place, the individual produces the new 
variations, the new things in social matter. As a thinker, 
he gives birth to the new thoughts by which the conven- 
tions, beliefs, opinions, institutions, of society are modified, 
if perchance they come to be modified at all. The indi- 
vidual makes the inventions which overthrow the older 
devices of labour, establish communication, commerce, and 
intercourse, and introduce new eras in all the spheres of 
human attainment. The individual feels and protests 
against the inadequate and the socially worn-out, and 
teaches other individuals so to do, thus producing the wide- 
spread revolutions of sentiment by which the slave is freed, 
woman given her social place, and all men made free and 
equal before civil law. The individual makes the moulds 
of legislation into which the soft materials of popular re- 
form are finally cast. The individual rises to the emergency 
when the social tide of suggestion and the waves of passion 
are about to break in popular frenzy, and leads society

into a place of broader outlook and quiet content in its 
social heritage. All this the individual does, and by so 
doing he fills a place in social progress which is vital to 
its life and indispensable to its growth. 
By calling the individual considered as performing this 
function the ‘ particularizing’ force, however, certain more 
exact things are meant; for there is a difference between 
pointing out that he does these things, and giving valid 
reasons for his doing them. 
303. First, the individual particularizes on the basis of 
the generalizations which society has already effected. The 
individual is a variation just because there is a mean 
from which to vary. If he varies too far from this 
mean, he must perish; so sometimes the genius, and 
so oftener the badly defective. So with his thoughts; 
his attainments, as well as his endowment, cannot be 
out of connection with those of other men. We have 
already seen that he must learn the lessons of society 
first, and produce his inventions afterwards. Further, 
he must judge his own thoughts, feelings, reforms, first 
by the judgment which is itself amenable to the law of 
the mean, before he can bring them out for the instruc- 
tion or for the revolution of society. His very good 
sense of the value of his thought-variations is itself a 
variation, and must not be too great a one, from a mean 
of social judgment. In short, he must use old materials; 
he must appeal to current judgments; he must particu- 
larize a new form or degree of the old. He does not 
create; he particularizes, with reference to the social 
material which is already present to his hand. 
Every individual who is not in all respects the veriest 
reproduction of the mean does this in some degree. He    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-493
    The Particularizing Social Force 467 
must perforce think his thoughts in his own way, no 
matter how commonplace a way it may be. His special 
particularization may, from its very dulness and sodden- 
ness, represent a backward tendency. He may be a 
victim to prejudice, to a narrow set of social influences, 
to a bad education, and so do his particularizing from 
the platform of a false social generalization; just as, 
on the other hand, he may be caught for the time in 
an eddy or cross-current of sentiment and suggestion, 
and so particularize at a tangent to his own normal 
social curve. In short, all sorts of variations may occur, 
as we have abundantly seen in considering the sanctions 
under which the individual’s current actions are performed. 
But with it all, there he stands, the one particularizing 
agency; the hope of social progress; the only avenue 
through which the social temper may flow and still 
emerge in forms new and particular, for the weal or 
woe of the community in which he lives, and possibly 
of the. world. 
304. Second, the individual particularizes with refer- 
ence to his own mental store. This also we have seen 
in considering the genius; but it is true of all men. 
Each individual must take out certain of his thoughts 
as particular secrets, special treasures, gems of his col- 
lection; cling to them and forget the rest. And inas- 
much as each individual is also social, this choice of 
his must, to a degree, come to affect the particularizing 
which he does of the current social material, and also 
that done by others, just as we have seen that the 
social judgment, by a reverse relation, affects his private 
selection. _ His private preferences make him more open 
to this social suggestion than to that, since it assimi-
-P-A-G-E-494
468 The Social Forces 
  lates one and fails to assimilate the other. This appears 
again most conspicuously in the genius. His own true 
thoughts become a sort of social measuring-rod, a net 
of a given size and shape, in which the details of the 
social life in general take on special form. He effects 
a constant give-and-take between his own and society’s 
thoughts, and so gets a richer particularization on the 
basis of them all. 
Then, as the individual particularizes, so he acts; 
thus getting the various forms of personal sanction which 
arouse him. Thus his actions become at once of social 
value. They contribute to the mass of social ‘copy,’ on 
which the run of men react; and his example domi- 
nates the Gesammtproduct of the circle in which he 
moves. Taken alone, he may be of course of little mo- 
ment; and in speaking of the individual who is com- 
monplace enough not to have much individual value, 
we are speaking just of the great mass of persons in 
society ; but when we consider all of them together, here 
is just the most important progressive factor in every- 
day social life. It is the commonplace men who lead 
to the good or to the bad—ahead or astray —the com- 
monplace men. Indeed, the man of greatest personal 
influence has very often to make himself commonplace 
in order to wield the influence actually due to his thought 
or character. This is, therefore, the most general and, 
on the whole, — apart from the world-moving crises when 
the great men play their part, —the most important sort 
of particularizing done by the individual: the settling 
with himself of the value of his own thoughts, and with 
them of the actions proper to embrace and impose upon 
his fellows.
-P-A-G-E-495
    The Particularizing Social Force 469 
305. Third, and more objectively, he particularizes for 
the future and for society. It is here that the biological 
analogy becomes most helpful. We saw that the simple 
presence of variations does not suffice for progress; for 
variations are in all directions. So the individual par- 
ticularizes thoughts good and bad. In the high ethical 
sphere his conduct sometimes gets particularized in ways 
which his own ethical sanction — which is nearest to the 
voice of society — does not ratify. So, if there are varia- 
tions both in the products of the individual’s mind and 
also in the sorts of minds possessed by different indi- 
viduals, then biology shows the result. We should 
expect an evening-up in endowment from generation to 
generation, and a regression to a set and average social 
life. Not only should the physical and intellectual capaci- 
ties of mankind remain about stationary, but a certain con- 
servative conventionalism should characterize the social 
life. In biology we find, however, that only the fittest 
variations come to fruition in posterity by the law of sur- 
vival with the ruthless ‘struggle for existence.’ So the 
mean is raised and the species makes progress, except in 
the case of man, where the effect of indiscriminate inter- 
marriage and the prevalence of ‘artificial selection’ do 
seem to realize the stationary result which we should 
expect.! 
Indeed, as regards physical and mental capacities, we 
find that the law of ‘survival of the fittest’ does not apply 
as among the animals, because in many spheres the com- 
1 This is a much-debated point — whether the level of intellectual capacity 
has grown higher with higher culture. It is not our problem now, —real 
social progress being in question, —so we need not reach an argued conclu- 
sion; but there seems to be little or no evidence that it has.
-P-A-G-E-496
  470 The Social Forces 
petition of organisms is greatly reduced through certain 
methods of intelligent and social preservation of the infe- 
rior members. In human life we keep ‘the inferior bodies 
alive and also let them marry; and we also keep the lower 
intelligences alive and active. The only people against 
whom society wages war, and against whom she must 
wage war in order to her own life, are the anti-social, 
represented most prominently in the criminal class. 
We should expect, therefore, since the safeguard of 
progress in the biological world—the law of survival of 
the fittest, with its negative application to the unfit —is 
removed, to find the sort of regression that comes on in the 
biological world when this principle ceases its operation. 
Yet this is not the case in the social life. As a fact, 
society is making what we call progress—the sort of prog- 
ress represented by civilization, material comfort, ethical 
sensitiveness, culture, etc. —all the while! We are forced 
to conclude, therefore, that this sort of progress is not 
dependent on any law which can get statement in anal- 
ogy with the law of survival of the fittest. And, as the 
facts show, the reason is to be found just in this process 
of the particularizing of material by the individual, taken 
in connection with the corresponding fact of social propa- 
gation or ‘ generalization,’ yet to be spoken of. 
The particularizing by the individual supplies the es- 
sential material of all human and social progress. This 
takes the place of the law of variations in the organic 
sphere. It means that individuals may, from the nature 
of the special particularizations which they make in

XIII. For distinction of various forms of struggle, competition, etc., see the 
Dict. of Philos., articles ‘ Rivalry’ and ‘ Existence (struggle for), also Develop- 
ment and Evolution, Chap. XV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-497
    The Particularizing Social Force 471 
thought, feeling, or action, have influence out of all pro- 
portion to their number and social status. It is of the 
essence of a true thought to live, although, at first, its 
point of origin be a single human head. It gets itself 
spread by social suggestion, education, imitation, etc., and 
then gets itself handed down by social heredity to sub- 
sequent generations. The individual may thus become, 
perhaps in his life, perhaps even before he himself real- 
izes it, the centre of a great social movement. His inven- 
tion may revolutionize industry; his discovery may add 
to the resources of commerce; his verse or scientific 
writing may set the aspiration of a nation, or mark an era 
in the knowledge of mankind. 
306. Not only is this the great difference between 
social and biological progress; the reason of it is also 
not far to seek. The limitation set in biology to the 
influence which an individual may work on his species 
is the necessary limitation set by physical heredity. This 
we saw to be a necessary assumption to the law of regres- 
sion. The individual cannot make the next generation; 
he can only make one-half of a single family in the next 
generation. And even that family is subject to the law 
of variations. If the genius has only one son, that son 
may be an idiot, and is likely to be little better than the 
average man. Further, the mate which the genius chooses 
is equally responsible with himself for the next genera- 
tion, and he does not always exercise the highest judg- 
ment of genius in choosing his mate! All these things, 
which might be carried out in many points of interesting 
detail, show the reason of the necessary limitation of the 
individual’s influence in biology. The ‘sport,’ however 
valuable he may be, even to the point of supreme adapta-
-P-A-G-E-498

tion, is always in biology a caprice, never a permanent 
possession. He is of no more value, from the purely 
biological point of view, than any other individual what- 
ever; for he is averaged up with all the others in the long 
run, and the special strain which his gifts represent is 
finally measured by that and not by him. 
But it is of the essence of the sort of organization 
which intelligent and reflective social co-operation have 
ushered in, that 2 danishes once for all this paralyzing 
limitation, due to physical heredity. The genius as a 
biological specimen has, of course, to submit to it, and to 
impose it upon those who follow him; but the thought of 
the genius does not have to, nor do the institutions and 
enactments in which his thought and sentiment take social 
form. The genius himself has to be made over each 
time we want him, and the making of him a second time 
is the problem which no man can solve. But his thought 
and sentiment are made once for all. His thought rings 
down the ages in human ears when his natural sons have 
gone back to their dust, and when a hundred generations 
have exercised themselves to develop the lines of his mag- 
nificent achievement. Who can trace the line of physical 
heredity from Aristotle to us? And what its value if we 
could?. But who cannot trace the strain in our social 
heredity which comes from him? And so I say that this 
is the great essential thing about social truth, as opposed 
to biological fact: zt leaps the bounds of physical heredity. 
We saw that ‘social heredity’ is substituted for it. 
First, man had to become intelligent—in the widest 
sense of that term—in order to think and to subdue 
nature; and ethical, in order not to kill off, but to utilize, 
the thinker. With these two requisites, together with
-P-A-G-E-499
   The Particularizing Social Force 473 
the forms of sanction to which they give rise, and 
with the institutions in which all these things have been 
embodied, he becomes the lord of nature that he is —and 
of himself. But the first conquest of nature that man had 
to make, in order to start his history in the line which we 
call social, was the conquest over the limitations of physi- 
cal heredity. His first revolt and the one in which all 
his subsequent protests were included —was his revolt 
against this biological law.1 
307. It is hardly necessary to say again that this is 
true not only of the man of great power, but also of all 
men, and of many animals which have considerable social 
tradition as well as social instincts. This form of revolt 
has become instinctive, itself fixed by the law of varia- 
tions first, and by the law of social heredity afterwards. 
The social man is the most natural man; the social insti- 
tutions are the avenues of his most normal life. So every 
man of us is thinking, feeling, acting, — particularizing, — 
for all time. We are acting up to our capacity to make 
the social heritage of our descendants; and the great 
man, the statesman, the poet, the scientific genius, does 
no more. His influence, indeed, is what it is only as we 
1 The question often asked whether the other assumption which biological 
evolution makes — the assumption of a struggle for existence with the survival 
of the fittest —does not hold of ideas as such; i.e., of the particularizations 
made by individuals, has already been answered (Chap. V.,§ 4). We saw that 
the use of such an analogy for the construction of a social theory analogous to 
the biological theory, is not legitimate, seeing that the correlative principle, 
that of physical heredity, which is necessary in biology to the operation of the 
struggle with survival, does not hold. Ideas are propagated socially by the 
imitative ‘ generalization’ described next below (§ 3). The failure to recog- 
nize that the two principles mzst go together in biology, and that at least 
one of them fails in social evolution, is responsible for much of the loose em- 
ployment of the biological analogy in the literature of sociology. On various 
sorts of selection, see Sect. 40, note, Sect. 120 f., and Appendix B, of 1st and 
2d eds. (now incorporated in Development and Evolution, Chap. XIL., § 2).
-P-A-G-E-500
  474 The Social Forces 
common men maintain the level from which he acts. He 
must have us, as we hope to have him. And besides this 
reciprocal influence between him and us, we are, besides, 
ourselves acting the genius, the hero, the great lawgiver, 
to our children, our pupils, our comrades, who are less 
privileged or less gifted than we are. 
308. Fourth, this particularizing tendency explains the 
oppositions between the personal and the social sanctions. 
The general fact of social organization involves two great 
tendencies, represented in the individual by the sanctions 
called intelligent and ethical. The intelligent sanction 
very quickly runs, as we have seen in the child,—and 
in very glaring social examples, such as the professional 
criminal, — to an extreme, giving results which are unsocial 
or anti-social. But we saw that the very growth of the 
intelligence in the way of general knowledge, with its 
sentiments of social, ethical, and religious value, gives rise 
to a new set of sanctions. And it is with these latter, 
especially, that the social sanctions as such (as voiced by 
the community and its institutions) are identified. So 
there arises the conflict among the man’s own sanctions, 
which shows itself as an intellectual revolt of the indi- 
vidual against society. It simply means that his particu- 
larizations cannot be assimilated to the generalizations 
which society has made; and either he must be sup- 
pressed, or society must be in so far reformed in those 
respects which his thought represents. The cases cited 
of the development of extravagant intelligent claims, as 
against the prevalent judgment of the community, — the 
case of the criminal, and often of the child, — illustrate 
particularizations in respect of a certain sort of thinking 
more or less free from ethical restraint.
-P-A-G-E-501
The Generalizing Force 475 
Moreover, there is the variation on the other side — 
individuals who, from conscientious scruples, will not 
obey law; or who rebel against the ethical standards of 
the community in favour possibly of a higher and purer 
morality than that which society has yet attained. These 
conflicts, so far from being a sign of disorder and a retreat 
of dualism in social theory, are really incidents in that 
larger interplay of forces which constitutes social progress. 
No psychologist needs to be told that the particular is a par- 
ticular only by reason of its partial conflict with the gen- 
eral; and the more the conflict, while yet it is a particular 
and not a disparate case, the greater its value from the 
point of view no less of the possibilities of the general, 
than from that of the realities of single fact. This fact 
of conflict will be considered, however, a little more in 
detail when we have looked closely at the second of our 
social forces, —the generalization made by society itself. 
§ 3. The Generalizing Force 
309. Coming to the exposition of the so-called force 
which society represents as over against the individual, 
the caution against falling into a dualism of view is per- 
haps unnecessary ; the development in the preceding chap- 
ter is against it. The only dualism which is in any way 
justified is the dualism of fact seen in the opposition of 
sanctions now indicated; and that, we are going on to 
see, is only an incident of a more profound unity pervad- 
ing the entire social movement. The tendencies seen 
in the outcome of social evolution, as embodied in institu- 
tions, are, however, in such contrast with the achieve- 
ments of the particular individuals, that further remarks 
   
-P-A-G-E-502
  476 The Social Forces 
may first be made upon the contrast. Bearing in mind 
the characteristics of what has been called the ‘particu- 
larizing’ function of the individual, certain truths come 
into view on the side of society. These are covered by 
the phrase ‘ generalization.’ 
310. First, society generalizes what the individual has 
already particularized. This is simply to say that society 
is not an original thinker, feeler, or doer. It would be 
going too far, as is so often done, to say that society is 
only an aggregate of individuals, and so can originate 
nothing; for, as we have seen, the bloodiest scenes of 
history, to say nothing of less exceptional things, have 
been the immediate work of certain social wholes; work 
for which no individual in the group would have found 
sanction, if he had acted alone. The works of the writers 
on collective psychology in recent years have made this 
plain. The social agent is not the aggregate of the 
individuals in the group. 
But it is true, nevertheless, that the thought on which 
the whole group acts is present in the minds of the indi- 
viduals, as far as it is thought at all; and it is generally 
true, also, that the crowd does not think thoughts nor do 
deeds which the individuals might not have done when 
acting under the influence of strong suggestion, had the 
suggestion been otherwise administered. There are really 
several cases of this relation between the individual’s 
thoughts and society’s; but I can only dwell upon the 
one general case which is normal and of special interest 
to us now seeing that it includes all the rest. 
The things which are taken up by society and incorpo- 
rated in permanent form, as its acquisitions, are usually 
the outcome of the severest thinking of the ablest indi-
-P-A-G-E-503
    The Generalizing Force 477 
viduals. In all the spheres of human activity and know- 
ledge, new ideas come from those most capable, through 
endowment and education in the normal resources which 
society already offers, of making real advances in the 
understanding of nature, in the application of their know- 
ledge in useful ways, and in the achievement of the highest 
and most ideal forms of poetic, artistic, and sentimental 
insight. These are society’s normal teachers. 
What society then does is to generalize the particular 
thought or value. A new scheme of legislation —let us 
say of taxation—is thought out by one man. It must 
be made a general thought in the group of fellow-citizens 
or fellow-legislators. This is one form of generalization 
of the thought. It does not retain just the form in each 
mind that it originally had. The essence of the thought 
is its general, workable part. Then, in order that it may 
be made effective for the good of society, only what is 
thus found general is actually carried out. So the form 
in which such a thought is realized in law —or, in other 
cases, in institution, ceremony, or custom —is seldom just 
that which the originator conceived. The idea or essen- 
tial contrivance remains the same; but it is given a form 
which fits it to the thought of many thinkers and to the 
practical needs which they bring to it. 
Then, after such a first generalization, new particulari- 
zations follow in the minds of other able men; as note 
the ‘improvements’ through which each practical inven- 
tion goes, after its first clumsy embodiment in a machine. 
Of course, different inventions, and different thoughts 
of all kinds, differ greatly, both in their nature and in 
their social fate; and I do not mean to say that the 
thought of each thinker necessarily undergoes improve-
-P-A-G-E-504
  478 The Social Forces 
ment before it will work socially. But what seems to 
be true is that, when looked at from the side of the final 
institution which is established in consequence of the 
thought of a great thinker, the thought is such that the 
average man can take it in, cling to it, and act on it. 
In political life principles have to be put concretely and 
with many illustrations, in order to get convincing force 
with the voters. Social measures which present least 
complication and the widest generality of application 
have most chance of adoption. The art work which 
strikes some general sentiment, or has so general a mean- 
ing that the average man may understand and feel its 
beauty, has most popular appreciation. All this seems 
to show that the pinnacle of singularity on which the 
original thinker stands cannot be scaled by the members 
of the community to which his thought appeals. But, on 
the contrary, his thought has to be assimilated to the 
great stock of established truths which society already 
understands and values. The result is that the new 
thought is ‘pared’ down, so to speak; its boldest and 
most novel outlines are obscured; and its form of final 
embodiment is that general form in which it can be most 
widely appreciated and applied. 
311. Second, it is also to be noted that it is only as 
this generalizing process is adequately done that she 
permanence of the new elements in the social life: is 
secured; for the matters of new sanction secured by 
the thought and struggle of one generation have to’be 
assimilated by the next; have to come under the peda- 
gogical sanction enforced upon the sons and daughters. 
And only the general conceptions which underlie institu- 
tions can thus be made matter of pedagogical sanction.
-P-A-G-E-505
    The Generalizing Force 479 
The singularities of thought, the particularities as such, 
which belong to a single thinker, and even those which 
such a thinker may succeed in imposing on his own gen- 
eration, cannot live on in succeeding generations if these 
succeeding generations are to exercise the same preroga- 
tives of thought. The later generations can only build on 
those general principles or ideas which the earlier thought 
out and wrought into the structure of the social fabric. 
Illustrations of this are plentiful. For example, the 
growth of the democratic idea in modern times shows all 
the vicissitudes to be expected from the varying degrees 
of thoroughness with which this people or that have done 
their generalizing. In France the attempt was made to 
apply at once, in all its naked particularity, the demo- 
cratic philosophy of one man and one school of academic 
thinkers. The result showed the absolute impossibility of 
building all at once a new social fabric whose foundation 
should be the thought of ‘freedom, equality, and fraternity’ ; 
a thought having little connection with the earlier devel- 
opment of French national life. Both the difficulties which 
are pointed out above appeared, and each was insurmount- 
able. First, there was no adequate framework, in law or 
social convention, for the new idea; no precedents, no safe- 
guards, no standards to which to appeal. In this state of 
things, the particularity of the thought saves it only so 
long as it is not in the ascendant, or so long as no new 
particularity of a new thinker comes to make a stronger 
social appeal to the suggestiveness of the people. And, 
second, the other defect appeared most glaringly, —the 
lack of adequate pedagogical sanctions for the new gen- 
erations of democratic France. One-man institutions can- 
not live, simply because one man cannot secure the suc-
-P-A-G-E-506
  480 The Social Forces 
cession of his thought, as he can that of his family. In all 
the vicissitudes of republican life in France, we see a nation 
seeking here and there for something to teach its sons. 
To this, the growth of the democratic idea in England 
presents the most instructive contrast. Successive ad- 
vances in the idea of popular constitutional government 
have been successfully realized, just by the process of 
social generalization of which we are speaking. Piece by 
piece, the stones from the quarry of republican govern- 
ment and manhood suffrage have been set into the fabric 
of monarchy; but in so apt and gradual a way that the 
whole stands a monument at once to the great thoughts 
of great men—as great as Rousseau and Voltaire 
to genuine social progress. 
       
      
   
      
    cost of dear-bought experience of revolution, anarchy, and 
misrule ; England has attained the same, but by growth. 
In art also, and even in mechanical invention, the same 
is seen. A school of painting is dominated by the style

which may be made the matter of pedagogical di 
from generation to generation. Here, as elsewhere, the 
purely particular is the eccentric and the temporary; and 
although advance is at first through some one thinker’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-507
    The Generalizing Force 481 
particularization, still only that part of his particulariza- 
tion which may be generalized becomes the real gain of 
society and of the world. 
312. Third, the real progress of society is measured, 
not by the individual’s particularizations directly, but by 
society’s generalizations. Here, again, the analogy drawn 
from biology may help us. The real measure of a species’ 
attainment is the position of the species as such in the 
scale of life, in respect to this character or that. The 
individual is judged with reference to his degree of con- 
formity to the average attainment of the species. If he 
be too great a departure from the type, he is a ‘sport’; 
and this, because he is less likely to perpetuate his en- 
dowment, by reason of the general tendency of physical 
heredity to regress to the mean. Now we have seen, it 
is true, that social progress is not under the limitation of 
physical heredity in this respect; but yet it is true also 
that the form of heredity under which it does proceed — 
social heredity, the handing down through pedagogical 
agencies, etc. —has a limitation analogous to this in its 
own sphere.!_ For just as a physical variation which is too 
far from the mean tends to be swamped in the retrograde 
outcome of heredity, so the thought which is too wide 
a departure from tradition, custom, convention, fails of 
assimilation in the popular mind, and so gets swamped 
despite its value. The great thinkers are themselves a 
better measure of the possibilities of a given social group 
than are the particular thoughts which this or that one of 
them may think. For given the thinkers, there is always 
the chance of thoughts: they cannot help thinking. But 
1 Yet it is only analogous. The real process is akin to mental ‘ generali- 
zation,’
-P-A-G-E-508
  482 The Social Forces 
given a thought, its final failure is its death. Interesting 
questions, in this connection, to be answered possibly by 
statistics, are: How many really great men does this or 
that nation or community produce in each generation? 
and is there any connection between the number of the 
great men and the advance in the general level of culture 
which we call social progress? Both are very complicated 
questions, and capable only of relative solution, from the 
ambiguity of the phrase ‘really great.’ 
The point of interest now is this: that an idea or thought 
—a particularization of one mind — may fail of the neces- 
sary generalization on the social side. It frequently so 
happens. This means that there is a limit in the matter 
of the perpetuation of a social influence through social 
heredity, as there is also the limit mentioned in natural 
heredity. Too original a thought is a social ‘sport.’ It 
is often still-born. So the test of the real elements of 
national or social life is to be found on the side of its gen- 
eralizations, —its established institutions, its customs, its 
creeds, its conventions, — and not on the side of the special 
monuments to the geniuses which it has produced. It is 
quite a mistake, for example, to reconstruct Greek national 
life from Greek heroic poetry; or to take the ‘Thoughts’ 
of Epictetus or Pascal as a measure of the moral intui- 
tions of the Romans or French. As was said above, 
the Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, was ideal enough as a 
motto for democracy for all time; but the events imme- 
diately succeeding the triumph of its enthusiasts did not 
reflect the ideality of life which one should expect from its 
realization. And does the world generalize this motto yet 
anywhere ?—as much as our individual pulses are stirred 
when we hear it pronounced !
-P-A-G-E-509
    The Generalizing Force 483 
313. Fourth, te advance on the social side, thus tested 
and measured, must result in a constant suppression of the 
individual's sanctions, as far as they remain in conflict with 
those of society. If the individual’s thoughts, sentiments, 
protests, recommendations,—having his own personal 
sanction, —fail of the sort of social generalization which 
we see to be necessary to their perpetuity, then, zso facto, 
they are not fruitful, and they go on to be eliminated. 
They are not factors of worth in the body social, however 
they may recur in individuals and seek a social outlet. 
This suppression of thought arises even when the indi- 
viduals themselves are not suppressed. We boycott books, 
refute ‘silver fallacies,’ suppress popular illusions by ‘cam- 
paigns of education.’ The general drift of social evolution 
is from the past, and has been set by the prevailing 
contributions of innumerable thinkers, all assimilated or 
generalized in a great body of accepted truth and tradi- 
tion. A new idea may modify it very essentially, as we 
saw; and this is the measure of the greatness of an idea, 
the extent to which it does modify tradition. But by so 
doing, by being thus generalized and made of social 
value, such an idea secures the social sanction and so 
ceases to derive its influence over the individuals of the 
social group solely through the personal presence or 
authority of the single thinker. He may die, but his 
thought lives in the institutions which all men possess. 
So the sanction passes from the personal to the social 
sphere; and then, by the education of the children, it 
passes again from the social to the personal sphere. 
All other thoughts or courses of action which the indi- 
vidual originates lapse and are lost. 
It is true, of course, that the social rise of an idea may
-P-A-G-E-510
  484 The Social Forces 
be very gradual; it may have its ebb and flow; its sup- 
porters may increase and decrease; and yet it may finally 
prevail, and secure social confirmation. Indeed, this is the 
history of most social reforms and of many institutions. 
Yet this does not affect the general truth that the indi- 
vidual is the waning factor, and the social the waxing 
factor, all the way through. The idea rises and gets a 
social chance, just in proportion as it takes on the gener- 
alized form which makes it socially available. All manner 
of vicissitudes may mark its passage from the purely per- 
sonal to the accomplished social form. But when it does 
get social embodiment, then it is permanent and effective 
in human life, not because this or that individual gives it 
his private sanction, but because it is the property of the 
community as such. 
The thought of this section gets its main interest from 
the fact that from it inferences may be drawn regarding 
the direction of social progress. These inferences are 
brought forward in the discussions of the concluding 
chapters. 
§ 4. The Socionomic Forces 
313.a. While considering as we have the two intra-social 
or psychological forces, which we have now discussed as 
the only truly social forces, we should not overlook the 
very important group of influences which condition social 
life and progress. Their consideration really belongs 
to socionomics'—the science of the relation of social 
life to its environment, including other social groups. 
1 This term is suggested (cf. my Dict. of Philos.), after analogy with the 
biologist’s term ‘bionomics’ (and bionomic relations); used for the science 
of the relation of organisms to their environment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
    The Soctonomic Forces 485 
These forces of an extra-social kind are conditions, but 
not social forces in the strict sense. They are really, so 
to speak, the banks or barriers which set limits to the 
social current, and even, by interaction with the strictly 
social forces, leave their marks within the social body. 
Their relation to the social forces, properly so called, is 
similar to that which the psychologists recognize between 
the strictly psychological and the physiological. The vari- 
ous states of the body, such as intoxication, fatigue, starva- 
tion and over-nourishment, affect the mind, and so influence 
the individual's mental development; but we do not call 
these mental or psychic forces. They are of psychologi- 
cal value only because, through the sorts of stimulation and 
limitation which they afford, they condition certain uni- 
form results in the psychological organization itself. The 
analogy thus cited— between the extra-social influences 
with the effects they bring about in the social whole, and 
the extra-mental or physiological influences with their 
influence upon the individual’s mental life—is indeed 
more than an analogy. When we reflect, we find that it 
is through the connection of mind and body —one term 
of the analogy —that the extra-social forces —the other 
term of the analogy — get their value. It becomes there- 
fore still more apparent that we cannot call the influences 
enumerated below social forces; for so far are they from 
showing direct value in the organization of society, that 
they become factors in that organization only by the indi- 
rect road of stimulation to the nervous system of individu- 
als. It would be just as appropriate to call blood-changes 
psychological facts, as to call physical changes, such as 
the cutting of the Suez Canal, social facts; yet both un- 
doubtedly deserve recognition in a philosophical statement
-P-A-G-E-512
486 The Social Forces 
of all the determining conditions, in these two branches of 
knowledge. 
The sort of conditions which I mean by the phrases 
‘extra-social’ and ‘socionomic’ will appear from the enu- 
meration below. It does not claim to be complete, how- 
ever. Their full discussion does not come within our 
province for the reasons given in § 2 of the ‘Introduction’ 
(in the 3d and later editions). 
1. Group-Selection (described above, Sect. 120).—In 
group-selection we have a condition of very great impor- 
tance in the development of social aggregations, especially 
in the instinctive and spontaneous periods; that is, of what 
I call ‘companies.’ It holds, however, for all societies 
when the conditions are such that groups as groups come 
into competition. Not only real war, but commercial and 
social wars of all kinds, illustrate Group-Selection. The 
working of the principle is strictly analogous, indeed iden- 
tical, with that of Natural Selection in biology, an analogy 
excellently worked out by Bagehot in his remarkable work, 
Physics and Politics. It is one of the foundation stones 
also of S. Alexander’s work, Moral Order and Progress. 
Bagehot acutely recognizes the distinction, without ex- 
plicitly drawing it, between group-selection as a condition 
of evolution in the earliest stages of human aggregation, 
and the operation of the real social force of ‘discussion’ 
(described above, under the heading ‘ Generalization’) in 
the higher forms. It is, moreover, an additional proof that 
group-selection is a condition, and not a social force, that 
there is this difference between the lower and the higher; 
1So much is said, however, to increase the usefulness of the book for 
sociological readers as well as to illustrate the true sphere of social psy- 
chology. 
   
-P-A-G-E-513
     The Soctonomic Forces 487 
for the lower are determined, as we have seen, very largely 
by biological principles, such as instinct and physical 
heredity, and do not involve the social progress which the 
operation of the psychological forces brings in later on. 
Yet it is just there that group-selection is all-important. 
Most of those who hold to a natural selection view of 
the origin and progress of society fall into confusion by 
disregarding the distinction between group-competition 
with selection, on the one hand, and the internal progress 
of a society, on the other hand :1 the distinction between 
‘monotypic’ and ‘polytypic’ evolution. Group-selection 
accounts for the survival of group-types. It is, however, 
by internal psychological processes, for the most part, that- 
the social organization within the group arises and makes 
progress. Natural or individual selection (see the next 
heading) may enter even here, it is true, but in a very sub- 
ordinate way. 
2. Individual Selection, which is natural selection work- 
ing upon individuals who are brought into competition for 
life and death with one another. For instance, let us sup- 
pose that a man of genius who has not yet given to the 
world his invention — the machine which, if produced by 
him, would have great influence upon the condition of the 
working classes—that this man meets a burglar in his 
library and is shot dead. Here is a case of elimination 
which determines, by hindering, the course of social evolu- 
tion in a nation or in the world by the destruction of an 
individual. Such a case shows that the natural selection 
of individuals is a condition of importance—when the 
individuals are important—in social development. But 
1 Even so careful a thinker as Professor Karl Pearson falls into this pit 
(Grammar of Science, second edition, pp. 358-361). 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
  488 The Social Forces 
natural selection is not a force even in biology.!. Itisa 
negative condition; a statement—#in sociology as in bi- 
ology — of evolution as it is, rather than as it would have 
been if the conditions had been other. This, again, is of 
especial importance in those stages of sociality in which 
the direct competition of individuals by physical strength 
or mental acuteness is in full operation ; but it is rendered 
inoperative in other and most essential cases by the fact 
that the characters selected are not preserved by selective 
marriage: as said above, the resource of physical heredity 
—a necessary link in evolution by natural selection —is 
here unavailable. 
3. The Intrusion of the ‘Physiological Cycle. —In an 
earlier place (Sect. 43) we saw that the ‘cycle of causa- 
tion’ which psychological and sociological facts, such as 
beliefs, desires, etc., represent, often intrudes upon the 
operation of the ‘physiological cycle’ through the exer- 
cise of personal selection of individuals in marriage. The 
physical heredity of the individuals is due to the mixed 
strains of the parents, and hence is in part determined by 
their mutual choice of each other. The converse is also 
true: the physiological intrudes upon the sociological, and 
thus becomes an ‘extra-social condition’ or socionomic 
force, in its determination. This is seen in all cases in 
which physical heredity works results in individuals or 
1 It has often been pointed out (see Cope, Primary Factors of Evolution. 
Chap. VII.; Baldwin, Psych. Rev., IV., 1897, p. 219) that natural selection 
in biological evolution is not a force or cause, but a condition, Spencer’s 
phrase ‘survival of the fittest,’ itself analyzes natural selection. The fitness 
is assumed ; it arises through variation ; the survival or selection which 
‘natural selection’ formulates is an ex fost facto statement of results. It 
merely states that no further force of a positive sort is necessary (as against, 
eg. ‘special creation’),
-P-A-G-E-515
  The Socionomic Forces 489 
groups which incapacitate them, highly endow them, or 
modify in any way their social fitness. A tall manly race 
of men would have social advantages in winning wives 
from a higher group, and such marriages would tell at 
once inside their own group. Where social preferment 
depended upon physical prowess, the inherited club-foot 
would be an element of social unfitness. In the fact of 
what is called physical ‘ presence,’ probably largely a mat- 
ter of posture and vitality, we all recognize an easy substi- 
tute in many social positions for brains, culture, or ora- 
torical gifts. Yet these things are not in themselves 
social; nor can they by any manipulation become social. 
The influence they have is entirely through the psycho- 
logical states of which they are the conditions, or which 
they determine in others. A man with the illusion of a 
club-foot would be about as helpless as if it were real. 
And where is the hero so commonplace that his ‘pres- 
ence’ is not lordly to some love-sick maid? 
4. Then there are the much-talked-of Physical Condi- 
tions, ‘the broken earth and the vaulted sky,’ the canal 
and the river-course, the mountain and the meadow. 
These, we are told, determine social evolution. They 
do; but by conditioning it, by intrusion upon it, by limit- 
ing it, not by being themselves social. That they are 
never. Let a race of animals that cannot think, nor 
recognize a social situation, nor know one another as 
reciprocating and fulfilling social give-and-take, run over 
the meadows and swim in the rivers, under a sky never so 
blue — and what effect of a social kind would these phys- 
ical things have upon them? But once give them the 
psychological traits, make them men—and then what 
would not the human race do even on the levelest plain?
-P-A-G-E-516
  490 The Social Forces 
Here again we have extra-social conditions. The land 
and water condition, separation and segregation, competi- 
tion and mutual defence, toleration and alliance, commerce 
and confederation ; but the essentials of social matter and 
process must be present, and it is they that work under 
these conditions or those. Again, an illustration from recent 
biological theory, a case which often turns upon the effects 
of such physical differences :—the facts of Isolation have 
been said to represent a biological force, since, when ani- 
mals are isolated from each other, the race is prevented 
from having the in-mixture of their hereditary strains, so 
the heredity of the race is pre-limited, and divergent types 
arise. True, as a fact; but why make an abstraction do 
justice for a force? Isolation is always accomplished by 
some real force —say a whirlwind which blows away the 
isolated individuals, — but the biological forces are the life 
processes in those which are left. The whirlwind is the 
condition by which the result has been in a measure nega- 
tively determined; but who would say that the whirlwind 
is a biological force? At the most it is an intrusion of 
physics into the biological cycle. Just so with all the 
physical changes considered as influencing social life and 
development: they are conditions, intrusions from physics ; 
not social forces. 
The consideration of these extra-social conditions con- 
firms us therefore in our view that only psychological 
sources of change can be called ‘social forces.’1 Other 
1 A force, in physics, is that which produces a change of rest or motion ; 
and the sorts of forces are those producers of change which manifest them- 
selves under different but constant physical conditions. We speak of mental, 
social, etc., forces in the analogous case of change in phenomena of one of 
these several orders ; and to give the term any intelligible meaning we must 
keep within the particular order of phenomena as strictly as does the physicist

such conditions might be pointed out, but the examination 
of them would lead to the same conclusion. 
in defining his forces always in terms of motion in space which determines 
other motion in space. In other words, the force is intrinsic or internal to the 
movement in which it is said to be exercised. On the use of the distinction 
between the ‘socionomic’ and the ‘social’ to answer certain criticisms, see

SOCIAL ORGANIZATION 
CHAPTER XII 
SoctaL MATTER AND Process?!: I. SocraL MATTER 
Tue object of this chapter is to present in outline a way 
of conceiving of the general fact of human social organiza- 
tion, based upon the foregoing, and in line with the ten- 
dency which has proved itself fruitful in the last few 
years, mainly in France ;? the tendency to recognize the 
psychological character of the motifs at work in society. 
It seems to me to be a permanent advance that the bio- 
logical analogy is giving place to a psychological analogy, 
and that this is leading the writers in so-called ‘sociology’ 
to examine the psychological processes which lie wrapped 
up in the activities and responsibilities called social. 
§ 1. Distinction of Problems 
314. The questions which should concern the scientific 
student of society seem to me to be two, each of which 
1 Much of this chapter was printed in the Psychological Review (Sept. 1897). 
2 The reader may turn to the very able résumés by M. Lapie, published in 
the Revue de Métaph. et de Morale (May, 1895, and May, 1896) under the title 
*L’Année Sociologique, 1894, 1895,’ which are continued for 1896 in the same 
journal (July, 1897) by M. F. Simiand. See also M. Lacombe’s interesting 
work De 1’ Histoire considéré comme science, for a justification of the psycho- 
logical point of view. An annual called Z’Année sociologigque is edited by M. 
Durkheim. 
492
-P-A-G-E-519
  Distinction of Problems 493 
gets again a twofold statement. The first question con- 
cerns the matter or content of social organization; what is 
it that is organized ?— what is it that is passed about, dupli- 
cated, made use of, in society? When we speak of social 
action in its lowest terms, ‘what’ leads to the action, 
what is the sort of material which must be there if social 
action is there? This question has had very acute dis- 
cussion lately under the somewhat different statement: 
what is the criterion or test of a social phenomenon? 
But the question which I ask under this head is more 
narrow, since, in all sorts of organization, a further ques- 
tion comes up in addition to that of the matter; the 
further question as to the functional method or process 
of organization of the social material, the type of psycho- 
logical function which explains the forms it takes on. It 
has been the weakness of many good discussions of late, 
I think, just that they have not set these questions sepa- 
rately, ze. (1) the matter, and (2) the functional method of 
organization of the given matter. ; 
Let us take an illustration. Some of the animals show 
a certain organization which appears to be social. But on 
examination, in certain instances, we find that the actions 
involved are hereditary, congenital, each animal doing his 
part, in the main or altogether, simply because he is born 
to do it whenever the organism becomes ripe for these 
actions under the stimulation of his environment. Now 
let us contrast with this the intelligent co-operative per- 
formance of the same actions by a group of men or 
children who deliberately join to do them in common. In 
the two cases it is clear that the psychological content is 
different; one being a biological and instinctive, the other 
a psychological and acquired, action. The results to the 
   
-P-A-G-E-520
  494 Social Matter and Process 
observer may be the same, and the question may still 
remain as to whether the method or type of function be the 
same or no; but there is no doubt that the psychological 
content is different. These two questions may therefore 
be distinguished at the outset with so much justification. 
315. But each of these two questions sets a twofold re- 
quirement. If we assume that the distinction between 
Habit (with its relative fixity of function) and Accommo- 
dation (with its relative plasticity of function, as seen in 
all progress in learning or acquisition) holds of society, 
then both the matter and the method or process of social 
organization must allow of these two modes, and working 
together must also produce them. If, for example, we take 
an individual and find that he has a habit of acting ina 
certain way, and that at the same time he also improves 
upon his action from day to day, we yet say that the 
action remains in a sense the same in its content or mean- 
ing throughout the entire series, from the fixed habit to 
the skilled variation. Our determination of the content of 
the action must have reference to just the possibility of the 
entire series of actions, from fixed repetitions by habit 
to the extreme variations of accommodation, through all 
the intermediate stages. In other words, the fact of 
growth by a series of accommodations must be reckoned 
with in all the determinations of social content. And state- 
ments of progress must go with the definition of the actual 
content at any given stage of social organization. In 
other terms, the matter of social life is changing growing 
matter; and the determination of it must always take 
account of this character. 
So also must the theory of the method of social function- 
ing. The process of social organization results in a grow-     
                                      
   
  
-P-A-G-E-521
    Historical Theories 495 
ing, developing system. Progress is real, no matter what 
its direction, provided it result from the constant action of 
a uniform process of change in a uniform sort of material. 
This we find in social life, and this is the prime require- 
ment of social theory both in dealing with matter and in 
dealing with function. 
§ 2. Historical Theories 
316. It may suffice to bring these distinctions, and the 
problems which emerge, more clearly to the light if we 
note briefly some of the later attempts to deal with the 
social organization from a psychological point of view.! 
I shall cite types of theory only, referring to particular 
writers merely as illustrating these. 
(1) The Imitation Theory, illustrated by M. Tarde. 
This view of social organization has very much to com- 
mend it from the point of view of functional method; in- 
deed, as appears in a later chapter,’ I think imitation is 
the true type of social function, and the theory which ade- 
1 As distinguished from mechanical and biological theories, The biological 
‘theory’ so-called, is, in my view, merely a collection of more or less apt 
analogies, to which M. Novikow has now added the new one which finds 
in the ‘élite intellectuelle’ in society the ‘ sexsorium social, and M. Lilienfeld 
that which likens mob frenzy to the hysterical fit of a female. As to M. 
Simiand’s suggestion that the rich are society’s adipose tissue, that priests also 
represent fat, and that the police force are the social phagocytes which eat up 
wandering criminal cells — admitting all of them, still in the words of the last- 
named writer, “ gx’y avons-nous appris? Analogie?—elle ne prouve rien.” 
The biological analogy is treated seriously, however, later on (Chap. XIV.). 
Possibly the best detailed treatment of all the facts of the organic analogy is 
in René Worms’ Organisme et Société (Paris, 1897). Certain idealistic views are 
referred to below (Sect. 331). See also the note, Sect. 333, on the ‘General 
Will’ and ‘Social Contract’ theories. Interesting exposition and discussion of 
theories from a psychological point of view resembling my own, are now avail- 
able in Barth’s Philosophie der Geschichte als Sociologie, 1. (the reader may also 
compare Professor Barth’s ‘ Preface’ to the German translation of this book). 
2 Chap. XIII. M. Tarde’s exposition is in his Les Lois de 1’ mitation.  
-P-A-G-E-522
  496 Social Matter and Process 
quately develops it will give possibly the final solution of 
the question. As a complete explanation of society, how- 
ever, it fails signally, since it gives no answer to the ques- 
tion of matter. M. Tarde does not tell us what zs imitable, 
what is capable, through imitation, of becoming fixed as 
social habit, and also of being progressively modified in 
the forms of social progress.1 He does seem to become 
more aware of the need of answering this question in his 
later work, La Logigue sociale, and introduces certain ele- 
ments of content such as ‘beliefs and desires,’ to supply 
the lack. This, however, seems to the present writer to 
imply, if logically developed, a departure from his earlier 
theory. 
Apart, indeed, from M. Tarde’s personal views, it may 
be said that the case of imitation at its purest is just 
the case in which the social vanishes. Imagine a room 
full of parrots imitating one another in regular sequence 
around the area and let them keep it up ad infinitum, 
and with as much individual variation as they may; 
where is the social bond among the parrots? In so far 
as the imitation is exact, in this case a thing of con- 
genital instinct, in so far we might substitute tuning-forks 
for the parrots, and let them vibrate together after striking 
one of them a sharp blow. Indeed, in his treatment of 
the final nature of imitation in his book Social Laws, 
M. Tarde brings it into a sort of cosmic correlation with 
undulatory repetition in physics. I cannot see that the 
mere presence of imitation would avail anything, without 
tacit or explicit assumptions of two kinds: first, that the 
material of social organization is essentially imitable ma- 
terial; and second, that through imitation this material 
1 Yet see his Lots de 1’ Imitation, p. 163. 
 
-P-A-G-E-523
    Historical Theories 497 
would take on the forms of organization actually found 
in society. 
317. (2) Another type of theory which is open to much 
the same criticism is represented by the ‘constraint’ view 
of M. Durkheim,! and what is called ‘subordination’ by 
other writers. To this view the essence of social organi- 
zation is the constraining influence of one person upon 
others, due to authority, social place, etc. It is in line 
with the extreme ‘suggestion’ theory of society, which 
makes the crowd acting under the suggestion of the 
strongest personalities in it the type of social organiza- 
tion as such: a theory which we have already criticised 
above.2 The weakness of this type of doctrine appears 
from the striking analogy from hypnotic suggestion which 
its advocates employ. And the common element of such 
a view with that of M. Tarde is evidenced in the use of 
the same analogy by the latter. The analogy seems to 
me to be quite correct; to this view the extreme and the 
purest instance of social organization would be hypnotic 
rapport. Were constraint is well-nigh absolute, imitation 
is perfect, subordination is unquestionable. But it is 
only necessary to state this to see that in hypnotic rapport 
the social has completely evaporated. There is no place 
for a criterion of social material. The hypnotic subject, 
or the generally suggestible subject, tends to take all 
suggestions as of approximately equal value, to obey 
everything, to understand nothing, to be the same sort 
of an instrument of repetition as is the parrot or the 
tuning-fork. How there could be any organization as 
distinct from repetition, of progress as distinct from arbi- 
trary law or caprice, I am quite unable to see. It may 
1 Revue Philosophique, May and July, 1894. 2 Chap. VIL, § 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  498 Social Matter and Process 
be, as a matter of history, that the first social man became 
so because he was knocked down by a stronger, and so 
constrained to be his slave; but further progress from 
such a state of constraint, in the direction of co-operation, 
would be possible only in proportion as there was a ‘let-. 
up’ or modification of the one-sided constraint. In other 
words, constraint — or rather the imitation to which it 
may be reduced as soon as it ceases to be one-sided and 
becomes mutual—may have been and may continue to 
be the functional process, or method of social life; but the 
lines of progress actually made by society would seem to 
be determined by certain inherent possibilities of fruitful 
imitation and co-operation in some particular spheres. 
These spheres should be defined, and that raises the quite 
different question of matter or content. The constraint 
theorists, I know, take as type of constraint not that of 
force but that of suggestion; and it is just this tendency 
which brings their view into line with the imitation theory 
and makes it available as an important, but less impor- 
tant, contribution to that theory. 
318. (3) There is another way again of looking at social 
organization, a way which may be called psychological, 
however, only with some latitude. Dr. Simmel, of Berlin, 
may be taken as representing it, in a part of his treatment 
of society! It consists in attempting, by an analysis of 
social events and phenomena, to arrive at a statement 
of the formal principles which each section or general 
instance of social life presents. Such formal principles 
are division of labour, ‘subordination,’ co-operation, etc. 
This is a very serviceable undertaking, I think, and 
1 Yet I expressly disclaim the intention of fully reflecting, even in this one 
particular, the subtle and discriminating thought of Dr. Simmel.
-P-A-G-E-525
  
     LMrstorical Theories 499 
must result in a certain valid social logic; a system of 
principles by which social phenomena may be classified 
and which may serve as touchstones in particular cases 
of organization. The objection, however, to building a 
science of the social life upon it is just that the principles 
are formal; it would be like building the psychology of 
concrete daily life upon the principles of formal logic. 
Principles which get application everywhere are not of 
concrete use anywhere. They also lack—or the system 
which seeks them out lacks—the genetic point of view. 
Granted the establishing of these principles by the analy- 
sis of social events, the question would still remain as to 
the original form which they showed in primitive societies. 
It is easier to deal with the simpler, and work up, than it 
is to reverse this procedure; and from this point of view 
it would seem quite possible to treat all such principles — 
once having solved the question of social material —as 
developments from imitation and suggestion. Apart from 
this, however, the essential criticism to be made upon this 
type of thought is that it deals only with form and func- 
tional method and assumes certain sorts of matter of social 
organization. The principle of division of labour, for ex- 
ample, assumes the conscious thought involved in each 
such division, and its constant application by the members 
of society. 
319. (4) Another class of positions have the merit of 
being genetic: those which found the social life of com- 
munities upon certain primitive emotions, such as sym- 
pathy. These theories are exemplified by Mr. Spencer, 
M. Novikow, and the English moral philosophers. This 
is possibly the oldest form of social theory, having its 
roots in Aristotle; so it has all the accumulated authority
-P-A-G-E-526
  500 Social Matter and Process 
of age. Its forms of statement are also so numerous 
that I cannot take them up. From the pure ‘sympathy’ 
theory we pass to the ‘altruistic theory’ which makes 
social life a derivative of ethical; to the ‘social instinct’ 
and ‘native benevolence’ theories, which say that man is 
natively social, and sympathy and altruistic feeling are 
eviderces of it; and finally we reach the climax of descrip- 
tive vagueness !— in a formula wide enough to include all 
the rest—the ‘consciousness of kind’ recently propounded 
by Professor F. H. Giddings. 
As a class it may be said of all these theories that they 
constantly confuse the question of functional method with 
that of the matter of social organization. In regard to 
method of function the imitation theory comes in at once 
to supplement these earlier points of view. 
Apart from this lack, it may be said that the life of 
feeling and instinct does not furnish the requirements 
of matter for social organization. There are two sorts 
of sympathy, two sorts of social instinct, two sorts of 
consciousness of kind. This appears when we press the 
requirement indicated above: that the matter of social 
organization should be such as to allow the formation both 
of social habit and of the adaptations seen in social accom- 
modation and growth. The life of instinct as such and of 
the emotions which come with instinctive activities —e.g., 
organic sympathy, impulsive altruism, manifestations of 
kind such as maternal affections, etc. —all these are race 
habits. To the degree in which they fulfil the require- 
1 In the Preface to the third edition of his interesting Principles of Sociol- 
ogy, however, Professor Giddings defines ‘consciousness of kind’ more in 
terms of sympathy, recognizing his kinship to Adam Smith, whose views are 
referred to further below (Sects. 330, 332).
-P-A-G-E-527
  
LWistorical Theories 501 
ment that society live by its stock of habits, to that degree 
do they fail to enable society to modify its habits and 
grow. If we sympathize with each other by pure instinct, 
and act only on the movings of sympathy, new organiza- 
tion would be as far off as if we fought tooth and nail; 
for action would be as capricious. So also merely to feel 
socially inclined would not beget differential forms of 
social organization. To be conscious of others as of the 
same kind would in itself not determine, in the slightest 
degree, the sort of thought or action which could be fruit- 
fully recognized and developed within the habits of the 
kind. If we assume an adequate content, a common ma- 
terial; in short, if we assume social organization already 
in the groups which for convenience, after they are made 
up in nature, we call kinds, then of course it is the sim- 
plest thing in the world to say that what the members 
have in common is their consciousness of kind; but it is 
no more an explanation than is the phrase ‘love of drink’ 
an explanation of inherited tendency to alcoholism. 
It is only when we come to see the second or higher 
sort of sympathy, social instinct, consciousness of kind, 
etc., that the requirement that social organization be pro- 
gressive becomes more apparent, because only there is 
it possible of fulfilment. We do not find instincts show- 
ing much organization apart from certain fixed and con- 
genital forms of co-operation. The higher emotions and 
actions which arise when consciousness becomes in some 
degree reflective, as opposed to instinctive, take on aspects 
which are differentiated from one another according to the 
mental content which they accompany. There is a reflec- 
tive sympathy, a reflective sociality, a reflective conscious- 
ness of kind, and it is just their value that they now afford 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
    502 Social Matter and Process 
some criterion — a material criterion — over and above the 
mere fact of feeling and instinct. This point it is the 
main business of this chapter to draw from our earlier 
distinctions and developments, so I need not dwell upon 
it here; yet we see that the theories which deal in such 
general descriptions of social organization as the terms 
mentioned carry, are quite inadequate, since they leave the 
real problem of matter unanswered: the problem of the 
‘what’ of social organization. We must know the ‘what’ 
of such questions as “what does society fruitfully imitate?” 
“what feelings and acts of sympathy yield results of social 
value and permanence?” “what is the something found 
sometimes in the consciousness of kind which in these 
cases leads to the sort of progress characteristic of an 
ethical society as opposed, let us say, to a school of fish?” ? 
Of course I am not intending to draw lines, even between 
the ethical society and the school of fish. It is a further 
question, after we determine the what of social organiza- 
tion, to find how far it may be present, also, in the behav- 
iour of the school of fish. But what is it?— ‘that is the 
question.’ 
320. This brief characterization of theories, all of which 
aim to be psychological, enables us to see our problem. 
I have introduced them only for this purpose; and the 
inadequacies of presentation will, I hope, not be construed 
1In my opinion, the nearest approach made by Professor Giddings, for 
example, to an answer to this question is in this sentence from his Preface 
(3d ed., p. xii): “The simplest known or conceivable social state of the mind 
is a sympathetic consciousness of resemblance between the self and the not- 
self.” But I find nothing in his detailed treatment that goes beyond the tra- 
ditional sympathy theory. In acknowledging the ‘protean modes’ of the 
‘consciousness of kind,’ Professor Giddings seems to me to be casting about 
for some material criterion of what is social. 
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  Historical Theories 503 
as inadequacies of appreciation. The way the emerging 
problems appear, in consequence of our review so far, 
may be shown in certain more formal statements to which 
the remainder of the chapter may be addressed. 
(1) The determination of phenomena as social is only 
possible under the twofold requirement as to matter and 
functional method. To fail in either of these is to fail 
entirely; on the one side it would be like determining 
life by morphology alone, with no necessary exclusion of 
crystals and ploughshares, provided they were the right 
shape; or, on the other hand, by physiology alone, which 
would not exclude a cunningly devised india-rubber heart 
or an air-pump breathing machine, provided it worked. 
(2) There is entire justification for the distinction urged 
by Tonnies between what have been called in English 
respectively ‘colonies’ and ‘societies.’! Tonnies distin- 
guishes between the Gemeinschaft and the Gesellschaft. 
The difference —to put it in my own way, from the point 
of view of a current psychological and biological distinc- 
tion —is this, z.e., between the relatively unvarying, rela- 
tively definite, and relatively unconscious organization 
which has its extreme instance in animal instinct, and 
the relatively varying, progressive, plastic, and conscious 
organization seen in human life. I shall distinguish these 
types as companies* and societies. Later on the more 
     
                                            
     
     1 Durkheim’s development of the distinction seems nearer to that of the 
text, however, than Ténnies’. 
2 The word ‘community’ might be used for this, as a translation of Gemein- 
schaft; but that word has another significance in English. The term ‘colony’ 
is also inappropriate, I think, for a similar reason. Colony has the biological 
meanings of (1) a group of cells making up a tissue or an organism, and (2) 
a mass of low organisms held together without vital union; and also its well 
known politico-social meaning,
-P-A-G-E-530
504 Social Matter and Process 
essential difference appears that while in companies the 
individuals feel and act alike, in societies the individuals 
also think alike 
(3) The distinction just made is mainly one of matter or 
content, seeing that the method of interaction is substan- 
tially the same in the two types of organization, 2.¢., imita- 
tion.? 
Our first problem, therefore, is the determination of the 
facts regarding the ‘what’ of social life. What is it that 
is common to all socéetzes, and is also capable of progres- 
sive organization in each society ? 
§ 3. The Matter of Social Organization 
321. Coming, therefore, to the question of the matter, 
the ‘what,’ of social organization, I shall state a general 
result, and then indicate certain lines of evidence for it. 
This result may be put in the form of a thesis as follows: 
the matter of social organization consists of thoughts — by 
which ts meant intellectual states — which are socially avail- 
able in the way now to be considered. These thoughts, 
or knowledges or informations, originate in the mind of 
the individuals of the group, as inventions, more or less 
novel conceptions ; what we have called ‘ particularizations.’ 
At their origin there is no reason for calling them social 
matter, since they are particular to the individual. They 
become social only when society — that is, the other mem- 
bers of the social group, or some of them—also thinks 
1 See Sect. 333 @ and cf. § 2 of Chap. XIV. on ‘ Social Progress.’ Durkheim 
goes further in requiring what he calls ‘ individualizing,’ in addition to ‘ think- 
ing’ in true ‘societies.’ 
2 That is, ‘conscious imitation’ in its ordinary sense. It works in animal] 
companies, so far as they have co-operations which are not purely instinctive.  
-P-A-G-E-531
    The Matter of Social Organization 505 
them, knows them, is informed of them. This reduces 
them, from the individual and particular form to a general 
or social form, and it is only in this form that they furnish 
social material, through what has been called, again, the 
‘generalizations’ effected by society. It is evident that 
these positions are not at all new after our earlier discus- 
sions; our main interest in presenting them, as well as the 
points of evidence which follow, lies in the advantage of 
having them definitely formulated about the present topic, 
and also as bringing us to a characterization of the sort 
of thought which is socially available. 
The general considerations upon which this opinion is 
based may be given in contradistinction from special lines 
of evidence. These general considerations will be seen to 
arise in connection with the general requirements of social 
theory as stated in the foregoing pages. 
(1) It is only thoughts or knowledges which are imitable 
in the fruitful way required by a theory of progressive 
social organization. It has been said by some that beliefs 
and desires are thus imitable. It is clear, however, to the 
psychologist that beliefs and desires are functions of the 
knowledge-contents about which they arise. No belief 
can be induced in one individual by another except as the 
fact, truth, information, believed is first induced. The 
imitator must first get the thought before he can imitate 
belief in the thought. So of a desire. I cannot desire 
what you do except as I think the desirable object some- 
what as you do. Both belief and desire are, as has been 
argued above, functions of thought-content. 
If it be a question of imitative propagation or reproduc- 
tion from one member of a social group to another, the 
vehicle of such a system of reproductions must be thought
-P-A-G-E-532
  506 Social Matter and Process 
or knowledge. The only other psychological alternative 
is to say that the imitative propagation takes place by the 
simple contagion of feeling and impulse.!_ This, however, 
takes us back to the question already raised above, z.¢., the 
question of possible progress by society. We found that 
the reign of imitative feeling and impulse, whether it be by 
instinct or by suggestion, would make possible only the 
form of organization in which fixed habit is all, and in which 
no accommodation, movement, progress, would take place. 
This we found to characterize certain animal companies, 
and mobs of persons, in distinction from true societies.? 
(2) It is only in the form of thoughts, conceptions, or 
inventions that new material, new ‘copies for imitation,’ 
new schemes of modified organization, can come into a 
society at any stage of its development. This seems evi- 
dent from the mere statement of it. If we ask how a new 
-measure of legislation, a new scheme of reform, a new 
opinion about style, art, literature, even a new cut to our 
coats or a changed height of hat— how any one of these 
originates, we are obliged to say that some one first 
1 Great variety of view obtains as to the fundamental psychologico-social 
fact; Le Bon says ‘Sentiments,’ Novikow ‘Desires,’ Lacombe ‘Needs.’ 
M. Lapie gives an interesting critique of these positions in the article cited. 
2See above, Chap. VI., § 5. The biological view which considers the 
unit-person as such the material of social organization may be refuted in a 
word. Itis as fersons that persons come into social relationships, and the 
differences of persons are just in the psychological part. One physical body 
is as good as another before social law, unless indeed by reason of its colour, 
etc., it becomes a matter to arouse psychological attitudes: a point suggested 
above apropos of ‘social forces’ (Sect. 297, note). The distinction between 
things in groups and persons in society is that there is a ‘give-and-take’ in 
the latter case. The object of social study is thus the ‘giving and taking,’ 
and the material is that which is ‘ given and taken.’ For a fine examination of 
the ‘unit-person’ theory see Lacombe, /’ Histoire considéré comme science, 
Introduction, >
-P-A-G-E-533
     The Matter of Social Organization 507 
thought of it. Thought of it, that is the important thing. 
Feeling and desire might have impelled to thought; 
urgent need may have prompted the invention; decaying 
modes may have made reform a matter of necessity; but 
with all the urgency that we may conceive, the measure, 
the reform, the new style, has to originate somewhere in 
the form of a concrete device, which society may take up 
and spread abroad. This particular form is then — apart 
from happy accidents of discovery !—the thought of some 
one; and society afterwards ‘generalizes’ the thought. 
Of all the individual’s doings, therefore, it is his thoughts 
which are the socially available factors of his life. Of 
course there is a form of social propagation which takes 
its origin in the actions alone of this man or that, whether 
any thought be discoverable in the actions or not. But 
apart from the fact that such actions have to be thought 
by the imitators, however spontaneous or accidental they 
may have been on the part of the original actor, it is evi- 
dent that this form of social origination is on the side of 
mere accident, and reduces itself to repetition, social con- 
vention, or mob-action, and is lacking in itself of any 
fruitfulness in the production of new phases of social 
progress. It is thus even with the cases of contagion of 
crime already spoken of. However much we deplore 
them and lament the victims, we do not fear that the 
crimes may become recognized social modes of conduct. 
That would mean disintegration. 
With these general considerations in mind, — which are 
enough in themselves to justify a close examination of the 
position that thought or knowledge is the matter of social 
organization, —we may proceed to. cite two lines of evi- 
1 And, of course, the happy accidents have to be re-thought,
-P-A-G-E-534
  508 Soctal Matter and Process 
dence which support this view. One of them is drawn 
from the facts of the child’s social development, as already 
depicted, and the other from the corresponding facts of 
the social and ethical man’s relations to the historical 
institutions of society. These are the two spheres in 
which the consideration of the psychological factors in- 
volved in social organization leads us to reliable results. 
322. I. A further development of the line of thought 
suggested in our consideration of social interests! leads 
us to the view that the so-called ‘dialectic,’ whereby the 
child comes to a knowledge of himself by building up a 
sense of his social environment, may also be looked at 
from the side of social organization. If we grant that 
the thought of self takes its rise as a gradual achievement 
on the part of the child by means of his constant experi- 
ence of the personalities about him, and that he has not 
two different thoughts for himself and the other, — the 
ego and the alter, — but one thought common in the main 
for both ;* then it becomes just as impossible to construe 
the social factor, the organized relationships between 
him and others, without taking account of his and their 
thoughts of self, as it is to construe the thoughts of self 
without taking account of the social relationships. The 
thought of self arises directly out of certain given social 
relationships; indeed, it is the form which these actual 
relationships take on in the organization of a new personal 
experience. The ego of which he thinks at any time is 
not the isolated-and-in-his-body-alone-situated abstraction 
which our theories of personality usually lead us to think. 
Chap. L, § 1. 
2 This common or general part consists mainly, as has been said, in motor 
attitudes. Cf. Mental Development, p. 330, and cf. Sect. 29 a above.
-P-A-G-E-535
    The Matter of Social Organization 509 
It is rather a sense of a network of relationships among 
you, me, and the others, in which certain necessities of 
pungent feeling, active life, and concrete thought require 
that I throw the emphasis on one pole sometimes, calling 
it me; and on the other pole sometimes, calling it you or 
him. The social meaning of this state of things comes 
out when we look into its psychological presuppositions 
in the whole group. Let us then call the child’s sense 
of the entire personal situation in which he finds himself 
' at any time in his thought, his se/f-thought-situation. This 
phrase, which I use simply for shorthand, may be ex- 
panded always into: ‘the social situation implicated in 
the thought of self.’ 
323. Now, whatever is true of one individual’s growth 
by imitative appropriation of personal material, is true of 
all; and we have the giver turned into the taker and the 
taker into the giver everywhere. The growing sense of 
a ‘self-thought-situation’ in each is, just to the extent that 
the. social bonds are intimate and intrinsic, the same for 
all, The possibility of co-operation—as, for example, 
the co-operations of children’s games—depends upon 
this essential sameness of the personal thoughts of the 
whole circle in each situation. My action depends upon 
my understanding of your thought and his, and your 
action depends upon your understanding of my thought 
and his, and so on! Looked at objectively, we say that 
the children are in social relationship; looked at subjec- 
tively, the truth is that they are thinking the same 
thoughts of the personal-social situation, and this thought 
1 The case will be remembered (Sect. 183) in which H., by putting an arti- 
ficial verbal value on an article, thus counted on the sameness of E.’s socially 
induced desire and discounted it to her own private advantage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-536
  510 Social Matter and Process 
is just the ‘self-thought’ in the stage of development 
which it has reached in this little mind or that, to be 
brought out on this or that occasion. H. understands 
E. in terms of her own motives, desires, tendencies, likes 
and dislikes, and, acting on this understanding, finds that 
it works; so E. treats her self-thought as true to H.’s 
thought, and it works; to find that either of these expec- 
tations did not work in the great run of cases of action 
would be to say, from the objective point of view, that the 
social relationship was dissolved. But this could not be 
without at the same time disintegrating, so far as the 
factors are intrinsic, the sense of personal self in each 
of the children, or taking it back toward the beginning 
of its development. 
324. The question of the material of social organiza- . 
tion comes up here as soon as we ask what it is that the 
children pass about, give and take, in this interplay with 
one another. And we find here just the distinction which 
occurred from the consideration of the difference between 
human and animal co-operations. We find the child at 
first largely organic, instinctive, directly emotional, under 
the influence of pleasures and pains. His sympathy is 
at first organic, and his antipathies likewise. But close 
observation shows that it is largely by the growing realiza- 
tion of personal distinctions, on the basis of which his 
thought of self develops, that he comes to have conscious 
imitations, original interpretations, hesitations, inhibitions, 
volitions. At first the relation is one of direct stimulation 
and direct response. If this state of things continued, 
men would form ‘companies,’ not ‘societies.’ Direct 
suggestion, emotional reaction, as much co-operation as 
heredity might give consistently with the other features
-P-A-G-E-537
    The Matter of Social Organization 511 
—that would be the state of things. But now let the 
child begin to think, and we find certain great features 
of social import springing up in his life. First, a distinc- 
tion in the elements of his environment according as they 
are personal or not; second, a difference of attitude toward 
persons, and toward different persons, according as the 
elements of personal suggestion become assimilated to 
this group of experiences or to that; third, the inter- 
pretation of the other persons in the same terms as 
himself, z.¢., as having attitudes like his in similar cir- 
cumstances, and as thinking of him as he thinks of them. 
But all this is due to thought, involves knowledges, and 
the sorting of them out. The emotions now spring from 
thought-experiences, and the attitudes, actions, responses 
now take on the character of means to a personal end, 
the end being the thought which issues in this or that 
attitude or action. This development has been all along 
the burden of our song. 
We may say then, as a first gain, from the considera- 
tion of the children, that what we call odjective social 
relationships are the objective manifestations to the on-looker 
of a common self-thought-situation in the different indi- 
viduals, together with the movements of its growth in 
each as the immediate situation calls it out. 
325. II. We have now found so much justification for 
two positions: first, that the material of social organization 
must be considered as thoughts; thoughts which arise in 
individual minds and are then re-thought imitatively by 
others, and so carried on through a social career; and 
second, that the child’s social sense, that is, his sense of 
social situations, however meagre and contracted or how- 
ever full and rich, arises and grows as a function of his
-P-A-G-E-538
  512 Social Matter and Process 
thought of himself. In other words, society to the child 
—society from the private subjective point of view —is a 
concrete situation involving related changes among the 
elements and attitudes which constitute his self-thought. 
The further question remains: given this objective social 
material — thought —and given also this subjective sense 
of society in the individual, what then is the objective char- 
acter of social organization? For, of course, the question 
of science is just this objective question; not only what 
does each individual think of the social situation when he 
thinks of it at all, but what must the observer think of it 
after he finds out scientifically all about it? His question, 
then, in view of the two earlier determinations, is this: is 
the thought which constitutes the material of social organ- 
ization any thought at random, thought X, thought Y, 
thought Z, these and others? Or must it be some par- 
ticular sort of thought? And again, if the latter, must 
it be the sort of thought which the individual thinks when 
he reaches his sense of social situations as functions of his 
thought of himself? To come right to the conclusion, I 
think the last is true; and its truth appears, again, in 
what was called above! the Pudlicity of all social truth. 
What, then, is this publicity when considered from the 
objective point of view of social science? It may be 
stated in a sentence (which we go on to illustrate and ex- 
plain): every socially available thought implies a public 
‘ self-thought-situation’ which is strictly analogous in its 
rise and progress to the self-thought-situation of the indt- 
vidual member of soctety. 
326. We may take an illustration from the ordinary 
attitude which society takes toward human life, in con- 
1 Chap. VIIL., § 3. 
 
-P-A-G-E-539
    The Matter of Social Organization 513 
trast with the attitude which the individual might some- 
times think himself justified in taking toward his own life, in 
case he succeeded in stripping from his thought its ‘ pub- 
licity,’ and acted on the lower unethical sanctions alone. 
Let us say that there is a question in the mind of Mr. A 
as to whether he shall put a barrier across his hay-field to 
protect himself from injury at the point at which a rail- 
road crosses the field. He says to himself: “I have crossed 
that field many times; I have never been struck by a 
train; the chances are that I never shall be; it would be 
useless trouble and expense.” So he takes the risk of his 
life, and is probably justified by the event in doing so. So 
the sanctions of a private kind, mainly that of his intelli- 
gence, seem to sustain him in this decision. 
But now let us suppose that Mr. A is also a public offi- 
cial and has to consider the question of putting up barriers 
at railway crossings generally. He is then told that at 
each place at which a railway crosses a road, a certain 
proportion of the pedestrians who go that way are killed 
each year. He might say of each of these what he had 
before said of himself, that the chances were in favour of 
safety. But now that he takes a public point of view, this 
is no longer sanctioned in his thought. It is no longer the 
question of the continuance of the life of this one man or 
that. It is now the question of the greatest possible safety 
to the collective or entire life of the community. To put up 
barriers at all the crossings would undoubtedly prevent the 
loss of many citizens a year. The social or public sanc- 
tion, then, impels him in just the opposite direction; and 
he not only votes for the measure, but bears a share of the 
taxation and allows the barrier to be put up in his own hay- 
field. 
 
-P-A-G-E-540
  514 Social Matter and Process 
327. If now we take this situation at its lowest terms 
and attempt to analyze it we find that it implies certain 
things : 
(1) A shifting of the individual’s point of view, in such a 
way that the earlier private thought of self is held in check 
before a higher or ideal thought of self; the self of the 
man acting in public is different; if he be true to it, he 
can no longer act out his private thought. (2) There is in 
his mind a sense of the reciprocity of action of all the indi- 
viduals with reference to one another under this larger 
self-thought ; and the actual social situation, involving all 
the individuals, is possible because this reciprocity and 
sameness of attitude are actually real. This, then, consti- 
tutes the public self-thought-situation or the social situation 
implicated in the public thought of self. 
328. It is only through the reality of the first of these 
movements in Mr. A’s mind that the second becomes 
possible, and has its value for objective science. The 
public or reciprocal reference of the judgment in each 
case arises only through the assimilation of the pri- 
vate and ejective self-thoughts in a larger whole of the 
same kind. The constituting of the larger self is just 
the evidence of the integrating of the more partial selves; 
and if the public reference is due to the common element 
in the different individuals’ self-thoughts, then each in- 
dividual must get the growth which the assimilation repre- 
sents, and all the individuals must construct somewhat the 
same ideal. The former is secured in the normal growth 
of the ‘self-thought-situation’ in each, and the latter 
through their actual life in a common social tradition and 
heritage. 
Taking the point of view of society, therefore, in con-

                                                           The Matter of Social Organization 515 
trast with that of the individual, we find the state of things 
which social science is led to recognize, z.c., an actual 
integration of individuals just through the identical higher 
self which their life together makes it possible for them to 
set up. From this point of view, therefore, we may call 
this a public ‘ self-thought-situation,’ —a social situation 
which is implicated in a public thought of self—and go on 
to inquire into the laws of progress and development which 
it shows, always with reference to the individuals of whose 
growth it is a function. It is interesting to note that in 
this public self thus understood, we have reached a 
measure of genetic justification for a position taken up by 
Aristotle and so often reasserted in the history of ethical 
discussion: the position which finds itself obliged to fall 
back upon a hypothetical ‘ best man’ or oracle, whose judg- 
ment would be correct if it could be had. In our develop- 
ment, however, this public self is the objective form of 
organization into which growing personalities normally fall, 
and its meaning will grow clearer, I trust, as we proceed. 
329. But it may be said, surely it is not necessary 
that all thoughts, inventions, schemes, ideas, reforms, etc., 
should. have this quality which we have called ‘ publicity’ 
to be available for the instruction or reforming of society. 
Yes, they must have it; that is just the point which I wish 
to urge. No knowledge, simply as knowledge, can be social 
knowledge or become the instrument of social advance until 
it be made over to the public self, by becoming in the minds 
of the individuals who think it a public thing, in contra- 
distinction to the private thoughts which they entertain 
simply as individuals. Whatever the thought is, however 
great the invention, however pregnant the suggestion of 
reform, it is not of social value until I am justified in  
-P-A-G-E-542
  516 Social Matter and Process 
thinking it as also thought by the ideal self whose enter- 
tainment of it gives it validity and general authority to 
all the other individuals of the group. I may, from my 
private judgment, discount this further development of my 
thought beforehand ; that is, I may confidently expect that 
my invention will be ratified by society, and so come to 
have the requisite publicity; but I then only do so as I ap- 
peal just to that higher self already formed in my breast 
through social experience, and through it anticipate the 
fate of the thought which I thus value. This is when the 
‘invention is looked at subjectively. As soon as we look 
at it objectively, —that is, from the point of view of the 
science of social organization, — we have to say that no 
thought is social or socially available which is still in the 
mind of an individual awaiting that generalization by the 
public which will give it the character of publicity by 
reason of the essential attribution of it to a public and 
general self. 
In other words, my private thought, in order to be 
social matter, must enter into that organization or integra- 
tion of the public ‘self-thought-situation’ which is reflected 
more or less adequately in every adult; it is thus thought 
by that higher self which imposes law upon all; with this 
goes the thought by me that all men agree with me in 
thinking it, and that they will give the enforcement of 
it the same recognition (including its enforcement upon 
me) that I give it (including its enforcement upon them). 
The thought thus becomes involved in the growth of the 
personal self, and just by this becomes public also. With- 
out this connection it cannot be social. The ultimate 
subjective criterion of social thought is the self-thought, 
with all its wealth of implication as to the social situation.
-P-A-G-E-543
    The Matter of Social Organization 517 
And the ultimate objective criterion is the actual ratifi- 
cation of the thought by the individuals through common 
action upon the situation which thetr self-thoughts mutually 
implicate. By this they show their common integration in 
a public ‘self-thought-situation.’ 
We come, therefore, in closing in upon our question as 
last stated to see that the growing ‘self-thought-situation ” 
in the mind of the individual is, when viewed in its mutual 
interactions and correlations in the group, just the material 
of social organization itself. For nowhere else can we 
find the requisites for public availability fulfilled. Thus 
arises ipso facto a public ‘self-thought-situation’; on no 
other view can we account for the response of individuals 
to the organization which society shows. So both from 
the side of the child’s and man’s growth, and from the 
side of society considered objectively, we are led to 
identify the organization of the individual’s personality 
directly with that of society, in respect both to its material 
and to its method of acting. This may be made a little 
clearer by a short criticism of two views which reach a 
conclusion on the surface similar to this; I refer to that of 
Adam Smith on the one hand, and that of Hegel on the 
other hand. 
330. Adam Smith’s wonderful treatment of the social 
bond under the term ‘sympathy’ is familiar to all students 
of English ethics. The criticism which I wish to make 
upon it is that he assumes the ‘publicity’ requisite to 
social organization, and rests satisfied with that assumption. 
According to Adam Smith, I sympathize with what I 
find ‘suitable’ in the affections of others, since it would 
be what I myself should experience; and the sense of this 
agreement is moral approbation. Then transferred to 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
  518 Social Matter and Process 
myself, my judgment of myself is a reflex of my sense of 
your corresponding sympathy with me. 
But, by way of criticism, we may say that as soon as we 
come to a social situation as such, that is, to a situation 
involving two persons, an aggressor and an aggressee, 
the question arises, with which shall I sympathize? And 
the same question arises as soon as I come to ask 
about my own self-approbation or disapprobation, con- 
sidered as a reflex of the sympathy of others with 
me. For I do not know whether the other will sym- 
pathize with, z.2., approve of, me or the other whom 
my action affects. What, then, is the general element 
which will give publicity and constancy of value to a 
social action as such? This Adam Smith answers in a 
general way by saying that that action is approved which 
is most sympathized with, say as between the aggressor 
and the aggressee.!_ But this of course does not help 
matters ; for how am I to know which of the two you sym- 
pathize with the more, except as I again ask myself which 
would call out the more sympathy in my own case. That 
is, the measure — strictly construing the doctrine — would 
be after all just what we started with, the individual’s 
private sympathy. Adam Smith later on calls in the 
recognition of the judgment of a hypothetical best man, 
to whom tacit appeal is made. But this seems to me to 
be simply an assumption to which he had no right; it 
certainly does not follow from the play of sympathies as 
he has depicted it. 
331. In stating and criticising various theories just 
1 This seems to me to be the outcome of Adam Smith’s discussions of 
utility, as attaching to “ behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either 
of the individual or of society.” Theory of the Mor. Sent., Stewart’s ed. p. xxx.
-P-A-G-E-545
    The Matter of Social Organization 519 
above, there was intentionally omitted a class of thinkers 
whose doctrine, disregarding differences of detail, may 
be described as the ‘ideal’ theory of social life. This 
theory generally proceeds by deduction and reaches a 
view of society from the presuppositions of idealistic 
philosophy. For this reason, ze, that the doctrine is so 
purely deductive, it has little consideration from the more 
scientifically disposed thinkers in this field; and this the 
more since it is with the name of Hegel, and with the 
Neo-Hegelians, that this type of social theory is asso- 
ciated. 
In its broadest outlines, this philosophy makes reality iden- 
tical with thought, finds consciousness, and especially self- 
consciousness, the ‘coming-to-itself’ of reality, and sees in 
social organization the objectivation or universalizing of the 
self-consciousness which first ‘comes-to-itself’ in the indi- 
vidual. The social doctrines of this school seem to be 
these: first, the essential character of reality, as thought, 
is not lost in the objectifying whereby the individual be- 
comes universalized in society; and second, the complete 
‘coming-to-itself’ of reality, in society as in the individual, 
is in the form of a self. When we put these two positions 
together, we have the doctrine that it is in the individual’s 
formal thought of self that there is realized both the sub- 
jective form of reality and its objective form as existing in 
society.} 
It is in this conclusion rather than in the metaphysics 
which lies back of it—and I wish to draw a sharp line 
between them —that our present interest lies. The state- 
ment regarding the thought of self it is which our detailed 
1 Hegel’s distinction between ‘subjective mind’ and ‘ objective spirit.’
-P-A-G-E-546
  520 Social Matter and Process 
inductive investigation both of the child’s development and 
of the movements of society goes far to confirm. 
Yet, from the empirical point of view, this doctrine of 
Hegel’s also makes the assumption of publicity. Meta- 
physically it contains this assumption from the start; 
finding just the coming of the individual to personal self- 
consciousness a manifestation of the universal self all the 
while implicit in nature. But in taking on individual form 
in the first stages of the realization of a self — geneti- 
cally considered—it has temporarily lost this attribute ; 
that it should get it again is to be expected; and that 
social life is the essential stimulus to its getting it again, 
is @ priori probable. Hegel says that social life shows 
indeed the realization of this expectation. Yet how? 
That is a question of fact. 
Hegel’s answer is, in respect to the social material, 
similar to the view which we have developed. He shows 
the dependence of personal development upon progressive 
social conditions, seen earliest in the fact of subjection, as 
of slave to master. Later, through the influences of family 
and state, certain regular self-limitations, mutual relation- 
ships, necessities of life and intercourse, grow up which 
have the quality of general or public value when recog- 
nized by all. 
This, I am aware, is a meagre enough statement of 
Hegel’s view, but it may serve to indicate what is its 
lack. What is wanting is just the bridge from the private 
thought to the public thought. This, in my view, zs suf- 
plied by the imitative process of assimilation and growth. 
Given complex social situations, whence their validity 
for all the members of society equally, and whence the 
intrinsic element of public reference which is a necessity 
 
-P-A-G-E-547
  The Matter of Social Organization 52% 
of social nature to us all? Hegel’s metaphysics, of course, 
supplies this element; it is the nature of thought to re- 
cover or recognize itself as universal (Anerkennung) on 
this higher plane of social self-consciousness. But this, 
when scanned from the point of view of actual genetic 
growth, requires an empirical process or method of de- 
velopment both in the individual and in society. This 
empirical ‘factor’ to Hegel, described as ‘necessary and 
legitimate,’ ‘the basis of the phenomenon’ of social life, 
and its ‘external or phenomenal commencement,’ but ‘not 
its underlying and essential? principle,’ is ‘force.’ But, 
if our earlier positions be at all true, ‘force,’ ‘constraint,’ 
is not the social process. 
In short, it is the great merit of the idealistic writers 
that they give a relatively full and accurate answer to the 
question of the matter of social organization; but with the 
exception of one author,” whose views are not yet published 
in detail, they fail to describe the imitative process or type 
1 That is, metaphysical. The process of ‘self-recognition’ (das anerken- 
nende Selbsthewusstsein) is described by Hegel as a ‘battle.’ “I cannot be 
aware of me as myself in another individual, so long as I see in that other 
another and an immediate existence: and I am consequently bent on the 
suppression of this immediacy of his.... The fight of recognition is a life 
and death struggle.... The fight ends in the first instance as a one-sided 
negation with inequality.... Thus arises the status of master and slave. ... 
In the battle for recognition and the subjugation under a master, we see, on 
their phenomenal side, the emergence of man’s social life and the commence- 
ment of political union.” — Encyclopadie, Part III., Sects. 431-3 (Wallace’s 
translation, Hegel’s Philosophy of Mind, p. 55 f.) This allies Hegel to the 
‘constraint’ theorists already criticised (Sect. 317). 
2 Professor Royce, who agrees with this main point of criticism, saying 
in a private communication: “An express recognition of the imitative 
factor as such is what I miss in him” (Hegel). I take pleasure in print- 
ing, in Appendix H, a passage from Professor Royce’s letter which indi- 
cates a difference of emphasis in the interpretation of Hegel’s ‘master and 
slave’ teaching.
-P-A-G-E-548
  522 Social Matter and Process 
of function by which the social matter — the ‘self-thought- 
situation’ — becomes public, and is so made available for 
society and for the individual doth at once. 
332. In the way of more positive evidence that social 
material always implicates the ‘self-thought-situation,’ we 
may note that much of the matter accumulated by the great 
succession of English moralists to prove that sympathy in 
all its manifestations is a ‘putting of oneself in another’s 
shoes’ is directly available. For we have only to substi- 
tute imitative identity of the ego and the alter for the 
artificial ‘putting of one into the shoes of the other’; 
and the results follow. This is to say that the old doc- 
trine of sympathy is essentially correct as far as it goes 
in the recognition of the implication of the self; it only 
needs supplementing from investigations into the genesis 
and nature of the class of phenomena covered by the 
term ‘sympathy.’ This the view does which makes the 
self-thought a progressive imitative outcome; with that 
active play between the poles of its realization which 
is just the method of its growth. Thus a certain unity 
and lack of assumption is secured to the whole scheme. 
For example, one might take the fine catalogue of argu- 
ments given by Adam Smith at the beginning of his 
Moral Sentiments and review them? one by one, finding 
that on this view they all fall together and support a 
derivation of publicity, where he could only assume it. 
For he assumes, first, that we sympathize with each other; 
this he makes his platform. Then he assumes that it 
is pleasant to both the parties when they are in a state of

pp. 199 ff. and 258 f.

-P-A-G-E-549
    The Matter of Social Organization 523 
sympathy. Both positions are true as facts, and equally 
true of animals. But the reason of the facts, lying 
(1) in the identity of a progressive thought, which (2) just 
by its growth in each, integrates all in social relation- 
ships, —this is wanting. Both of these facts are ac- 
counted for, in man, by the view that from the first the 
gathering self-thought grows up by imitative suggestion. 
For on this view sympathy is a necessary emotional 
attitude flowing from the identical thought of self; and 
the pleasure of mutual sympathy and co-operation is 
the pleasure of personal activity which is normally inter- 
woven in a situation understood and appealed to by all 
the individuals. 
333. Further evidence comes from some of the posi- 
tions already taken in earlier pages, to which we may 
simply refer for the sake of completeness. 
(1) We may cite the evidence which goes to show that 
each person does depend upon social stimulation in his 
personal growth, and does arrive at standards of social 
judgment and feeling which reflect in the main the stand- 
ards current in his environment (Parts I.-II. especially). 
Here the writings of Leslie Stephen, Héffding, S. Alexan- 
der, Josiah Royce, etc., may be utilized. 
(2) A further argument may be drawn from the state- 
ment of the same question in reference to ethical pub- 
licity, z.¢., the evidence which goes to show that genetically 
social suggestion and social beliefs are intrinsic to moral- 
ity (Chap. I., § 3, and Chap. VIII., §§ 2-4). This point 
is mentioned again below, where the connection between 
ethical and social progress is indicated. 
(3) Finally, there is the evidence from the history of the 
social life of man, which shows the constant ‘give-and-
-P-A-G-E-550
  524 Social Matter and Process 
take’ between the individual and society which the position 
now taken would require (Parts III-IV.).1 
§ 4. Animal Companies and Human Societies 
333 a. It remains to gather up the facts regarding the 
forms of quasi-social organization among animals.2_ The 
distinction made between human and animal common life is, 
of course, not a hard and fast one. The types are respec- 
tively types, not kinds. In saying that man is a being 
whose social life is an organization arising from his growth 
as a self—as a being who thinks himself and so thinks 
others also in relation to self —is not to say that there are 
no factors in his social life due to the lower functions — 
impulses, emotions, instincts, etc. Man is also an animal. 
He has certain spontaneous tendencies company-wards, 
apart from his great capacity to think himself into con- 
1 These discussions deal only with what might be called the internal evi- 
dence of the course of man’s social history. The external or anthropological 
evidence would still remain to be cited. 
The theory of the ‘General Will’ as held by Rousseau, and especially as 
recently developed by Bosanquet (Philosophical Theory of the State), might 
well come in for estimation here ; it is a sociological theory, however, rather 
than a psychological one, and I hope to take it up shortly in another connec- 
tion. It may be said, however, that so far as it is psychological it might better 
be called theory of the ‘general self,’ and as such it has affinities with my own 
views (cf. Sect. 339, and the ‘ Introduction,’ § 2). Other writers who represent 
—and more explicitly so—a voluntaristic point of view, are Wundt, ‘ Logik 
der Gesellschaftswissenschaften’ in Zogzk, IL., ii, cap. 4, and Barth, Philos. 
d. Geschichte als Sociologie. See also the article (Baldwin-Stout) on ‘General 
Will’ in my Dict. of Philosophy. 
The ‘social contract’ theory has also been revived and given more adequate 
psychological basis in certain recent publications (De Greef, Jutrod. & la 
Sociologie; Fouillée, La Science sociale contemporaine). 
2 See as bearing on this point Sects. 142, 158 ff., 163, 319 f.

scious social life. This, however, if it were all he had, 
would lead to the sort of gregarious life called above 
“socionomic’; that is, in the main. This is what the ani- 
mals have. In its ¢yfe it is a life together, because it is 
natural for them to live together. It represents the 
‘instinctive’ and ‘spontaneous’ periods of equipment. 
This fully admitted,—that there is such company life 
among animals, — we yet find it different from the human, 
just as the child’s early spontaneous reactions — bashful- 
ness, organic sympathy, etc. —are different from his later 
reasonable and reflective attitudes. Yet the transition is 
gradual, as the springing up of the form of organization 
called the ‘self-thought’ situation is gradual. I have en- 
deavored to show the child’s progress in actually passing 
from the lower stages into the higher. So with the animal 
forms: they are mainly instinctive, somewhat spontaneous, 
a little reasonable — in the highest species, — xever ethical. 
If the individuals of a particular group have a germ of 
self forming within them, then their organization is becom- 
ing tinged with true ‘social’ value, though in its zype it 
remains still that of a ‘company.’ The criticism (Ell- 
wood) that I find here a break in the genetic line —an 
impassable gulf between animals and man—is contra- 
dicted by my whole view of the social life as a gradually 
developed thing emerging with the consciousness of self. 
Yet this continuity of development assumed, the point 
emphasized in the foregoing pages is the fact of a grow- 
ing and typical difference between that gregarious con- 
sciousness which mainly reflects fixed and unprogressive 
nervous functions biologically selected, and that conscious- 
ness which, becoming freed from these limitations, shows 
its capacity for the psychological organization which is
-P-A-G-E-552
  526 Social Matter and Process 
intellectual and ethical. To this latter alone I apply the 
term ‘society’; to the former ‘company.’! 
1 Criticisms of the view that the social matter is the ‘self-thought,’ turn 
largely on the necessity of recognizing the animals’ gregarious activities. 
This we may fully do; but the problem then still remains: how can we get 
human society with its characteristics ?— i.e., (1) reflective opposition to or 
confirmation of the gregarious impulses; (2) the universality and publicity of 
social duties and rights; (3) the peculiar ‘general’ will or self; (4) the insti- 
tutions in which these are embodied, notably the state. These things are 
so outstanding ! — man with his social history is so different from the brute 
with his physical heredity! —that the real need is to bring out the human 
factors, not to obscure them. See, for example, the inadequate outcome of 
the biological, as opposed to a psychological, naturalism of such a writer as 
Sutherland (Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct). 
It is singular that the teaching intended in the view that the ‘social matter’ 
is ‘thought’ should be so constantly misunderstood. Bosanquet criticises the 
theory as being too much a matter of repetition and imitation and neglecting 
‘thought’ (a logical principle sui generis) ; others (¢g., A. E. Davies, in 
Jour. of Philos., August 30, 1906) find ‘thought’ here a new and unnecessary 
‘principle’ All I mean by ‘thought’ is some kind of cognitive content or 
‘idea’ to give body and copy-for-imitation to the state of mind. Emotion or 
impulse, no matter how ‘gregarious’ or ‘ contagious,” would be blind, unor- 
ganized, and not capable of fruitful imitation, except for the idea or ‘thought’ 
which is its common kernel in different minds,

  CHAPTER XIII 
SoctaL MATTER AND Process: II. Soctat PRocEss 
§1. The Process of Social Organization: Imitation 
334. Upon the question of the process or method of 
social organization, with the type of function which it re- 
quires in the individuals, we need not stop long, seeing 
that all our developments have proceeded upon a cer- 
tain construction of this method and function, and have in 
turn also confirmed that construction. 
(1) We have pointed out that the growth of the indi- 
vidual’s self-thought, upon which his social development 
depends, is secured ‘all the way through’ by a twofold 
exercise of the zmztative function. He reaches his sub- 
jective understanding of the social copy by imitation, and 
then he confirms his interpretations by another imita- 
tive act by which he ejectively reads his self-thought into 
the persons of others. Each of these stages is essential to 
his growth as a person, and so also is it essential to the 
growth of society. For society grows by imitative gen- 
eralization of the thoughts of individuals. So we may 
give this as the main point of proof that imitation is the 
method of social organization. And in this statement again 
two positions are involved: first, that it is through imita- 
tion that the self-thought-situation in all its stages of 
growth and in all the individuals actually has its rise; and 
second, that it is by imitative selection and generalization 
that the individuals are integrated in the public self- 
thought-situation. 
527 
 
-P-A-G-E-554
  528 Social Matter and Process 
(2) Again, we have seen that it is just this point of 
view which is lacking in so many theories of social organ- 
ization. We have criticised both the ‘sympathy’ and the 
‘ideal’ theories on this score. Only when identity of self- 
thought is secured all through personal growth, can unity 
of trend of the social forces be secured; and this comes 
only through the imitative function. 
(3) The works of recent writers have depicted imitation 
as it is operative in society, and have conclusively estab- 
lished its universality from an objective point of view: 
notably Bagehot, Tarde, and Sighele. 
(4) Ina recent volume! the present writer has been led 
to the conclusion that the reaction of the imitative type is 
the original form of organic and mental accommodation to 
environment. However that may be in cases not now in 
discussion, the evidence given in our earlier chapters to 
show that the child actually comes into his social inheri- 
tance by imitative appropriation of the lessons of the social 
environment, makes it evident that here is an unmistaka- 
ble example of the ‘circular’ process which is explained in 
that work. The child imitates another, and so learns what 
is later to be a habit of action to himself. This is a step 
in each case toward his more complete accommodation to 
the social world. And his later actions, confirming, ex- 
tending, and modifying these acquired habits, only further 
illustrate the same process in the higher reaches of de- 
liberation, desire, volition, etc. 
(5) The assumption that imitation is the method of so- 
cial organization may, however, be brought to a further test 
in connection with the problem of social matter, since, after 
having determined the sort of matter with which we have 
1 Mental Development.
-P-A-G-E-555
    Lmitation 529 
to deal, we must then ask whether the imitative method of 
organization adequately explains the actual forms which 
this material takes on. To my mind a strong proof of the 
claim for imitation as type of social function is derived from 
the effective application of which we have seen it to be 
capable after the nature of the material is determined, as 
in the last chapter. It thus loses the casual empirical 
character which social observation so often shows, and 
becomes wrought into what may then be called, in a figure, 
social morphology. 
The last two considerations suggested lead us, however, 
to our next topic, z.e., the consideration of the sort of view 
of Social Progress we should have to hold if the two main 
results of our discussions proved to be true: (1) that the 
matter of social organization is thought which has the 
attribute of publicity springing from its attribution in 
the mind of the social thinker to a public self, and (2) 
that the method or type of function in social organization 
is imitation. 
§ 2. Mature and Function of Imitation? 
335. The discussions so far assume a certain definition 
of imitation, and also a distinction between the function 
itself and its exhibition in social life. By definition I 
understand imitation to be either (1) a process in which 
one individual uses another as a copy for his own produc- 
tion of something, whether or not he intentionally and 
consciously aims at the other as his model; or (2) the 
1 This paragraph is added (third edition) in view of certain criticisms 
which show that in the treatment above I have not explained with sufficient 
fulness the distinction between the psychological and social phases of 
imitation,
-P-A-G-E-556
  530 Social Matter and Process 
same type of function when that which is imitated belongs 
to the imitator himself instead of to another person. The 
first of these phenomena I propose to call ‘social imita- 
tion’: it is the sort of imitation described mainly by the 
sociologists (Bagehot and Tarde). Psychologically, the 
latter is that which is called the ‘imitative function,’ or 
‘psychic imitation,’ as mainly dealt with by the psychol- 
ogists (Royce; the present writer, in Mental Development). 
As type of function, this cannot be denied the name imita- 
tion, for the process of imitating a copy is precisely the 
same in the imitator’s consciousness, whether the copy 
arise in his own mind, or be introduced there by another 
person. But the social phenomenon is social simply and 
only because there are two or more persons necessary to 
the imitation, and hence the confusion arising from the 
failure to discriminate the two points of view. Psychologi- 
cal writers have been careful to mark off the sphere of 
‘self-imitation’ (by this term) from that of ‘social imi- 
tation.’ ? 
335 a. In the study of social process, it is clear, we may 
1 The purely neurological self-repeating function which in that work I 
called ‘organic imitation,’ is better known as ‘circular’ process. It under- 
lies, however, in my opinion, all the higher imitative functions. 
2 In the careful treatment of the terms ‘ Imitation,’ ‘Copy,’ ‘ Model,’ etc., 
in my Dict. of Philosophy, the topic is brought into line with others cognate 
to it under the headings ‘Mimetism’ and ‘ Resemblance’ (where the term 
‘mimetic resemblance’ —that in which what 7s resemed/ed is itself a factor in 
the production of that which resembles it—is made to cover both cases of 
imitation). The use of the term ‘instinct’ as applied to imitation is, I think, 
confusing. As used in my Mental Development, it means simply what is a 
native tendency or impulse, not an instinct in the sense of a function having a 
fixed form of reaction or expression. I now follow the recommendation of 
the Dict. of Philos., and call it the imitative ‘impulse’ — which I think, is 
native for the reasons I give in arguing the case in Mental Development. 
Cf. Groos, similar revised usage in this case, and also in that of the play im- 
pulse (Play of Man, p. 2).

take the point of view of social psychology —that of the 
question, by what mental process men actually are social 
and show social organization. But it is possible also to 
take the point of view of sociology —that of the question: 
What do I as an observer find going on between or among 
men who are socially organized? If one replies to the 
first question, ‘imitation,’ he means a different thing from 
his possible reply, ‘imitation,’ to the second question. By 
saying that the social process is imitation, I mean, for 
example, more than M. Tarde does, who speaks from the 
objective point of view. In short, the observer sees often 
what is not ‘social imitation’ going on about him; he sees 
opposition, invention, discussion, etc.; and often he sees 
in imitation less —he sees social imitations which are not 
productive at all for social organization. But from the point 
of view of social psychology, all of it may still be psychic 
imitation considered as a function of the individual’s life 
and growth. This is what I believe. It is, indeed, im- 
plicit in the foregoing pages, and is now to be brought out 
more plainly. 
We may approach the subject from the point of view 
of sociology, and ask for the limitations of the sociological 
theory of ‘imitation.’ These have been brought out by 
many recent critics. 
First, we are told that much imitation of one by another 
is not fruitful. This is true (see the criticism of M. Tarde’s 
view, Sect. 316, 1), but it may still be true that what is 
fruitful always involves psychic imitation (or even social 
imitation). This criticism holds only against the view that 
social imitation is always fruitful for social organization, 
which I think is far from correct. 
Second, we are told that although imitation may be
-P-A-G-E-558
  532 Social Matter and Process 
present, it is not that which is fruitful and essential ; (1) the 
recognition of another self, (2) the constraint or obedience 
enforced by another, (3) the compulsion of ideas, (4) the 
onward sweep of the social current, (5) the sharing of a 
‘general will,’ (6) the recognition of duties and rights, 
(7) a social contract —all these are urged, and urged by 
those who criticise the ‘imitation’ theory. 
Again, we may say, that this negative criticism, coupled 
with varied positive views, holds only against the theory 
that ‘social imitation’ is the essential and the only essen- 
tial thing. But admitting its force, we ask: Are any of the 
things mentioned as real social agencies — or all of them — 
sufficient without psychic imitation, without the exercise of 
the imitative function in the social individual? And we 
find that they are not. They all involve a form of social 
matter which can only have arisen, and can only be opera- 
tive in a social situation, through the imitative function. 
We may take them up in order. 
(1) The recognition of another self, or of many other 
selves. This is only possible when and because the self- 
thought has grown up through direct social imitation with 
the further use of the same thought by ejection, which is 
self-imitation. The self arises through the reinstating, by 
imitation, of a copy found in others, together with the 
reading back of the enriched self-copy into the others. If 
the taking over from you to me is imitation, how does the 
function differ when I carry over from me to you? If this 
be true to psychology, then the recognition of another self 
is an imitative function through and through. At any rate 
this is a position which is not touched by the criticism in 
question aimed at the ‘social imitation’ theory. 
(2) Constraint and obedience. Here the lesson taught,
-P-A-G-E-559
      
   
                                                      
            
            
       Imitation 533 
the task enforced, the obedience required, depends upon 
one’s accepting and acting on what one is told; and acting 
on what one is told is a form of self-imitation which is only 
one step removed from direct social imitation. Where is 
the difference in my function between doing ‘what I see 
you do and doing what I hear you tell me todo’? It is 
said the motive for the doing is different; and so it is. 
But it is the entire act which is or is not fruitful for 
social organization, not merely the motive to it. To be 
sure, the motive makes a difference; but the motive as 
such is not the criterion of its social availability. A 
whipped dog obeys from fear, and so may a whipped man; 
but the man’s act, motived by his fear, modifies or confirms 
his social status in his thought and in that of others; the 
dog’s does not (cf. Sect. 317, 2). So I hold that social 
constraint, all that compels and enforces, in so far as it is 
social and not merely ‘socionomic,’ is so through its accept- 
ance and assimilation; and this is then subject to the law 
of all social material that it be taken up by imitation in 
the social agent’s personal self-thought.t 
So it is also with the factors written above as (3) 
and (4): the compulsion of ideas and the social current. 
These get in their work as strictly social only through 
their acceptance and assimilation by the social agent. 
The valuable data of M. Durkheim’s book on Swicide can 
be fairly understood, I think, only on the supposition of a 
constant psychic imitation whereby the Leviathan, society, 
finds his roarings echoed in numberless cries, the voices of 
the individuals who are the organs of society —and this 
          1 A similar result appeared in the chapter on ‘ Sanctions’ (Chap. X.), where 
we found that social sanctions to be effective have to be taken up and ratified 
by the individual as ‘ personal’ sanctions.
-P-A-G-E-560
   
    534 Social Matter and Process 
in spite of M. Durkheim’s strenuous opposition to M. 
Tarde’s imitation theory. Only a social agent can be com- 
pelled to be sociable, and only he can be a social agent 
who is socialized. It may be true that social conditions 
compel a certain number of suicides a year; but it is also 
true that each man himself commits suicide — otherwise it 
is not suicide, but murder. One may say that I am wrong 
in finding that socialization proceeds by the one process of 
self-growth through imitation. It may be. But still this 
theory is not touched by the criticism which merely points 
out that social imitation is absent in this case or that. 
(5) Into the ‘general will’— postulated by others— 
in my opinion psychic imitation enters. To partake of 
a general will— or a general mind, or a general any- 
thing, if ‘general’ means in some sense ‘collective’ — 
one’s private will, self, mind, consciousness, must implicate 
others in a collective outcome. What is the good of a gen- 
eral will if the individuals do not reflect it? It is just of 
its essence that they do. But this involves some mental 
content not only common to their thought severally, but 
also thought by them as common. This is what I mean by 
‘publicity’; and I hold that this arises in a common imi- 
tative situation. A will is not collective simply when 2 
individuals agree in willing this or that. Each must will 
this or that as collective—as belonging to the  indi- 
viduals in the thought-situation in which he finds them 
implicated as he himself is. This implication of all in a 
common situation, by the thought of each, I think, is pos- 
sible only through the imitative development of the self- 
thought (cf. Sects. 323 f. and 329). This again may not be 
true; but the assertion of a general will is entirely incompe- 
tent unless one show how a general will is a psychological   
-P-A-G-E-561
  Imitation 535 
possibility and just what its genetic factors are. Rousseau 
and, more recently, Bosanquet make no effort to do this. 
The latter criticises imitation loosely, without seeing that 
the imitative functions may be utilized to derive the 
general will; in criticising me, he is hitting blows on 
the plate which this theory is placing over an exposed 
joint in his own harness. Yet in the main I indorse his 
criticism of the sociological imitation theory. 
The ‘status’ theories, which (6) hold to a recognition of 
duties and rights as the essential thing, and the ‘contract’ 
theory, which (7) hold to a social contract, both point out 
something in the main true, but not analyzed to its lowest 
terms. How are duties and rights possible ?— how is this 
or that status possible ?— how does man come to give his 
adhesion to the contract implicit in social organization? 
These questions I have endeavoured to answer by depict- 
ing the process whereby the individual, in growing to be a 
person — through the dialectic of his personal growth —is 
at once also a social person with a status and with duties 
and rights (see especially in Chaps. I., II., and VIII.). So 
also a social contract —in any sense. in which it exists at 
all —is the individual’s ratification of all that the status or 
social situation means. The view here developed supple- 
ments these partial theories. A genetic theory points 
out the origin of the developed social life with all its 
phases; and if my way of doing it be correct, psychic 
imitation is an essential mental process in it all. 
335 4. Our result, therefore, made now more clear 
from this review of criticisms, is that imitation is the 
method or process of social organization in two senses: 
(1) Ideas, inventions of all sorts, are actually propagated 
by the imitation of one man by another; but this is only
-P-A-G-E-562
  536 Social Matter and Process 
one step in their conversion into social matter. Merely 
this fact of social imitation does not necessarily make 
these things socially available. If so, my parrot would, by 
imitating me, come into a social status with reference to me. 
Another factor is necessary (2), ze. imitative assimilation 
and growth, whereby what is imitated is also organized in 
the individual’s own thought, and imitatively ejected into 
others, becoming part of a situation —a status-scheme — 
whose organization includes ‘publicity’ and ‘duties and 
rights.’ It is only this full view, not the first part of it 
taken alone, that I am concerned to defend.

CHAPTER XIV 
SociaL PROGRESS 
It has been shown already that there are two con- 
trasted functions involved in the progress of the thoughts 
which are socially available, seen respectively in the ‘ par- 
ticularizing’ done by the individual, and the ‘general- 
izing’ done by society. Both of these go on together, 
and give rise to the conditions which social life in all 
its complexity presents. We have called the individual’s 
thought the particularizing social force; he invents, con- 
structs, interprets, on the basis of the matter already 
current in society and administered to him through 
‘social heredity.’ And in society, as already organized, 
resides the generalizing social force; it reduces or gen- 
eralizes the inventions of the individual by integrating 
them in the public ‘self-thought-situation’ now described. 
The further question then arises: how and in what direc- 
tion is social progress determined under the interplay of 
these two types of social force? 
$1. The Determination of Social Progress 
336. The word ‘determination’ is used here after anal- 
ogy with the use of the same word in recent biological dis- 
cussions, in which the phrases ‘determinate variations,’ 
‘determinate evolution,’ etc., are of frequent occurrence. 
The analogy with the biological conception of ‘deter- 
537
-P-A-G-E-564
  538 : Social Progress 
mination,’ in respect to the movement of development, 
is very close; indeed, when due regard is had to the dif- 
ference of province in which the development occurs, we 
may say that the question set under this head in the two 
departments is the same. It is briefly this: do certain lines 
of growth, remaining consistently the same as respects 
characters, functions, or attributes, appear in the develop- 
ing content? Is there consistency of direction from stage 
to stage in the whole movement? And then, after such 
determinateness is once discovered, the further question 
at once arises: what determines the movement in this 
direction or that ? 
337. As soon as we look into the implications of the 
positions already taken, we find ourselves shut up, I think, 
to a very definite view of the determination of social prog- 
ress. The positions which immediately concern us now 
are three: (1) Individuals can particularize only on the 
basis of earlier generalizations of society. This gives an 
initial trend to the thought-variations which are available 
for social use.1 (2) Society is absolutely dependent, as to 
its new acquisitions, upon the new thoughts, particulari- 
zations, of individuals; and it again generalizes them. It 
can get material from no other source. (3) Only when both 
these conditions are fulfilled—when old social matter is 
particularized by an individual and then again generalized 
by society —can new accretions be normally made to the 
social content and progress be secured to the organization 
as a whole. Looking at these requirements together, and 
attempting to discover what sort of a general movement 
will result, we find what may be called the ‘ Dialectic of 
1 Cf. the section on ‘ Selective Thinking,’ Chap. III., Sect. 3, for the justifi- 
cation of this,
-P-A-G-E-565
    Dialectic of Social Growth 539 
Social Growth,’ an expression which is intended to sug- 
gest an analogy with the ‘ Dialectic of Personal Growth,’ 
already described. 
§ 2. Dialectic of Social Growth 
338. In the ‘dialectic of personal growth’ we saw the 
development of self-consciousness proceeding by a two- 
fold relation of ‘ give-and-take’ between the individual and 
his social fellows. Personal material, coming in the shape 
of suggestions from the environment, is first ‘ projective,’ 
as we called it; then it is taken over into the private circle 
of the inner life by imitation, and so becomes personal or 
‘subjective,’ as belonging to the ego; and then again by 
a return movement between the same two poles, also 
imitative in its nature, the characters of the subject are 
read into the alter personalities, so becoming ‘ejective.’ 
The various stages into which consciousness grows — 
becoming social, ethical, etc., by this one method of social 
give-and-take — have already been treated in detail; but it 
is interesting to see that this way of growing on the part 
of the individual consciousness may be stated in terms 
which reproduce in a very precise analogy the three re- 
quirements which we just found it necessary to lay down! 
as characteristic of the growth of society. We may say (1) 
that the individual reaches new inventions, interpretations, 
particularizations, zz his own personal growth, only on the 
basis of what he already understands of personality; that 
is, of what he has learned. Each step of his progress in 
understanding personality is a particularization in his own 
thought of old material, a personal interpretation, subjec- 
tive in its character. And (2) only those particularizations, 
1 Sect. 337.
-P-A-G-E-566
  540 Social Progress 
interpretations, inventions, thoughts of personality, are 
permanently available for his growth which he again 
ejects outward and finds to hold generally of others also; 
these are generalized as habits and stand as accretions to 
his growth. This last is also imitative, since only the 
imitable elements of his subjective thought are thus true 
and available in his treatment of others. (3) His ‘self- 
thought-situation ’ grows only when both these phases are 
accomplished together. Here, then, is personal growth 
quite accurately stated in the same terms as those which 
give the outcome of our detailed examination of social 
organization. 
I am not willing to leap to metaphysical or even logical 
conclusions on the basis of this analogy, striking as it 
seems to be, especially from the point of view of the 
requirements of idealistic philosophy. But we may at least 
use it as an analogy, and see its further bearings in the 
matter of the determination of social progress. 
339. Coming to make out the analogy in more detail, 
we see that society stands as a quasi-personality under 
a twofold relation of give-and-take to the individuals who 
make up the social group. It is related to these individ- 
uals in two ways: first, as having itself become what it is 
by the absorption of the thoughts, struggles, sentiments, 
co-operations, etc., of individuals; and second, as itself 
finding its new lessons in personal (zow socéal) growth in 
the new achievements of individuals. If we take any lesson 
which society learns, — any one thought which it adopts 
and makes a part of its organized content, — we can trace 
the passage of this thought or element through the two 
poles of the ‘dialectic of social growth,’ just as we can 
also trace the elements of personal suggestion, in the case 
 
-P-A-G-E-567
  Dialectic of Social Growth 541 
of the analogous dialectic of the individual’s growth. The 
new thought is ‘ projective’ to society as long as it exists 
in the individual’s mind only; it becomes ‘subjective’ to 
society when society has generalized it and embodied it in 
some one of the institutions which are a part of her inti- 
mate organization; and then finally society makes it ‘ejec- 
tive’ by requiring, by all her pedagogical, civil, and other 
sanctions, that each individual, class, or subordinate group 
which claims a share in her corporate life, shall recognize 
it and live up to it. 
Society, in other words, makes her particularizations, in- 
ventions, interpretations, through the individual man, just 
as the individual makes his through the alter individual 
who gives him his suggestions; and then society makes 
her generalizations by setting the results thus reached 
to work again for herself in the form of institutions, etc., 
just as the individual sets out for social confirmation 
and for conduct the interpretations which he has reached. 
The growth of society is therefore a growth zz a sort of 
self-consciousness!— an awareness of itself— expressed in 
1 Whether we hold that there is a ‘real’ general or social self seems to 
me to depend very much upon our metaphysical presuppositions. If we mean 
by a ‘real’ self a something back of the processes of growth and not expressed 
in the content of thought, then there is no reason for saying that there is a 
‘real’ social self. If, however, our meaning in speaking of a self be exhausted 
by just the thought-content with its organization and growth, then society may 
have a ‘ real’ self just as the individual has. Indeed, if a metaphysician should 
find it well to say on the strength of the analogous ‘ dialectic’ that there must 
be hovering over society an ‘I’ consciousness which integrates all the ‘me’ 
consciousnesses of the individuals, I think the contrast between the ideal ‘I’ 
and the habitual ‘ me,’ in the individual, would be in so far an available anal- 
ogy. M. Novikow (Conscience et Volonté sociales) thinks collective conscious- 
ness and will are realized in the socially é/te, who are the learned and (asa 
class) wealthy individuals; in them social experience is organized, just a8 
physiological processes have their organic centre in the brain,
-P-A-G-E-568
  542 Social Progress 
the general ways of thought, action, etc., embodied in its 
institutions; and the individual gets his growth in self- 
consciousness in a way which shows by a sort of re- 
capitulation this twofold movement of society. So the 
method of growth in the two cases—what has been 
called the ‘dialectic’ —is the same. 
§ 3. The Direction of Social Progress 
340. From these indications — which must in all cases 
be controlled by an appeal to fact—we see the direction 
in which social progress must move. The individual 
moves directly toward an ethical goal. His intellectual 
sanctions, it is true, tend toward a personal and egoistic 
use of his own forces and those of society; but that 
cannot go far, since, in its extreme, it runs counter to 
the co-operations on the basis of which the dialectic of 
his personal growth as such must proceed. The very 
growth of intelligence in the individual is itself a gen- 
eralizing process, and by this generalization, a measure 
of higher restraint is set on the elements which enter 
into the generalization.. The growth of intelligence must 
itself issue in those ideal states of mind which are called 
social and ethical and which set the direction of growth 
as a whole. The ethical sanction comes to replace and 
limit the sphere of application of the sanctions of desire 
and impulse; and so the individual gets, in his private 
life, a bent toward social co-operation and ethical conduct. 
So with social progress. The use of intelligence for 
the private manipulation of social agencies does actually 
represent a level of social institutional life;and in certain 
great departments of human intercourse —as especially
-P-A-G-E-569
    The Direction of Social Progress 543 
the commercial — relatively selfish ends, as seen in per- 
sonal competition of wits, seem to be the highest society 
has yet attained. But as with individual growth so here. 
As soon as the personal use of the individual’s wit brings 
him into conflict with either of the two necessary move- 
ments by which society gradually grows,— or with the 
institutions which represent them, —so soon must the in- 
dividual be restrained. And, further, the restraint is no 
more an artificial thing, an external thing, in society than 
it is in the individual. 
The social or communal growth shows the same ethical 
tendency for the reason, altogether apart from analogy, 
that the actual conditions in society are the same as in 
the individual. Society is, as we have seen, the generaliz- 
ing force. It reduces the thoughts which rise and claim 
recognition in its midst to forms of general acceptance 
and to working shape. The very institution therefore, 
which embodies the new idea and enforces it upon the 
individuals, is itself the work of the best individuals, and 
represents the restraint of the egoistic and personal sanc- 
tions in favour of social and ethical co-operation. 
Further, all the pedagogical sanctions of society, in the 
family, the school, etc., are brought directly and positively 
to bear for the production of those social forms of habit 
which confirm and encourage the development of tolera- 
tion, forbearance, and all the virtues which are of social 
value. 
341. There is, however, another and more profound 
reason that the direction of social progress must be 
determined by ethical and religious sanctions, and toward 
the goal represented by a state of ethical co-operation. 
It is to be found in the fact of what was called above the
-P-A-G-E-570
  544 Social Progress 
‘publicity’ of all ideal thought of personality. We saw 
that the individual cannot be a wicked or a good individ- 
ual in his own opinion —that is, cannot get a full ethical 
judgment on his own acts— without, at the same time, 
making his thought include the similar judgment passed 
by his fellow-men. His private self-judgment is a judg- 
ment based on the sense of a prevalent public judgment. 
The sense of the opinion of the public is an ingredient or 
element in the very synthesis by which the ethical judg- 
ment is constituted. Therefore, so far as the growth of 
his personality involves a general or ideal thought of self, 
so far is this self a public self whose thought is zpso facto 
the birth of a sanction of a public kind. The man says to 
himself: “I think thus of myself; other men think thus 
of me; I think thus of them when they are in my place; 
and all for the reason that what we each and all judge 
with reference to, is that ideal self which each of us only 
partially realizes. I partially realize it in my own way, and 
each of the others does in his own way; and it is by these 
partial realizations in concrete instances alone that this 
ideal gets its reality.” 
Now, we have seen that social growth proceeds by 
just this same development. Objectively, and in fact, it is 
seen in the actual publicity of social institutions and inter- 
ests. But the same result comes out if we take the point 
of view which we may call subjective to society itself. If 
we went so far with the analogy from the individual’s 
growth as to speak of society as a quasi-personality, and 
asked what thought such a quasi-personality would have 
to think in order to grow and to go on developing by the 
method of personal dialectic seen in the individual, we 
should say that society would have to think in a manner
-P-A-G-E-571
  The Direction of Social Progress 545 
which involves the publicity attaching to ideal and ethical 
personality. It would have to ask what institutions were 
good for its citizens as such, not what was good for this 
particular individual or that. Its thought of personality, 
all the way through, would be the form of general person- 
ality which is realized in the individuals at that stage; 
but which is not identical with any one of them. With 
this thought of general personality, there would go the 
thought, also, that the thought that it did thus think was 
the outcome of all the partial personality thoughts which 
the individuals thought, of all the judgments which they 
passed on one another ; otherwise the social quasi-person- 
ality would have no content out of which to constitute its 
general thought of self. 
All this is simply a realization in the community, in 
public opinion, of the ethical standards of judgment which 
the individual must have if he is to develop beyond the 
stage of concrete egoistic or altruistic intelligence or of 
impulsive action. That the individual does go further is a 
fact; and it is just the fact which we call ethical develop- 
ment. He has attained the form of general thinking 
about himself and others which carries with it sentiments 
of a social and ethical kind. This enables him to consti- 
tute society in a way which would be impossible if he had 
only reached the lower development of the animals, say, 
with the sanctions for action which go with this lower 
development. 
342. So when we come to ask what the direction of 
social progress may be, we find that it cannot be a direc- 
tion which violates the method and denies the meaning of 
those very states of mind—the ideal, social, and ethical 
states— which have enabled the individual to come into  
-P-A-G-E-572
    546 Social Progress 
his social relationships. The ethical sanction in the indi- 
vidual comes to control the other sanctions, since it gener- 
alizes and so transcends them. Society represents the 
embodiment of these generalizations. Its institutions both 
represent and further the individual’s growth. Its trend 
forward, then, must be in the line in which the individual’s 
higher growth also proceeds. This is the trend toward the 
complete regulation and use of the forces of the individual 
in the interests of social and ethical unity and co-operation.! 
Two things are accordingly true of the determination of 
social progress. These two things are these: first, social 
progress ts determined by the social generalization already 
remarked upon working upon the thoughts of individuals ; 
and second, ¢his form of determination is necessarily in the 
direction of the realization of ethical standards and rules of 
conduct. 
343. The example given above,? of Mr. A, who allowed 
barriers to be put up in his hay-field, also illustrates, when 
we come to consider Mr. A’s psychological movements, 
the fact that social progress is essentially an ethical move- 
ment. The taking of the general point of view involved 
the direct suppression of Mr. A’s personal sanctions, the 
securing of publicity of judgment, and the establishing of 
reciprocity of duties and rights between him and others, with 
respect to an ideal thought of personality —all of which 
characterizes the ethical sentiment. To take away his re- 
sponsiveness to ethical considerations is just to remove a 
man’s ability to act the good citizen in the responsible 
matter which the illustration supposes.

rise of individuals who erect such an ideal first in its personal form.

  Conclusion on the Biological Analogy 547 
It may be said that the insurance companies take the 
same point of view for the purpose of making money. 
And so they do. But that is only to say that social forces 
and situations may be used intelligently for other than 
directly ethical purposes, —a proposition fully maintained 
in the foregoing pages. The question as between the ethi- 
cal value of a proceeding and its intellectual value arises 
only when there is a conflict between the sanctions on 
which they respectively proceed. For example, if it could 
be shown that the insurance companies were impair- 
ing the ethical or even the financial interests of the com- 
munity or of its citizens, by faking money in this way, 
then the question of the social suppression of the com- 
panies would at once arise naturally among us. Or if the 
man A put up barriers in the United States, where the 
duty of doing so has not yet been enforced upon the re- 
sponsible parties, and exacted, let us say, such a toll from 
pedestrians as to yield him an income, then Mr. A’s action 
would have the intellectual sanction of being a money- 
making scheme, and possibly also —in case he really took 
the social point of view, and did it primarily to save human 
life — the ethical and social sanction as well. 
In short, soctety’s sanction ts always ethical to the indi- 
vidual, while it remains social; but individuals may take 
society's point of view from private and personal motives. 
§ 4. Conclusion on the Biological Analogy 
344. On the whole, then, we reach a theory of social 
determination! which makes it only to a slight degree 
analogous to the determination reached in biology. Bio- 
logical variations are determinate in the sense that their

  mean is shifted in this direction or that in each gener- 
ation from the fact that certain types of individuals are 
kept alivé in the earlier generation, z.e., those which 
could adjust themselves to the requirements of the envi- 
ronment in useful ways.!_ This gives determination to bio- 
logical evolution. In the social life we find practically no 
determination in the social direction extending to the indi- 
viduals considered as variations; and only the ‘suppression 
of the unfit’ after they are born. Yet in the primitive 
social conditions there must have been positive changing 
of the mean in social variation analogous to that just de- 
scribed as operative in biolbgy. 
But though there is this degree of analogy between the 
two determinations, there is the difference arising from 
the different sorts of heredity appearing in the two in- 
stances. In social organization the fruitful variation is not 
the individual as such, but his thoughts. This lifts the 
problem into the sphere of social heredity. Physical 
heredity generalizes or regresses toward a mean of all the 
individuals; while in the sphere of social heredity, the 
generalization made by society is of each new thought, 
invention, or sentiment considered for itself; and a single 
such social variation may revolutionize society and give a 
new bent to the social movement. 
345. On the whole, then, it follows from our study that 
the progress of society is, in its method, in its direction, 
and in its impelling motives, analogous to the growth of con- 
sciousness rather than to that of the biological organism. 
The current phrase ‘social organism’ is a defective one. 
1 Tllustrating ‘ Organic Selection’; see Appendix A, in the 1st and 2d edi- 
tions (now omitted: but see Development and Evolution, Chaps. VIII.-X.), 
Whether there be actual determination of variations as such in definite direc- 
tions is a disputed point; the evidence at hand is against the view that there is.
-P-A-G-E-575
Conclusion on the Biological Analogy 549 
If we mean ‘organization’ when we use the term ‘organ- 
ism,’ — leaving to further consideration the sort of organi- 
zation, — well and good. But to speak of the social 
‘organism,’ as the biologist speaks of the organisms with 
which he deals, is misleading in the extreme. The organi- 
zation which is effected in social life is, in all its forms, 
a psychological organization. Its materials are psychologi- 
cal materials: thoughts, with all their issue in desires, im- 
pulses, sanctions, consciences, sentiments. These things 
are incapable of any organization but that which finds its 
analogy in the actual growth of, living minds. To speak 
with Mr. Spencer of social atorns and organs, of organic 
processes and centres, of nerves of primary and second- 
ary order, etc., after analogy with the physiological organ- 
ism, is nothing short of violence to the nature of the 
material of social science. What can be done with such 
critical phenomena in social theory as imitation, generali- 
zation, invention, tradition, social and pedagogical sanc- 
tion, on such a crude analogy as that? To force these 
things into biological moulds is simply to deform them.! 
And where in the analogy from an organism shall we 
place the influence of ethical and religious sentiment, which 
becomes, in the highest reaches, the determining factor in 
social progress ? 
There are, on the contrary, two great compelling reasons 
for saying that the sort of organization which is effected 
in social progress is psychological. First, all organization 
is a function of the material organized. The biologist 
is the first man to admit this, now that he has given 
up the forms of vitalism which saw in vitality a force from 
1 Cf. the excellent remarks in M. Simiand’s article, pp. 497-498. 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  550 Social Progress 
outside, coming in to bend the life-processes this way or 
that. And a school of psychologists claim, as one of their 
greatest modern generalizations, the idea that mental activ- 
ity is just the movement of mental elements toward organi- 
zation ; not a force from outside working these elements up. 
To treat social organization after analogy with the growth 
of the physical organism, is to set to psychological materials 
a certain force of impulsion, over and above the movement 
which they show in their own natural theatre and in their 
own natural forms of growth. 
Second, the actual growth of social organization shows 
principles and methods which have a meaning to us only 
because we have minds. Such are those just mentioned 
—suggestion, imitation, sentiment, etc. We get at the 
meaning of these things in our own personal growth. We 
build up our understanding of character, both our own 
and that which we think our neighbour to have, just by 
these principles. So when we see social organization 
going on, we say: “This is a phenomenon of imitation, 
that of suggestion, this again of invention, and the other 
of sentiment.” Indeed, the outcome of all our study has 
led us to the view that social progress is essentially, in its 
method, a reproduction of the growth of the individual; 
and the individual grows up in the social circle only be- 
cause it is so akin to him that he is able to reproduce it in 
himself. 
345 a. Yet with social competition in certain of its forms 
—inter-group competition being perhaps the most im- 
portant case—we have socionomic forces guiding the 
movement and determining the social type by the laws 
of selection and survival (cf. § 2 of the ‘Introduction’ 
and Sect. 313 a).

PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS 
CHAPTER XV 
RULES oF ConpbucT 
Tue practical questions which come up in connection 
with the relation of the individual to his social environ- 
ment are of the greatest importance. We should expect 
the discussions which attempt to throw light on the social 
organization, by means of an examination of the equip- 
ment and development of the individual, to throw light 
also on these practical matters; for all of an individual’s 
actions are sanctioned either by the conditions of his 
private growth and equipment or by the regulations of a 
social kind to which he submits. So if we use the ex- 
pression ‘rules of conduct’ as covering all practical for- 
mulations of whatever kind, then we may make some 
deductions respecting them from the principles already 
set forth. 
346. At the outset, a general truth seems to be estab- 
lished by the discussions through which we have come; 
the principle, namely, that a// rules of action for the guid- 
ance of life must be of possible social application, even though 
in their origin they are announced and urged by individ- 
uals. This would seem to follow from the fact that society 
is the generalizing agency. Therule, considered asa rule, is 
55
-P-A-G-E-578
  552 Rules of Conduct 
of general application. Its generality may be considered 
with reference to the particular individual’s own conduct , 
that is, as coming to him with his personal sanctions only. 
Or it may be considered as general in the sense that it is 
enforced on all individuals alike ; that is, as having social 
sanction. Or, finally, a rule of conduct may have the 
quality of publicity already discussed, which makes it at 
once a thing of universal sanction, as typified in the ideal 
rules of ethics and religion. It may be well to take up 
these three cases, and look at each of them with a view to 
seeing its relation to the sort of generalizing which seems 
to be the source of all rules of conduct considered as social. 
In other words, we may show in some detail that the state- 
ment made above, to the effect that all rules as such are 
capable of becoming social in their nature, applies to each 
of these three cases. 
§ 1. Rules in the Sphere of Impulse 
347. First, considering the rules for action and conduct 
which embody the individual’s personal sanctions, we find 
the sorts of action already pointed out in detail: the 
impulsive, the intelligent, and the reflective or ethical. 
Of these the impulsive type of action may be disposed 
of without much trouble. Impulsive action can have no 
self-regulation simply because its sanction is necessity. 
Necessity knows no law, no rule, because it is itself an- 
other name for inviolable law.. There can be, therefore, 
no question of a law of action to the individual who acts 
purely from impulse. Capriciousness is his rule—and 
that is not a rule. So the only regulative or legislative 
restraint to which such action may be brought is that
-P-A-G-E-579
  Rules in the Sphere of Impulse 553 
which comes either from the actor’s higher sanctions, 
those of intelligence or conscience, or from the sanctions 
of a social kind which are enforced upon the actor. This 
takes us, therefore, up into the higher realms of conduct. 
348. The same may also be said concerning possible 
rules of conduct on the part of society at the impulsive or 
so-called suggestive stage. The mob exhibits social im- 
pulse, but it has no rule of action save that of suggestion ; 
and suggestion has no law. Its sanction, again, is not a 
rule, but only the necessity which hurls the mob over a 
moral or legal precipice. 
The only possible law or sanction which can be brought 
to bear on the mob is that compulsion which is enforced 
at the point of the bayonet or the muzzle of the gun. So 
we may not stop further on this sort of action in our 
search for rules. 
So much, I think, we may confidently say, despite the 
attempt of certain recent writers to deduce from the action 
of crowds a ‘social ethic’; a set of formulations or rules 
which shall express the laws of collective human action. 
We have seen above that the only principles involved in 
mob-action, and collective action as such, are those of the 
lower impulsive order, carried to the extremes which throw 
into temporary abeyance the higher intelligent and ethical 
sanctions of the individuals involved. This reversion from 
social continence to social passion brings about so great a 
simplicity in the operation of suggestion that no further 
‘ethic’ of it is possible. What these writers seem to reach 
is a statement of the causes or favouring conditions under 
which this sort of ‘social hypnotism’ of the individual 
comes about. So we may not delay upon these cases; 
but pass on higher up in the sphere of action in order
-P-A-G-E-580
  554 Rules of Conduct 
to ask there our question as to whether all rules of conduct 
are of social availability. 
§ 2. Intelligent Rules 
349. The sanction of intelligent actions — that is, of 
those which involve desire — we saw to be mainly success. 
And it would seem that there might be rules of action 
addressed to this motive alone, embodying the highest 
wisdom, which would yet be unsocial. Such rules would 
be those dictated and sanctioned entirely by prudence, 
discretion, convenience, expediency, or the attainment of 
happiness. Such actions do, as we have seen, represent a 
period in the life of the child, and also a type of adult de- 
velopment as concerns individual actions and certain forms 
of social competition. And we may at once say that such 
rules do exist in the maxims of practical wisdom current in 
all societies and embodied in the proverbs of all nations. 
Making this admission, it still remains to ask, however, as 
to the possible social element in such formulations. 
The foregoing discussion brought out the real conflict 
which occurs between the individual and society at this 
point. It is unnecessary to bring that up again. But it 
is a character of the conflict that it concerns the excep- 
tional individuals, or the exceptional acts of normal indi- 
viduals, as we were led to conclude in the earlier place. 
As to the latter, the exceptional acts or judgments of the 
man of normal social training and sobriety, it is enough, 
from the point of view of the question of rules, just to say 
that they are exceptional. The individual himself con- 
siders his conformity to social sanctions the rule, and the 
violation of them the exceptions.
-P-A-G-E-581
     Intelligent Rules 555 
So soon as he makes the violation of the sanctions of 
society the rule, — adopts rules of his own which lead to 
their systematic violation, — he then falls in the other class, 
the exceptional individuals. 
Now in this class of exceptional individuals we may 
make distinctions. The men who are exceptional from a 
strictly social point of view, illustrated under the head of 
‘social variations,’ are those who violate social rules habitu- 
ally and as such; these are suppressed, made away with, 
out of the consideration of society and out of our theme. 
Even the exceptional individual must be, in the main, if 
he will inherit a social part and play it as a man, not excep- 
tional. And if we rule out the people whom society rules 
out, and these only, we have left the people whose endow- 
ments or training make them, in certain respects, lawgivers 
to themselves and to society. What shall we say to these? 
Has their rule of action any social ingredient? 
As far as such a man’s actions — thus sanctioned by pri- 
vate intelligence —do not conflict with social institutions, 
requirements, etc., so far they may be socially general- 
ized and made socially available. In so far the sanction 
of intelligence then gets support from the social sanction 
also. This we saw in the case of commercial competition. 
And this must be essentially the character of the individ- 
ual’s intelligent rules. For so soon as he attempts to 
make use of his intelligence in a way which is strictly 
private, — aiming at an end quite his own, and not sub- 
serving social utilities, then he inevitably comes into 
conflict with society in the carrying out of his rule. In 
real life, a man’s actual rules of private intelligent self. 
interest are usually qualified by a social clause; they read: 
“ Act to your own advantage so long as. society does not  
-P-A-G-E-582
  556 Rules of Conduct 
find you out, and with as much temerity as you have.” 
His rules have direct social and ethical limitations. So 
for the first sort of generality which we supposed a man’s 
action possibly to have — universality in his own private 
life —this is largely fictitious, even in its stronghold, the 
sphere of the intelligent sanction. He admits the social 
limitations under which he may observe it, in case it be a 
socially damaging line of conduct which it prescribes; and 
he admits its liability to be generalized for social utili- 
ties, in case it is not a damaging line of conduct. In 
this latter case, it comes under our formulation as being 
socially available; and in the former case it is not a rule 
in any universal sense. The one case is illustrated by the 
maxims of social prudence, the ‘saws’ of society, as well 
as by the larger things of intelligent co-operation and 
utility which have arisen at first in the single inventive 
thought of one man, and have then been generalized by 
the process already described. The other case is best 
illustrated by the rule of action of the acute thief who 
escapes the law. He acts with a rule of intelligent self- 
interest, but under certain very evident social restrictions ; 
and with those ethical limitations, also, which are indi- 
cated in the motto, ‘there is honour among thieves.’ If he 
observe both these restrictions, again, however, strictly 
from self-interest, making success in stealing his sole 
reason both for observing the law and for honouring the 
rights of his fellow-thieves, then he is that sort of a crimi- 
nal exception to social law which society shuts up for life 
when he is caught; and his rule of action, though con- 
fessedly a rule, is as unavailable for general theory as is 
the impulsive action which has its law in natural neces- 
sity.
-P-A-G-E-583
  
Intelligent Rules 557 
350. As to the social formulation of the sanction of 
desire, little need be said. From the very fact that it is 
social, it comes under our formula. The only cases which 
might give room for discussion would be those in which 
social intelligence makes devices for other than social 
utility and advantage; as, for example, the life-insurance 
companies, commercial trusts, ‘combines,’ etc. But we 
have already seen that as soon as these devices become 
sufficiently damaging to society, they are no longer toler- 
ated publicly ; that is, the social element of sanction comes 
to suppress the private. As to the question of possible 
tules of action, therefore, the only universal rule in these 
cases is the generalized rule which in the earlier con- 
nection was shown to be the point of view of society. 
The intelligence cannot lay down its rule of success as 
a general rule, since the constant call to conformity to 
social and ethical requirements it is which gives to 
such organizations their sole right to the sort of public 
exploitation on which their patronage and success de- 
pend. 
Any real conflict in this realm between rival rules 
would arise from a conflict of two sanctions both equally 
social: the one mainly intellectual, and the other mainly 
ethical. And there are many interesting cases of such 
conflict. Indeed, there are writers on Political Economy 
who claim that that science is unethical in practice; that 
a state can have no conscience nor obligation arising from 
sympathy or humanity, and that legislation properly takes 
account of the fortunes of ‘our’ citizens, no matter at what 
damage or cost to ‘yours.’ This is a practical formulation 
of the intellectual sanction in its social form; and repre- 
sents that stage of culture in national life which the intel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-584
  558 Rules of Conduct 
ligent highwayman represents in private life. Political 
economy may be developed, like private economy, on the 
basis of rules which are only intelligent, — success being 
the only sanction for conduct, — but for a nation to apply 
such a political economy is simply to admit that the in- 
dividual citizens who represent the moral sense of the 
nation have not yet reduced their choicest sanction to 
social form; and that in the highest sphere of social 
organization, the ethical, their intuitions have not yet been 
generalized. 
This case deserves attention, moreover, from the fact 
that all of the defensive and aggressive, most of the 
productive and distributive, and much of the directly 
educative organization? in the world is actually at this 
stage. Intelligent action, with its sanction, has been re- 
markably generalized in political and industrial life. On 
the other hand, the development of our judicial systems is 
in the direction of the same adequate embodiment of the 
ethical sense in national life. Yet the absence of inter- 
national law— while there are yet the remarkable trade 
relations and refined rules of diplomacy which tax the 
intelligence of the acutest minds on this side and on that 
—shows the very backward development of the ethical 
sanction in institutions. 
1 The American tariff for protection and alien labour laws are cases in point. 
2 My colleague and friend, Professor H.C. Warren, held, in a paper read in 
the Psychological Seminary, that the forms of social organization were based on 
three ultimate motives to action, — defence, nutrition, education, —and I use 
this division in my text. I am not prepared, however, at present, to accept 
the classification as exhaustive. Reproduction, for example, might be consid- 
ered as a candidate for a distinct place. 
8 Even the relapse into barbarism seen in lynch law in the South has its 
darker counterpart in indifference to crime, or in its intellectual justification, 
as seen in the literary defences of anarchism.
-P-A-G-E-585
Ethical Rules 559 
§ 3. Ethical Rules 
351. Coming, then, to the ethical or, more widely, the 
sentimental forms of conduct, we have a more complex 
question of rules. And looking at the problem from the 
point’ of view of the three sorts of generality which a rule 
may have, we may waive certain of them at once. The 
ethical sense — taken as typicai and inclusive of the reli- 
gious, zsthetic, etc.—cannot sanction a rule of private 
generality only ; since all ethical conduct, as such, has the 
public reference. A man cannot have a line of conduct 
which is right for him alone; the very bounds of the right 
are coincident with the bounds of the general self-relation- 
ships which include all concrete selves. All those who 
are excluded are exceptions, no matter how great their 
number. When he pronounces judgment upon himself, 
he judges with all men. This has been dwelt upon suffi- 
ciently already. 
As to the second form of universality, — giving a rule on 
which all may act, —this also does not alone exhaust the 
sort of sanction which ethical rules have. We can imagine 
a form of society built on the basis simply of a system of 
conventional social rules which each citizen is always to 
observe.1 This would be strictly a social sanction; the 
rules would be civil; they might be compulsory, but they 
need not be ethical. Such a society would lack just the 
one thing which we have found essential to human society 
considered as a progressive organization ; the thing omitted 
by the traditional theories of human society which liken 
law to convention, and conformity to cowVenience and 
1 Plato’s conception may be recalled here; and the criticism of it by 
Aristotle in the Politics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-586
  560 Rules of Conduct 
utility. This lack is just the principle of growth: the 
give-and-take of personal influence between the man and 
the group. Society has grown by this process of give-and- 
take. So also has the individual grown by it. But in the 
individual it is what we mean by his ethical growth. The 
give-and-take is now in the sphere of the ideal thought of 
personality, and its exhibitions are motived by this ideal 
thought. So the society which results is also an ethical 
society. Its institutions are generalizations of ethical rela- 
tionships. And as in the individual the ethical sanction 
has come to replace and control those of intelligence and 
impulse, so in society also ethical sanctions supersede 
those of intelligence, convention, and mob-suggestion. 
So, apart from its actual realization in society, of which 
more is to be said below, the ethical rule is not only a rule 
which all men are to follow, being social in so far; it is 
also the rule which embodies the ethical sanction which 
has been so far developed. The individual’s ethical deliver- 
ances are from the platform of social sentiment. The 
average individual’s ethical judgments include the social 
requirements of his group. He says, ‘I ought,’ meaning, 
also, not only ‘he and she ought,’ but ‘ what we ought is the 
lawful.’ The ideal lawgiver, the self of general value, is 
the communal legal self. 
Such an individual, whose ‘ought’ is exhausted by the 
legal, is possibly below the average, numerically speaking ; 
for the moral education! of most men gives them other 
and higher embodiments of the ‘ought’ of personal duty 
than law or public opinion represents; but that does not 
impair the general truth that the legal, conventional, 
1 And in many communities notably the religious education.
-P-A-G-E-587
  Ethical Rules 561 
standard seen in public opinion and law is also somebody’s 
ethical ideal, or has been; it could never have come to be 
the legally or conventionally right, if it had not first been 
somebody’s ethically right. The growth of society is but 
the generalization of the individual’s ethical ought into 
society’s conventional ought. And then it proceeds by 
generalizing the further acquirements of the ethical ought 
in the individual; acquirements made only by conformity 
to the legal ought, and the transcending of it. For society 
to make a rule is to generalize the ethical opinion of indi- 
viduals; for the individual to get an ethical rule is for him 
to particularize on the basis of society's conventional rules. 
The conclusion, therefore, is this: that (1) ethical rules 
are either already embodied in the sanctions of society, or 
(2) they are capable of being so. In the former case 
(1) the individual’s rule is his version of the social voice. 
To him it is ethical; not only must all men observe it as 
law, they must observe it also as right. They do observe 
it for these two reasons — both of them. And the socially 
legal is society’s version of the individual’s right. In the 
latter case (2) the individual legislates his rule equally 
both into other individuals and into society; but, as a 
matter of fact, his legislation of it into society is not yet 
realized ; society has not yet generalized his sense of right. 
352. It may help us to get clearness of view in this 
matter by appealing to the analogy of the individual’s 
growth, to which we have found that of society to bear so 
close a resemblance. The individual’s, z.¢., the child’s, 
sense of law is reached through a twofold relation to the 
personalities about him. His sense of the personality in 
which law is embodied represents a sort of generalization 
of his particular thoughts, and also a sort of midway stage 
 
-P-A-G-E-588
  562 Rules of Conduct 
between those personal actions which he understands and 
those which he is still to imitate and grow up to. His 
‘projective’ ethical personality includes all his generali- 
zations, but it is not exhausted by them. And his further 
generalizations of the elements of this personality are 
conditioned upon his assimilations of them to what he 
already has. 
So with society over against the individual. Society 
represents what is-already generalized of the individual’s 
intuitions of ethical right. But the further ethical intui- 
tions of right, on the part of the individuals, are not 
exhausted in these social generalizations. On the con- 
trary, it is only as the individuals attain new intuitions and 
announce them that society can generalize them in turn 
in new institutions and in laws.! 
So, finally, we may say that the ethical rules of the 
individual involve all three kinds of generality. They are 
to apply (1) to all the acts of the individuals, (2) to the 
acts of all individuals, and (3) they are to have the pub- 
licity which attaches to the ethical sanction as such. But 
they are sanctioned in the individual’s case by only one 
sanction: Ais own ethical sense. He is to act impulsively, 
but not because it is impulsive; reasonably, but not 
because it is reasonable; socially, but not because it is 
prescribed. He must act always and only because it is 
right. The right comes to the individual to sum up the 
three, and to give all his conduct its final sanction. 
He can recognize no other. But then the formulation of 
1 Our progress in administrative matters illustrates this: ‘civil service 
reform’ gradually coming to be general; the rule of the ‘boss’ gradually 
disappearing; municipal reform movements gradually purifying city govern- 
ment, etc.
-P-A-G-E-589
Tepe eT RET ren nn a anata Cee 
Ethical Rules 563 3 
this sense of right, its generalization, is directly in the line 
of the social prescriptions. So, in the outcome, che social 
and the private duty of the man are in essential harmony. 
353. It remains to ask whether society’s ethical is ever 
at variance with its own socially prescribed. This would 
seem from what has been said to be a superfluous ques- 
tion; for if the social sanctions arise from generalizations 
of the individual’s ethical intuitions, then there could 
be no socially ethical apart from what is actually pre- 
scribed. But this, although on the surface logical, 
does not do justice to the complex way in which society 
grows. We saw that society’s attainments are not made 
by jumps. Its generalizations involve long processes of 
social education on the part of the individuals. Often a 
generalization is reached only to be again called in ques- y 
tion. The law of majorities is peculiarly liable to mis- 
carry. A single individual may often wield authority 
enough to carry or to obstruct a social movement. There 
are ebbs and flows, actions and reactions. So there grows 
up in every society a certain discrepancy between what 
the people feel ought to be, and what really is. New 
things are agitated ; their consequences are not fully seen; 
the conservative spirit says ‘Let well enough alone.’ And 
the very generalizing process by which society reaches 
her enactments suggests a certain discounting of the new. 
Further, there is a great derangement of interests in- 
volved in every important social change,! and a great 
series of divisions in the occupations, conditions of educa- 
tion, etc., of this man and that; so that all are not equally 
competent nor willing to indorse a particular course of 
public action.

Again, there often grows up, through the discussion of 
remote topics, a sort of ethical sense that an old institution 
is out of date; while yet no man arises to think the case 
through, and take the lead in urging reform. These in- 
fluences crystallize to make the reformer very often a man 
of one idea and an offence to the socially satisfied in the 
community, who for no other reason refuse to follow him. 
In fact, changes of an important socza/ kind often burst 
with sudden and overwhelming force. Their preparatory 
stages are obscure, and their influence dumb. They area 
part of the ethical intuition of individuals; and the com- 
munity of them is not fully suspected until the prophet of 
the new thought comes to give it public voice. Then the 
‘ought’ of society shows itself to have already surpassed 
the ‘is,’ and the reformer becomes at a step the historian 
of a social revolution. The question is simply as to the 
exact moment when the new thought is sufficiently spread 
to realize itself in a social generalization. When it does, 
then it is no longer merely the individual’s ethical; it is 
then also the community’s ethical; but until it is actually 
made a part of what is socially recognized and sanctioned, 
there will remain in reference to it a certain discrepancy 
between what society ought to do and what it does. 
354. Another very interesting case of discrepancy be- 
tween the social ‘ ought’ and the social ‘is’ is found in the 
phenomenon of contagion of crime already referred to in an 
earlier place. The fact that the report of a peculiar form 
of suicide, for example, spread abroad by the newspapers, 
stimulates other persons not only to the act of suicide but 
even to the adoption of the same peculiar form of self- 
destruction, shows the phenomenon clearly. There are 
epidemics of crime of this sort or that. A suggestion of
-P-A-G-E-591
The Final Conflict 565 
a criminal sort will spread through a community; and a 
sensational story will excite the readers, both young and 
old, to perform the crimes with which the narrative con- 
cerns itself. 
In such a case as lynching, for example, society really 
condemns, by its better public utterances, the crimes 
which society commits and propagates; just as in the case 
of collective action, more properly so called, society after- 
wards recovers her judgment and passes a more normal 
and withal a more righteous sentence. In these cases we 
have the social ought-judgment temporarily suspended. 
A series of social facts or events occur which in no wise 
represent the real ethical voice of the community. This 
is a phenomenon of regression,! just as the other case of 
antithesis (spoken of in Sect. 353) is a phenomenon of 
forward movement or real growth. It is not surprising, 
from what we now know of the organization of the social 
body, that these phenomena should occur. 
The ordinary meaning, however, of the saying that social 
institutions ought to be different, is something quite other 
than this; it is the expression of the individual’s ethical 
judgment. That introduces another and the last consider- 
ation to be brought forward in this matter of rules of con- 
duct. 
§ 4. The Final Conflict 
355. In an earlier connection we noted that all possible 
conflicts, of a general kind, which might arise between the 
individual and society, are conflicts either of his intelli- 
gence, or of his ethical sense, with the social order. We 
1 That is, of ethical regression, not —as we saw above — of reversion to an 
earlier type at one time normal; such action could never have been normal, 
   
-P-A-G-E-592
566 Rules of Conduct 
  saw also that conflicts arising from his intelligence were 
largely reducible to conflicts between the intelligence of 
him and the conscience of the rest of the community; 
inasmuch as the social order represents the generalized 
ethical sense. The only way for a man to carry out his 
protest, in such a case, is to persuade other men, until he 
gets his opinion adopted. Then the conflict ceases, since 
then the reform which he proposes receives ethical and 
social sanction. But in the case of the ethical protests of 
single men against the social order, we have a different 
phenomenon. 
This sort of conflict is more serious and more profound, 
because the sanctions involved are more comprehensive. 
The ethical in the man represents the essential and highest 
outcome of his individual nature; this on one hand. The 
socially established represents the highest outcome of the 
collective activities of man; that on the other hand. What 
then can be done, in the case of conflict between these two? 
Nothing! Nothing can be done. 
It is the case of the fountain running higher than its 
source. The man cannot argue; morality is not a thing 
of logical sanction. And, moreover, to argue a violation 
of law —in serious cases —is to commit it, in the eyes of 
society. Yet society, on the other hand, cannot suppress 
such a man, although too often that is what results. For 
it is just through the ethical reformers that society learns 
her own mind and heart. It is the picture, which history 
shows, of the seer on his mountain. He speaks in riddles. 
He stands and waits. He weeps. To be sure, he may be 
no genuine great-man; he may be a fanatic, a lunatic, a 
fraud, — but, then, he may be a prophet, a seer, a teacher 
of nations!
-P-A-G-E-593
The Final Conflict 567 
This ts the final and irreducible antinomy of society. It 
shows at once the law of social growth, its direction, and 
its goal. It shows the dialectic of growth in its concrete 
social form, as in the child’s obedience we see it in its 
concrete private form. Society must simply listen to such 
a man, for her weal or woe, as the child listens to his 
father. The insight is on the seer’s side. But in listening 
to him, and doing with him, she is reaching for her own 
by right. He is of her, she has made him, he clothes her 
thought in a diviner form. So the child takes from his 
father. He takes the social heritage which is his by right 
of birth. He takes from his father, and so lifts himself 
to his father’s stature, just as society takes from the great 
man and so makes his insights her own. 
If we bring this finally under the question of rules, we 
reach a last possibility: that in the ethical realm the 
individual may rule himself by rules which are in advance 
of those which society prescribes, and also exact them. This 
is common, not only with the moral seer, but in the life 
of us all. 
All of us have our moral discontentments. We all 
think that society should be reformed in certain essential 
respects. Just to this degree each of us is moved to 
prescribe a rule of conduct in this case or that; since the 
publicity of the ethical judgment carries just this sort of 
prescription. The reason we have also sufficiently seen. 
It arises from the particularizing of the individual, work- 
ing as an active force in the social complex, and from the 
uneven way in which society realizes her progress, in this 
respect or that. Even different requirements of the same 
general principle or rule remain at different stages of 
realization in social institutions, and in the formulas of
-P-A-G-E-594
  568 Rules of Conduct 
public opinion; so that the individual, in making his rule, 
finds that society violates it here and there. The incon- 
sistency of the social order, from a moral point of view, 
is very apparent, and many pages might be devoted to 
giving illustrations of it. Just as the individual is often 
condemned for law’s sake, so society is often ‘damned for 
conscience’ sake.’ 
Yet we are able to see that both cases are incidents of 
the larger movement which our discussions have led us 
to appreciate; a movement which includes the individual 
with his oppositions as well as his agreements, and society 
with her achievements as well as her omissions.
-P-A-G-E-595
  CHAPTER XVI 
RETROSPECT: SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL 
Ir only remains to state, in certain formal sentences, 
some of the more general conclusions to which we have 
come; those having especial reference to the relation of 
the individual to society. 
356. I. The examination of society reveals a body of 
rules of conduct with sanctions which are in the main 
adequate for the private life of the individual. This fol- 
lows from the fact that the institutions and sanctions of 
society are in their origin actually generalizations of the 
intellectual and ethical knowledges, sentiments, and sanc- 
tions of individuals, handed down by social heredity. 
357. Il. The examination of the individual gives rules 
and sanctions which are in the main adequate for the social 
life. This follows from the fact that the knowledges and 
sanctions of the individual are received from society by 
social heredity. 
358. Ill. Neither of the above principles ts absolute. 
(a) It cannot be absolutely true that the examination 
of society gives rules and sanctions adequate for private 
life; since only the generalized part of human life is em- 
bodied in institutions. The individual must have his 
private rules of conduct for the situations of life which 
are particular to his knowledge and action. This brings 
his private rules into possible conflict with society to the 
569
-P-A-G-E-596
  570 Retrospect: Society and the Individual 
extent to which he is original in his thinking and in his 
sentiments ideal, or the reverse. 
(6) It cannot be absolutely true that the examination 
of the individual gives rules and sanctions adequate to 
the social life; since the strictly average individual, who 
would correspond to the generalizations which society 
embodies, is mythical. Every individual is, in some de- 
gree and in some respects, socially untypical.! 
An illustration of ITI. (4) is seen in the development of 
high intelligence in criminal persons; and an illustration 
of III. (2) is seen in the intelligent development of society 
in industrial and political life, while its ethical institutions 
lag behind the moral sense and moral rules of individuals. 
359. IV. The principles just formulated find their ground 
in the method of progress of society. 
(a) The method of progress of society ts a dialectic, analo- 
gous to the ‘dialectic of personal growth’ in the child and 
man. This ‘dialectic of social growth’ is a circular 
movement of give-and-take between society and the indi- 
vidual. The form of collective organization cannot be social 
(general) without having first been individual (particular) ; 
and the matter of social organization cannot be individual 
(particular) without having first been social (general). 
There must always be, therefore, at every stage of social 
progress, a balance of ungeneralized form in the indi- 
vidual, and a balance of unparticularized material. in 
society. And the rules of the one cannot express the 
balance found on the side of the other. 
1 Readers of Mr. Leslie Stephen’s Science of Ethics will remember his 
position that the ‘ properties’ of society cannot be inferred from those of the 
individuals, since either may vary independently of the other (/oc, cit, pp. 
93 ff.).
-P-A-G-E-597
Retrospect: Society and the Individual 571 
  (6) The determination of social progress is ethical in its 
direction and tn its goal. It involves a publicity of values 
which only the ethical category shows. The generaliza- 
tions which society effects can proceed only as individuals 
act ethically. And individuals can realize new intuitions 
of an ethical kind only because the material already social 
is again capable of taking on ethical form. 
(c) A final conflict of an ethical kind between the indi- 
vidual and society ts always possible. It is soluble only by 
the actual growth of society itself in the particular case, or 
by the suppression of the individual who revolts. And 
society solves it only to renew it, always. 
360. V. Finally, our outcome may be gathered up in 
a sentence of characterization of society as a whole. 
Society, we may say, is the form of natural organization 
which ethical personalities come into in their growth. So 
also, on the side of the individual, we may define ethical 
personality as the form of natural development which indi- 
viduals grow into who live in social relationships. The 
true analogy, then, is not that which likens society to a 
physiological organism, but rather that which likens it to 
a psychological organization. And the sort of psycho- 
logical organization to which it is analogous is that which 
is found in the individual in deal thinking. :

APPENDIX D' 
THE GENESIS OF SOCIALITY 
PROFESSOR G. A. TAWNEY, of Beloit College, in a review of my work 
on Mental Development, in the International Journal of Ethics, July, 
1897, pp. 520 f., gives what in his view would be the derivation of sociality 
in the animal consciousness, provided we assume only the tendency to 
‘circular’ or ‘imitative’ reaction in creatures which actually live together. 
He says: “Let us imagine two primitive organisms, A and B, existing 
in the immediate vicinity of each other. A is approached by some 
hostile object X, with which B also at some time or other has had to 
do. -X approaches A, and B’s glimpse of him revives his own past ex- 
periences with him. There is revival of pain, fear, and movements of 
flight on B’s part. [These movements would be substantially the same 
as those also being executed by A.2]_ Suppose, however, that this flight 
does not suffice to relieve B of the sight of X approaching, and, let us 
say, attacking A, so that no movement puts an end to the revival ex- 
periences of B. Excitement, which means heightened discharge, gives 
rise to variations of movement, and all the time the movements of A 
are setting copies from without for the reactions of B. The law of imi- 
tation implies that B’s conduct under such circumstances will resemble 
A’s ultimately. Let us again suppose that together they succeed in 
driving off X, and enjoy together the feelings of relief, z.e. pleasure, 
which follow. Here is a copy in the direction of co-operative conduct 
set for future imitation. Perhaps such copies would in time grow 
numerous, and through tradition become the social habit.” 
This illustration makes, I think, the true suppositions, and with some 
differences of detail, I am able to accept Professor Tawney’s use of it. 
I should say — speaking of the unreflective sociality of the animals — 
that if A and B live together and react imitatively to common experi- 
ences, that in itself produces sociality. For (1) B, seeing A act as he 
also has acted in the presence of X, has reinstated in him thus the 
memory-copy-system, however simple, of his own earlier action, and 
reacts imitatively on this. This is just the objective reaction of sympa- 
thy, and becomes subjective sympathy, as different from real experience 
of the same kind, in so far as B comes to realize a distinction between 
this case and that in which he is himself threatened by X. (2) The 
1 The Appendices A, B, and C are omitted from this edition, as the topics are in- 
cluded in the other publication, Development and Evolution (1902). The lettering 
of the remaining Appendices is allowed to remain the same as in the earlier 
editions. 
2 Added by the present writer,  
-P-A-G-E-600
  574 Appendix D 
actual sameness of conduct, whether produced as above by B's sight 
of A’s action, or directly by the same X-experience in both A and B, 
produces results in a measure co-operative. This, I take it, is sufficient 
for the operation of natural selection, which on this basis produces 
‘colonies’ of similar creatures. But in such experiences it would be 
quite artificial to suppose that no memory of the struggles, cries, en- 
deavours, of A would linger in the consciousness of B as.a part of his 
copy-system of the situation for future action. Yet if such elements 
do enter into his memory-system, then on future occasions it would be 
only to reinstate his requisite imitative copy for him to enter actively 
into similar co-operations. This again would be a great gain in the 
actual possibilities of united action, and would again survive in the 
struggle for existence. (3) Whenever the situation depicted by Adam 
Smith’s illustrations was realized, —cases involving the sight of both 
an aggressor and an aggressee, with their respective claims upon the 
onlooker, B, for sympathy, — the creature whose shape, movements, pos- 
tures, cries, etc., were like those of B would be the one which would 
supply B’s copy-system, and the one with which his co-operations would 
arise; that is, the animal of the same kind. So subjective sympathy 
would be at once a ‘consciousness of kind,’ and the objective reactions 
would be indications of ‘kind.’ 
So I hold that actual life together, of creatures having the tendency 
to circular or imitative reaction, results inevitably in sympathy, co-opera- 
tion, sociality of the sort found in animals apart from fixed instincts ;+ 
and it is actually carried on by tradition.?_ Moreover, all the while, the 
species is accumulating variations by the aid of organic selection, and 
so special co-operations gradually take on the instinctive forms found in 
gregarious animal ‘ companies.’ 
1 The biological necessity for the full organization of the sexual instinct at 
a very early period makes it unlikely that that is to be looked to for the germ 
of the social tendency, in the sense that in sexual sociality the animal formed 
his lessons in tolerance and co-operation. The evidence collected by Top- 
inard, already referred to (Sect. 139, note), goes to show the widest variation 
as between family life, springing from sexual needs, and general sociality. 
Yet a distinction may be made between sexual sociality in general and the 
restricted and more exclusive form of it found in family life. This Topinard 
recognizes in saying that polygamous animals are more ‘social’ than monoga- 
mous (Zhe Monist, January, 1897, p. 250). 
2 Darwin notes that after the acquisition of a fortunate co-operation by cer- 
tain individuals, imitation could be counted on to spread it abroad and keep 
it going (Descent of Man, I., pp. 157-159).
-P-A-G-E-601
  Appendix E 575 
In man, who goes on to organize experience in the form of a self, 
the ‘dialectic of personal growth ’ produces the distinction between ego 
and alter; and reflective sociality takes the place of the spontaneous 
and instinctive forms. As Dr. Tawney says in the same notice: “ The 
sense of subjectivity develops as the reflex of those established habits 
of social co-operation and organization which have already been formed ; 
the social consciousness is the sense of self in relation with other 
selves.” 
The attribute of ‘ publicity,’' which has its genesis as the crowning 
social outcome of the ‘dialectic of personal growth,’ is also summed 
up so neatly by Dr. Tawney in the same place, that I may quote it, at 
the same time not taking space to make the qualifications under 
which the developments of the earlier pages would support just the 
formula which he attributes to me. He says: “ The law of Kant, ‘So 
act that the principle of your conduct may be fit for universal law,’ is 
to the individual, subjectively speaking: ‘So act that all the members 
of the social group to which you belong, i.e., all your other selves, 
may know your conduct without pain to yourself.’”?

The Meanings of Self: the Reality of Self. F.H. BRADLEY. Chaps. 
IX.-X. of the work ‘Appearance and Reality.” London, Swan 
Sonnenschein & Co.; New York, The Macmillan Co., 1893. 
Mr. Bradley distinguishes eight meanings of ‘Self.’ He criticises 
them all and finds the following outcome. Nowhere is there any con- 
tent of consciousness which is consistently and always called ‘Self.’ 
There is the anthropological self, a cross-section of consciousness, 
Hume’s bundle of present states — which changes, of course. There is 
the organized self of thought which proceeds upon ever-new materials 
of organization. There is the quasi-permanent self of memory and 
personal identity : but what is it-that is permanent? There is the 
sentient self which finds itself subject to the contrasts, fluxes, relativi- 
ties of feeling, and so on. The actual process of reflection on self is

  576 Appendix E 
depicted by Mr. Bradley in an analysis which is wonderfully acute and 
obviously true; a landmark, I think, in the history of that enigma, the 
so-called ‘rational subject.’ He depicts a perpetual ego-play of content- 
elements over against one another in their relation of subject and object. 
At one time a certain arc in the trajectory of consciousness assumes 
the réle of self over against another arc which it takes for its object. 
Then, at another time, the ego-section slides further around, so to 
speak. But however long you chase it, it is always part of the trajec- 
tory, part of the content — the ego is; and the object is another part. 
And the unity which contains the whole play, this is the only unity there 
is. It is aunity of feeling. Always, there is a fundus of feeling. This 
ego-play I find to be very truly described ; try as one will to reflect on 
self, he finds a content — that which is at that moment claiming to be 
the subject — setting itself over against another content and calling it 
‘me’; and just as soon as one tries to find out what this subject-content 
is, he is able in a measure to doso; which means that that content has 
now taken the place of the object-content, and so is no longer I, but has 
become me. And all the time there is a ‘feeling’ of the whole play, 
and of the background, as itself upholding the I and linking it into 
some sort of unity with the me. 
The same analysis holds, says Bradley, also for the ‘active’ self — 
the self of volition and desire. It seems possible to turn upon any 
element in the self that desires, and desire zt to be different; that is, 
to treat it as a not-self upon which the action of the self desiring is to 
terminate. This leads to a subtle deduction of the sense of self-activity, 
which is shown to be due to change in content. For example, the I 
which desires finds in its object new elements of content fit to be in- 
cluded in the me, and by its expansion to include these elements it sets 
itself over against its former I-elements, thus converting them into ob- 
jective me-elements. This expansion and shifting of content-elements 
through which certain constant I-elements are present — this is felt as 
self-activity. Even when the elements reached out after as fit for I- 
elements are not explicit, —7z.e., when there is no explicit desire, — even 
then self-activity is felt. This is due, Bradley thinks, to the implicit 
presence of these elements already in the original I-content, but in such 
a way that the entire content as a group is inhibited by the explicit 
elements. The release of this inhibition is then felt as self-activity. 
This deduction, it is clear, is capable of either a Herbartian or a 
Wundtian construction (see notice of Mackensie’s paper below); it 
assumes, with both Herbart and Wundt, conscious self-activity beneath 
the threshold of explicit desire. With this assumption I do not agree.
-P-A-G-E-603
  
Appendix E 577 
There is really no warrant for any such sort of self-activity. Con- 
sciousness bears witness, on the contrary, to a very clear aloofness of 
the I-content from both the members of the change of content taking 
place in a ‘me’ which is not the object of desire. Note the case of 
involuntary attention with its distractions, and the changes wrought in 
the me content by hypnotic suggestion: these have no feeling of self- 
activity.1_ Nor has the progress of a purely objective ‘train of ideas.’ 
And even in the instance of blind unratified impulse, there is a feeling 
of ‘run-away’ in the machinery, of lack of self-implication, which is due 
not to the implicit presence of the elements which are explicitly pres- 
ent in desire, but to the weakness of another content which is ex- 
plicitly desired. This latter content is inhibited and overcome, and 
the undesired takes place because of the reverse outcome of the same 
process as that of explicit desire. Mr. Bradley holds the necessity 
for some content-element ideally held for realization; but, in saying 
that after all it may be implicit, he seems to give up his analysis for 
the sake of accounting fora myth. The idea said to be implicit is really 
a part already of the old felt content; otherwise there is mere change 
—not activity — in which the felt content maintains itself successfully 
against the ideal content. Hence the sense of incompleteness, disap- 
pointment, relative irresponsibility, in such activities, e.g., as saying ‘1 
will not consent, and consenting. Put in symbols, there seems to be 
little difference here between Mr. Bradley’s view and mine. But he, 
in fact, finds self-activity felt towards what is not desired; I rather 
find activity, largely not that of self, felt toward that which inhibits 
what is desired. In the concrete cases which psychology actually 
knows it makes a difference.” 
1Cf. my volume on Feeling and Will, Chap. XII., §§ 3-6. 
2 With this criticism of Mr. Bradley’s view the following remarks made by 
him in his second edition (p. 607) should be noted, seeing that they show 
more agreement than I had supposed: “ But that I failed to be clear is evident 
both from Mr. Stout’s criticism and from some interesting remarks by Profes- 
sor Baldwin in the Psychological Review, Vol. 1., No. 6. The relation of felt 
activity to desire, and the possibility of their independence, and of the priority 
of one to the other, is to my mind a very difficult question ; but I should add 
that to my mind it is not a very important one. I hope that both Mr. Stout 
and Professor Baldwin will see from the above that my failure was to some 
extent one merely of expression, and that our respective divergence is not as 
great as at first sight it might appear to be. As to the absence of felt self- 
activity in certain states of mind, I may add that I am wholly and entirely at 
one with Professor Baldwin.” The reader should look up Mr. Bradley’s new 
statement. 
 
-P-A-G-E-604
  578 Appendix E 
This analysis of self-activity—or any other which proceeds upon 
what Mr. Bradley calls ‘the end in the beginning’— shows itself im- 
portant in relation to the doctrine of imitative development worked 
out by recent writers. The object of desire, explicit or through habit 
implicit, is set up for realization. This is what I have called a ‘ copy 
for imitation’ in my theory, such a copy as an imitative view of volition 
requires. It seems then that this citadel of actus purus, this fount of 
originality and unrelated self-determination, is also capable of a natural 
construction. The pedagogical applications are very important. For 
‘self-activity’ is talked of so freely nowadays as the goal of educa- 
tion —and so it is— that it is well to show that it is after all through 
imitation that the training process must proceed even in order to make 
our scholars inventive. 
The other chapter of Bradley’s —‘The Reality of Self’ — proceeds 
to show that in such a shifting self, constructed out of changing con- 
tent, we have no right to find reality. Itis appearance only. This 
involves the further doctrines of reality, appearance, change, etc., and 
is too far-reaching for further notice here. 
Mr. Bradley's View of the Self. J.S.MAckENSIE. Mind, N. S. IIl., 
July, 1894, pp. 304-335. 
Mr. Mackensie gives an account of the chapter on the Self of Mr. 
Bradley's book, and criticises it on the score of certain omissions. 
He classifies Bradley’s meanings of ‘self’ under four heads —-the 
‘biological,’ the ‘psychological,’ the ‘sentient,’ and the ‘ pathological’ 
self —and claims that two other forms of ‘self’ must be added, called 
by him the ‘epistemological’ and the ‘ontological’ or ‘ideal.’ The 
epistemological or transcendental self is the form of the thought-pro- 
cess, the focus at which the variety of experience is brought to unity 
in thought. It is the Ego of the cogito and is not a matter of content ; 
thus escaping Bradley’s reduction of the various selves to particular 
constructions of content. In psychological terms, I suppose, this self 
is the function of apperception considered as unifying principle of 
thought. The other ‘self’ added by Mackensie is the ‘ontological’: 
again the formal principle of unity, but now considered as the unity of 
reality or completed system — the ideal unity of ‘the completely intel- 
ligible for the completely intelligent.’ Both these points are familiar 
to readers of Caird. 
As to the matters of fact involved, I think Mr. Bradley is not well 
1 See also Royce’s paper noticed further on.
-P-A-G-E-605
  Appendix E 579 
criticised. The question arises, how does ‘form’ come to conscious- 
ness? If not as content, we have to say, then not at all. But if not 
at all, then it must be itself a matter of thought-construction. For how 
can we say ‘experience when thought has the form of unity’ except 
by the use of judgment, which must go back again to conscious-content 
for its matter? So the ‘transcendental ego’ becomes either the Kant- 
ian noumenon, or reduces itself to the ‘sentient’ self of Bradley, z.e., 
as I should put it, it is a matter of sentient or felt content over and 
above the presented content of which it is felt to be the form. In 
this shape it loses much of its mystery and is amenable to the same 
natural-history treatment as other facts of consciousness. And the 
‘ontological’ or ‘ideal’ self is subject to the same sort of criticism. 
If there be no real ego discovered in the cogito, apart from the felt form 
of the cognitum, then we have no basis for an ideal ego discovered in 
an ideal cogito apart from what we feel the form of the ideal cognitum 
would be if we were able to apprehend it. Then presupposing abso- 
lute reality, the ideal ego will be an absolute sentient ego —an ego 
which feels its own perfect content. 
Ido not know whether Mr. Bradley would accept this bald argu- 
ment to a conclusion near his own. It certainly is much briefer than 
his. And Iam sure that Mr. Mackensie and his master would say: 
“not a word about ‘reason’ — which is a ‘higher level’ than intellect.” 
But of the points still left in current idealism for Mr. Bradley’s prob- 
ing-knife of psychological analysis, this is the most inviting. I believe 
that reason is feeling, and its ideals are feeling — the onrush of habit and 
emotion in their own out-reaching movement beyond the constructions 
of intellect which they presuppose. This is reason’s nature and his- 
tory. It is Bradley’s splendid service to have shown that reality is as 
much reality when felt as when judged — possibly more, if the pros and 
cons of the relation of feeling and thought to each other be duly 
weighed. 
The External World and the Social Consciousness. JOSIAH ROYCE. 
Philos. Review, \1., pp. 513-545, September, 1894. 
The thesis maintained by Professor Royce in this interesting paper 
is this: “Social community is the differentia of our external world. 
. . . A child never gets his belief in our present objective world until 
he has first got his social consciousness.” The arguments presented by 
the author in support of this view are of twokinds. He first shows- 
that the ordinary so-called tests or criteria of externality are not 
valid or sufficient, inasmuch as they omit the quality of définiteness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-606
580 Appendix E 
  All things believed to be external are definite in place, dimensions, 
number, and movement. But what we really mean by definiteness is, 
when analyzed, communicableness to others; what I cannot express to 
my fellow and ratify together with him — that is not external, but inter- 
nal. The notion of externality therefore proceeds upon the sense of 
social relationship or community. Apart from the question of proof, 
attention may be called to Professor Royce’s acute note on Renouvier’s 
thesis, ‘Whatever is must be determinate,’ and to the use he makes 
of the sense of -indefinite movement in after-images quoted from 
Fleischl, In what is said in this part of the paper we have, I think, 
a very original and interesting contribution to the theory of externality. 
It lacks, however, detailed criticism of the criteria usually named, 7.e., 
resistance, regularity, involuntariness, etc., of the external world. I 
myself, for example, should not feel driven out of my view of the ‘coeffi- 
cient of external reality’1 earlier worked out, even though the whole 
account of the social consciousness given by Professor Royce should 
prove true. This appears in the general point of criticism made below. 
In the second part of his paper, the author gives a summary of a 
theory of the rise of the social consciousness based upon the doctrine of 
imitation, z.¢., a theory with which the present reviewer is in sub- 
stantial agreement. The essence of the theory is that the child 
gets his material for the personality-sense from persons around him 
by imitation. So that his growing sense of self is constantly behind 
his growing sense of others. This conclusion affords the additional 
argument that it is through this relationship that the antithesis be- 
tween self and the external is discovered and the community made 
possible in which the external world finds its differentia. 
The one criticism which I should venture to make upon this paper 
—as attractive in style as thoughtful in content — is that it neglects 
the phylogenetic point of view, the considerations from race-history. 
I think the element of social suggestion may be admitted to the full as 
Professor Royce argues for it, and yet the conclusion not follow that the 
child would not get the notion of externality without it. No more 
should I say that the child would not get a notion of self without the 
imitative copying of others which we agree in emphasizing so strongly. 
Would not the hereditary impulses of thought and nervous action give 
an isolated babe a pretty good apology for an external world and a 
self? To say, ‘yes, but not the same he now has,’ is only to say 
that the social element is an addition. Certainly it is; but is there no

  Appendix F 581 
essential moment in externality which must be either there or not there 
toa child? 
I think there is: something in the structure of the developed ner- 
vous system. The seeing of space itself may carry externality in 
presented objects: not not-self-ness, of course, but blank, definite, 
awayness — da-ness, so to speak. It is the property seen in the nervous 
projection of stimulations to the periphery. Little chickens seem to 
have a very respectably definite sense of da-ness, and this without com- 
paring notes with one another or with the hen! Now this sense of 
projection may be the essence of external existence vs. internal — 
although the antithesis comes only later and largely by social develop- 
ment—and it may be that the elements even of personal suggestion 
which the child imitates already have it.1 Indeed I think it can be 
shown that they have. It is on this basis that I recognize, in my 
‘coefficient of external reality,’ an element which constitutes this kind 
of objectivity, and make the ‘objective’ stage first even in the child’s 
knowledge of other persons. 
An interesting speculation would arise if Professor Royce should 
work out the social criterion in the phylogenetic sphere ; by applying it, 
for example, to the quasi-social community of the different senses to- 
gether —a test of externality strongly insisted upon sometimes. If so, 
I should ask him how it has come about that a single sense often so 
strenuously lies to us about externality, in the face of all sense and 
social testimony, that we have to lie to ourselves, almost, to keep back 
our belief in it. If it be because this function, say, of this sense is a 
part of habitual convention and former beliefs which are themselves 
guaranteed, then that illustrates what I should say was the case with 
each organism as a whole with reference to other organisms.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES 
1. THE general position involved in the ‘ dialectic of personal growth,’ 
to the effect that early consciousness is objective, and that it is by the 
distinction among objects, which gives persons as first projective, that 
1 Cf. the section on ‘ Personality Suggestion’ in my volume on Mental De- 
velopment, and Chap. VI., § 2, above, where it is pointed out there that there 
is a period of ‘ organic’ bashfulness in the child’s first year — showing a special- 
ized nervous reaction to the presence of Zersons.
-P-A-G-E-608
  582 Appendix F 
subjective consciousness arises, would seem to have support from the 
argument made by Professor Héffding in his Outlines of Psychology, 
pp. 2f. He holds that the results of philology are safe in showing 
that names of subjective states of consciousness, mental conditions, 
attributes, etc., are from roots which originally designated objects and 
events in the objective world. He further uses this result from philol- 
ogy to disprove the older theory of personification, which held personifi- 
cation to be the original mould for the conception of the external world. 
He is not willing, however, to throw over the personification theory 
altogether in favour of the ‘dream’ theory of the origin of the belief in 
ghosts, spirits inhabiting objects, and spiritual agencies in nature; for, 
he thinks, even if the notion of spirits did arise through dream-per- 
sons, yet unless there were a fundamental personifying tendency, the 
dream-persons would not be understood to be personal (p. 8), nor 
would there be any reason for the primitive man’s reading of them into 
the phenomena of the objective world generally. This seems to me 
quite true ;} and yet it is difficult to see whence this personifying ten- 
dency could arise in the primitive man’s mental growth, especially if he 
began with a purely objective consciousness. The solution offered in 
my ‘dialectic’ (cf. the section on Religion) fulfils all the requirements 
thus laid down by Professor Héffding ; and more, the imitative method 
of growth explains the origin both of the subjective-personal and of 
the ejective-personifying consciousness. The subjective is an imitative 
interpretation of the objective in terms of internal feeling; and the 
ejective is an imitative interpretation of objective action in terms of 
the subjective. The truth of the dream theory would then seem to be 
somewhat this: that in dreams primitive man found actual concrete 
and quasi-social confirmation for the personifying or ejective interpre- 
tations which his own growth led him to make, at the same time join- 
ing with his actual social life to furnish materials for his personal 
subjective interpretations. Dreams, and ghosts, and spiritual portents 
thus led him on his way into the realm of mystery which filled so large 
a place in his religious development.” 
1 Indeed, Professor Héffding’s treatment of this, and also of the child’s 
personal development (pp. 5 f.), with the insistence on the truth of recapitu- 
lation, seems to be lacking only in that it stops short of the growth of the 
social self under social stimulation. Even the social dream by primitive man 
involves some social experience; and the child’s social experience begins fur- 
ther back than his social dreams. 
2 Avenarius makes the dream consciousness an important factor in the his-

2. I think there is evidence from philology, moreover, of the eject- 
ing or personifying tendency ; to be found in our references to the more 
abstract and hidden processes of nature whose naming followed the first 
crude descriptions made in the objective period. For example, we 
speak of the chemicals as agents ; of drugs, as having virtue ; of natural 
forces, as being virdle; of poisons and acids, as eating; of machines, 
boats, etc., as she or her ; of putrid things, as s¢vong ; of colours, as gay, 
oud, etc. ; of weights and electric circuits as dead and ‘live’ — to enu- 
merate a few of many instances at hand. 
3. I have endeavoured to find evidence as to the place of personifica- 
tion in primitive language, by looking into the growth of gender dis- 
tinctions, thinking that the distinctions of gender could not have been 
embodied in the names of natural objects (particularly as between the 
personal genders and the neuter) without some mental, tendency to 
personification. But the authorities on comparative philology seem 
entirely at sea, both as to the history of gender distinctions and as to 
the linguistic purposes which gender (especially the neuter) really 
serves. In support of this I may refer to the résumé given by 
Professor Brugmann in his ‘Princeton Lecture’ on ‘The Nature and 
Origin of the Noun Genders’ (New York: Scribners, 1897).1 
4. As illustrating the necessity for distinguishing the different forms 
of ejective personal thought which arise in the growth of the religious 
consciousness, so-called ‘ fetishism’ and ‘ totemism’ may be mentioned. 
I am not competent to go into the controversy as to the place of fetish- 
ism in early religion, whether it be a degraded or a primitive form; but 
it may be noticed that the arguments urged pro and con by Max Miiller 
and the followers of Waitz turn really upon the sort of mental reading- 
in which so-called personification supposes. As a primitive form, ante- 
dating polytheism, it would represent only that beginning of ejective 
personal consciousness which we see in the child when personal sug- 
gestion with social vapor, but without distinguishing whose suggestion 
or rapport with whom, is the extent of his sense of society. It seems 
torical process of ‘introjection,’ using the exposition of Tylor’s ‘ Primitive 
Culture’ (Mensch. Welthegriff., pp. 32 f.). 
1 The tendency is to discount the ‘psychologizing’ explanation attempted 
in Grimm’s law. Yet whether in primitive language there is a period in which 
inanimate objects have names either exclusively neuter, or lacking entirely in 
the marks which are used to denote sexual differences—this would seem to 
be a ‘live’ problem, and its answer, whatever it be, of great value to the 
anthropologist and psychologist.
-P-A-G-E-610
  584 Appendix F 
>» 
to me most likely that the fetish is a symbol, or terminus of reaction, 
for this sort of vague social community with an undifferentiated spirit 
world. 
The totem, on the other hand, seems to stand for a much more 
advanced self, a self of some reflective generality ; and to be the 
embodiment of the ‘socius’ consciousness of the group — the family, 
the tribe, the race. As such, it would involve a certain distinction 
between what is private to the individual, and what is public to the 
group, which we have found so marked in the child’s social develop- 
ment at the very beginning of his growth into real moral personality. 
5. Does not Edward Caird’s masterly exposition of the develop- 
ment from ‘objective’ to ‘subjective,’ and finally to ‘absolute’ religion, 
require essentially the psychological movement seen in Avenarius’ 
‘introjection’ when supplemented by the imitative motive, as in the 
‘dialectic of personal and social growth’? I may refer the reader 
especially to Caird’s summary, pp. 188 ff., Vol. I. of Zhe Evolution 
of Religion. His ‘absolute’ religion, representing the final result of 
reflection and embodying Mr. Caird’s metaphysics, does not lend itself 
so readily to objective genetic interpretation. Without referring to 
that, therefore, I may yet call attention to the use his development 
makes of what Romanes, from a more psychological point of view, calls 
the ‘world-eject,’ considered in its objective and subjective religious 
embodiments. 
6. Apropos of Sect. 140, the following passage may be quoted 
from Tylor : — 
“There survives even now in the world a barbaric mode of bring- 
ing land under cultivation, which seems to show us man much as 
he was when he began to subdue the primeval forest, where till then he 
had only wandered, gathering wild roots and nuts and berries. This 
primitive agriculture was noticed by Columbus. When landing in the 
West Indies he found the natives clearing patches of soil by cutting 
the brushwood and burning it on the spot. ... In Sweden this brand- 
tillage, as it may be called, has lasted on into modern days, giving us 
an idea what the rough agriculture of the early tribes may have been 
like when they migrated into Europe. . . . In long-past ages much of 
Europe was brought under cultivation by village communities. The 
move upwards from the life of the hunter to that of the herdsman is 
well seen in the far north—the home of the reindeer. Among the 
Esquimaux the reindeer are only hunted. But Siberian tribes not only 
hunt them wild, but tame them. . . . Here is seen a specimen of pas- 
toral life of a simple rude kind; and it is needless to go on describing
-P-A-G-E-611
  Appendix G 585 
at length the well-known life of higher nomad tribes, who shift their 
tents from place to place on the steppes of central Asia, or the deserts 
of Arabia, seeking pasture for their oxen and sheep, their camels and 
horses. There is a strong distinction between the life of the wander- 
ing hunter and the wandering herdsman. The hunter leads a life of 
fewer appliances or comforts, and, exposed at times to starvation, his 
place in civilization is below that of the settled tiller of the soil. But 
to the pastoral nomad the hunting, which is the subsistence of the rude 
wanderer, has come to be only an extra means of life. His flocks and 
herds provide him for the morrow; he has valuable cattle to exchange 
with the dwellers in towns for their weapons and stuffs. There are 
smiths in his caravan, and the wool is spun and woven by the women. 
What best marks the place in civilization which the higher pastoral life 
attains to, is that the patriarchal herdsmen may belong to one of the 
great religions of the world: thus the Kalmuks of the steppes are 
Buddhists ; the Arabs are Moslems. A yet higher stage of prosperity 
and comfort is reached where the agricultural and pastoral life combine 
as they already did among our forefathers in the village communities 
of old Europe just described.” — TyLor, Anthropology, 219 f.

APPENDIX G 
DARWIN’S JUDGMENT 
THE main consideration which this paper! aims to present, that of the 
responsibility of all men, be they great or be they small, to the same 
standards of social judgment, and to the same philosophical treatment, 
is illustrated in the very man to whose genius we owe the principle upon 
which my remarks are based— Charles Darwin; and it is singularly 
appropriate that we should also find the history of this very principle, 
that of variations with the correlative principle of selection, furnishing 
a capital illustration of our inferences. Darwin was, with the single ex- 
ception of Aristotle, possibly the man with the sanest judgment that the 
human mind has ever brought to the investigation of Nature. He rep- 
resented, in an exceedingly adequate way, the progress of scientific 
method up to his day. He was disciplined in all the natural science of 
his predecessors. His judgment was an epitome of the scientific in- 
sight of the ages which culminated then. The time was ripe for such 
1 From the Pop. Sci. Monthly, August, 1896, p. 532. Cf. Chap. V., above.
-P-A-G-E-612
  586 Appendix G 
a great constructive thought as his — ripe, that is, as far as the accumu- 
lation of scientific data was concerned. His judgment differed then 
from the judgment of his scientific contemporaries mainly in that it 
was sounder and safer than theirs. And with it Darwin was a great 
constructive thinker. He had the intellectual strength which put the 
judgment of his time to the strain—everybody’s but his own. This is 
seen in the fact that Darwin was not the first to speculate in the line of 
his great discovery, nor to reach formulas ; but with the others guessing 
took the place of induction. The formula was an uncriticised thought. 
The unwillingness of society to embrace the hypothesis was justified 
by the same lack of evidence which prevented the thinkers themselves 
from giving it proof. And if no Darwin had appeared, the problem of 
biological development would have been left about where it had been 
left by the speculation of the Greek mind. Darwin reached his conclu- 
sion by what that other great scientific genius in England, Newton, 
described as the essential of discovery, ‘patient thought’; and having 
reached it, he had no alternative but to judge it true and pronounce it 
to the world. 
But the principle of variations with natural selection had the recep- 
tion which shows that good judgment may rise higher than the level 
of its own social origin. Even yet the principle of Darwin is but a 
spreading ferment in many spheres of human thought in which it is 
destined to bring the same revolution that it has worked in the sciences 
of organic life. It was not until other men, who had both authority 
with the public and sufficient information to follow Darwin’s thought, 
seconded his judgment, that his great formula began to have currency 
in scientific circles. 
The passage referred to} in Professor Poulton’s Charles Darwin and 
the Theory of Natural Selection (Macmillans, 1896, pp. 12 f.) is so fully 
in accord with the position of my text that I allow myself to quote it 
entire :— 
“Tt is a common error to suppose that the intellectual powers which 
make the poet or historian are essentially different from those which 
make the man of science. Powers of observation, however acute, could 
neyer make a scientific discoverer; for discovery requires the creative 
effort of the imagination. The scientific man does not stumble upon 
new facts or conclusions by accident ; he finds what he looks for. The 
problem before him is essentially similar to that of the historian who 
tries to create an accurate and complete picture of an epoch out of 
1 Above, Sect. 111.
-P-A-G-E-613
  
Appendix H 587 
scattered records of contemporary impressions more or less true, and 
none wholly true. Fertility of imagination is absolutely essential for 
that step from the less to the more perfectly known, which we call 
discovery. . 
“But fertility of imagination alone is insufficient for the highest 
achievements in poetry, history, or science; for in all these subjects the 
strictest self-criticism and the soundest judgment are necessary in order to 
insure that the results are an advance in the direction of the truth. . . . 
“It is probable then that the secret of Darwin’s strength lay in the 
perfect balance between his powers of imagination and those of accurate 
observation, the creative efforts of the one being ever subjected to the 
most relentless criticism by the employment of the other. ‘We shall 
never know,’ I have heard Professor Michael Foster say, ‘the countless 
hypotheses which passed through the mind of Darwin, and which, 
however wild and improbable, were tested by an appeal to nature, and 
were then dismissed forever.’ 
“Darwin’s estimate of his own powers is given with characteristic 
candour and modesty in the concluding paragraph of his Autobiography 
(Life and Letters, 1887, p. 107): — 
“¢Therefore my success as a man of science, whatever this may 
have amounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by com- 
plex and diversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these the 
most important have been — the love of science, — unbounded patience 
in long reflecting over any subject, — industry in observing and collect- 
ing facts, — and a fair share of invention as well as of common sense. 
With such moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I 
should have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific 
men on some important points.’ ”

APPENDIX H 
I. Comment by Professor Royce on Hegel's Social Theory (cf. Sect. 332). 
“The ‘ master and slave’ business is expressly presented as but a very 
brief and primitive stage in the genesis of the social consciousness, 
even in the Phénomenologie. In going over the ground again, in the 
Encyclopédie, Hegel explained in some of the lecture notes (presented 
as Zusiétze in his Werke) that that was a barbarian affair, not to be 
regarded as related to the modern civilized consciousness, where the 
Anerkennung, which is everywhere the essence of individual self 
   
-P-A-G-E-614
  588 Appendix H 
consciousness, is founded not upon mastery, but upon the dignity of 
social office. The genesis of this higher sort of consciousness Hegel 
refers, in all his works, to the Family, to the State, and to much the 
same special principles of correlation between growing self-conscious- 
ness and social surroundings which you and I now insist upon. Hegel 
was not interested much in individual psychology, but he analyzed the 
motives of social institutions and process in a frequently quite genetic 
and psychological spirit, so far as his time permitted. The family tie, 
the relation of self and one’s critics, the relation of free citizen to other 
freemen, — these are very fundamental and fruitful in Hegel’s account. 
What I miss in him is an express recognition of the zyztfative factor as 
such. Hegel’s genetic theory assumes that the private self funda- 
mentally wants to possess everything, but finds itself limited, not merely 
by physical forces, but by its sensitiveness to criticism, to counter- 
assertion of all sorts, and by that whole sense of the complexity of 
things which is the very correlative of its longing for universal mastery. 
This manifold limitation leads, in ways which Hegel usually mentions 
without any so general explanation as yours, but for all that by much 
the same road as your theory follows, to ethical selfhood. But your 
theory insists that the self, even in its private desires, not only wants to 
possess everything, but, within its limits, to zmitate everybody. This 
involves, of course, an explanation of the phenomena of social sensitive- 
ness which does indeed go beyond Hegel’s. For his principles are 
special, yours and Tarde’s is very general.” 
— Extract from a private letter. 
Il. Wote to Sect. 86.— Yet I think, in opposition to Professor Mezes, 
who discusses the subject ably (‘The Essential Differences between 
Man and the Other Animals,’ read before the Texas Acad. of Sciences, 
May 6, 1898), that volition, as seen in ‘persistent imitation,’ may be 
present in some animals (¢.g. the dog, as in the case which he cites 
from my Mental Devel.: Methods and Processes, p. 386) without lead- 
ing to sufficient organization of the self to be ‘ reflective.’ 
Ill. ote to Sect. 136.—It is possible that the ‘flush’ associated with 
other physiological signs has played a rd/e, as an indication of impor- 
tance, in connection with sexual selection. This would seem to fall in 
with Groos’ suggestion as to the utility of the coyness of the female. 
It would, if established, make the operation of sexual selection in a 
measure reciprocal, as between the sexes, instead of one-sided, as it is 
usually considered. Something of the sort appears in the charm for the 
opposite sex which attaches to the blush, even now, in human life.

APPENDIX K 
I. Socéal Interpretations :1 a Reply to Professor Tufts 
The interesting remarks made by Professor Tufts in his kindly 
notice of my volume on Social and Ethical Interpretations in the last 
number of this REVIEW might profitably have extended comment. I 
find it difficult, however, to be sure from the condensed statements of 
Professor Tufts as to the exact bearings of his criticisms; and hence I 
shall at this time only make a general statement or two. 
First, regarding the ‘ general’ and ‘ideal’ self which he thinks is not 
clearly enough defined in the book, he asks (p. 318): “Is the social 
or general self the outcome of the dialectic in such a way that both the 
ego and the al¢er must enter into it, and become as such elements of it, 
or is it conceived as merely the undifferentiated raw material out of 
which ego and alter develop, but which does not include them?” He 
adds : “Perhaps the note on p. 266 (first edition) means that both the 
above alternatives are true and represent successive phases in the 
development of the social self.” 
In answer to this question I may say that Professor Tufts’ surmise 
regarding the note to Sect. 170 is quite correct; the note was added to 
make it clear that the alternative phrases used in the text at that point 
(‘general’ and ‘ ideal’) referred to the same content looked at from the 
two points of view of what is ‘undifferentiated,’ on the one hand, and 
the outcome of the dialectic into which both ego and alter must enter, 
on the other hand. The former is the ‘ideal’ self considered as having 
a ‘projective’ value, a something-over not realized in actual self-expe- 
rience. The latter is the ‘general’ self, considered as including what 
is common to ego and alter at any particular stage of progress of the 
dialectic of personal growth. This latter is what I mean by the ‘social’ 
self when speaking of it as an organized thought. The general self is 
always ‘social.’ So also is the ‘ideal’ self considered as to its actual 
content, which is, as I said above, the content of the general self; but 
in so far as it is ideal it stands for the further projective something-over, 
which is not yet organized in experience. In short, the ‘social self’ is 
at once a ‘general’ self, and also, by the continuance of the dialectic, 
the bearer of the ‘ideal’ values. It is the meaning and the peculiarity 
of the ‘projective’ and this made it necessary for me to adopt the 
word —that there is this sense of value or worth keeping ahead all 
along of the actual growth of the ‘ general.’? 
1 From the Psychological Review, July, 1898. 
2The theory of meaning worked out in the book, Thought and Things, Vol. 1., 
Chaps. VII.-IX., derives the different phases of meaning, ‘ generai,’ ‘ ideal,’ ‘ univer- 
sal,’ etc.
-P-A-G-E-616
  590 Appendix K 
So I am astonished when Professor Tufts goes on to say that I do 
not do justice to ‘conceptions of value.’ The whole treatment of the 
origin of social judgment to which the earlier chapters of the book are 
devoted leads up to the social determination of ethical values. Social 
judgments of worth are the important things all the way through. The 
recognition of social approval, the social criterion, etc., is a distinctive 
feature of my work. I hold the child and the genius alike, the moral 
informer and the social propagandist alike, close down to social tests 
of worth. I fear in this—if I understand him— Professor Tufts has 
missed the forest fer the trees. Possibly Professor Tufts constructs 
what I have said about ‘suggestion’ in this matter exclusively under 
the heading of ‘law and authority,’ but it was not so meant. 
In the remarks on the absence of the ‘value’ element in cases of 
spontaneous desire and ethical sanction, however, I think there is a real 
difference between Professor Tufts’ views and mine, which I cannot go 
into now. Part of the difference may be due to different uses of the 
term ‘end.’ 
In regard to what I have called ‘reflective bashfulness,’ I am con- 
vinced by various reports from correspondents that my own children 
developed earlier than many do in this respect. In new editions of 
both my volumes I am giving ‘three years and later,’ instead of ‘in the 
second and third years,’ in describing this epoch. As this ‘reflective 
bashfulness’ is what goes on to develop into self-conscious modesty, its 
existence sooner or later cannot be in question. The point on which 
more light is needed is as to the existence of an intermediate period of 
relative friendliness — which both my children showed — between the 
earlier and the later exhibitions of bashfulness.1 
In conclusion I may especially thank Professor Tufts for the subtle 
compliment implied in the words: “But I am convinced that few 
children develop in such a favorable moral atmosphere as that of the 
children observed by the author !”»— that is if he does not spoil it by 
saying he did not know the children observed by me were my own!

see my real point of view. In consequence of what seems a miscon- 
ception, the detailed criticisms lose the instructiveness which they 
might have had, and also, I am free to say, some of their point. This 
I aim to show below. As a matter of fact, Professor Dewey has mis- 
taken a knob on my harness for a joint, and aiming at it has, I think, 
wasted much of his ammunition. 
There are two things quite essential to a real understanding of my 
book: (1) it must be understood that my method is gemetzc, and (2) that 
the results state empirical generalizations, as all genetic science does, 
and not metaphysical explanations. I am not attempting to say what 
either the individual or society is, nor how either of them is possible ; 
I attempt rather to say what the law is of their evolution, and by what 
relation of fact or of implication of each by the other this law of evolu- 
tion proceeds. That Professor Dewey fails to realize both of these 
essentials it is easy to show. I shall take the second point first, since 
the great ‘circle’ of contradiction which he finds at the outset illustrates 
misapprehensions on both of these points. 
Professor Dewey says that I am guilty of a fine circle of argument, a 
circle which he allows I have myself stated ‘precisely’ in the following 
quotation :# “I do not see in short how the personality of this child can 
be expressed in any but social terms; nor how, on the other hand, 
social terms can get any content of value but from the understanding of 
a developing individual. This is a circle of definition of course, but 
that is just my point. On the one hand, we can get no doctrine of 
society but by getting the psychology of the socius with all its natural 
history ; and, on the other hand, we can get no true view of the socius 
at any time without describing the social conditions under which he 
normally lives, with the history of their action and reaction upon him” 
1 Professor Dewey’s article on my book in the Mew World (September, 
1898) may also be referred to; I find it in many ways truer to my meaning. 
I refer in an earlier place (Preface to this edition) to Professor Caldwell’s 
article as making answer to certain of Professor Dewey’s criticisms. I hope, 
in case he or the reader find in this ‘reply’ anything but friendly social ” 
‘give-and-take,’ my apologies may be allowed to anticipate their censure. 
2 The reader of Professor Dewey’s review will have noticed that after each 
statement of a ‘contradiction’ he says: “ As usual Mr. Baldwin recognizes all 
this in another place” (p. 403 of his article; the page references are to his 
article unless otherwise indicated. See also pp. 400, 409). My reply is made 
much shorter from this fact — that I have gone over about all the points which 
Professor Dewey raises. They are things which the genetic point of view, as 
involved in my ‘ dialectic of growth,’ not only recognizes, but actually rests upon.
-P-A-G-E-618
  592 Appendix K 
(Soc. Int., p. 21). Professor Dewey goes on to say that this “recog- 
nition of the circle does credit to the author’s candor, but does not 
eliminate the contradiction” (p. 401). 
Now taking Professor Dewey’s statement that this quotation ‘ pre- 
cisely’ expresses his point (a fact of which I should not otherwise have 
been at all sure, even after his explanations), it becomes evident how 
completely he has misread the theory of my book. I italicize two 
clauses in the quotation, each of which brings out one of the two 
essentials stated by me just above. The clause ‘dt that is just my 
point’ —and the book is very largely vain if the point be not in the end 
established — intimates that the ‘circle’ is not a logical one at all; it is 
a material one. So far from falling into a logical circle, I make the 
material circular process of give-and-take the subject for my predicates 
all the way through. I make the growth of the sense of personality 
(gua personality) largely a matter of social absorption and ejective 
interpretation 1—a complete circle of fact. And by this very circle of 
fact, looked at from the objective point of view, society is constituted 
with its bonds of publicity, etc. To shift one’s point of view in consid- 
ering a process which by its very nature shows two points of view is 
not to argue in a circle. It is an attempt to establish something 
material.? 
1 Imitative! despite Professor Dewey’s fear of the term (p. 402, note). I 
think most readers readily understand what it is to ‘read oneself imitatively 
into others’ (though that is Professor Dewey’s expression, not mine). It 
means to think the other by the same content by which the self is thought, 
with the imitative attitudes which such thinking involves. If I get my self- 
thought by imitating others, I can reinstate it either as self or as another 
only by taking on the imitative attitudes over again. See what is said 
below of the ‘general’ as motor attitude. (See also the new Chapter XIII 
added in this edition.) 
2 The two points of view called by Professor Dewey, I think unhappily, 
those of process (psychological) and content (sociological) ,— subjective and 
objective are much better, for ‘ content ’ is really psychological, — are not only 
recognized by me, but the great division of my work, into Book I. and Book 
II. respectively, is based upon it (disregarding intentional ‘ shifting’ in certain 
chapters). When Professor Dewey asks (p. 400) for “a psychological deriva- 
tion of the concepts of conscious personality, etc.,” from the point of view of 
‘content,’ charging me with its omission, I fail to understand how that is 
possible. If he means a sociological, i.e., anthropological derivation, that I 
have expressly declined to undertake from lack of competence; and it is not 
necessary, seeing that I say with sufficient directness that I am seeking light
-P-A-G-E-619
Appendix K 593 
Now Professor Dewey’s ‘fundamental’ criticism with many of its ap- 
plications falls of its own weight with this point. Assuming the circle 
to be a logical one, he attributes to me the distinction between society 
and the individual which such a circular fallacy presupposes. In other 
words, I am made an individualist, recognizing individuals independent of 
society, and society over against individuals, and committing the circular 
fallacy of defining them in terms of each other after such recognition. 
Nothing could be really more untrue to my position. I nowhere recog- 
nize such an individual nor deny sociality to him; I nowhere assume 
society apart from social individuals ; I nowhere fail to protest against 
just these assumptions. The passage which Professor Dewey quotes 
as showing ‘even more explicitly’ the ‘denial of sociality to the indi- 
vidual’ is altogether misinterpreted. I say in discussing the child’s 
egoism, not at all in discussing adult reflective action, “the child must 
grow up to be an individual ; that is incumbent upon him at all hazards ; 
what more he may attain in the way of being a good or wise or social 
individual is based on this first presupposition.” What is meant is that 
it is essential that the child should know how to act in self-defence and 
offence in order to live—it is rather important to his future social 
career that he should live! So he is provided with organic and spon- 
taneous reactions for personal quasi-egoistic action. But Professor 
Dewey has understood this to mean that a mature individual exists who 
is not social, and then has in some way to be made social! On the 
contrary, such a child is not a person at all, not an individual; I say 
distinctly that his own self-consciousness is not yet formed. I must 
say that this reading of my pages seems to me very astonishing. 
So also it is not true that I ‘unconsciously postulate’ society (p. 401). 
I expressly and consciously postulate society, in the anthropological or 
sociological sense, and say that every individual at the stage to which 
upon society from the psychological development of the individual. It would 
remain for me, were I able, to inquire as to whether the ‘dialectic of social 
growth,’ which I find analogous to and suggested by the ‘ dialectic of personal 
growth,’ has really been the method of sociological evolution. (The distinc- 
tion between the points of view is made in the new Chapter XIII on Imita- 
tion under the terms ‘social’ or objective, and ‘psychic’ or subjective imi- 
tation respectively.) 
1So on p. 403 he says: “We are simply told that there is an individual 
who is not social,” a statement which is not made and not intimated in the 
quotation [p. 402] from which Professor Dewey draws it, nor anywhere else 
in the book! The anti-social people, criminals and lunatics, are expressly 
excluded.

his maturity belongs reflects a society of individuals like himself; all 
genetic science has so to proceed, as I explain more fully below. When 
Mr. Dewey says: “Were it not for this unconscious assumption we 
should have an absolutely numerical individualistic view,” I agree, ex- 
cept to say ‘conscious and necessary assumption’? Things do not 
grow by leaps, but from earlier stages; yet when Professor Dewey fol- 
lows that up by attributing to me this: “The thought of the individual 
in itself is not social; but other individuals come to think in the same 
way, and then there is society” —I make emphatic demurrer. If he 
had said, “Then the thought becomes available as social matter in so 
far as the attitudes which it excites have personal value and refer- 
ence,” he would be true to my exposition in the passage to which he is 
referring. 
Let us take a case from physiology. Suppose a writer who is asking 
how physiological growth takes place. He finds there is an order of 
changes through which morphological results come about. These 
changes may be looked at chemically or physically. In Part I. he 
treats of animal chemistry; then in Part II. of his treatise he treats of 
functional physiological changes. Now, is he guilty of a circulum in 
definiendo in saying that the functional changes, which can be described 
only from the physiological point of view, require certain definite chem- 
ical changes, and also that the chemical changes in the organ are de- 
pendent upon the physiological action of that organ? Can we go on 
and say that his recognition of the chemical changes makes him an 
‘atomist’ in his morphology, his recognition of the functional changes 
makes him an ‘organist,’ and his attempt to unite the two only empha- 
sizes their antagonism? I think his answer would be that any one who 
knew the real problem of growth, as the facts set it, would see that the 
development of the organism is actually — materially —a thing of just 
this sort of higher organization of chemical matter in physiological form. 
And if any one pressed him with being an atomist he might retort: 
“ Away with you; read me again! And if you, my critic, chance to be 
a philosopher, I advise you in the meantime to look up again Aristotle’s 
theory of ‘matter and form.’” 
Professor Dewey says: “How a matter which is not itself social (the 
individual’s inventions) can become socialized through a process 
(imitation) which is not social either, I do not see.” But this is just 
what happens whenever a lower order of fact is built into a higher 
organization. It is what happens in physiology, and it is what happens 
here. Imitation is not social unless it be the means of organizing a 
certain sort of material, and the material is not social unless it be imita-
-P-A-G-E-621
  Appendix K 595 
tively organized. Self-thoughts imitatively organized are, I contend, 
the essence of what is social. 
Turning to the need of taking the genetic point of view —the other 
general point—I find Professor Dewey equally wide of the mark.? I 
have italicized a second clause in the sentence which he quotes from 
my book to prove the fatal circle; I say: “We can get no true view of 
the socius at any time without describing the social conditions under 
which he normally lives, etc.” The words ‘at any time’ indicate what 
the whole book clearly says from preface to back-cover. If we are to 
assume a ready-made individual, on one hand, and a ready-made society, 
on the other hand, and an antagonism between them which we are 
called upon in some way to do away with—all of which I have called 
(Soc. Znt., p. 88) a ‘hideous un-fact’— then of course we cannot allow 
ourselves to explain one of these ‘at any time’ or stage of growth as 
involving elements from the other at some other stage of growth. But 
if we are studying a progress, an evolution, genetically, and have already 
determined the essential interdependence of the elements which go into 
it, it is not only legitimate, it is necessary for attaining truth, that we 
discover in each stage, ‘at any time,’ the part in the whole movement 
which each of the elements contributes. The individual’s growth as a 
person is as a fact, I think, at once personal and social; and the social 
situation is, at any time, a reflex of the individual’s growth in person- 
ality. So a genetic investigation has just to trace out the zigzag or 
spiral curve of this one development, now looking toward society from 
the point of view of the individual and now toward the individual from 
the point of view of society. It is again a matter of astonishment to 
me that a member of the Hegelian school should urge for a moment 
that opposition in the elements of a complex group of phenomena 
should be considered strictly static — not resolvable into a higher organ- 
ized unity. To carry out such a point would be to condemn all evolu- 
tion theory; and—what may sound like a worse penalty to my re- 
viewer — it would destroy Hegel’s Philosophy of Mind as well as his 
Philosophy of Nature. So careful am I that my book should not seem 
to fall into this confusion, that I reprint here the following extract from 
Professor Héffding’s Report to the Danish Academy, in which the 
method of the work is spoken of.8

opposed to a ‘society.’ 
2 There is a singular difference, however, in this respect between the review 
under discussion and the Vew World article.

“. .. The memoirs seem to fall . . . into three categories. . . . 
The third category contains a single memoir... . By the method 
which it employs, it throws new light upon the solution of the question 
proposed and thereby advances it remarkably toward a solution. . . . 
This . . . work commences with an inquiry into the relations subsist- 
ing between the individual and society. Proceeding by observation 
and analysis, the author studies the development of the consciousness 
of the individual, and this study bears at once upon that aspect of con- 
sciousness which relates to purely individual existence and upon that 
which relates to the society, great or small, to which the individual 
belongs. . . . A fundamental idea, which he seeks to establish by the 
aid of the genetic method, is that there exists a correspondence and 
constant relation between the purely individual part of the conscious- 
ness of a person and the part which develops under the influence of 
society. From the start, the conception which the individual forms of 
his ego is made after the pattern of what he learns of others, or what 
he adopts from others by imitation; and the conceptions thus formed 
come in their turn to determine the conceptions which he forms of 
others and the expectation which he entertains of them. Or, to employ 
the terminology of the author, there exists a certain reciprocity, or con- 
stant circulation, setting out from the ‘project’ (the conception sug- 
gested by the behavior of the ‘ other’) and proceeding to the ‘subject’ 
(the conception which the individual has of himself), and from that in 
turn to the ‘eject’ (the new thought or expectation in regard to the 
‘other’), and wce versa. It is by this process, notably through the 
influence of the ‘ project,’ that what the author calls ‘social heredity’ 
comes into operation. It is only when aided and corroborated by 
social heredity, that the tendencies of physical heredity are able to 
influence in an important way the development of the individual. The 
individual is a product of society rather than a social unit. Yet this is 
only one side of the truth, as the writer goes on to show. For the in- 
dividual never remains passive under the action of the suggestions and 
impulsions of the social environment. It is not that the project is 
simply converted into the subject, and the subject into the eject. What 
the individual adopts he makes over into different interpretations and 
combinations: social heredity is particularized. Invention accom- 
panies imitation; sometimes the one predominates, sometimes the 
other; and in this respect there are great differences among indi- 
viduals. When the mind passes on from the project and the subject to 
the eject, it always has need of putting to proof the new combinations 
or particularizations in their relation to actual experience. The project
-P-A-G-E-623
  Appendix K 597 
may be imposed as ideal upon the subject, and the subject in its turn, 
with its private particularization, as ideal upon the eject; and it is 
through this relation that moral conflicts are rendered possible. 
“By this psychological analysis the author prepares himself to treat 
in detail the question proposed (see the Preface to the first edition). 
In the examination of society, with a view to discovering and de- 
termining its relation to the individual, he finds that social organiza- 
tions themselves are forms and accumulations of the work of individuals, 
It is not correct, then, from the outset, to make a fundamental opposition 
between the individual and society. We have to distinguish, he says, 
two sorts of social forces: the one is implicated in the organization of 
the social body (the laws, customs, manners, and institutions of so- 
ciety) ; the other manifests itself in the particularizing and combining 
activity of the individual — an activity which exists in all degrees from 
the idiot to the genius. What is ordinarily called ‘society’ is the gen- 
eralizing social force; and what is ordinarily called the ‘ individual’ is 
the particularizing social force. Social development results from the 
correspondence and agreement of these two forces. Individual varia- 
tions and particularizations render possible variations in the social 
organization, if society is able to generalize the new element which the 
individual variation introduces. But the individual variations do not 
take effect in a vague and indeterminate manner (this the author seeks 
to demonstrate by a special psychological and biological research) ; 
the course and direction of variation are limited by physical and social 
heredity, and the new element, which is produced as a variation, must 
itself be a particularization of earlier generalizations. In the develop- 
ment of society there is always—just as in the development of the 
individual consciousness — a continual movement between two poles. 
“There is thus established an harmonious correspondence and 
agreement between the two social forces which are ordinarily held to 
be opposed to each other, — the individual and society. But, in the 
opinion of the author, this agreement is not always realized. Conflicts 
in practice and problems insoluble in theory are liable to arise from the 
collision of the two social forces. For there is always something in 
the individual which cannot be generalized, and something in society 
which cannot be particularized. As long as the normal social develop- 
ment continues, there may at any time surge up tragic conflicts, which 
consist in moral protests against the social order. This condition of 
strain between the two social forces is called by the author ‘the ulti- 
mate and irreducible antinomy of society.’ Between this antinomy and 
reciprocal action in harmony, there are many intermediate forms.
-P-A-G-E-624
  598 Appendix K 
“Certainly the question proposed might be, and should be, examined 
from more points of view than the author has done by his large use of 
the psychological and genetic method. But by the original, profound, 
and penetrating use which he makes of this method, he has really 
cleared up the notions which must be used in the study of this question, 
and thereby made much progress toward its solution. In fact, the last 
parts of the memoir, in which application is made of the results ob- 
tained by this method, are extremely brief, not only in themselves, but 
also in comparison with the earlier parts, which constitute a very com- 
plete psychological essay. Nevertheless, the author indicates with 
sufficient clearness the consequences of his researches for the problem 
proposed.” 
Space will not suffice for the application of these remarks to all the 
points of criticism which Mr. Dewey makes. I think the reader will 
see in most of the instances how the genetic and material points of view 
relieve the case of all embarrassment. For example, my view of the 
‘publicity ’ of the ethical sense is said to be contradictory because it is 
‘quantitative’ (involving reference to others’ knowledge of the situa- 
tion) and also ‘qualitative,’ z.e. having an ‘ideal reference.’ Waiving 
matters of fact? I see no inconsistency. If the ideal is a synthesis of 
ego and alter thoughts which has been attained through actual social 
contact and reciprocal judgment, then the ideal reference comes to take 
. the place of the social contact. But this ideal reference is always con- 
firmable concretely, and in terms of self-attitude, only through the origi- 
nal social channels. Private judgment in ethical matters ‘needs less 
and less to appeal to an [external] authority,’ but its inner authority is 
always subjected in particular cases to this appeal. The instance given 
by Professor Dewey (7.e., “our surest token that an intention is wrong 
is our shrinking from having anybody else know of it”) does involve 
the thought of some one else’s knowing of it, and moreover it does not 
escape the genetic truth that the judgment of the act has arisen in us 
through other experiences in which we had the actual judgment of 
1 I reply to most of the criticisms, however, in the various footnotes which 
follow. 
2 The statements: “Publicity consists in actual possession of the same con- 
tent by two or more agents,” and “A thought originally not ethical becomes 
such when one knows somebody else accepts it” —with the implication of 
‘moral legislation by majorities’ (pp. 407-8 of Professor Dewey’s article) — 
cannot justly be attributed to me from any ‘point of view,’
-P-A-G-E-625
Appendix K 599 
others. As to evidence of others knowing of the deed, I have taken 
pains in the book (Sects. 198 f.) to say only of the wegatzve case (z.e., in 
which we know the deed to be quite private) that our ethical competence 
is impaired ; not that we require evidence in the positive case. In the 
negative case, the facts impair the data of moral synthesis; in the posi- 
tive case, past experience reinforces the ethical judgment without such 
direct evidence. 
There are only two points at which I feel Professor Dewey’s remarks 
take hold upon the matter vitally. One of these (pp. 405-6) is a point 
already raised by Professor Tufts in the Psychological Review for May, 
1898, and answered by me in the July issue of that journal (reprinted 
immediately above in this Appendix; cf also Sect. 170, note). It is 
this: that the general may be at once unformed and undifferentiated, 
and also a generalization from concrete thoughts. I hold that there 
is always ina general more than the content which stands for the ob- 
jective class; there is a forward reach, a prospective reference, a drift 
which is, in so far, as yet undifferentiated. In the general self this is 
the ‘projective,’ the unabsorbed balance of personal material which sets 
imitative copies and, in the higher development, ethical law to the 
child. 
The other point raised by Professor Dewey is as to whether my doctrine 
of identity of content in individuals, as necessary to sociality, takes any 
account of my other ‘ official’ doctrine that the general as such is motor 
attitude. I reply: Certainly it does, though here I might have made 
further explanations in the text, had I not already (officially!) dealt with 
the psychology of the general in the earlier book (AZental Development). 
The identity of content is essential to the identity of motor (z.e., per- 
sonal) attitudes in which last this general self and the social conscious- 
ness consist. I go to the greatest pains to say, in the chapter on 
‘Intelligence,’ that the attitudes are functions of the thought. Given 
identity of the self-thought, and the attitudes which constitute general 
and social personality follow — however inadequate the actual content 
1 Cf..Mr. Dewey’s criticism (p. 405) that the ejective process is sometimes 
stated as giving an alter to practise on, and at another time as resulting in 
social confirmation. The former is the content considered as concrete and 
calling out habit merely; the latter is the projective copy for imitation; the 
latter can be utilized, however, and learned about, only through imitation 
which now leads to accommodation. Who has not seen a child start out to 
tyrannize over a playfellow, and then turn in upon himself and reinterpret the 
whole situation ? Both are social, but they represent different phases of the 
genetic process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-626
Appendix K 
may be to establish sociality.1_ Professor Dewey’s criticisms are verbal 
and logical,? and take no account of what to me is the essential fact, z.e., 
that in thinking himself the individual attains a general and ideal self- 
attitude with the implication of a social situation. It is not to me the 
identity of content, as Professor Dewey seems to suppose (pp. 399, 402, 
403, 404), that is immediately productive of sociality ; but the common 
attitude which the individual takes up, whether the identical content be 
determined as ego or as alter-content (cf. Appendix D). This consid- 
eration and the recognition of the genetic method completely dispose 
of the criticism on p. 402 of his article. So in the final summary where 
Professor Dewey again says that I have myself happily stated the three 
‘ contradictory’ conceptions of the socius, these are the things to bear 
in mind. Socius (b)® is the content, the identical concrete thought 
which stands for me and you. It is the socius in so far as that person- 
age has any concrete embodiment. It is the identical content in every 
concrete self. Socius (a) is the retrospective, historical, psychological 
self which has experienced pleasures, pains, etc., with other persons. 
It is not content in so far as it is different from (b) ; but the (b) con- 
tent is there of course to arouse the (a) attitude. It is the self of habit 
_which dominates over other selves. Socius (c) is the general, gua 
ideal, self which is ‘projective’ and prospective; again not content, 
since it too is attitude aroused by content (a). Now to say that these 
three things contradict and annul one another is (me judice!) absurd, 
save in a faculty psychology. Genetically they are phases in a process 
upon a content. The thing essential to it all is a social situation which 
each individual helps on and realizes by his personal growth. The 
different passages which discuss it might certainly be better written, but 
such as they are they do not appear to me to be inconsistent. 
In conclusion, I may say that I do not mean that Professor Dewey 
has not written with consideration and evident desire to be just, and I 
regret, indeed, that I do not find his remarks more pertinent. That 
one of his mind and heart should have so largely, as it seems to me, 
mistaken my fundamental presuppositions makes me think there must 
1 See Professor Caldwell’s adequate recognition of this relation as essential 
to the psychology of my book (as cited in the Preface to this edition), 
2 CF op. 402, lines 13, 14 from the top, where the whole point turns on the 
use of the word ‘social’ in two senses, ‘social organization’ meaning /o the 
onlooker, and ‘social interpretation’ meaning subjective to the individual, the 
ambiguity being held up as a confusion of mine! (See also p. 403, middle 
paragraph.) 
8 See Professor Dewey’s symbols on p. 409 of his review. 
 
-P-A-G-E-627
  Appendix K 601 
be some radical divergence between his ‘apperceptive systems’ and 
mine. I make free to add also that at times I find Professor Dewey's 
writing somewhat unintelligible. For example, the first paragraph on p. 
403 of his notice has no glimmer of meaning to me, except that it says, 
“we are simply told that there is the individual who is not social” — 
which somebody else must have told him, not I! If this statement re- 
fers to the quotation just made from me to the effect that the completely 
socialized individual — whose rules and sanctions would equate abso- 
lutely with those of society —is mythical, it is a singularly wild and 
uncalled-for misunderstanding. Of course, I mean that there are vari- 
ations in individuals’ sociality — not a hard saying !—and that science 
has to suppose a mean value; and that conclusions cannot be drawn in 
concrete cases, since the mean value is seldom or never met with. 
Where is the assertion of ‘the individual who is not social’ ? 
So in the note to the same paragraph I am quoted as saying, ‘society 
solves it only to renew it,’ of the ‘bond between the individual and 
society.’ To be frank, this attributes nonsense to me. What I say 
is: “A final conflict between the individual and society is always pos- 
sible. It is soluble only by the growth of society . . . . and society 
solves it only to renew it always.” It is a part of the task of the book 
just to show how the progress of society exists by constant solving of 
the oppositions which the individuals’ thoughts produce, and that by 
producing new thinkers and new thoughts society ever and again re- 
news the opposition on another plane. If Professor Dewey wishes a 
final adjustment of all oppositions between individuals and society, then 
I agree with him that my conclusion does not ‘conclude’; for it is a 
part of my conclusion that the opposition is itself an essential moment 
in social progress. 
Ill. Selective Thinking: A Reply to Mr. Bosanquet. 
Mr. Bosanquet brings the positive criticism that I do not develop an 
exact view of the process of selective accommodation by which “the 
mind can appropriate a law or principle, the scheme of a whole, and 
naturally and necessarily differentiate its reactions in accordance with 
the bearing of such a principle on the new situation presented” (AZind, 
1899, p- 174). This is covered, I think, by the points given in the sec- 
tion on ‘Selective Thinking’ (Sect. 78), with the preceding sections on 
the nature of invention (Sects. 54-57) and carried out in detail in my 
later ‘President’s Address’ (printed in the volume Development and 
Evolution). Briefly, 1 hold that in each such case the ‘scheme of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-628
  602 Appendix K 
whole’ is itself the outcome of an earlier active accommodation (or of 
many of them) ; not only does action result in the selection of thoughts, 
but thoughts are the counterpart of former adapted actions. So in each 
case to recognize the ready-formed ‘scheme of the whole’ is merely to 
recognize the earlier organization— what in my ‘President’s Address’ I 
call the ‘platform’ — by which the thinker is able in so far to ‘size up’ 
the new situation. The general process by which all accommodation is 
effected must go deeper than goes the assumption of a plan having itself 
no genesis ; unless, indeed, we bring in intuition or some other form of 
‘preéstablished harmony’ between thought and things. On my view 
the whole process is one of these phases: (1) the selection of actions 
which ‘work’ in a given situation, (2) the corresponding and consequent 
survival of the thoughts which are functions of such selected actions, 
and (3) the ‘system of the whole,’ so sade up, which is brought to new 
situations ; this last is but the mind’s progress so far, in this line or that, 
in the two earlier mentioned phases of its growth. In short, the twofold 
psychological truth that (2) ‘what we do isa function of what we think,’ 
and (6) ‘what we shall think is a function of what we have done’— 
formulated in Sect. 57— cover the case, provided we admit that the 
‘functional selection’ of movements from movement variations — con- 
stantly repeated from a progressive ‘platform’ — is the actual method of 
motor accommodation. In the case cited by Mr. Bosanquet (/oc. cit., 
p- 174) — the building of his new house —I should say that the plan of 
the whole is made up of parts each of which is taken imitatively from 
other houses or plans of houses, or selected out by the owner himself 
from alternative variations of thought, by the process of getting new 
workable combinations which is indicated above. I could not wish a 
fairer example. 
How, I may add, Mr. Bosanquet can hesitate, as he says, in regard to 
possibly classing my humble self as an ‘associationist’ I cannot imagine. 
All my psychological publications have been from the first as diametri- 
cally opposed to associationism as an apperception theory, based on 
motor unity and synergy, can be. I am also of the opinion that Mr. 
Bosanquet will find in the later writings of Dr. Stout, from whom he 
takes the theory of ‘relative suggestion,’ evidence that that able writer 
is inclined to supplement his view, on the genetic side, by a theory of 
motor selection.t 
1 As Professor Bosanquet and I have now (1906) debated our differences in a 
series of discussions in the Psychological Review, 1902-3, interested readers may 
turn to that journal.

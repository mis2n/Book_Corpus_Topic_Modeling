PREFACE 
The study here presented is an effort to chart a hitherto 
unexplored body of literature, lying partly within and partly 
without the religious realm. Only two works have ap- 
peared in English which undertake to give any thorough- 
going treatment of the English hermit—Charles Kingsley’s 
Hermits (1871) and Mary Rotha Clay’s Hermits and An- 
chorites in England (1914). Both, of these are almost 
wholly historical in viewpoint, and only the latter deals ex- 
clusively with the English hermit. 
' The following investigation is a longitudinal treatment 
of the hermit in English literature, beginning with the ori- 
gin of the religious solitary in England, and traces the 
stages of his literary evolution under the influence of that 
indefinable complex which we call the “spirit of the age.” 
Three distinct stages in his literary development are recog- 
nized: (1) the religious, including saints’ legends and pious 
tales; (2) the semi-religious or social, including the hermit 
in social service réles in the medieval tales of chivalry; and 
(3) the unreligious or philosophic, including the hermit in 
the variable capacity of counselor in the literature from 
1500 to 1660. The various roles. which he plays in liter- 
ature are indicated and their relation to their respective 
ages pointed out, culminating in a popular interest in soli- 
tude—an interest directly traceable to the hermit. 
As the apotheosis of solitude, the hermit will always be of 
perennial interest in literature, and his literary history does 
not end with the date indicated in the title. His. literary 
cycle, however, is complete at 1660; for the later appear- 
ances of the hermit in English literature are merely revi- 
vals, with slight variations, of his former réles. The 
chronological conclusion of the study at 1660 is, therefore, 
justifiable. An historical background of the hermit out- 
side of England is presented in the Introduction. 
In a treatment of such magnitude as the title of this work 
would suggest, entailing as it does a knowledge of every- 
thing written in England from earliest times to the Resto- 
ration, it is neither to be hoped nor expected that there are 
not important omissions. My purpose will be served, how- 
ever, if a satisfactory history of the hermit as a figure in 
English literature has been sufficiently traced to establish: 
(1) his continuous existence in the literary field, and (2) 
the great variety of aspect, which his character shows, as 
emphasized by writers in different periods.

No single volume could chronicle a detailed record of the 
hermit’s appearances in English literature; and since much 
of such history would be a mere repetition of type usages, 
no serious purpose could be served, were, indeed, the mate- 
rials for such a compendium available. 
It is certain, however, that the hermit, as the quintes- 
sence of the unsocial being, presents a subject of inexhausti- 
ble interest in literature and also in life, as the following 
history will amply attest. 
I have spent four years in studying the hermit as a liter- 
ary figure, working for limited periods in the libraries of 
Johns Hopkins University, Columbia, Vanderbilt, Peabody, 
and the Congressional Library, Washington, D. Cc. Just 
here I wish to acknowledge the large debt of gratitude 
which I owe to various persons whose kind assistance has 
given this work a large measure of whatever excellence it 
may possess. It was begun as a graduate student at Johns 
Hopkins University under the tutelage of Dr. James W. ° 
Bright, to whom I owe:a greater debt of gratitude than I 
shall ever be able to pay. It has grown to its present pro- 
portions under the kind and sympathetic guidance of Dr. A. 
I. Roehm, of Peabody College for Teachers, whose untiring 
and painstaking interest has been a constant inspiration 
to me. 
I wish to acknowledge also excellent suggestions from Dr. 
Walter C. Curry, of Vanderbilt University; Dr. Charles E. 
Little, of Peabody College; Dr. C. T. Goode, of Mercer Uni- 
versity; Father Charles R. Robertson, of Nashville; Dr. 
Patrick J. Healy, of George Washington University; and 
likewise the courteous assistance of the librarians at Hop- 
kins, Peabody, and Vanderbilt.

INTRODUCTION 
I 
The hermit, or eremite (Gr., épyuos—desolate, solitary), 
is a religious character with an ancient and honorable his- 
tory. The type is by no means peculiar to Christianity, for 
every great religion in ancient and modern times has devel- 
oped an asceticism which expressed itself in the solitary 
practices which characterize the hermit. While his exact 
origin cannot be positively established, the hermit is clearly 
the product of the East, and is a well-defined and, more- 
over, honored figure in the ancient popular traditions of 
India. He appears frequently in the two great Indian epics, 
the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.1 
In the former Rama, the semi-divine hero, while yet a 
mere stripling, is appealed to by the sage, Vishvamitra, to 
destroy certain demons who occupy a goodly portion of the 
land, some of whom have been carrying on their austerities 
for thousands of years.2, With the aid of Vishvamitra and 
his brother, Lakshmana, he accomplishes the task, and is 
rewarded by having conferred upon him a gift of strange 
weapons, which even the celestials are incapable of wielding, 
and spells by which, in critical occasions, they might be re- 
strained and regulated in their offensive operations. 
In the course of their conquest the two brothers visit 
many hermitages and find many hermit sages, whose labo- 
rious austerities were constantly being hindered by the 
wicked flesh-eating Rakshasas. Indeed, the whole world 
through which they wander, outside of a few cities and vil- 
lages, appears to be peopled only by two classes—hermits, 
striving to acquire supernatural power through persistent 
austerities, and demons, bent on frustrating their success by 
unseasonable interruptions of their rites or impious pollu- 
tions of their sacrifices. It is surprising also to learn that 
even the demons at times are not above practicing austeri- 
ties for the attainment of power.

$ “According to the Hindu ‘theory, the performances of penances was like making 
deposits in the bank of heaven. By degrees an enormous credit was accumulated, 
which enabled the“depositor to draw the amount of his savings without fear of his 
drafts being refused payment. The power gained in this manner by weak mortals 
was so enormous that gods, as well as men, were equally at the mercy of these all but 
omnipotent ascetics ; and it is remarkable that even the gods are described as engaging 
in penances and austerities in order, it may be presumed, not to be outdone by human 
beings.” —Indian Epic Poetry, Sir Monier-Williams, p. 4.

inations of Kaikeyi, the favorite wife of King Dasharatha, 
his father, is banished for fourteen years; and, together 
with his wife, the beloved Sita, and his brother, Lakshmana, 
he himself turns hermit. Dressed in the ornament of ascet- 
ics, a head of matted hair, and clothed in bark, they build 
a cottage thatched with leaves and “walled with wood and 
furnished with doors.”. The details of their exile affords 
the epic poet rare opportunities for idealizing the serene, 
if uneventful, life of the hermit, who loves the beauties of 
the landscape and holds loving communion with the fair 
things of nature in field and forest. Many beautiful visions 
appear to Rama, and the years of exile slip rapidly away, 
broken here and there by battles with the giants, who rove 
the woods, interrupting, wherever possible, the worship of 
the ascetics and devouring the flesh of hermits. The chief 
of these fights is with Ravana, the ten-headed giant, who, in 
the course of the conflict, carries off the beloved Sita. After 
many miraculous occurrences, Rama overcomes Ravana, re- 
claims Sita, and returns home to assume the throne, where 
he reigns ten thousand years.’ 
The Mahabharata, though purely a contest for supremacy 
between kindred families, supported by their friends and 
allies from alien tribes, contains likewise, more or less 
prominently, accounts of ascetics and hermits. The sacred 
writings of the venerable Hindus, which may be traced back 
to 2400 B.C., also contain numerous legends about holy 
ascetics, including many ascetic rules. 
“Asceticism is a common feature in all religious systems, 
and is the practical expression of certain definite phases of 
religious sentiment and philosophical speculation. Buddha 
taught those who entered the Buddhist order that a monastic 
life of quietude and thought was preferable to a life in the 
world. To Buddha the world was evasive and ever tran- 
sient. He, therefore, taught that in the whole universe there 
is nothing permanent, no eternal substance either of mind’ 
or matter.” 
An ardent desire on the part of religious enthusiasts to 
imitate the life of the founder of their religion or sect, such 
founder being almost always an ascetic and a contemner of 
things of this world, has ever been a potent influence in 
originating and perpetuating schemes of life or particular 
practices which savor of self-denial more or less rigid. 
In fact, it would appear that all religions hold that in the 
thoughts, desires, and actions of every individual there are   
®The chief events of the epic still function in the popular festivities of India to- 
day, where they are rudely enacted on stated occasions by amateur actors, covering a 
period of several days, amid the enthusiastic applause of the spectators.

present elements which, unless conquered, modified, or neu- 
tralized in some way or other, disqualify him from attain- 
ing that unending rest or that most desirable beatitude in a 
future state of existence which the world prophets have so 
freely promised mankind. The disqualifying elements ‘re- 
ferred to as hindering the religious in the realization of 
their aspirations, although differing remarkably in the va- 
rious cults, may for convenience be included in the one term 
“sinfulness.” 
In the East generally, and particularly in India, man’s 
corporeal frame has.been for ages considered the great 
hindrance to the attainment by the spirit of its proper des- 
tiny, whether that destiny be, as the Buddhists teach, a 
release from the successive rebirths with ultimate nirvana 
(rest), or, as the Hindus hold, direct ‘union with and ab- 
sorption into the Universal Spirit. By the Hindu -specu- 
lative theologians, asceticism, with a view to the repression 
of the animal passions, is regarded, in accordance with their 
dualistic theories, as a means to the purification of the 
mind, such purgation being, they say, an essential condition 
‘for the attainment of a complete knowledge of Brahman, 
with its attendant freedom from samsara, or embodied ex- 
istence, the great aim and object-of Hindu religious life. 
The purification of the body by ascetic practices is also held 
by Hindu theologians as a necessary condition for even that 
temporary communion, in this life, of the human soul with 
the Divine Spirit, which is the object of the ecstatic hope of 
many a religious man in India. 
Under the combined influence of the physical, political, 
and social conditions referred to, and aided powerfully by 
the intellectual and moral peculiarities of its people, “a dull 
stagnation has been for ages the unenviable lot of the 
masses of the Indian people—a state very conducive to mem- 
tal depression and gloomy religious speculations, leading 
naturally to abnegation and ascetic living. Hence, it came 
to pass that the ancient lawgiver was able, with a reason- 
able hope of success, to model the ordinary life of the Hindu 
upon a wide basis of poverty, renunciation, and retirement 
from the world.” In'the sacred shastras of the Hindus, 
the ideal life as prescribed for the three superior castes 
begins with mendicancy and ends with asceticism,‘ accord- 
ing to the following scheme, which divides the ordinary span 
of a man’s existence into four well-marked periods: 
  
*Ascetics are defined by John George Zimmerman (An Examination of the Ad- 
vantages of Solitude and of Its Operations on the Heart and Mind, translated from 
,German, London, 1808, Vol. 11, p. 35) as “enthusiasts who by exercise and effort 
endeavor to attain the highest degree of virtue and perfection.”

1. Early youth, which should be.passed as a Brahmachavi, 
or religious student living on alms; 
2. Manhood, during which period the “twice-born” man 
should, as a Grihastra, devote himself to household duties 
and the rearing of a family; 
8. Middle age, which should be spent as a Banaprastha, 
or forest recluse, or hermit, with or without one’s wife, liv- 
ing on food which is the spontaneous product of the earth, 
obtained only by himself, and abstaining, under all circum- 
stances, from partaking of anything grown in towns, or even 
the produce of any other man’s labor; 
4. The closing period of life, during which final stage the 
good Hindu should become a Sanyasi, abandoning all sen- 
oe desires and living by mendicancy upon the charity of 
others. 
Among the Greek philosophers there were likewise those 
who taught ascetic principles. Pythagoras (c. 580 B.C.), 
in an effort to realize the highest ideal of friendship, estab- 
lished a religious brotherhood at Crotona, in Greece, the 
requirements for which were “rigid self-examination and 
unquestioning submission to a master.” The plan of organ- 
ization, in fact, so closely resembled monasticism that the 
order has been sometimes called “The Pagan Jesuits,’ and 
many authorities hold that Pythagorean philosophy was an 
effective influence in both Egypt and Palestine for some 
time, at least, after the Christian era.® 
The philosophy of Plato likewise exerted an ascetic influ- 
ence. ‘The life of the wise man, according to the precepts 
of that celebrated sage, should be a constant endeavor to 
die, or to set at liberty the immortal spirit from the frail 
tenement which it inhabits. The soul can only be raised to 
the divinity and its expiring energies revived by the morti- 
fication of the senses, by the extinction of the passions, by 
the incessant search and contemplation of eternal truth. 
The truly wise man, from his early infancy, disregards pub- 
lic honors and emoluments. Ignorant of what is passing 
around him, he aspires not to dignity and wealth. ‘ He is 
never seen at the festive board or in the jovial circle. He 
renounces the attainments of study, not out of vanity or to 
make a boast of his ignorance, but because he considers them 
trifles so insignificant as not to merit a moment’s attention. 
His body alone dwells among his fellow citizens; his spirit 
hovers about continually, penetrates beneath the earth, or 
soars aloft in the ethereal regions. He despises the dis- 
tinction of rank, the influence conferred by extensive posses- 
sions, the pride of pedigree, immense treasures augmented

by the parsimony of each succeeding possessor, as the play- 
things of children, from which a great mind can derive no 
pleasure. He ridicules the arts and sciences as unprofitable 
nonsense, excepting those which teach him how to escape as 
quickly as possible from the earthly, impure habitation of 
mortality to a better world, to everlasting felicity.” 
The Therapeutz and the Essenes, Jewish sects antedat- 
ing the Christian church, likewise contributed something to 
the development of Christian asceticism. The former for- 
sook their wives, their children, and property and lived in 
sequestered cells principally in the mountains of Nitria, 
where, along with a rigid exercise of piety and devotion, they 
studied metaphysics, poetry, and astronomy. The latter 
lived on the west shore of the Dead Sea and are described 
by Pliny, the elder (A.D. 23-79), as follows: “They are an 
eremite clan, are marvelous beyond all others in the world, 
without any women, with sexual intercourse entirely given 
up, without money, and the associates of palm trees. Daily 
is the throng of those that crowd about them renewed, men 
resorting to them in numbers, driven through weariness of 
existence and the surges of ill fortune to their manner of 
life. Thus it is that through thousands of ages—incredible 
to relate—their society, in which no one is born, lives on 
perennial. So fruitful to them is the irksomeness of life 
experiences by other men.” 
Even during apostolic times there were still current cer- 
tain teachings and practices which might be characterized 
as ascetic. “The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Colossians, 
doubtless had in mind a sect or school which desvised the . 
body and abstained from meats and wine. . . . The teach- 
ings of the Gnostics, a speculative sect of many schools, 
became prominent in the closing days of the apostolic age 
or very soon thereafter. Many of these schools claimed a 
place in the church, and professed a higher life and knowl- 
edge than ordinary Christians possessed. The Gnostics 
believed in the complete subjection of the body by austere 
treatment.”* The Montanists, likewise, during the second 
century, inaugurated a movement which Schaff character- 
izes as “a morbid exaggeration of Christian ideas and 
demands” as a “frantic protest against the growing laxity 
of the church,” their practices including numerous fasts and 
other austerities. 
From the evidence which has been adduced it may be seen 
that Christian asceticism—of which the hermit life is the 
best exemplification—did not originate at any definite time 
or place. Asceticism was in the air, and Christian ascet- .

14 Introduction 
icism was evolved gradually as “a curious medley of 
heathen-Jewish-Christian influences.’ 
The stages in the growth of Christian asceticism are, of 
necessity, vague. “Between the time of Christ and Paul, 
of Thebes—who died in the first half of the fourth century 
and who is usually recognized as the founder of monas- 
ticism—many Christian disciples voluntarily abandoned 
their wealth, renounced marriage, and adopted an ascetic 
mode of life, while still living. in or near villages or cities. 
As the corruption of society and the despair of men became 
more widespread, these anxious Christians wandered far- 
ther and farther away from fixed habitations, until, in an 
excess of spiritual fervor, they found themselves in the 
caves of the mountains, desolate and dreary, where no sound 
of human voice broke in upon the silence. The compan- 
ions of wild beasts, they lived in rapt contemplation on the 
eternal mysteries of this most strange world.’’s 
Another powerful stimulus to Christian asceticism was 
the persecutions of the early church by the Roman emperors, 
. and many of those who fled to the caves and deserts at this 
time never returned. “Accordingly, it was discovered about 
the end of the fourth century that the mountains and des- 
erts of Egypt were full of Christian men who had fled out 
of a dying world in the hope of attaining everlasting life. 
Wonderful things were told of their courage, their absti- 
nence, their miracles, and of their virtues also; of their 
purity, their humility, their helpfulness, and charity to each 
other and to all.®9 . . . They called each other ‘brother,’ and 
’ they lived up to that sacred name . . . and kept liter- 
ally those commands of Christ which all the rest of the 
world explained away to nothing.”!° 
“The first Christian distinguished by the name ‘hermit’ 
was Paul (died c. 325 A.D.), who rose to a degree higher 
than the common ascetics, renouncing, in his dreary soli- 
tude, all intercourse with mankind, and never quitting his 
cave till the time of his death. St. Jerome calls him the 
‘founder of the hermit life,’ though it was more probably 
only an extension of the manners and principles of the 
ascetics. Next in order of the ancient hermits is the great 
St. Anthony. In the fourth century the number of all the

monks and nuns in the great convents amounted to ninety- 
six thousand; the hermits and monks, being in the smaller 
institutions, were innumerable.”!! 
“These unhappy exiles from social life,” says the eloquent 
Gibbon, ‘‘were impelled by the dark and implacable genius 
of superstition. Their mutual resolution was supported by 
the example of millions of either sex, of every age and of 
every rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates of a 
monastery was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny 
path of eternal happiness. The prince or magistrate, the 
soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent zeal and im- 
plicit faith with the exercise of their profession, the pursuit 
of their interest, and the indulgence of their passions; but 
the ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of 
the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm which 
represents man as a criminal and God as a tyrant.” 
These ideas of immemorial antiquity and far-reaching 
influence in the East found their way to Europe in the early 
centuries of the Christian era in connection with Manichal- 
ism and Gnosticism, and, though condemned and suppressed 
by the Papacy, aided by the strong arm of secular power, 
did not fail.to make a deep impression on Western thought. 
If the doctrine in question be accepted, it is plain that 
man’s corporeal frame comes directly under condemnation ; 
and it follows likewise that, spirit alone being pure, the flesh 
and its lusts are responsible for all the sins which man com- 
mits. Hence, for the preservation of his soul and the fur- 
therance of its aspirations, it is necessary that man’s body, 
with all its senses, appetites, and desires, should be kept 
under restraint—that is, should be mortified and suppressed. 
The logical outcome of this train of reasoning thus gave 
to the world the ascetic practices so highly honored in all 
the great religious systems, the chief example of which 
among the nations of Europe was the hermit. 
“Whatever may be one’s opinion about these Christian 
ascetics, the place they occupy in the Christian history is - 
undeniably important.” Their influence — subtle, often 
transformed and modified again, but “still potent from its 
very subtleness—is being. felt around us in many a puzzle— 
educational, social, political—and promises to be felt still 
more. . . . Their fame and power occupied a part analogous 
to that of the old Jewish prophets; always independent of, 
sometimes opposed to, the regular clergy; and dependent 
altogether on public opinion and the suffrage of the multi-   
USee Wishart: A Short History of Monks and Monasteries, p. 107: “It is very 
doubtful if any uniform rule governed these first religious houses, or if definitely 
organized societies appear much before the time of Benedict (b. 480 A.D.).”

tude. . . . The model of religious life for the fifth century, 
it remained a model for succeeding centuries. In the lives of 
St. Anthony and his compeers were founded the whole lit-. 
erature of saintly biographies. . . . The whole science of 
demonology, with its peculiar literature, its peculiar system 
of jurisprudence, and their influence, did not cease at the 
Reformation among Protestant divines. . . . The great her- 
mits of Egypt were not merely the founders of that vast 
monastic system which influenced the whole politics, and 
wars,-and social life, as well as the whole religion of the 
Middle Age; they were a school of philosophers (as they 
rightly called themselves) who altered thé whole current of 
- human thought.”!2 
IT 
The origin of the hermit in England is shrouded in the 
mystery which envelops the planting of Christianity in the 
island. The reputed founders of the Christian religion in 
Britain include the’ names of St. Paul, Bran, the father of 
Caractacus, and St. Joseph of Arimathea.1? The latter, 
bearing the Holy Grail with twelve companions, is said to 
have landed in the Isle of Glastonbury, where Joseph, con- 
strained by the incredulity of his hearers to perform a mir- 
acle, planted his staff in the earth, commanded it to put 
forth leaves and blossom. ‘This led to the conversion of 
the king, the staff becoming the famous Glastonbury thorn, 
which ever afterwards bloomed on Christmas morning, the 
anniversary of the miraculous event.” 
“The probability is that. Christianity reached England, 
as it reached other countries, through a variety of agencies. 
Individual Christian believers among the soldiers and civil- 
ians, who were continually passing and repassing between 
the continent and Britain, in all likelihood made the first 
converts, while missionaries from the Greek missions at 
Lyons and Vienne, in .Gaul—founded before 150 A.D.— 
organized these scattered converts into a church. This 
theory is confirmed by historical evidence. The existence 
of Christians in England is first mentioned by Tertullian 
about 208 A.D. In 304, during the Diocletian persecutions, 
St. Alban was martyred at Verulam, since called ‘St. Al- 
bans,’ showing that Christianity had then attained a posi- 
tion deserving the notice of civil powers. In 314 A.D. the 
presence of the British Bishops of York, London, and (prob- 
ably) Caerleon on Usk at the council of Arles, in France,

proves certainly the existence of an organized church in the 
southern half of the island.”!+ 
Whatever the real facts in the case, it is certain at least 
that hermits are the earliest historic figures that emerge 
from the haze of barbarism in both Britain and Ireland. 
Practicing celibacy and poverty, they draw around them 
disciples, who seek to acquire the secret of their perfection, 
as did the followers of the early hermits in the deserts of 
Egypt, found convents, convert and baptize the heathen, and 
gradually acquire all the qualifications of sainthood. Like- 
wise they work the same miracles, see the same visions, and 
live in the same intimacy with the wild animals as did their 
forbears of the Eastern deserts; but their history—at least, 
that of the earliest solitaries—owing to their barbarous en- 
vironment and the untutored imaginations of their early 
converts, is so highly involved in fable and legend that it 
is all but impossible to separate fact from fiction or to say 
with absolute confidence precisely when or where they lived. 
While it is impossible to say who was the first of these 
shadowy ascetics, the names of some of the earliest are defi- 
nitely known, and some of the legends which sprang up 
around them.15 Among these is St. Patrick (d. 464), the 
patron saint of Ireland, who seems to have been of Roman 
or Roman-British lineage, and who is said in his “Confes- 
sion’ to have visited the monastery of St. Martin, at Tours, 
and to have studied with St. Germanus at Auxerre. Palla- 
dius, reputed to have been sent by Pope Celestine to convert 
the Irish Scots, is another. St. Ninian, a monk of North 
Wales, mentioned by Bede, is likewise another. Dubricius, 
‘a legendary contemporary of both St. Patrick and King 
Arthur, after serving both as Bishop and Abbot of Llandaff, 
ends his career, according to a tradition, as a hermit; and 
his disciples, multiplying, spread into Armorica (Brittany) 
and Ireland. 
Other traditions tell of still other solitaries. Among the 
Christian martyrs under Diocletian are reputed to: have been 
two anchorites of Caerleon, and we learn also from Bede 
that at the conference with Augustine a “recluse’—a name 
usually used to refer to an anchorite—was the oracle of the 
British Church. Still others who might be mentioned are

Certain it is that the hermit was a well-defined type in the 
early history of Christianity in Britain, and the solitary 
life—including both the hermit and the anchorite—early 
developed into an established institution. The growth of 
the type, indeed, was in later centuries little short of phe- 
nomenal, for so widespread did it become that there was 
not a single county in England that did not have at some 
time or other a recluse’s cell.'° 
Two types of solitaries, the hermit and the anchorite,'* 
developed in England, both.apparently in the early centu- 
ries, though in much of the literature on the subject the dis- 
tinction does not appear then or even later to have been 
clearly made. There was, nevertheless, a clear line of de- 
marcation, as may be seen in “Friar Daw Topias,” a middle- 
English poem: 
For sum fleen from the world and closen himself in wallis 
And steken hem in stones, and litil wole thei speken, 
To fleen sich occasions as foly wyle fynden; 
And thees us clepen ancres in the commoun speache. 
Also in contemplacion there ben many other, 
That drawen hem to disert and drye (endure) muche peyne, 
By eerbies; rootes and fruyte lyven for her goddis love, 
And this maner of folk men callen hermytes. 
While the contemplative life was the ideal of both the 
hermit and the anchorite, in neither case did the ascetic 
practices imply a complete absorption in the ascetic’s own 
spiritual interests. The anchorites (dvaywpyrjs)—i. e., with- 
drawn from the world—differed from the hermit in impos- 
ing upon himself a stricter seclusion. He was literally a 
prisoner (inclusus), inclosed by his own volition within the 
four narrow walls of a church, chapel, convent, or castle 
until released by death. The prisoner was variously called 
inclusus, inclusa, reclusus, reclusa, according to sex. The 
middle-English form, ancre, was of common gender; the 
anker and ancresse also occur, as well as the indefinite 
anachorita. Of the 650 cells of hermits’ and anchorites 
located by Mary Rotha Clay, 301 are those of anchorites. 
WClay: Hermits and Anchorites of England, Appendix C, for tabulated list of cells 
showing the location of 750 such abodes and the names with dates for 650 hermits and 
anchorites. 
Though these terms are often used synonymously, a distinction should be made 
between them. The anchoret, or recluse, male or female, was immured in a cell or 
anchorage, often built near (or in) some monastery or church. The hermit was free 
to leave his cell, which was usually placed in a more or less lonely spot, and wander 
whither he would. The distinction, however, was not clearly observed in these early 
times, and Guthlac is called a ‘hermit’ and an ‘anchoret’ indifferently.”—Hunt: The 
English Church, 597-1066, p. 229.

“A study of the Christian names of these recluses,” says 
Miss Clay, “seems to show that.more women than men un- 
dertook this austere vocation.’”!8 
The abode of the anker was usually (1) adjoining parish 
churches, (2) in conventional houses, or (3) adjoining 
chapels. This place is variously referred to as domus 
anchoritae, reclusorium, inclusorium, reclusaguim, and an- 
choraguim. Most of the writers on the subject are foreign- 
ers. In speaking of the anchorite’s place of seclusion, 
Grimlaic (Regula Solitariorum C. L. Holstenius, Codex 
Reg., II 464-600) says that the dwelling should be very 
small, and, if possible, surrounded by an inclosed garden. 
If desirable, two solitaries might share a single chamber; 
or if the anchorite had disciples, they were allowed to dwell 
in a separate apartment and serve him through the window. 
The recluse’s cell usually communicated with the church; 
but if it chanced that the solitary before becoming conse- 
crated an anchorite had been a priest, he was also allowed 
a consecrated oratory. According to a Bavarian rule, this 
should be twelve feet square and built of stone. Three 
openings, or windows, gave the imprisoned access to the 
outside world. Through one, which opened toward the 
choir, he received the sacrament of holy communion; 
through the second, located on the opposite side, he received 
his food; and through the third, which was closed with the 
glass or horn, light entered his dwelling. 
While the anchorite’s abode might include several apart- 
ments, there was required, nevertheless, throughout an 
austere simplicity. Abbot Aelred, author of a twelfth-cen- 
tury rule for anchorites (Regula, Informacio, or Institutio 
Inclusarum) ,° disapproves of covering the naked walls with 
any sort of ornamentation, since any such efforts at adorn- 
ment savored of vanity. 
“Now shall I shewe the how thou shalt arraye thyn ora- 
tory. Arraye thyn autier with white lynnen clothe, thw 
whiche bitokenett and symplenisse in this autere sette an 
ymage of Cristis passion, that thou may have mynde and 
se hou he sette and spredde his armes abrood to resceyve thee 
and al mankynde to mercy, if thai wil axe it. And if plese 
the, sette on that oo side an ymage of our Lady and another 
on that other syde of seynt John.” 
In order to become an anchorite it was necessary to obtain 
permission of the bishop of the diocese and likewise consent

from the incumbent and patron of the church to which the 
recluse was to be attached. In the prefatory note to the 
Sarum Office the bishop is required to cause the candidate 
to be instructed and warned how he should examine his 
conscience and his motive to determine whether by his act 
he is seeking to please God or men. Nor did the matter end 
here. To further insure sanctity and sincerity on the part 
of the candidate, a commissary was appointed to inquire 
into the circumstances of the case, the suitability of the pro- 
posed cell, the candidate’s estate, whether married or un- 
married; but, above all, a strict examination was made of 
the person’s'character. In some cases a period of proba- 
tion was provided. 
After the candidate was accepted, he was inducted into 
the life of an anchorite with appropriate ceremonies. 
There are numerous liturgical forms for this ceremony ex- 
tant, the earliest of which is a fragmentary twelfth-century 
pontifical entitled ad Recludendum.2° Other examples are 
the Clifford Pontifical at Corpus Christi College, the Chichele 
Pontifical at Trinity, the Sarum Manual at St. John’s, and 
the Russell Pontifical in the University Library. 
The office for the inclosing of anchorites, according to the 
use of Sarum, stipulates that the candidate, before being 
admitted to the cell, should fast, make confession, and keep 
vigil during the whole of the previous night. The ceremony 
proper, which occurred on the morrow, began with an ex- 
hortation to the congregation and the one about to be in- 
closed, delivered by the bishop or his commissary, and the 
office opened with versicles and psalms. This was followed 
by mass, including special prayers. Following the gospel, 
the candidate, after placing his tape upon the altar, stood at 
the altar step and read his profession in a clear voice as 
follows: “I, Brother or Sister N, offer and present myself 
to. the goodness of God to serve in the order of an anchorite; 
and, according to the rule of that order, I promise to remain 
henceforth in the service of God through the grace of God 
and the guidance of the church and to render canonical obe- 
dience to my spiritual fathers.” The includendus then made 
the sign of the cross with a pen on the roll, and, after plac- 
ing it with bended knee upon the altar, prayed. There fol- 
lowed then the sprinkling and blessing of the habit worn 
by the newly professed anchorite, after which the celebrant 
chanted over him in a prostrate position before the altar: 
“Veni, Creator Spiritus.” After the conclusion of mass, the 
novice, carrying his tape and followed by all the rest, moved

in procession to the cell, where the bishop, after blessing 
and hallowing the cell, advancing, took him by the hand and 
inducted him into his prison, while the clerks chanted a lit- 
any. The door of the cell being firmly shut, a final prayer 
is uttered for the includendus, and he is left alone.?1 
After being inclosed, the anchorite was guarded by the 
rules of the order, which consisted of friendly counsel, how- 
ever, rather than rigid regulations. Five such rules of life 
for the guidance of anchorites are extant: (1) Rule of 
Aelred (twelfth century), entitled The Regula, Informacis, 
or Institutis Inclusarum; (2) Ancren Riwle (thirteenth cen- 
tury), usually attributed to Richard Poer, Bishop of Salis- 
bury (1217-29); (8) Form of Perfect Living (fourteenth 
century), written by Richard Rolle, a hermit, for his 
friend, Dame Margaret; (4) The Scale (a Ladder) of Per- 
fection, by Walton Hilton, an Augustinian canon (d. 1396) ; 
(5) Book for Recluses (fifteenth century), B. M. Harl. 2372. 
The best known of these, Ancren Riwle,?? is a hand- 
book of devotion, conduct, and household management. The 
author enjoins the threefold vow of obedience, chastity, 
and constancy of abode, declaring that while mere outward 
rules may vary according to each one’s estate and circum- 
stances, the friends for whom this book is written are to be 
guided by the inward law of love which regulates the heart. 
The function of the anchorites is further defined by St. 
Aelred of Rievaulx, who, in his Jnstitutis Inclusarum 
(twelfth century), gives some of the special needs which 
should call forth the sympathies of anchoresses: the mis- 
ery of the poor, the sigh of the orphan, the desolation of the 
widow, the need of pilgrims, the danger of voyagers, the 
hardship of soldiers, the vows and temptations of nuns, and 
the cares of bishops. Anchoresses also found useful occu- 
pation in making clothes for the poor. Anchorites, in some 
cases, devoted their leisure to quiet study and sent forth 
from their cells many works of literary value, among them 
the Lindisfarne Gospels and other notable works of histor- 
ical value. ; 
The hermit, on the other hand, with a larger measure of 
freedom and activity than that accorded the anchorite, was. 
in many respects, a very different character. The life of

The work is edited and translated from a semi-Saxon MS. of the thirteenth century 
by James Morton, printed for the Camden Society, London, 1851. The editor writes 
concerning the authorship (Preface, p. XIV): “Concerning Simon of Ghent, the re- 
puted author, very little information is to be found. A fourteenth-century version 
of this work has recently been edited by Joel Pahlsson, the original of which is Ms. 
" Pepys 2498, Magdalene College, Cambridge. It is addressed to men and women, and 
several of the intimate touches of the Ancren Riwle are omitted.” .

22 Introduction 
a hermit was once a career, and not, as generally supposed to-day, the abdication of all careers. In his pone: and detached nature, however, his place in the ecclesiastical system is hard to thoroughly define. Like his Oriental pro- 
totype, the subjection of the body and the “carnal mind’2? was the lifelong labor of the English solitary. “The se- 
riousness of the struggle is shown by the extreme measures 
devised by way of training. Wulfric, for example, used to 
mortify his members with much fasting and bring them un- 
der control by toils of vigils, so that ‘his flesh scarcely hung 
on his bones.’ He and certain other companions were clad 
not only in spiritual, but material, armor. Night and day 
the rough habergeon pressed the rough hair shirt upon the 
emaciated frame. When Wulfric, having worn out one 
penitential suit, obtained a new one from Sir William. 
Fitz Walter, he found its length impeded his kneeling. The 
knight offered to send the coat of mail to London to be 
shortened, but the anchorite bade him in God’s name take a 
pair of shears and cut it. Whilst he hesitated, thinking the 
good man mad, Wulfric brought shears out of the house, 
and, having drawn a thread through the rings of the chain 
armor to mark it where it should be cut, he placed it in the 
window before the knight, saying: ‘Be steadfast and fear 
not. I will go pray to my Lord about the matter; mean- 
while do you set about confidently.’ The two warriors were 
now busily occupied, the one in praying and the other in 
cutting. Their work prospered, and the iron seemed like a 
linen texture. Amazed, Sir William fell at Wulfric’s feet; 
but he raised him and badehimtellnoman. . . . ‘From that 
time the man of God, without any shears, with his own 
weak fingers, but with no less faith, distributed rings of the 
coat of mail to heal diseases of all who asked it of him in 
charity.’ Godric wore the lorica for fifty years. Indeed, 
he wore out three in succession, the metal rings of which 
were treasured as relics. Another ascetic practice was that 
of standing in cold water for hours, sometimes throughout 
the night. Godric often stood in’a hollowed rock in the icy 
waters to the ear, or descended into a tub sunk in the floor 
of his oratory.”’2+ 
In like manner also the same ideal of spiritual warfare 
which characterized the fathers of the desert inspired the 
English hermit. Indeed, the reality of the personality of 
the devil was so strong to the minds of men like Cuthbert, 
Guthlac, Roger, Godric, Robert of Knaresborough, and 
Richard Rolle of Hampole, that they .seemed themselves,

like Anthony of Egypt, to have actual conflicts with de- 
mons, whose insults and attacks are described at length in 
the lives of those saints.?° 
In fact, the solitary was taught to expect temptation as a 
part of his religious training. ‘Let not any one of remark- 
ably pious life think that she may not be tempted. The 
good, who have reached a high degree of virtue, are more 
tempted than the frail; and there is good reason for it, for 
the greater and higher the hill is, there is the more wind 
upon it. As the hill of holy and pious life is greater and 
higher, so the fiend’s puffs, which are the winds of tempta- 
tions, are stronger thereon and more frequent.”2¢ 
The inexperienced were at the same time warned against 
the wily snares of the devil. ‘“‘Account no vision what ye 
may see, waking or sleeping or in a dream, to be anything 
but an illusion; for it is only one of his stratagems. He 
hath often thus deceived wise men of holy and pious life; 
as him, whom he came to in the wilderness in the form of a 
woman, and said that she had lost her way, and wept as in 
misery, for a hospitable shelter; and, again, of the other 
holy man, whom he made to believe that he was an angel, 
and of his own father that he was the devil, and made him 
kill his father.”27 
“From first to last . . . the mystic was waging war 
with demons. To strive to dwell in thought solely upon the 
invisible was a severe strain upon the mind. Some of his 
fighting and fears were the result of self-repression and 
shattered nerves; some apparitions were hallucinations or 
feverish dreams. Nevertheless, the indomitable wills of 
these men and women command admiration. . . . They 
lived a life of unflinching sacrifice—a life typified by the 
nakedness of the cell with its dominating crucifix. Volun- 
tarily they stripped themselves of the natural joys of life. 
Patiently they persevered in hardness of living and unre- 
mitting moral effort. Contemporary writers witness to the 
reality of their discipline. Langland says: 
“To preyers and to penaunce putten heom monye ~ 
For loue of vr lord liueden ful harde 
In Hope for to haue Heuen-riche blisse; 
As Ancres and Hermytes that holdeth him in heore Celles.” 
And the ascetics themselves testify that they found a 
rich recompense in thus faithfully performing what they

conceived to be their duty. “Full swete melody makes 
merry the solitary man,” says the hermit of Hampole. 
“Tn the end after long toil, He giveth them sweet rest, here, 
I say, in this world, before they go to heaven; and then the 
rest seemeth so good after the labour.’ So writes, out of 
her own experience, the Anchoress of Norwich, Anchoress 
at St. Julian’s, Norwich, a church which was under Carrow 
nunnery.”28 
It is but natural that the hermit’s venerable aspect should 
have become proverbial. Strangely enough, while the self- 
imposed hardships of his life produced a premature ap- 
pearance of great age, the rigor of his life seems actually to 
have preserved his health and promoted longevity. ‘“Her- 
mits of England carried on the tradition of those of Egypt, 
where Paul had died at the age of one hundred and thirteen 
years, and was buried by Anthony, who was already ninety. 
Despite ‘frosts and fasts,’ hard lodging and thin weeds, the 
solitary overpassed his days, until he was, indeed, as pic- 
tured by Shakespeare, ‘a withered hermit, fourscore winters 
worn.’ ’’29 
All religious solitaries, in theory at least, were recognized 
by and amenable to the authority of the church. Some, 
indeed, were in close touch with a monastery. The re- 
quirements for becoming a hermit in early times are only to 
be determined from concrete cases, but the later usage is 
fairly well defined. In general, recluses, whether anchor- 
ites or hermits, were officially set apart for their vocations, 
whether they were regular or secular clergy, nuns, or men 
and women who as yet had taken no vows: To-become a 
hermit, a monk required official sanction from his abbot; 
but to become an anchorite, he required the joint consent of 
both his superior and his bishop. To take either step, a 
lay person required the consent of his abbot. Bartholomew, 
a monk (born cir. 1120), and Godric, a lay brother (died, 
May 21, 1179), were both under the egis of the Benedictine 
house of Durham, whose prior exercised the right to offi- 
cially “create” hermits. In the time of Richard II the civil 
law required*° that unlettered hermits should be licensed for 
episcopal recognition, and such approval is to be found in 
episcopal records.** 
Further evidence of episcopal control is to be found in the 
various rules for hermit life extant. Among these are the 
following:

  26 | Introduction 
The different rules for hermit life include directions con- 
cerning times of labor, sleep, eating, silence, and worship. 
In the monastic sense, however, obedience was not required, 
since the hermit “is abbot, prior, and prefect in the cloister 
of his heart.” If he chose, he might vow poverty and chas- 
tity to Almighty God before the bishop, but not by any man’s 
commandment. Definite instructions are given in regard to 
the hours set for the repetition of the Creed, Lord’s Prayer, 
and Angelic Salutation. In addition to this, the hermit was 
to gad mass daily, if possible, and to be houseled once a 
week. 
It appears, therefore, that, in a strictly monastic sense, 
the English hermit was something of a free agent. In mat- 
ters of food and dress there was likewise some latitude. 
“Wherever . . . aman liveth by himself alone (Clay, 
p. 105), be he hermit or anchorite, of outward things where 
scandal cometh not,” it was not necessary to take much care; 
and yet, as the visible sign of separation, a habit was re-. 
garded as necessary, and no man felt himself a hermit until 
he had put on some distinctive dress. Richard Rolle of 
Hampole, upon his decision to become a hermit, persuaded 
his sister to send to him in the wood two of her garments, 
a white and a gray tunic, and his father’s raincoat, from 
which he fashioned a suitable habit “so that in some meas- 
ure he might present a confused likeness of a hermit.” 
As a matter of fact, the habit varied quite as much as the 
office itself. Usually it consisted of loose garments of sober 
hue, caught up with a cord. A mural painting at Rampton 
shows a hermit with sleeved surplice, tippet, and skull cap. 
The rules regarding dress are general. The hermit’s dress 
must be according to the bishop’s ordinance, but must not 
too closely resemble any order lest it cause offense. ‘Let 
his clothing be humble and not curious; . . . and if 
he will of devosyon wear next his flesh a cylyce, it is law- 
full.” He was to wear plain shoes, without hose, or else go 
barefoot. He slept in his coat or kirtle, girded with a cord, 
and at his death was thus buried, since the rules required 
that “he should be graved when he is ded in his habyt as he 
gothe.” 
The food of the early hermit was remarkable for its fru- 
gality, consisting usually of herbs, roots, grain, and fruit. 
Although his chief occupation was deeply religious in nature, 
it was necessary that either he or some one else should pro- 
vide him sustenance. In many instances, therefore, he 
maintained a little garden, which furnished him his simple 
fare. He rarely tasted flesh, though it was lawful to par-

take of it on the three great church festivals and the four 
days following, as well as in time of sickness or strenuous 
labor, “for grete labore past or labore for to come if nede 
ax yt.” Also at the commandment ofthe bishop or patron 
he might indulge in meat for a single day. On the other 
hand, he was required to fast three days in the week and 
on, Friday to partake of only bread and water, and was 
‘likewise directed to observe seasons of abstinence during: 
the fourth days before Christmas as well as Easter, and 
also the nine days preceding Whitsunday and Michzlmas.** 
In the early days of hermit life in England the solitary 
dweller lived a primitive life and supplied his own meager 
wants as a tiller of the soil; but as the number of hermits 
multiplied, there developed a class of hermits who had no 
land to cultivate, and who became, therefore, objects of 
charity. The growth of this class proved a stumbling block 
to many, and led to the secularizing of the hermit, follow- 
ing the directions of a rule headed, “Of Provisions in His 
Cell 
“I a hermit dwells in a borough, town, or city, or Miah 
there, where each day he can well beg his daily food, let him 
before sunset distribute to Christ’s poor that which remains 
of his food. But if he abides afar, as in a country village 
or desert spot, one or two miles, from the abode of men, let 
him make provision for one week, strictly from Sunday to 
Sunday, or he may begin on another day of the week; and 
if aught remains over, let it be given to the poor forthwith, | 
unless on some ground he can excuse himself in the sight of 
God, as that he is sick, or weak, or that he is tending a sick 
man, or is buying a home with works bodily or spiritual, 
which are well pleasing to God.’’#+ 
The excess of such “town” hermits, licensed to beg, led to 
the type of ecclesiastical cheat against whom Langland in- 
veighs in his Piers Ploughman. The growth of this class 
of “lollers” was, however, but another evidence of the gen- 
eral decay of true religion which preceded and led to the 
Reformation in England and the downfall of the hermit 
himself as a religious type. 
The degeneration of the true hermit was recognized by 
the civil authorities as early as 1381, when, after the col- 
lapse of the peasant revolt of that year, a series of statutes 
placed all hermits under condemnation who could not pro-

alms of the passers-by. ‘There was nothing religious about 
such mendicants except their garb, . drunken, 
thievish rascals, who had been turned from honest trade by 
the success of the lazy friars. Episcopal regulations seem 
to have been powerless to check their growth.’’25 
Contemporary authority also confirms the decay of the 
sincere religious solitary. In his Morte d’Arthur, Malory 
- (1400-1471) writes: “For in those days it was not the 
guise of hermits, as it is nowadays. For there were none 
hermits but they had been men of worship and of prowess, 
and those hermits held great household and refreshed peo- 
ple that were in distress.’’3* 
William Thorpe, another writer of this period, in the Tes- 
tament (1400), brackets hermits with “pardoners, ankers, 
and strange beggars,” who have leave to defraud the poor.*? 
The charge was, indeed, not undeserved; for the system of 
indulgences was,frequently applied to the support of her- 
mits, and other strange and irreligious usages had been de- 
veloped. “In1443 . . . the Pope offered an indulgence 
to penitents who should visit and give alms to a chapel in 
the parish of Stalham, dedicated to St. Andrew, ‘at which 
John Kylburn, a hermit, has long dwelt, and whither re- 
sorts a great multitude out of reverence for the saint, by 
whose merits divers of those who visit it have been deliv- 
ered from diseases.’ Pilgrims to Bauburg were wont to 
resort to the oratory of the hermit near the bridge; and 
after mass, he ‘attended them to the town, sprinkling them 
with hysop and holy water.’ 38 
Another reason undoubtedly led to the passing of the re- 
ligious solitary. Besides being a devoted worshiper, the 
English hermit was a pioneer in public service in the Mid- 
dle Ages—indeed and in truth, the good Samaritan. He 
assumed voluntarily the rédle of host and guide to the 
stranger and the lost, lightbearer for the mariner and la- 
borer, alms gatherer and turnpike builder and bridge keeper 
for all who came that way. 
As early as 1114 Goathland hermitage, in the moors near 
Whitby, was a house of hospitality for the poor. In 1184 
Hugh Garth, “an hermit of great perfection,” gathered 
alms to found a hospital, perhaps to shelter travelers, at 
Cochersand, in the sandy wastes between the estuaries of 
the Lune and Coker. Other hermits acted as guides at the 
passage of rivers, and hermit cells had been located at

Still more important is the réle played by the hermit as a 
road and bridge builder. Throughout the Middle Ages the 
upkeep of the highways was largely a matter of chance and 
left to the charity of the few. The hermit, being the soul of 
charity, was by nature admirably fitted for this work. ‘ 
The Patent Rolls of York give the record of several her- 
mits who served in this capacity. “Adam de Whenby, who 
dwelt by Saint Helen’s chapel, at Shipton, in the parish of 
Overton, undertook to make a convenient road in certain 
dangerous parts. He was granted protection and safe con- 
duct ‘while seeking means of carriage and alms to enable 
him to make safe way in the forest of Galtres, at a place 
called les Polles, where many accidents have occurred by 
reason of the depth of the ways.’ Adam continued his la- 
bors there between 1327 and 1332, but was succeeded by 
Robert de Skitheby, hermit of St. Augustine’s chapel, at 
Huntingdon, by York. . . . The hermits of Skip Bridge 
and Stainforth Bridge spent large sums in repairing the 
ways over the moors. Similar improvements were effected 
in other wild districts.’’*9 
It is but natural that such worldly employments drew the 
hermit away from his religious devotions, and, coupled with 
the growing corruption within the church itself, brought 
the hermit, along with all other ecclesiastics, into disrepute. 
Moreover, the cell, as a recognized part of the chantry 
system, was doomed at the Dissolution of the Monasteries 
(1536-9) ; and if any solitary remained in his cell, he was 
almost inevitably homeless after the Suppression of the 
Chantries in 1546. Their habitations passed into other 
uses. “The cell at Allhallows, London Wall, was suppressed 
in 1538 and was given to the city sword bearer. In 1516 
there had been an anchoress living at St. John’s chapel. 
Wakefield but a century later speaks of it as now trans- 
lated into a laythe (i. e., barn), on the south side whereof 
is a hollow place yet extant in the wall where (an) anchoret 
lived.’’40 Ih other instances hermitages were put to pa- 
rochial uses, either as a vestry or a school, as at Gateshead. 
In 1591 the chapel near Plymouth is referred to as a barn 
and missuage called ‘‘the hermytage of our ladie at Quarry- 
well.” The sale of the premises of Nalmesbury Abbey in 
1544 included “St. Whit’s Armitage” upon Burton Hill. 
Another hermitage, described as “a little cottage much

ruyne with two little garden plotts,” was used in the sey- 
enteenth century as a posthouse, and later as a poorhouse. 
St. Leanard’s Armytage, consisting of a house, chapel, gar- 
den, and closes, was sold by the crown in 1544. 
Of course, a few isolated hermits in places not easily ac- 
cessible to state officials remained; but the heyday of her- 
mit life had passed, although the “ornamental hermits” and 
hermitages of the pseudo-gothic revival were yet to be 
developed. And yet the ideal for which the hermit had 
stood lived on and will continue to live in the minds and 
hearts of the English-speaking race. This ideal is best 
expressed, perhaps, by the hermit of Hampole, Richard 
Rolle (d. cir. 1849) : “Righteous hermits also have a single 
aim. In charity of God and of their neighbor’ they live; 
worldly praise they despise; as much as they may, man’s 
sight flee; each man more worthy than themselves they 
hold; to devotion continually their minds they give; idle- 
ness they hate; fleshly lusts they manfully withstand ; heay- 
enly things they taste and eagerly seek; and earthly they 
covet not, but forsake; in sweetness of prayer they are 
delighted.”*1 
In the thousand years of the historical English hermit he 
had developed a clearly definéd character which was to 
become the subject-matter for a prodigious and profoundly 
interesting literature. His love of solitude led many an 
English poet and prose writer to praise the contemplative 
life and to seek the “peace that passeth understanding” in 
nature’s solitudes. The hermit had likewise developed many 
activities of great benefit to society at large. In the days 
when civilization was but a mockery and culture the posses- 
sion of a few, he had taught, preached, and celebrated divine 
offices in his humble hermitage for the wayfarers or acted 
as the spiritual guardian of some saint’s shrine; by exhib- 
iting the highest degree of self-control himself he had de- 
veloped in the hearts of barbarous men a respect for law; 
he had taught most effectively the Christian virtues by gath- 
‘ering alms for the relief of the poor at home or the freeing of 
those in captivity among the heathen; he had set an example 
of thrift and industry by cultivating and making to bloom 
the dismal waste places; he had given a new ideal of the 
meaning of citizenship by making roads, building and repair- 
ing bridges, erecting sea marks and lighthouses; he had 
made Christianity a living philosophy by giving comfort and 
counsel to the poor and the distressed in every walk of life.

ity and civilization is unparalleled and undisputable. The 
tribute of .Dr. Samuel Johnson is ‘justly deserved: “I never 
read of a hermit but in imagination I kiss his feet.” 
“The hermit saints must not be forgotten when we try to 
trace the molding of English national character. Their in- 
fluence was unique. They were not like the bishops, great 
lords, whose holiness must shine through the entanglements 
of spiritual state and worldly business; or the monks, whose 
ordered round of service might make but faint echoes on 
the world outside; or friars, who lived among the poor as 
poorer still and maintained in the crowded centers of pop- 
ulation as preachers of righteousness and love. The ancho- 
rite and the hermit lived a solitary life, with no active duty 
toward others, but visible, even if it were only through a 
thin lancet opening, to all who would come and look upon 
him, and willing to converse (though it might be, like Saint 
Godric, only by signs) with those who came. Obvious in 
the rigor of his asceticism, his contempt of the world and of 
comfort, his mastery over all sins of the flesh to which men 
were most prone, he might be seen standing in the freezing 
lake at midnight ; his food was known for’what it was, of the 
scantiest ; his raiment was visible in all its imperfections; 
men could measure the scant proportions of his cell. As for 
those who were behind high walls, who could tell that their 
life was so holy as a monk’s should be? When friars went 
in and out among the vile, who could tell if they touched 
pitch and were not defiled? But about the hermit there 
could be no doubt. Men could see and hear and judge him 
for themselves. It was thus that those who gave them- 
selves, in this way so strange to the gregarious Teuton, 
ee to God, were loved and venerated with special won- 
er.”42 i

CHAPTER I 
THE HERMIT IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 
FROM EARLIEST TIMES TO THE ROMANCES OF CHIVALRY 
For more than twelve centuries the hermit is a familiar 
figure in English literature, though one must search for 
him at times in unfamiliar places. Viewed longitudinally 
through this long stretch of time, his position has not the 
commanding importance of the knight, nor perhaps the emo- 
tional consistency of the jester ; but his position in literature 
is withal by no means inconspicuous and stands alone and 
undisputed in his literary longevity, reflecting in a charac- 
teristic manner the spirit and the emotional life of the age. 
“The mystery of existence, the unreality of what seems 
most real, the intangibility and evanescence of all earthly 
things, these thoughts obscurely echoing to us across the 
ages from Heraclitus, have remained, and always will 
remain, among the deepest and most insistent of the 
world’s thoughts in its sincerest moments and in the world’s 
greatest thinkers.”*® In no class of persons, literary or 
real, is this great mystery more clearly exemplified than in 
the English hermit, who dedicated his life unselfishly to its 
experimental solution.‘ This fact will be exemplified in 
the study of the hermit in English literature. 
Beginning first as a commanding figure in the early his- 
tory of the church in England by a sort of spiritual meta- 
morphosis, he became first an object of wonder, then of 
reverence, and finally an ideal—a symbol of that eternal 
mystery; and in some form or other in literature his sub- 
tle influence continues even to the present moment. In or-

4«“Nowhere had Christianity been embraced with greater warmth than in England, 
and nowhere was there a more fertile soil for mysticism. . . . The intensity of 
religious feeling . . . is proved by the rapid increase of monasteries, especially 
of the more ascetic orders; . . . and, at the same time, anchoritical life, once 
the sole form of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, . + survived in England and 
had many followers. . . ‘The hermits were nowhere more frequent than in the 
North. Here St. Cuthbert (died, 687), having been Bishop of Lindisfarne for twelve 
years, had resigned his office and settled as a hermit in one of the small islands of 
Farne; and St. Guthlac (died, 714), in his twenty-fourth year, suddenly experiencing 
a change of heart, had given up his wild life as a warrior and adopted that of a 
hermit at Crowland; and here we find St. Henry (died, 1127), the hermit of the Isle 
of Cocket, which is said to have been full of hermits; St. Godrick, of Finchall (died, 
1180) ; and, in the thirteenth century, St. Robert of Knaresborough. The authors of 
that time frequently recommended hermitical life (ef. Petrus Blesensis Vita S. Guth- 
laci, in MS. Trin. Coll., Dublin, B. 2, 7). The cells of the hermits . . . were the 
seat of holy contemplation, of a life, which by way of purification through ascetic 
exercises, compunction and humiliation, aspired to the ecstatic union with God, to a 
love of God so intimate that the soul, losing itself altogether, was transformed into 
him.” —C. Horstman, Intro., Richard Rolle of Hampole, London, 1895, p. XI, XII.

84 The Hermit in English Literature 
der to show how his character came to be so closely defined 
in the public mind that it assumed the power of an ideal, it 
will be necessary to treat the hermit of early English his- 
tory, since it was from him that the ideal hermit of lit- 
erature developed. This transformation was quite fully 
established in parts of England by the time of Cynewulf 
(ate eighth century), though the hermit continued to hold 
an actual place in the world until the dissolution of the 
monasteries, 1536-39. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to record the steps in this 
transformation from actuality to ideality—from the popu- 
lar idea of a hermit to the ideal for which he stood. In the 
course of this development three different stages are recog- 
nizable: (1) the incidental, or general historic, hermit; 
(2) the prose biographic, or semi-heroic, hermit; and (3) 
the pure literary, or heroic-ideal. The last stage is defi- 
nitely reached when the author has become a conscious lit- 
erary artist. 
With many it is a question whether history is literature, 
or may be so regarded; doubtless the whole question is one 
of viewpoint, and is, therefore, a veritable ‘‘de gustibus,” 
etc. Suffice it to say that the earliest mention extant of the 
hermit in England is found in Bede’s Latin History,*® and 
forms an important incident in the notable conference at 
Augustine’s Oak, A.D. 603 (?). The exact date of the 
conference is not fully established; four different authori- 
ties give as many different dates. Florence of Worcester 
gives A.D. 603; Sigebert, A.D. 602; Spelman, A.D. 601; and 
Randolph of Chester, A.D. 599. The place was probably 
near Aust, formerly Austre Clive, Gloucestershire, near the 
site of the ancient Victis of the Romans.** 
The story, however, is significant in establishing the re- 
markable power and influence of the hermit in early Britain. 
When Augustine arrived in England (597), he found Chris- 
tianity already established among the Britains. These early 
Christians did not, however, observe Easter at the same 
time as the Romans, and differed also in other traditional 
usages. Augustine sought to bring about Catholic unity in 
all these matters, and accordingly called a conference of 
British bishops or doctors for this purpose. The first con- 
ference proved more or less a failure because of the small 
number of Britons present, and a second synod was ap- 
pointed. 
*Stopford Brooke, The History of Early English Literature, New York and Lon- 
don, 1914, p. 346, says: “Of all these works (by Bede), none can be said to belonz 
properly to literature except the Lives of Cuthbert and the Abbots, the Ecclesiastical 
History, the Letter to Ecgberht, and perhaps the Hymns.” 
‘Bede’s Ecclesiastical History.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
The Hermit in English Literature 35 
“This being decreed, there came (as is asserted) seven 
bishops of the Britons, and many most learned men, partic- 
ularly from their most noble monastery, . . . called 
Bancombing. . . . They that were to go to the afore- 
said council repaired first to a certain holy and discreet 
man, who was wont to lead an hermitical life among them, 
advising with him, whether they ought at the preaching of 
Augustine to forsake their traditions. . . . ‘Do you 
contrive,’ said the anchorite, ‘that he may first arrive with 
his company at the place where the synod is to be held; 
and if at your approach he shall rise up to you, hear him 
submissively, being assured that he is the servant of Christ; 
but if he shall despise you and not rise up to you, whereas 
you are more in number, let him also be despised by you.’ ’’47 
According to the historical account, Augustine did not 
rise to them; and, following the venerable hermit’s advice, 
they charged him with pride; whereupon Augustine threat- 
ened them with destruction at the hands of their enemies, 
“which,” continues Bede, “through the dispensations of Di- 
vine judgment, fell out exactly as he had predicted.” 
From among the Britons also comes the next hermit of 
literature, ‘“‘a holy man,’ who came out of Ireland, called 
“Fursey,’’ renowned, according to Bede,*§ both for his words 
and actions and remarkable for single virtues (A.D. 633). 
“Vouchsafed a heavenly vision, in which he was forewarned 
of his death, he built a monastery at Cnobher’s Town (Burg- 
castle in Suffolk). He later became desirous to rid himself 
of all business of the world, even of the monastery itself, 
and forthwith left the same and the care of souls to his 
brother, Fullan, and the priests, Goldban and Dicull, and, 
being himself free from all that was worldly, resolved to 
end his life as a hermit. He had another brother, called 
‘Ultan,’ who, after a long monastical probation, had also 
adopted the life of an anchorite. Repairing all alone to 
him, he lived a whole year with him in continence and 
prayer, and labored daily with his hands. . . . Later, 
quitting his hermitage because of the eruptions of the pa- 
gans, he went to France, where he died, and his body re- 
mained for along period uncorrupted, according to the book 
of his life, ‘all of which whoever will read it will find more 
fully described, as also about his fellow laborers.’ ’’+9 
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 657°° likewise 
presents an incident in which hermits (or anchorites) are

important figures. On the occasion of the hallowing of the 
monastery of Peterborough by Deus-dedit, Archbishop of 
Canterbury, the king (Wulfhere) declared: “And thus free 
will I make this minister, that it be subject to Rome alone; 
and it is my will that all of us who are unable to go to Rome 
shall visit St. Peter.” 
“While he was saying these words, the abbot desired of 
him that he would grant him what he should desire of him, 
and the king granted it. ‘I have here godefrihte monks who 
wish to spend their lives as anchorites if they knew where. 
And there is an island here, which is called Anchorets-isle, 
and my desire is, that we might build a minister there to the 
glory of St. Mary, so that those may dwell therein who wish 
to lead a life of peace and rest.’ ” 
The king readily assented to the request, pnd entered into 
solemn covenant confirming the bequest, which the kings 
and other dignitaries then present witnessed “with their 
fingers on the cross of Christ and assented to it with 
tongues.” The account states that “this writing was writ- 
ten six hundred and sixty-four years after the birth of our 
Lord, the seventh year of King Wulfhere, the ninth year of 
Archbishop Deus-dedit,” but says nothing further about 
Anchorets-isle.*!| Other such incidents occur with more or 
less frequency in Bede’s history. Many, like Wictbert 
(689), lived “many years a stranger in Ireland, leading 
an eremitical life in great purity,” and went, like him, on 
frequent missionary journeys—for the early hermit of 
England was earnestly and effectively evangelistic—and, 
finally, “returning to the beloved place of his peregrination, 
gave himself up to his wonted repose; and since he could 
not be profitable to strangers by teaching them the faith, he 
took care to be more useful to his own people by the example 
of his virtue.” 
Toward the latter part of the seventh century the hermit 
assumes such prominence in Bede’s literary narrative that 
we are able to recognize the prose biographic or semi-heroic 
stage, or second phase in the development of the hermit as 
an ideal in literature. As evidence of his semi-heroic qual- 
ity, we find Bede allotting five full chapters in the Ecclesi- 
astical History to the life and work of the hermit, Cuthbert, 
and writing separately also the Life and Miracles of Saint 
Cuthbert and his successors in forty-six chapters; and, be- 
sides, the life of the same hermit-saint in Latin hexameters,   
*tAnglo-Saxon Chronicle, Everyman's Library Edition, p. 155ff.

The Hermit in English Literature 37 
somewhat more briefly, but in the same order.®? Still an- 
other biography of the saint existed before Bede’s account, 
of anonymous origin. It was kept at Lyndisfarne, and Bede 
used it in part as a source. 
The prose life, which is the longest and most complete in 
detail, was probably written between 716 and 720. The 
Ecclesiastical History, which contains the seven chapters 
devoted to the life of Cuthbert and the miracles connected 
with his name, was completed in 731. From this circum- 
stance and the additional fact that in the summary of his 
works at the close of the Ecclesiastical History the same 
order is preserved, it is evident that the account in Latin 
verse was elaborated into the prose life; and this, in turn, 
made the basis of the account of the hermit-saint in the 
Ecclesiastical History, although the two accounts are by no 
means the same, and differ sufficiently to imply that newly 
discovered information may have been furnished for the 
final account, doubtless given by brothers at Lyndisfarne.** 
Although the biography in both prose versions is little 
more than a series of miraculous tales, in which the hermit- 
saint is the invariable hero, the author’s avowed purpose is 
to represent authentic history. This fact Bede sets forth 
with his customary frankness in his preface to the longer 
prose account. “I have not presumed,” he says, “without 
minute investigation, to write any of the deeds of so great 
aman, nor without the most accurate examination of cred- 
ible witnesses, to hand over what I have witnessed to be 
transcribed. Moreover, when I learnt from those who knew 
the beginning, the middle, and the end of his glorious life 
and conversation, I sometimes inserted the names of these, 
my authors, to establish the truth of my narrative, and thus 
ventured to put my pen to paper and to write. But when 
my work was arranged, but still kept back from publication, 
I frequently submitted it for perusal and correction to our 
reverend brother, Hereford, the priest, and others, who for 
a long time had well known the life and conversation of that 
man of God.”*+ 
Beginning with the boyhood of Cuthbert, which he rep- 
resents as being full of prophetic portents of his future   
"The prose life, which is addressed to “the holy and most blessed Father, Bishop 
Eadfind, and to all the congregations of Brothers also who serve Christ in the Island 
of Lyndisfarne,” refers in the preface to the versified life by Bede as follows: “And 
may your holiness know that I have already written in heroic verse, as well as in this 
prose work, which I offer to you, the life of this same, our father beloved of God, 
somewhat more briefly indeed, but in the same order, because some of our brethren 
intreated the same of me; and if you wish to have these verses, you can obtain from 
me a copy of them.”

greatness, “he sets forth many miracles which were vouch- 
safed the saint before he had assumed his monastic vows. 
Once while tending his flocks, in company with other shep- 
herds on the mountain side, he saw, while his companions 
slept, the soul of Bishop Aidan carried to heaven by angels. 
Again, in the course of a journey he was miraculously sup- 
plied with food by God. After assuming the vows of a 
monk, he entertained an angel unawares, and, while serving 
his guest earthly bread, was rewarded with bread from 
heaven. Later he often went out from the monastery, some- 
times on horseback, sometimes on foot, and preached the 
way of truth to the neighboring villages, as Boisil, his pred- 
ecessor, had done,” acquiring renown by his virtues and 
miracles. 
During all this time he engaged in many rigorous ascetic 
practices to subdue the flesh, at times spending whole nights 
away from the monastery in watchfulness and prayer. 
“One night a brother of the monastery, seeing him go out 
alone, followed him privately to see what he should do. 
But he, when he left the monastery, went down to the sea, 
which flows beneath, and, going into it until the waters 
reached his neck and arms, spent the whole night in prais- 
ing God. When the dawn of the day approached, he came 
out of the water, and, falling on his knees, began to pray 
again. Whilst he was doing this, two quadrupeds, called 
‘otters,’ came up from the sea, and, lying down before him 
on the sand, breathed upon his feet and wiped them with 
their hair, after which, having received his blessing, they 
returned to their native element. Cuthbert himself returned 
home in time to join in the accustomed hymns with the other 
brethren.’’55 
Other miracles are detailed, including prophecies, putting 
out a house on fire by prayer, and the casting out of a devil 
from the prefect’s wife, all of which serve to prepare the 
saint for his solitary life on the island of Farne. ‘After 
this,” says the account in the Ecclesiastical History (Chap- 
ter' XXVII), “Cuthbert, advancing in his meritorious and 
devout intentions, proceeded, even to the adoption of a her- 
mit life of solitude;” while the separate life says: “He re- 
joiced that from the long conversation with the world he 
was now thought worthy to be promoted to retirement and 
°5*All through his life he had pleasant doings with the animal, as many others had 
among the early English saints.” See his encounter with the birds who wasted his 
barley in Farne, the story of the fish the eagle killed for him, and the ravens who 
stole his thatch. “Cuthbert in this relation is the St. Francis of England, and it is 
agreeable to think, and may have more in it than mere fancy, that the love of Wal- 
ter Scott and Burns, lowlanders like Cuthbert, for the poetry of animal life, had a 
far-away origin in Cuthbert’s affectionate regard for birds and beasts—creatures who, 
he thought, served God and ought to love God’s ministers.”—Brooke: The History of 
Early English Literature, p. 221.  
-P-A-G-E-37
The Hermit in English Literature 39 
divine contemplation.”’ Both accounts indicate, therefore, 
the high regard in which the hermit was held in the monas- 
tic world at the time of Bede. 
The island to which Cuthbert retired was wild and deso- 
late. ‘No one before God’s servant, Cuthbert,” says his 
biographer, “had ever dared to inhabit this island alone, on 
account of the evil spirits which reside there; but when this 
servant of God came, armed with the helmet of salvation, 
the shield of faith, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the 
word of God, all the fiery darts of the wicked were extin- 
guished, and that wicked enemy with all his followers was 
put to flight.” 
There follows a description of Cuthbert’s hermitage. 
“The building is almost of a round form, from wall to wall 
about four or five poles in extent. The wall on the outside 
is higher than a man; but within, by excavating the rock, 
he made it much deeper to prevent the eyes and thoughts 
from wandering, that the mind might be wholly bent on 
heavenly things and the pious inhabitant might behold noth- 
ing from his residence but the heavens above him. The 
wall was constructed, not of hewn stones or of brick and 
mortar, but of rough stones and turf, which had been taken 
out of the ground within. Some of them were so large 
that four men could hardly have lifted them, but Cuthbert 
himself, with angels helping him, had raised them up and 
placed them on the wall. There were two chambers in the 
house—one an oratory, the other for domestic purposes. He 
finished the walls of them by digging around and cutting 
away the natural soil within and without and formed the 
roof out of rough poles and straw. Moreover, at the land- 
ing place of the island he built a large house, in which the 
brethren who visited him might be received and rest them- 
selves, and not far from it there was a fountain of water 
for their use.’ 
Following this description of his dwelling, twenty-eight 
chapters are devoted to recounting the various miracles 
which the hermit himself performed or which were wrought 
posthumously through the power of his sacred relics. The 
former include such feats as healing the sick, quelling the 
sea, prophesying and giving wholesome advice in trouble, 
and making the fowls of the air his servants. Since the 
last-named supernatural power is recurrent in the hermit 
life of early English literature, the incidents may be here 
quoted. 
Deciding to live by the fruit of his hands, like the hermits 
of old, he planted wheat near his hermitage; but this fail- 
ing to generate, he planted barley, which came up both un-

expectedly and abundantly. “It no sooner began to nen 
than the birds came and wasted it most grievously. 
‘Why do you touch that which you have not sown?’ he’ in- 
quired of the birds. ‘If you have received license from God, 
do what he allows you; but if not, get you gone, and do no 
further injury to that which belongs to another.’ He had 
no sooner spoken than all the flock of birds departed and 
never returned to feed upon that field. . . . In driving 
away the birds he imitated the reverend and holy father, 
St. Anthony, who by his word alone drove away the wild 
asses from the garden which he had planted.” 
A still more striking incident illustrating the hermit’s 
power over birds is also recorded. ‘‘There were some crows 
which had long been accustomed to build in the island. One 
day the man of God saw them, whilst making their nest, pull 
out the thatch of the hut which he had made to entertain 
the brethren in and carry it away to build with. He imme- 
diately stretched out his hand and warned them to do no 
harm to the brethren. As they neglected his command, he 
said to them: ‘In the name of Jesus Christ, depart as speed- 
ily as possible, and do not presume to remain any longer in 
the place to which you are doing harm.’ He had scarcely 
uttered these words when they flew away in sorrow. At 
the end of three days one of the two returned, and, finding 
the man of God digging in the field, spread out its wings 
in a pitiable manner, and, bending its head down before his 
feet, in a tone of humility asked pardon by the most expres- 
sive signs it could, and obtained from the reverend father 
permission to return. It then departed and fetched its com- 
panion; and when they had both arrived, they brought in 
their beaks a large piece of hog’s lard, which the man of God 
used to show to the brethren who visited him and kept to 
grease their shoes with; testifying to them how earnestly 
they should strive after humility, when a dumb bird that 
had acted so insolently hastened by prayers, lamentations, 
and presents to obliterate injury which it had done to man.” 
This benign relationship between hermits and animals, 
including wild animals as well as the gentler kind, is an in- 
variable characteristic of the hermit’s personality through- 
out English literature, and is so striking as to call for some 
exposition. A feasible explanation may be found in the 
biblical account of Daniel’s remarkable escape from destruc- 
tion in the lions’ den (Dan. 6: 22): “God hath sent his 
angel and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not 
hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
    
The Hermit in English Literature 41 
me.” This theory of the power of innocency** in man to 
control the entire animal world is likewise found in Gen. 1: 
28, when God commands Adam before his fall to “have do- 
minion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air, 
and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” 
It would, therefore, seem that the hermit had reacquired 
his pristine innocence through prayer, contemplation, and 
his ascetic life; and animals in general recognized this fact 
by their obedience and fellowship. (Compare poems of 
William Blake and Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner.) While 
this power was not confined to hermits alone (cf. The Twi- 
light Saint, by Stark Young, in One-Act Plays, ed. Helen 
Louise Cohen, New York, 1921, p. 227ff), the fact at least 
is significant. This relationship with animals is frequently 
attended by a love of external nature, and perhaps we have 
here the beginning of the lyric mood, which later becomes 
highly predominant in English poetry. 
For two years toward the latter part of his life Cuthbert 
“adorned the office of bishop,” although greatly loath to give 
up his solitary life. At the end of this, perceiving the ap- 
proach of death, he “divested himself of his episcopal duties 
and returned to his much-loved solitude,” and continued, as 
he had done before, to subdue both his body and mind with 
accustomed severity in order “‘to prepare for the joy of ever- 
lasting happiness through pain and temporal affliction.” 
Even up to the hour of his death he continued to minister 
to those about him, and, passing to his reward, the objects 
of his abode which had been hallowed by his presence con- 
tinued to have miraculous powers. A boy possessed by a 
devil was cured by some dirt from the place where the water 
in which his corpse had been washed had been thrown; a 
paralytic was healed by means of his shoe; a sick man was 
cured at his tomb by prayer. The Ecclesiastical History 
records two such miracles not mentioned in the life—that 
of one who was cured of distemper in the eye by relics of 
the dead saint, and of another who was cured of a palsy at 
his tomb. 
Bede records how Ethelwold and Fulgeld, successors to 
Cuthbert in his hermitage, were likewise endowed with mi- 
raculous powers, and the latter was himself cured of a swell- 
ing in the face by means of the covering of the wall, a piece * 
of skin which he found hanging in Cuthbert’s hermitage. 
The life of St. Guthlac, written originally in Latin by 
‘*There seems little reason to doubt that this theory is shared by the writers of 
romances of chivalry in England. In Sir Bevis of Hampton (cir. 1300), when 
Josian, the heroine, is left by Bevis in the temporary care of the chamberlain, Boni- 
face, the two take refuge in a lions’ cave. The lions devour Boniface and his horse, 
but because of the potent virtue of Josian in her combined character of king’s daugh- 
ter and pure maiden they lay their heads in her lap and refuse to harm her.

  42 The Hermit in English Literature 
Felix,5? usually called a “monk of Crowland,” between the 
years 747 and 749 and dedicated by its author to Alfwold 
of East Anglia, continues the literature of prose biography 
of the semi-heroic hermit. It was translated into Anglo- 
Saxon in the tenth or eleventh century by some unknown 
writer without the omission of any material incidents, 
though the florid rhetoric of Felix, who, like Bede, never 
knew personally his hero, but drew his material from per- 
sons who had, is much pruned and cropped. Only one com- 
plete MS. of the translation is known to exist, preserved in 
the Cottonian collection in the volume marked “‘Vespasian 
D XXI,” though an extract comprising two chapters, pre- 
senting a different text, is among the contents of the MS. 
known as the “Codex Vercellensis.” For the purpose of this 
study no lengthy analysis of either the Latin life or the Anglo- 
Saxon translation will be necessary, however, since the 
work in its general characteristics is quite similar to that 
of Bede’s life of Cuthbert and derives its chief interest from 
the fact that it is, in part at least, the basis of the remark- 
able poem, now generally assigned to Cynewulf, called 
“Guthlac.” 
Certain details appear in the two prose accounts, how- 
ever, which indicate the near approach of the consciously 
literary or heroic-ideal stage of development of the hermit in 
literature. Guthlac’s birth occurs amid a portentous dis- 
play on the part of nature. His youth is filled with rapine, 
riotous outbursts, followed by a mature life of extraordinary 
piety and grace. On assuming the life of a hermit in a wild 
fen infested by accursed spirits, he is beset continually, 
attacked by the devils in many hideous shapes. The devils 
vary the form of their temptations. Once, assuming the 
appearance of angels of light, “sliding down from the air, 
they seek to win him through flattery of the hermit life to 
waste his life through excessive fasting and severe bodily 
punishment. Failing in this well-disguised attempt, a great 
host of devils appears, filling all the house with their com- 
ing.” The passage which follows is full of imaginative 
touches: “They had great heads and a long neck and lean 
visages; they were filthy and squalid in their beards; and 
they had rough ears and distorted faces and fierce eyes and 
foul mouths; and their teeth were like horse tusks, and their 
  “Felix, who from the dedication of his book seems to have been an East Anglian monk, stated that he derived his knowledge of Guthlac from Wilfind, Cissa, and Beccel” (the first and last mentioned in the narrative). ‘‘who had known the saint.” 
There is little reason to doubt that he gave the main facts of his life with substan- 
tial accuracy, “but it is clear that he formed his work and adorned it with accepted models. Thus he borrowed from Bede’s Vita St. Cuthberta both incidents and de- 
scriptive passages, and it is not unlikely that the entire text is a mosaic, of which Felix should be regarded as compiler rather than author.”—Gerould: Saints’ Legends, Boston and New York, 1916, p. 80.
-P-A-G-E-41
“The Hermit in English Literature 43 
throats were filled with flame, and they were grating in 
their voice; they had crooked shanks and knees big and 
great behind and distorted toes, and shrieked hoarsely with 
their voices.” 
There follows here one of the most spirited passages in 
the whole narrative: “They bound Guthlac and brought him 
to the black fen and sunk him in the muddy waters, and then 
tore his flesh by dragging him through the brambles, and 
commanded him to depart from the wilderness, and threat- 
ened worse tortures if he did not depart.’”®* Guthlac replies 
with spiritual truth. The spirits then beat him with iron 
whips, and afterwards brought him on their creaking wings 
amidst the cold regions of the air, and finally brought him 
to hell’s door and threatened to hurl him into the torments 
of this abyss; but Guthlac again rebuked them. In the mo- 
ment of his greatest distress, Guthlac’s guardian, St. Bar- 
tholomew, “shining with heavenly brightness amidst the 
dim darkness of the black hell,’ appears and commands the 
evil spirits to desist from their tortures and return Guthlac 
to his abode. As they are returning, there meets them in 
the air a host of holy spirits, singing: “Holy men shall go 
from virtue to virtue.” He reaches home in the early dawn; 
and as he is about his orisons, he sees two of the cursed 
spirits standing there weeping and wailing. Upon inquiry 
he learns that they mourn because their power over him is 
broken and he has entirely conquered, after which they van- 
ish “even as smoke.” 
In spite of this last statement, three other distinct attacks 
by the devils are recorded to break down the hermit’s re- 
sistance to their power; but all their efforts meet with fail- 
ure. As in the life of Cuthbert, many wonderful miracles 
are detailed, and the saint’s remarkable power over the 
feathered kind is likewise attested on several occasions. 
One incident records that once during the visit of Wilfrith, 
a venerable brother, two sparrows lit fearlessly upon the 
hermit’s shoulders and “lifted up their song.’””’ When Wil- 
frith asked for an explanation of this strange power of his 
over the birds, the saint replied: “Hast thou never learnt, 
brother Wilfrith, in holy writ, that he who hath led his life 
after God’s will, the wild beasts and wild birds have become 
more intimate with him; and the man who would (se man 
ge hure wolde fram woruld—mannum his lif libban /at hine 
englas fe near comon) pass his life apart from worldly men, 
to him the angels approach nearer? But he who frequently

-P-A-G-E-42
  44 The Hermit in English Literature 
longeth for the converse of worldly men cannot meet with 
an angelic discourse.” 
Besides many miracles of healing and prophecy wrought 
by Guthlac himself or the potency of his apparel, similar to 
those narrated of Cuthbert, several examples of the hermit’s 
omniscience are given. On one occasion an abbot, accom- 
panied by two attendants, started to visit the saint. On the 
way the two attendants begged leave to be excused from 
making the visit in order to attend to other needful business, 
and the abbot granted their request. Guthlac, however, 
inquired of them from the abbot, and, when the latter ex- 
plained their behavior, told the abbot that they had deceived 
him and gone to the house of a widow and there become 
drunk. On their return the abbot confronted them with 
Guthlac’s revelation, and they confessed that what he had 
revealed to the abbot was true. 
Of a simliar nature, but combining his omniscience with 
his struggle with the devils, is the story of his attempted 
assassination by Beccel, a priestly companion of his solitude. 
.Tempted by the devil to take the life of his master in order 
that he might succeed him, “have more of the world 
honor him as they now do him” (Guthlac), Beccel was about 
to proceed with his evil designs while in the act of shaving- 
the hermit; but his purpose was revealed to Guthlac. He 
reproved the priest, who fell at his feet and craved the 
saint’s pardon; whereupon Guthlac forgave him, and prom- 
ised also to be “his helper in all his trials.” 
With the poem Guthlac we enter definitely and unmis- 
takably the field of the hermit of literature; for here we 
have an epic legend, based upon a known source by a liter- 
ary artist who selects his material and writes with conscious 
power. In this respect the poem presents an interesting 
study of literary evolution, besides furnishing us with the 
ideal essence of hermit character for future use in liter- 
ature. 
The poem presents certain textual difficulties which may 
be disposed of briefly, since such matters lie out of the do- 
main of this particular study. Suffice it to say that the 
poem, from a textual point of view, has been divided into 
two parts by some Anglo-Saxon scholars and by others into 
three, while a division also exists as to its authorship. Some 
attribute the poem as a whole to Cynewulf, while others 
maintain that he wrote only the second part. Practically 
all agree, however, that the poem should be divided on the 
basis of style and literary workmanship, and. most authori- 
ties agree in making a twofold division, known generally as 
Guthlac A, usually termed as Guthlac, the Hermit (vv. 1—
-P-A-G-E-43
  
The Hermit in English Literature 45 
790), and Guthlac B, or Guthlac’s death (vv. 791—138538). 
In style and poetic power Guthlac A is inferior to Guthlac 
B. Those who maintain that Cynewulf wrote both poems 
explain the difference in merit on the ground that a long 
interval occurred between the two compositions.®? What- 
ever the case, the division of the poem into logical units will 
prove useful for our analysis. 
The poem consists of 1,353 lines, the ending of which ap- 
parently has been lost, and appears in the Exeter Book MS. 
fols. 33a—52b immediately after the Christ. Guthlac A 
describes the entire life of the saint, telling how he turned 
from the evil ways of his youth, became a hermit, endured 
temptation in his solitude, and died. Guthlac B reviews 
briefly the fame and temptations of Guthlac and gives with 
great detail the circumstances attending his death. The 
first part differs considerably from the life as narrated by 
Felix, while the second part follows Felix’ account closely. 
Moreover, the second part shows a more imaginative and 
experienced hand, while the first part’ shows little poetic power."° 
Whether the poem be the work of one or more hands or 
the product of the same author with a considerable interim 
between, it is sufficient to know that we have an epic poem 
with a hermit-hero, which epitomizes and emphasizes 
through the writer’s choice of his materials the hermit ideal. 
The poem opens with a mournful note, which is Cynewul- 
fian, and, in addition, furnishes us with some historical in- 
terest, if we may read in it a reference to the evil days of 
Northumbria at the time of the poem’s probable composition. 
In such a contemplative mood, which is highly appropriate 
for his subject, the poet drops into a classification of saints, 
the highest of whom are hermits. ‘Some who sojourn in 
the wastes, of their self-wills, seek out and have their dwell- 
ings in darksome caves; these await their heavenly homes.” 
So great, in fact, is the piety of hermits that Satan him-   
n the whole, . . . it is most probable that Cynewulf, at the beginning of 
his Christian life, while his imagination was yet hampered by his natural avoidance 
of all profane poetry, wrote the first part of Guthlac from oral tradition, and then, 
much later in life, when his imagination was delivered by the peace in his soul, took 
up his old work again, after the production of the Life of Guthlac, and added to it 
an end, with a special account of the anchorite’s death. The free and noble manner of this part is a great contrast to the barren and limping movement of the first part. Could we but be certain that Cynewulf wrote both parts at different times, the 
comparison of the poet in the one to the poet in the other would be a fascinating bit 
of criticism.” Other interesting views are presented by the same author in the above- 
mentioned work, and the subject is likewise discussed with discrimination by Gerould in his Saints’ Legends (Boston and New York, 1916), p. 79ff, and by Charles W. Kennedy in the Poems of Cynewulf, London and New York, 1910, p. 51. 
That we may have a cycle of poems with Guthlac or other similar saints as the 
hero is suggested by Gordon Hall Gerould in his Saints’ Legends (New York, 1916), 
p. 79. These two poems are the only examples preserved (however many may have 
existed) with a native saint as a hero. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44

self is envious*! and uses his most ingenious inventions to 
win them back to the world. “Often he who envieth them 
life bringeth loathsome dread upon them, while revealing 
some horror whiles idle glory. The cunning murderer hath 
craft of both and harrieth these hermits.” But, in spite of 
their peculiar danger, hermits are not without ample pro- 
tection. “Yet angels stand before them, armed with weap- 
ons of the soul, heedful of their safety, guarding the lives 
of the holy men, knowing their hope is in the Lord. Chosen 
champions are they, serving the King who never holdeth 
back reward from them that know his love.” 
With this introduction the author launches at once into 
his narrative of “how Guthlac informed his heart according 
to the will of God, and scorned all sin and worldly weal; was 
ever mindful of the realms above, a home in heaven. , 
So that he went to dwell alone in a mountain house, humbly 
devoting all his soul to God, which ’tis said in youth he 
“marred with earthly joys. A holy warden (who is none 
other than the apostle Bartholomew) guarded him from 
Sched steadfastly strengthening his pure heart in ghostly 
good.” 
Scarcely had Guthlac taken up his abode in “that hidden 
place, waste and barren and void of folk,” than he was beset 
by the fiends. ‘“Oft there came horror awful and unknown, 
the hate of olden foes, mighty in cunning craft, and unto 
him they showed their face. There they had held afore- 
time many a seat, but, shorn of honor, went their way, a 
wandering wide, beating through the air. . . . Neither 
may they find a dwelling place on earth, nor doth the air 
soothe them into rest of body ; but, lacking home and shelter, 
they moan their wretchedness and long to die, yearning for 
God to grant to them an end of sorrows in the throes of 
death.” 
The hermit, however, through the aid of the angel sent 
to guard him, boldly resists their attacks and blandishments. 
The fiends are discomfited, but, filled with ire, again and 
again return to the assault with the violence of despair. 
“Then was a tumult aroused. The exiles stood in hordes 
about the hill.’ A shriek arose, the wail of woeful souls. 
. Thou vowest thou wilt gain home among us? Thou 
art God’s pauper. Though thou win the land, wherewith 
shalt thou live? No man will bring food hither unto thee. 
Hunger and thirst shall be thy hardy foes, if thou, like the 
wild beasts, depart lonely from thy home. Vain is the ad- 
venture. Depart from this place. No man may teach thee 
*%1Cf. Ramayama, also Satan Against Solitude, etc.
-P-A-G-E-45
The Hermit in English Literature 47 
better counsel than all this host. We will be gracious unto 
thee if thou wilt hear us.” 
Again they seek to break his resolution by temptations 
which appeal to fleshly lust. “They raised him up on high 
and bestowed power on him beyond the race of men, so that 
he saw before his eyes all the bearings of those cloistered 
men under the sway of holy shepherds who have passed 
their lives in vain delight with idle wealth and gained treas- 
ure and splendid raiment, as is the way of youth when fear 
of old age doth not bridle it.” Finding their wiles unavail- 
ing, they even bring him to the gates of hell and there seek 
to frighten him into submission, ‘‘as is the way of fiends 
when they are fain to trick the souls of righteous men. 
: Thou shalt sink deep in hell, nor any whit shalt thou 
possess the radiance of the Lord in heaven, celestial dwell- 
ings, . . . for that in the flesh thou hast accomplished 
over many sinful deeds. We will requite thee now for every 
guilt, as may be most grievous unto thee, in grimmest tor- 
ment of the soul.” 
Guthlac, however, remains firm, and at the command of 
God’s holy herald is brought back tenderly in triumph to 
his abode, where a tribe of forest birds with their notes joy- 
fully proclaim his return. ‘“Oft he held out food to them, 
and they were wont to fly in hunger round his hand in great 
desire, rejoicing in his succor. So that kindly soul, severed 
from mankind’s delights, served the Lord, having joy in 
wild things after he forsook the world.” 
The second part of the poem recounts with elaborate detail 
many of the same trials, but the greatest portion is taken 
up in recounting the details of the saint’s death. In the 
midst of his own trials Guthlac has time, however, to alle- 
viate the pains of others. ‘Human heralds came to him in 
lowliness, and there, after their journey, found help and 
comfort of heart at the hand of that holy saint in that bliss- 
ful plain. No one there was, indeed, who went away cast 
down in heart, wretched, or hopeless. But the holy man by 
his noble power healed every mortal, every man racked by 
pain or sick at heart. He healed both soul and body as long 
as the Warden of life, Eternal and Almighty, would grant 
him that he might enjoy bliss and life in the world.” 
Having conquered the fiends, Guthlac now faces the last 
fight of all against that solitary Warrior “who is not weary 
in the fight.” Attended by his serving thane, he prepares 
for his forthgoing. He reveals to his companion the secret 
of his angelic defender, sends a parting message to his sis- 
ter, and gives words of comfort and sage counsel to his 
weeping servant. “Then was Guthlac’s soul led blessedly  
-P-A-G-E-46
  48 The Hermit in English Literature 
upon its upward way. Angels carried it unto its eternal 
joy. ‘The body grew cold, empty of life under the upper air. 
Then a radiance shone forth, brightest of beams. All that 
beacon, that heavenly brilliance, lay round about the holy 
house from the ground upward like a tower of flame, raised 
upward to the roof of heaven, seen brighter than the sun 
under the sky, a beauty as of noble stars, and bands of 
angels chanted songs of triumph; the sound was heard in 
the air under heaven, the harmony of noble voices. 
“More unlike it was, 
And more winsome there, ‘than in world of ours 
Any speech may say; how the sound and odor, 
How the clang celestial, and the saintly song 
Heard in heaven were—high, triumphant praise of God, 
Rapture following rapture. 
All its field-floor shook.” “All our island trembled. 
The poem breaks off suddenly as the messenger is deliver- 
ing the saint’s message to his sister. 
Another hermit, whose life is the subject of posthumous 
fame in the literature of this period, is that of St. Neot, a 
contemporary and a reputed kinsman of King Alfred. AlI- 
together there are five lives of St. Neot extant, and it is 
probable that still others existed. The oldest of these pre- 
served, which is in the form of an Anglo-Saxon homily, 
relates that St. Neot is often visited by Alfred, whom he 
warns of future sorrow and causes him to send offerings 
to Pope Marinus for the English school at Rome. After 
Neot’s death his prophecy to Alfred is fulfilled. Guthrum 
and his followers take possession of the country, and Alfred, 
overcome with fear, forsakes his army and his countrymen 
and becomes a royal exile in disguise. Later Neot appears 
to Alfred by night, and, after offering him assistance, prom- 
ises him an end of his sorrows. “I go before thee; follow 
after me, and thy people also.” The hermit’s promise is 
verified. Alfred’s foes are conquered, and Guthrum, accom- 
panied by thirty warriors, sues for peace. 
In the next life of the saint the facts are expanded and 
several details added. Neot is declared to be of royal birth, 
and apparently ‘a brother of Alfred, since he is called the son 
of “Edulfus (4thelwulf), the ruler of Wessex and Kent.” 
The episode of Pope Marinus is likewise expanded; and 
Alfred, after sending money for the English school, as before 
related, is rewarded with a piece of the true cross, and Neot 
reproves the king for the specific sins of tyranny and pride. 
In this version St. Neot appears to Alfred twice in visions 
and leads the English troops of Alfred in person to victory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
    The Hermit in English Literature 49 
In the three remaining lives of the saint, one of which is in 
verse, the facts are essentially the same. 
Another work, entitled “Chronican Fani Sancti Neoti, 
sive Annales Joan, Asserii ut nonnulus viditur,” composed 
probably in the twelfth century, from which Bishop Parker 
obtained the Neot Legends, which he incorporated into his 
edition of Asser in 1574, now generally discredited, con- 
tains Neot’s reproofs of Alfred for early sins. Neot, called 
his relative, predicts Alfred’s distress; but the king re- 
fuses to act upon the prophecy, and is accordingly punished, 
as before stated. The spirit of Neot likewise appears to the 
king, promising relief and predicting victory, since he him- 
self will go all day before the king’s banners so that Alfred 
may fight the enemy without fear. 
The subsequent development of this story in early middle- 
English times shows a remarkable confusion in saintly leg- 
ends and furnishes a strange commentary on the accuracy 
of chroniclers of this period. In the Historia Regum of 
Simeon of Durham (fl 1130) there is inserted an episode 
for the year 877 which details how Alfred was encouraged 
by Cuthbert in a special revelation and informed that he 
would be victorious in the approaching battle. As a result 
of this service on the part of Cuthbert, the chronicler re- 
lates that Alfred ever after held the saint in especial honor. 
The same facts are elaborated with slight variations in the 
History of the Church of Durham, with the addition that 
Alfred gratefully sent gifts to the saint’s shrine by his son, 
Edward. 
In the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto, of uncertain date, 
another singular incident involving Cuthbert and Alfred is 
set forth. On one occasion, when Alfred and his wife are 
left with only one attendant, while his followers are gone to 
catch fish for food, Cuthbert appears in the guise of a pil- 
grim. The king offers the stranger the one remaining loaf 
of bread and a bit of wine that is left. The attendant expos- 
tulates with his lord over the prodigality, whereupon the 
saint suddenly disappears. The fishers soon return with 
abundant supplies, having succeeded in catching three ship 
loads of fish. Another version of this story relates that 
Alfred gave a half of the loaf to the pilgrim, and that the

king and the saint is recorded in detail, and it is further 
stated that when the saint appears in the vision he is ac-

  50 The Hermit in English Literature 
companied by a wonderful light,** while his prophecy and 
counsel are fully elaborated. 
William of Malmesburg (d. 1173), in his Gesta Regum 
Anglorum, gives a somewhat different form of the Cuthbert 
legend. In his narrative the hermit appears to the sleep- 
ing king at Athelney, and, after introducing himself, declares 
that since England has paid the penalty of the crimes, 
Heaven will now grant her mercy and restore Alfred to the 
throne. In support of his prophecy the saint announces 
that the fishers who have gone in quest of food will soon 
appear with abundance of food in baskets, despite the fact 
that the weather is unpropitious and the rivers covered with 
ice, and closes the interview by warning the king that in 
the future he must not neglect his devotion to God and the 
saint. 
The king’s message is further corroborated through a sim- 
ilar appearance of the saint to the mother of the king. In 
the De Genealogia Regum Anglorum of Ailred of Riveaux 
(d. 1166) the Cuthbert legend likewise appears instead of 
that of Neot, and the character of Alfred is represented as 
religious both before and after the saint’s help. Roger of 
Hovendon (fl 1150), in his Annaliwm Pars Prior (Stubbs, 
Rolls Series, 1871, Vol. I, pp. 41-50), also represents the 
Cuthbert legend without change. 
The Neot legend reappears in the chronicle of Roger de 
Wendover (d. 1236), whose work is continued by Matthew 
Paris (d. 1259) and incorporated by him in the Chronica 
Majora (Luard, Rolls Series, 1872, Vol. I, pp. 403-435), 
and the account again figures in the Flores Historianum of 
the mythical Matthew of Westminster. Roger de Wen- 
dover was himself indebted apparently to an earlier chron- 
icle, which was compiled about the year 1188. In this ac- 
count there is a return to the more original Neot legend. 
Alfred visits the hermit Neot, whose solitary abode is near 
Hamstoke, and is severely reprimanded for his pride and 
fiery lusts. The king, promising repentance, is visited the 
same night in a vision by Cuthbert, who declares to him that 
his kingdom will be restored to him; and, on awakening, 
Alfred declares that he will erect a monastery in that place. 
Here for the first time we have a remarkable mixture of 
both the Neot and the Cuthbert legends. 
Another writer, John of Wallingford, who wrote about 
the same time as Roger of Wendover (Gale, Rerum Anqli- 
carum Scriptores Veteris, 1, pp. 535-538), gives an exalted 
view of Neot’s character, and at the same time depreciates 
that of Alfred. He gives a long extract from the Life of 
“SCf, a similar phenomenon in the passing of Guthlae in Cynewulf’s poem.

St. Neot, and declares that the character of the king did not 
improve even after receiving assistance from the saint. In 
‘the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (Wright, Rolls Series, 
Os Vol. 1, pp. 387-394), the Cuthbert legend is again 
retold. 
Still other chronicles carry forward the legends of the 
two hermits with a strange admixture of facts and fancy. 
In the Polychronicon Ranulphi Higden, with the English 
translation, etc. (Babington, Rolls Series, 1869, Vol. VI, pp. 
352-402), a work that was subsequently translated into 
English by John de Trevisa (d. 1420), a new element is 
added in making Alfred, upon the advice of Neot, the 
founder of common schools of various kinds at Oxford. 
Neot’s reproofs to Alfred are strangely omitted; but Cuth- 
bert appears to Alfred as in former legends, though this 
time Alfred is reading the Scriptures, while his followers 
are fishing. Another work, the so-called “Bromton Chron- 
icle” (Chronicon Johannis Bromton in Twysden’s History, 
Aug. Scripts Decem, p. 726, ascribed by one MS. to John 
Bromton, Abbot of Jorvaux, fl 1463), whose authorship 
is really unknown, but belongs probably to the fourteenth 
century, declares not only that Alfred founded the Univer- 
sity of Oxford at the instigation of Neot, but also made a 
division of his revenues, based on Asser’s account, as a sort 
of endowment—i. e., for maintenance. 
The founding of Oxford, through the influence of Neot, 
is again recorded in the Liber de Hyda (Edwards, Rolls Se- 
ries, 1886, pp. 28-51), a monastic chronicle composed about 
the beginning of the fifteenth century. The account de- 
clares that the university was founded in 886, and that the 
faculty included Neot and Grimbald in theology and Asser 
in grammar and rhetoric. “The lectures,” the chronicle 
further declares, ‘were all given in the presence of Alfred, 
whose memory will dwell like honey upon the lips of all.” 
The same story appears in the Chronicle of England, by 
John Capgrave (d. 1464); (see Higeston, Rolls Series, 
1858, p. 113). The entry appears as follows: “In this tyme 
regned Alered in Yngland; the fourt son of Adelwold.. He 
began to regn in year of our Lord 872. This man, be the 
conicelle of St. Ned, mad an open scole of divers sciens at 
Oxenford.” 
Again, in the Historia of Ingulf (Fulman, Rerum Angli- 
carum Veterum, Oxford, 1684, Tom 1, pp. 25-28), purport- 
ing to be the work of an abbot of Crowland in the eleventh 
century, but generally held now to be a forgery, composed 
at the beginning of the fifteenth century, there appears an 
elaborate account of the story of St. Cuthbert similar to the
-P-A-G-E-50
  52 The Hermit in English Literature 
version given in Higden’s Polychronicon. In this account 
Bishop Werfrith becomes St. Werfrith, to whom both St. 
Neot and Alfred offer prayers. : 
A last chronicle, by Robert Fabyan (d. 1513) ; (see Henry 
Ellis, London, 1811, pp. 165-170), records the story of St. 
a, and Alfred, but omits that of the hermit St. 
eot. 
In the course of this chapter we have endeavored to show 
in detail by historical and literary remains how the hermit 
in England developed gradually from a mysterious religious 
ascetic into a religious hero, the object of the deepest vener- 
ation, until there was established a literary usage in regard 
to hermits, which we may term the “hermit tradition.”” While 
this tradition is by no means complete, since each age made 
its own literary contribution and gave its own particular 
emphasis, the fundamental elements which made up the 
tradition or ideal are, nevertheless, recognizable, and, it is 
to be hoped, have now been satisfactorily established. 
Like his prototype of the Eastern desert, the English her- 
mit was a voluntary solitary, who took up his abode in some 
distant waste for the purpose of subduing his evil passions 
and indulging in penitential practices for past sins. His 
physical food was of the simplest, and his mental food ‘‘con- 
tinual meditation upon the vanity of the world, the sinful- 
ness of the flesh, the glories of heaven, and the horrors of 
hell.” Like the hermits described in the Indian epic, The 
Ramayana, his progress was, however, continually beset 
with interruptions and obstacles in the form of subtle and 
powerful temptations devised and executed by the Prince 
of Devils, as has been indicated, especially in the lives of St. 
Guthlac, though this was likewise a part of every hermit’s 
existence. In his struggles, however, he was ably assisted 
by the saints and angels, and always achieved a victory over 
his foes. 
Unlike the Oriental hermit (Christian or pagan), the 
English hermit was also interested in the world around him, 
and gave succor and counsel to all who asked assistance, 
sometimes leaving his solitary habitation for this purpose, 
and extending always hospitality and shelter to those who 
visited his abode. Like the old Hebrew prophets, he medi- 
ated powerfully between God and man; and, even more 
effectively than the clergy, he exemplified the Christian vir- 
tues and the Christian ideal. As such, he became the-uni- 
°If the large amount of space given to Cuthbert and Guthlac in this chapter seems 
somewhat out of keeping with their merits in literary history, it may be said that 
the former most completely foreshows the essential qualities of the hermit ideal in 
later literature, while the latter shows the early blending of the pagan and the Chris- 
tian spirit which underlies the great mystery of existence of which the hermit is the 
most complete, if not altogether satisfying, exemplification.   
 
-P-A-G-E-51

versal object of pious veneration. The afflicted and diseased 
besought his help and were effectively healed. Miracles of 
healing continued to be wrought after his death through his 
sacred relics. Even kings sought his counsel, and their po- 
litical fortunes were affected according as they followed or 
failed to follow his advice. His superhuman powers like- 
wise extended to the wild beasts and fowls of the air, over 
whom he exerted a powerful, but benign, influence. Finally, 
he presented, in contrast to the selfish activities of those 
around him, the opportunity to observe the merits, real or 
imaginary, of the contemplative life as opposed to the prac- 
tical. While this last-named philosophy of life was not 
much discussed in England up to this time, it became in- 
creasingly popular as a subject for debate in the later cen- 
turies and formed an interesting and extensive subject for 
controversy as one aspect of the English romanticism. 
Strange and improbable as many of these attributes of 
the hermit may seem to the present age, they were, never- 
theless, powerfully effective in certain periods of English 
history. In the subsequent chapters the varying vicissi- 
tudes of the traditional hermit in literature will be traced, 
showing how that peculiar complex called the “spirit of the 
age’ is variously affected by the one ingredient element, 
which we may now hereafter refer to specifically as the her- 
mit tradition in English literature.

CHAPTER II. 
THE HERMIT IN THE RELIGIOUS LITERATURE OF 
MIDDLE ENGLISH 
From the standpoint of subject-matter the literature of 
the middle-English period divides itself quite naturally, for 
the most part, into two classes—religious and romantic. In 
both groups the hermit appears with consistent regularity 
and the general lack of prominence which in real life char- 
acterized his solitary existence. To the religious literature 
he contributed, as forecasted in the last chapter, the highest 
spiritual essence; or, to use a more Gothic figure, in the 
ecclesiastical edifice of the Middle Ages he was the spiritual 
capstone in the architectural design. 
In order to here achieve a logical sequence otherwise im- 
possible, it is desirable to treat fully and finally the hermit 
in the religious literature of the middle-English period 
(cir. 1050-1400) in the present chapter, waiving wherever 
it appears expedient any attempt at exact chronology, which, 
at best in this period, is dubious and relatively unimportant. 
Two types of religious literature dealing with hermits 
showed remarkable development in middle English—saints’ 
legends and pious tales. The former, already popular, as 
we have seen, attained remarkable vogue in the church rit- 
ual during this period, especially during the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries. As the number of saints and saints’ 
days multiplied, the prominence accorded their legends in 
religious service increased proportionately. “The Acta 
Sanctorum made their way from a brief passage in the Lit- 
urgy before the Epistle with a brief exposition of the legend, 
first to a reading at the close of Prime of a chapter of the 
acts of the saint for the following day, and then to intro- 
duction into the Nocturnes, where they developed from con- 
cise notices to elaborated accounts.” By degrees “the 
legends pushed aside the Scriptures and the homilies in the 
Lectiones, though often only a part of the legend was read. 
To meet these conditions, to satisfy enthusiasm for an indi- 
vidual story or the needs for a particular common or local 
occasion, isolated or special legend pieces were composed.’ 
Accordingly, it became necessary to collect or compose for 
the purposes of worship special groups of discourses on 
saints, covering all, or at least large sections of the festivals

of the year. By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries 
this usage had become so well defined that saints’ legends, 
for the most part, displaced the homilies proper for the fes- 
tivals of the saints, crowding the regular homilies over to 
Sundays and the festivals in the life of Christ. In fact, the 
intrusion went so far as to furnish a part of the expository 
portion of the Sunday homily in the form of one or more 
legends from the lives of saints as an exemplum or illustra- 
tive narrative. ‘Indeed, as time passed, except in the hom- 
ilies of Wycliffe and his immediate followers, who were op- 
posed to appeal by narrative from other than the Bible itself, 
the vogue of the legend by the end of the fourteenth century 
caused the homily to be composed largely of stories or tales 
from other than scriptural sources.’”’6* 
As a result of these conditions there developed the Pro- 
prium Sanctorum, or legendary—a cycle of saints’ legends. 
Sometimes the work was made up of legends alone; some- 
times they were added to a homily cycle, as was the case of 
the Northern Homily Cycle, the earliest MS. belonging to 
the early fourteenth century ; and sometimes there is a com- 
plete fusing of homily cycle and legendary, called a ‘“‘fes- 
tial,” such as the Festial of John Mirk, author of the Jn- 
structions for Parish Priests, dating from about 1400, or 
the Early South-English Legendary, or Lives of Saints 
(ed. C. Horstmann, E. E. T. S. No. 87). 
The last mentioned will be-used to illustrate the hermit’s 
position in the legendaries. In its complete state it is a 
Liber Festivalis, “containing sermons, or materials for ser- 
mons, for the festivals of the year in the order of the calen- 
dar, and comprehends not only Saints’ Lives for Saints’ 
Days, but also a Temporale for the festivals of Christ, an 
Advent and Christmas cycle, the Passion and an Easter 
cycle, and even, in some MSS., a Life of Christ compiled 
from the Gospels and Sunday Lessons. It was made shortly 
before, or simultaneously with, the Legenda Aurea by Jaco- 
bus a Voragine, the famous store book of medieval legends. 
The collection grew slowly and expanded by de- 
grees round a first nucleus; it was the work of many dec- 
ades of years, of many collaborators, most likely the joint 
work of a whole abbey, that of Gloucester, where the plan 
seems to have been fixed and brought into definite shape, 
and underwent more than one phase before comple- 
tion,”67

collection containing a hermit, we find a new and hitherto 
unmentioned office for the hermit, though prone to become 
quite frequent in the romances of chivalry later on—that of 
protector of the weak and the pursued. In fact, in this 
story it would appear that the hermit’s abode was regarded 
as a sort of city of refuge. The legend, which is the long- 
est of the entire collection (pp. 106-177), sets forth in full 
the details leading up to the martyrdom of the saint, includ- 
ing his flight to Rome and return to England. During his 
flight from England he traveled incognito, stopping for rest 
at the hermitage of Semplingham. ‘ sat a-midde Se watere 
is.” Here he remained without any apparent fear of moles- 
tation for seven nights, though his journey generally was 
beset with grave danger, and he was compelled to travel on 
foot in order to escape recognition. 
The Life of St. Brendon, setting forth his wonderful voy- 
age, in company with twelve monks from the monastery of 
which he was abbot, to the earthly paradise, and constitut- 
ing what has been called ‘a monkish Odyssey,’’s presents 
also a hermit story as a striking incident of the journey. 
Following a remarkable experience with Judas Iscariot, they 
arrive at an isle inhabited by Paul, an aged hermit, from St. 
Patrick’s Abbey. ‘‘jare is purgatorie is.” His appear- 
ance is a sort of epitome of his asceticism: 
“ bis heremite, pat was sq old man 
his her tilde doun to is fet 
None o )ur clothes nodde he on: is limes weun al hore.” 
He receives the visitors gladly and tells them the remark- 
able story of how he had been strangely directed to this 
isle by his abbot, who told him that on the morrow he would 
find a ship awaiting him on the shore, and how, upon getting 
in the ship, it had been miraculously driven until it brought 
him to that isle. Here, again, we meet with the loving serv- 
ice of animals toward hermits which has now become a lit- 
erary tradition. The hermit tells his visitors, further, how. 
upon his arrival, another (cf. story of Cuthbert) had 
brought him fish and a flinty stone with which to make a 
fire and cook his food, and so continued to feed him every 
third day. This hermit is now a hundred and twenty years 
old, having been on this isle seventy years. (The life of 
Cuthbert appears in the collection, but his experiences as a 
hermit are not mentioned.)

  The Hermit in English Literature 57 
The life of St. Christopher, a Saracen saint, likewise here 
included, shows the hermit in the customary réle of a coun- 
selor. Christopher, with the avowed intention of serving 
only a supreme master, has failed in his search, although he 
has tried a great king and later “the high devil of hell.” A 
hermit tells him that he must carry travelers over a certain 
stream, and by so doing he would discover the supreme 
Lord. One night he carried across a little child, that be- 
came larger and heavier as he walked until he was well-nigh 
exhausted when he reached the other bank. The child 
proved to be Christ, and Christopher was ever after his 
devoted follower, being finally martyred. 
Three other saints who live as hermits in customary 
fashion appear in the legendary, two of them being women. 
Mary of Egypt, being a great sinner, is converted, and goes 
to live a penitential life in the wilderness, where she is 
greatly tempted by evil passions. At the end of thirty-six 
years of solitary life she is visited by Zosimus from his 
abbey in Palestine. He gives her his blessing. Returning 
on the following Lent, he cannot discover her at first. but 
later, under a bright sign in the air, he finds her lying dead. 
Unable to bury her alone, he is assisted by a lion, who uses 
his claws to dig her grave. This last feature is a new addi- 
tion to the loving-service-of-animals tradition, but recurs in 
later literature. 
The other story of a woman saint is that of Mary Magda- 
lene. Besides the biblical story, many other incidents are 
told; but the one of especial interest is that she was a soli- 
tary in the wilderness for thirty years, during which time 
she was daily lifted toward heaven by the angels, the same 
process being a direct reversal of the situation usually nar- 
rated of hermits (cf. Cuthbert and Guthlac). As her end 
drew near, she told her story to a hermit, and at the same 
time predicted her own death—a well-defined, conventional 
usage in saints’ legends; is borne by angels to the Bishop 
Maximus, at Marseilles; is shriven and dies. 
The Life and Passion of St. Blaze the Martyr completes 
the list of hermit stories in the Early South English Legen- 
dary.®® Born in Cappadocia, he lived a hermit in the desert. 
Here we meet with the most elaborate control of the animal 
creation thus far encountered, for St. Blaze is a sort of St. 
Francis of Assisi. He blesses all the animals; and 
“Whan any of hem sike were, to him he wolden a-non, 
And arst ar he hem blesside, nane fot fro him nolden gon.” 
This legend appears in the appendix of Horstmann’s edition and the editor states 
that it is added at the end of M. S. Laud by a later hand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  58 The Hermit in English Literature 
His control over animals is so great that even the wild 
beasts obey him. On one occasion he makes a wolf bring 
back a pig he has carried off. Because of this remarkable 
power he is arrested, scourged, hung up, and tortured; but 
he continues to make converts. His persecutors throw him 
into a deep water, but his body will not drown. He was 
at last martyred, however, by having his head struck off. 
Prayer directed to him removes bones stuck in people’s 
throats. 
In addition to saints’ legends, pious tales likewise devel- 
oped great prominence as exempla during the Middle- 
English period. The history and explanation of this prac- 
tice is conveyed briefly, but succinctly, in tale No. 315, p. 
217, of An Alphabet of Tales, an English fifteenth-century 
translation of the Alphabetum Narrationum of Etienne de 
Besancon, entitled Exemplum bonum plus monet quam 
predicacio subtilis: 
“Saynt Bede telles in ‘Gestis Anglorum’ how, when En- 
gland was oute of /e belefe /e pope sent in-to it to perche a 
bisshop /at was a passying sutell clark, & a well-lettered ;

ban he was, & he vsid talis & gude exsample in his sermon; 
and he with-in a while convertyd nere-hand all England.” 
The earliest collections of these spiritual tales are ascribed 
by some authorities to the Cistercian, Odo de Ceritona (or 
Shirton), an English monk of the twelfth century, entitled 
(1) Parabole, (2) Homiliz, and (3) Brutarum. Others 
maintain that the most ancient collection was made by Hugo 
de St. Victoire, a Parisian, and contained a mixture of 
AMsopian fable with a great variety of pious and profane 
histories. Two subsequent collections of spiritual tales were 
made in French verse, the first by Gautier de Coinsi, Prior 
of a monastery at Soissons, who died in 1236, one of his 
.chief sources being a Latin collection in Latin by Hugues 
Farsi, who was also a monk in the same monastery. The 
second collection was entitled Vies des Peres, either because 
it relates the spiritual adventures of hermits or because it 
is partly extracted from the Vies des Peres du Desert. The 
latter group is declared by Legrand to be far superior to the 
former in both subject-matter and style.” 
How many stories of hermits appeared in these various 
collections, it is impossible to say without consulting the

originals; but from the number interspersed with other mat- 
ter or appearing singly in Middle-English literature, the her- 
mit was undoubtedly a Dona character in the pious tale.7? 
Robert of Brunne’s Handlyng Synne, founded upon William 
of Wadington’s Manuel des Pechiez, A.D. 1803.,78 giving an 
epitome of the various sins, the seven sacraments, etc., 
illustrates many principles with stories of hermits. The 
Eremyte and the Outelawe, composed in the Midland dialect, 
1350-1375 (in MS. Br. Mus. Additional 22577), is a pious 
tale, consisting of 387 verses in tail-rimeaabccbddb 
eeb. The most complete collection of hermit stories of this 
period, however, is‘to be found in An Alphabet of Tales, a 
fifteenth-century English translation of the Alphabetum 
Narrationum of Etienne de Besancon, already referred 
to.7™+ Still another hermit story appears in The Pilgrimage 
of the Life of Man, englished by John Lydgate, A.D. 1426, 
from the French of Guillaume de Deguileville, A.D. 1835.75 
These stories, forty-eight in number, may be grouped to- 
gether under five different heads. The following are the 
themes treated, together with the number under each head: 
(1) Hermit Counsel, three stories; (2) Hermit and Ani- 
mals, four stories; (3) Hermit Doubts, nine stories; (4) 
Hermit Virtues, eleven stories; (5) Hermit Trials, twenty- 
one stories. The stories will be treated in the chronological 
order of the collections in which they appear. 
The three stories which treat of the hermit as a counselor, 
all appear in The Alphabet of Tales, a fifteenth-century 
English translation of the Alphabetum Narrationwm of 
Etienne de Besancon. The first story, No. 131 in the col- 
lection,’® entitled “Carnis temptacio reprimenda est eciam 
in senibus,” tells how Heraclides, when greatly tempted in 
the flesh, sought the comfort of a man “Jat hight Pachonius, 
sat dwelte in wyldernes a solitarie.””’ The hermit tells him 
that his case is by no means peculiar, for he himself, after 
living in his solitary abode for forty years, had been contin- 
ually tempted in like fashion for years. Greatly disturbed 
that God had apparently forsaken him, he went into the for- 
est and exposed himself naked to the fury of a wild beast, 
thinking thereby to destroy himself. Instead of devouring 
him, however, the beast came and licked him over from head 
to foot. Later the devil, in the likeness of a fair damsel, 
sought to overpower him with fleshly lust. Fearing that his

resistance should be overpowered, he struck the damsel with 
his right hand, and she immediately vanished. Still war- 
ring with his flesh, he went again into the wilderness and 
exposed himself to the sting of a poisonous serpent; but the 
reptile would not bite him. Thereupon he heard a voice 
saying: “Go home and withstand ;i temptacion, ffor al- 
mighti God hae sufferd /e to be tempid becauce at jar sulde 
know /ine infermyte & /i frelenes, and at /ou sulde beseke 
God for to helpe /e.” The hermit went to his cell accord- 
ingly and continued steadfast with God’s help. 
The second story, No. 717, entitled “Simonia committitur 
sine pecunia,‘* and related by Cesarius,; is about “a holie 
ancres” and “one abbot of Ceustus ordur.’’ When the lat- 
ter asked the hermit whether it was expedient for him to 
be abbot or not, he replied in the negative and charged the 
abbot with simony. When the abbot remonstrated, he de- 
clared that on the day of his election he had imposed him- 
self upon the “‘symeple monkis” by saying, “It is not our 
wurshup to chese our abbot with-oute our abbay ;” and, thus 
beguiled, they chose him. The abbot was convicted by this 
testimony and became “‘a closter monke.”” 
The last story of this nature,?s No. 724, entitled ‘‘Solitudo 
Solitudinem multi propter deum appetunt,” is about a her- 
mit and a wild man whom the solitary found in the wilder- 
ness. The wild man, who was also a hermit, scenting the 
smell of a man, sought to escape; but the solitary caught 
him and held him fast, while he inquired of him: “Fadur, I 
pray +e, tell me a wurd at I may be savid bye.” The wild 
man answered him and said: “Fle man’s felowschupp & be 
still, & sou sall be safe.” 
The second group has to do with the strange power which 
hermits exerted over animals. The first of these stories, 
already familiar in the saints’ legends, occurs in Robert of 
Brunne’s Handlyng Synne,’’® entitled ‘The Tale of the 
Bear which kept the Hermit’s Sheep, and how it was slain 
by envious Monks,” and appears as an exemplum under the 
head of “envy,” the third deadly sin. St. Florens, having 
been deprived of Eutycyres, the companion of his solitude, 
by virtue of the fact that he had been made abbot of the 
near-by abbey, prayed that God would send a companion for 
his fellowship. 
“whan he ros vp of his orysown, 
he zede yn hys celle vp and down, 
and opened hys zate, and loked oute 
and sagh a beri wylde and stoute.”

The bear shows himself so gentle and serviceable that 
Florens takes him to live in the cell with him and teaches 
him to take care of his six sheep, for he had ‘noun hyrde 
hem for to kepe.” 
As a rule, Florens directed the bear to bring the sheep 
home at six, but on fast days he enjoined him not to herd 
them until nine. The bear obeyed these injunctions with 
great punctuality, and “bose tymeus he knew hem wele.” 
Certain monks who lived in the adjoining abbey, envious of 
the reputation of their abbot, Euticius, whose fame seemed 
overshadowed by Florens because of this marvel, slew the 
bear for spite; whereupon Florens prophesied vengeance to 
Euticius upon the malefactors, as a result of which they all 
died next day “of putrid disorders.’’s° 
Another story which shows the affectionate regard of wild 
animals for hermits occurs in the Alphabet of Tales collec- 
tion, No. 336, with the title ‘“Furtum committendo eciam 
bruto se pecasse cognoscunt.’’s! The story is told on the 
authority of Severus. A hermit living in a wilderness had 
a daily visitor in the person of a she-wolf, whom he was 
accustomed to feed. One day, being absent “with a noder 
bruther of his in occupacion,” the wolf broke in a window 
and helped herself to a piece of bread, leaving crumbs be- 
hind on the window, which revealed her theft. Over- 
whelmed with the guilt of her crime, the wolf came not again 
for a “sennet,” and then not until the hermit had prayed 
for her return. When she appeared, however, she would 
not come near, but lay down with bowed head as if to ask 
forgiveness. Struck with this remarkable show of peni- 
tence, the hermit freely forgave her and meted out to her 
the wonted amount of food,-“and fro thens furth evur after 
scho come at tyme of pe day, and did hur offes as sho was 
wunt.” 
The feeding of hermits by ravens is the story told in tale 
No. 36152 of the same collection, with the heading, ‘“Honor- 
ant se mutuo sancti.” The source is the Life of St. Paul, 
written originally by St. Jerome, and appears in the Legenda 
Aurea, a translation of which was compiled and printed by 
Caxton “at Westmestre the twenty day of Novembre the 
yere of our lord MCCCCLXXXIII.”s3 St. Anthony came 
one day to visit Paul. When it came time that they should 
eat, a raven brought them a “small lavis.” When Anthony 
expressed his wonder, Paul replied that every day God sent

him food in this fashion, but to-day the portion had been 
doubled. A friendly strife arose between them as to who 
should bless the food, but it was finally agreed that they 
should do it together, and they then divided the food evenly 
between them. 
The story of St. Florens and his bear also appears in the 
Alphabet of Tales, No. 572, with the headpiece, ‘““Obediunt 
sanctis eciam bruta animalia.’’* The version follows 
closely that of Robert of Brunne,®> but Florens merely 
speaks to himself concerning the punishment of the monks. 
Later, when vengeance overtakes them, as in the earlier ver- 
sion, he is conscience-stricken, ‘and held hym selfe as a 
crowell man & a vengeable homycide.” 
A still more productive theme for hermit stories in the 
Middle-English period is that of hermit doubts—in essence 
a form of temptation so subtle in its nature and in its ap- 
proach that it could easily mislead the unwary and some- 
times did send the hermit back to the world. While the 
story never develops the elaborate details of the testing of 
Job, the situations are in many cases sufficiently similar to 
challenge comparison. In most cases divine interposition 
occurs in the form of an angel or some other interpreter,’* 
who silences the hermit’s murmuring; but sometimes, as in 
Job, the voice of God himself proclaims his wisdom. In 
general, the writer’s purpose is the same as that of Pope in 
his Essay on Man—“to justify the ways of God toward 
man.’ 
Apparently the earliest occurrence of this form of her- 
mit story extant in English is the pious tale entitled The 
Eremyte and the Outelawe, written in the Midland dialect, 
1350-1375. It is found in the MS. Br. Mus. Additional 
22577, a copy from the Fillingham MS. now lost that con- 
tained an Otuel.8? It is in verse, and consists of 387 lines, 
in tail-rimeaabccbddbeeb. 
In substance, the tale is a union of two widely known ex- 
empla—the one the legend of the penitent outlaw, the other 
a tale of easy penance, each being represented in Jacque de 
Vitry’s Exempla and Etienne de Bourbon’s Recuiel. The 
whole, which aims to offer hope to the most abandoned and 
to emphasize the doctrine of the parables of the lost sheep 
and the workers in the vineyard, resembles closely the re- 
markable French legend, Du Chevalier au Barizel. 
The characters are two brothers—one a hermit who lived

as hermits should, and not “as other hermits do now- 
adays;’’8§ the other an outlaw, long an evildoer. The lat- 
ter went to church on Good Friday, and, being deeply af- 
fected by the vicar’s sermon, asked for absolution. The 
penance assigned consisted of going barefoot for seven 
years, fasting on bread and water, saying a Pater and Ave 
daily, and making a pilgrimage. When the outlaw refused 
these, the vicar, learning that the thing he most disliked was 
to drink water, assigned as his penance that he should drink 
no water that day. The devil, who seems to have assisted 
in imposing the penance, developed in the outlaw a terrible 
thirst, and then caused him to meet successively three 
women bearing water. The outlaw, however, remained true 
to his pledge, and quenched his thirst by opening a vein in 
hisownarm. Asa result, he bled to death, and his soul was 
carried to heaven by singing angels. The hermit saw his 
brother’s translation in a vision, and protested, declaring 
that, in view of this unjust discrimination, he himself would 
turn outlaw. An angel declared to him, however, that the 
outlaw had really suffered more in that single day than the 
hermit in all his years of solitude, and accordingly bade him 
bury the body and continue to persevere in his right living. 
The hermit obeyed his injunction, and finally attained 
heaven. 
The Alphabet of Tales*® tells a story from Vitis Patrum 
of a hermit who traveled in company with an angel in the 
likeness of man. Passing a dead carrion, the hermit held 
his nose. The angel inquired why he did so, and the hermit 
replied: “Becauce I may not fele /is savur.”’ Later, as the 
two saw “a fayr yong man cled in gay clothyng,” the angel, 
in turn, held his nose; and when the hermit expressed his 
surprise, he replied: ‘““Yone yong man /at is so prowde & 
full of syn, stynkis mor vglie in pe sight of God & all his 
aungell /an done all /e carion of sis wuld in syght or felyng 
of erysten men.” 
In the same collection, tale No. 100 narrates how a her- 
mit was reproved by “a voyce” for saying, as he watched 
Basilius, the abbot, walk in his pontifical, that he had “a 
delectacion & a pride in his clothing.” The voice declared: 
“Thow hase more delectacion in grapyng of /i catt tayle, 
pan Basilius has in his gay pontificall clothyng.” 
A similar story is told in tale No. 277 in the same collec- 
tion.2° A good hermit, who had given up all his property 
save a cat “for Goddis sake,” prayed to know who would be

his fellow in heaven. The answer came that it should be 
Gregory; whereupon the hermit murmured, because Greg- 
ory had great riches. In his prayers, however, he thought 
he heard God say that Gregory is “als pure in his spirett as 
fou erte, for ou hase more lykying in /i povertie /an he 
hase in his riches.” 
The Hermit and the Mason®! is another story from Vitis 
Patrum. It relates how a hermit who had been hospitably 
harbored by a certain mason and impressed with his char- 
itable generosity prayed that God should reward him with 
wealth. It was answered him in a vision that such a result 
would not prove a blessing, but rather a curse. The hermit, 
however, continued to pray in the mason’s behalf, and of- 
fered to become his sponsor if the prayer were granted. 
The prayer was answered. The mason unearthed a hidden 
treasure in an old wall and immediately gave up his craft 
and betook him to court. He soon rose to a position of au- 
thority and immediately began to oppress “pure men.” In 
a vision the hermit was carried up ‘‘vnto fe dome,” and 
there heard angels complain of the mason’s oppression. It 
was said his sponsor should be summoned to answer for him. 
In great fear what to do, the hermit appealed to the Virgin, 
and she counseled him to go to the mason and plead with 
him to amend his ways. The hermit did so, and for his 
pains was beaten and came sorrowfully back to his cell. 
That night he was again summoned to “/e dome” and ac- 
cused, but was saved again by the Virgin. Shortly after- 
wards the emperor under whom the mason held office died, 
and his successor punished the mason so severely that he 
fled the court and returned again to his craft and the prac- 
tice of former charities. 
Likewise from Vitis Patrum the Alphabet of Tales re- 
cords’? a hermit whose doubts were dissipated. A man 
of ungovernable temper sought to curb his passion by be- 
coming a hermit. In spite of his simple wants, however, he 
came to realize that he was “stirred to wrath by a fend.” 
Accordingly he “turnyd agayn unto his felashup; for whar 
der is labur & felashup commonlie Ser is paciens & Goddis 
helpe.” 
One other story belonging to this category appears in the 
Alphabet of Tales, entitled “Relinquere Reliquendi sunt 
parentes a virus perfectis.’’®? The story is related in Abbot 
Abraham’s Collasion of a young man who came to St. An- 
ton, the abbot, declaring the life of those who busied them-

selves daily at home superior to those of hermits who went 
into the wilderness and “‘abstenyd paim fro daylie laburyng, 
and gaff /aim vnto nothying bod vnto redyng add prayer.” 
The abbot inquired of him if he was not joyful at the pros- 
perity of his father and mother and sorrowful at their ad- 
versity, and he replied in the affirmative. The saint then 
said: “All we hafe bothe ffadurs & moders, yitt vs hase 
levur lefe paim & liff in wyldrenes & jer take syke fude as 
God sendis vs. san for to be in /e warlde & be sekur of fynd- 
ing of our fadurs & moders.” 
The three remaining stories of this group are in the Gesta 
Romanorum and the Alphabet of Tales. The first of these 
is the story of a female recluse—one of the few belonging 
to the distinctly religious literature of this period—and is 
entitled, How an Anchoress?» Was Tempted by the Devil. 
The author states that the woman “‘lafte all the worlde and 
wente into deserte and leuyd there many yeres with rotes 
and grasse and such frute as she might get,’ because she 
saw “the wretchidnesse, the synnes and the unstableness 
that was in the worlde.” After many years the devil, in 
the likeness of a woman, came to the hermitage and asked 
shelter for the night—a request which the good woman read- 
ily granted. Observing that the solitary was engaged in 
reading saints’ lives,°* the devil proceded to argue against 
the life of the solitary as being a selfish existence, declaring 
it to be better to dwell among men in order “to gyfe good 
Ensawmpill.”” This remonstrance so troubled the solitary 
that she was unable to sleep. On the morrow the devil, 
learning the effect of his remark, suggested that they both 
immediately return to the world, to which the solitary read- 
ily agreed. Before doing so, however, the hermitess prayed 
to the Virgin for counsel. The Virgin immediately revealed 
to the solitary the character of her guest, and charged her 
not.to be misled by his guiles. The solitary obeyed the in- 
junction and gave thanks to the Virgin for her help. The 
story ends with this commentary by the author upon the 
Virgin’s zealous interest in all faithful followers of Christ: 
“Lo! here may men and women se how redy this good ladie 
is to helpe here servauntes at all here nede, when they calle 
to here for helpe, that they falle not in synne, be stirring of 
the wicked Enemy the false fende.” 
The next story, also from the Gesta Romanorum, is re- 
markable as the source of Parnell’s Hermit. Both its source 
and development form a remarkably interesting history.

  66 The Hermit in English Literature 
A synopsis of it appears in the edition of the Gesta Roma- 
norum (E.E.T.S., No. 33), edited by J. H. Herrtage in the 
appendix (p. 520), headed ‘Tales in the Printed Latin Edi- 
tion of the Gesta and not found in the English MSS.” The 
story in translation is given in full with notes and the texts 
of Parnell’s poem in Swann’s edition of the Gesta, revised 
eae by Hooper, London, 1888 (pp. 138-141, 378- 
384). 
A hermit, displeased with God for allowing the owner 
of a flock of sheep to put to death his shepherd, who slept 
while a robber stole his sheep, quits his hermitage and starts 
to return to the world. On his way he is joined by an angel, 
who tells him he is come from heaven as a messenger to be 
his companion. Entering a city, they are entertained with 
great magnificence by a certain knight. During the night 
the angel repaid his host for his hospitality by strangling 
the sleeping infant of the knight, who was the idol of his 
heart. The following day they pursued their journey, and 
the next day were graciously entertained by another host, 
whom the angel again strangely requited by purloining a 
superb golden cup, highly prized by its owner. Proceeding 
the next day, they inquired the way to the next city from a 
pilgrim whom they met midway a bridge which spanned a 
river. As the pilgrim turned to reply. the angel seized him 
by the shoulders and hurled him into the stream below. 
Overwhelmed with horror at his companion’s consistent 
treachery, the hermit exclaimed to himself, “It is the devil,” 
but was too frightened to depart alone. The following night 
they were refused harborage for the night by the master of 
the house, but after importunity were granted the privilege 
of lodging in the pig sty. They accepted this shelter, and 
upon departing the next day the angel rewarded his inhos- 
pitable host with the gift of the stolen goblet. Now thor- 
oughly convinced that his companion was none other than 
the devil himself, the hermit cried he would no longer asso- 
ciate with him. The angel first demanded the privilege of 
explaining his mysterious acts, and did so in an entirely 
satisfactory manner. The shepherd, unjustly executed by 
his master, was guilty of former sins for which he deserved 
to die, and his sudden taking off relieved him of the conse- 
quences of these crimes for which he had not repented. 
The robber would suffer eternally for his theft, while the 
owner would be allowed to make restitution by alms and 
good deeds for the crime which he ignorantly committed. 
The sleeping infant had been strangled in order to recall 
his father to his former charitable acts, which he had neg- 
lected since the birth of the idolized son. The owner of 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
The Hermit in English Literature 67 
the cup had become inordinately fond of drink since acquir- 
ing the cup; and now that it was lost, he had returned to his 
former sobriety. The innocent pilgrim had been destroyed 
in order to save him from committing a mortal sin which 
lay directly in his path. The cup finally had been bestowed 
upon the selfish host for the hospitality of his swine house, 
but he himself would be properly punished later in hell. 
Hearing these words, the hermit entreated pardon from the 
angel and returned to a pious life in his hermitage. 
The final story of this group, No. 411 of the Alphabet of 
Tales,°7 is merely a corrupted variation of the foregoing. 
The story is attributed to Jacobus de Vetriaco (Jacques de 
Vitry) ,°8 and the hermit is tempted with the “spirit of blas- 
femyng, unto so mek (lii) he thoght in his awn mynd /at 
fe doings of Almiztti God wer nott rightwus, /at sufferd 
synners & ill men to hafe prospertie & welfar of /is warlde, 
& gude men & rightwus to hafe disease & tribulacion.” 
There is no mention of the punishment of the neglectful 
shepherd, and no hint that the hermit did anything more 
than murmur against providence. In each case an act of 
violence on the part of the angel guide is followed by an 
unwarranted reward. The pilgrim of the former version 
becomes the servant of a host who sends him as a guide for 
the two travelers, and the act is justified by the angel in his 
explanation on the ground that he had planned to kill his 
master on his return home. The statement is likewise 
added that the soul of the slain infant had been placed in 
paradise, and that as a result of the angel’s mission the her- 
mit was “delyvered fro al maner of suche temptacion.” 
The virtues of hermits are exemplified in eleven tales, as 
follows: (1) generosity, one tale; (2) hospitality, one tale; 
(3) protection of the weak, one tale; (4) industry, three 
tales; (5) penance, five tales. 
The first of these, illustrating hermit generosity, occurs 
in Handlyng Synne® under the treatment of the fifth deadly 
sin, covetousness, to exemplify its antithetical virtues. A 
hermit, fearing want, gathered great wealth together, pre- 
sumably by begging; but he found that he had exchanged 
a lesser worry for a greater one, for he now deemed every 
man he saw to be a robber. 
“And whan he seyd hys oures of /e day, 
He poght on hys tresour per hyt lay.”

  68 The Hermit in English Literature 
Reasoning with himself on the subject, he finally con- 
cluded “fat Goddys curs ys spread with pens yn /e purs;” 
and accordingly, when he perceived two men approaching 
his gate, he flung to them his entire fortune. 
Hermit hospitality is the subject of tale No. 265 in the 
Alphabet of Tales,!°° and suggests that the fare of hermits 
in that day was not always frugal or uniform, nor were they 
at times lacking in a sense of humor.’ Beginning like 
many other stories in the collection, “we rede in Vitis Pa- 
trum” it tells how two religious men from an abbey were en- 
tertained hospitably by a hermit. After they had retired 
for the night, he heard one of them declare to the other: 
“This hermitt hase better meate & is better fed fan fai er 
bat liffis in abbays.” The hermit made no comment; but 
when they were about to continue their journey, he sent an 
occult message by them to another hermit with whom they 
were to lodge. Asa result, he set them to hard labor, mak- 
ing “skirttles & hepis of wandes,” and fed them only on 
“sture brede and salte.” Later he said he would fare bet- 
ter for their sakes, and therewith set before them a little 
“aysell & garlykk.” Tiring of this treatment, they sought 
to take their leave; but he would not let them, and finally 
they were compelled to steal away in the night. 
The hermit as a friend of the oppressed—a rdle that is 
remarkably popular in the romances of chivalry—is mea- 
gerly treated in the purely religious tale. Tale No. 190 
(p. 531) of the Gesta Romanorum'? is of this order. King 
Symachus covets the land of a knight named “Lumcius,” 
and commands him on pain of forfeiture of his estate to 
procure and bring to him within eight days a black dog, a 
black horse, a black falcon, and a black horn. The knight 
is in despair; but, acting on the direction of an old hermit, 
who gives him a staff, he goes to a certain castle, and, on 
announcing that he has come from the lord of that staff, is 
at once provided with the things he seeks. Acting on the 
advice of the old hermit, he refrains from mounting the 
horse or blowing the horn, but gives them to the emperor, 
who, on making use of them, is immediately carried off to 
hell. The unusual power of the hermit in this story sug- 
gests the use of black art and raises the question whether

the hermit is not a magician rather than a true believer.1° 
Another story, in which the réle played by the hermit is 
more in keeping with the religious réle, is found in Hand- 
lyng Synne as an exemplum for the sixth grace due to shrift, 
entitled “A Tale of How to put Devil’s Eye out Spiritually, 
or How by Shrift a Man made himself invisible to the Fiend 
who before used to lead him about chained.”!°* A hermit 
that was perfect in God, “so moche he hadde of Goddys 
grace,” had attained the power of knowing the spiritual 
condition of men’s hearts. One holy day, as he 
“ened hym on a walle 
And badde hys bedys, and loked ouer-alle 
And beheld je folke pat come yn pe gate,’’ 
he beheld a devil leading a man by achain. The devil, un- 
able to enter the portals of the church with the man, suf- 
fered the chain to be broken, but waited without to reappre- 
hend his prisoner on his return. The man, however, having 
been properly shrived, passed by his former master without 
being recognized. The hermit approached the devil after 
all had passed out of the church and asked why he continued 
to remain, whereupon he replied that he awaited his pris- 
oner. Upon hearing this, the hermit ran after the man and 
inquired concerning his past life, and learned that he had 
been a man of sin, but having confessed his crimes, he was 
now full of happiness. Returning to the devil, he com- 
manded him that 
“he shulde do no man euyl, 
But go to helle, /ere he come fro, 
Euer to dwelle yn pyne and wo.” 
Physical labor as a proper occupation for hermits, even 
though not financially profitable, is commended by writers 
of pious tales in Middle English literature. Two such sto- 
ries, or exempla, appear in the Alphabet of Tales1% The 
first of these, No. 428, is entitled “Laborare debet mon- 
achus vt cogitaciones malas euadat, concerus ‘Paulus Here- 
mita, /at was a moste provid man emang ailde fadurs.’” 
Although there was none to pay him for his labor “becauce 
he was so fer fro townys,” nevertheless he would gather to- 
gether many palm leaves and burn them as an example that 
he did some bodily labor for his sustenance; and by this   
At least one hermit who practiced necromancy and magical art lived in Eng- 
Jand, however. Mary Rotha Clay (Hermits and Anchorites of England, pp. 172-3) 
mentions one George or Gregory Ripley who seems to have been an anchorite of the 
Carmelites. He is the author of a work called The Castle With Twelve Gates, which 
treated calcination, solution, congelation, and similar phenomena; and his Medulla 
Alchimio was widely studied.

act he proved that a monk might not be in a place without 
“laboryng with his handis, or els he mot not esskape many 
ill thoghtis & unthrifti etc.” The other story (No. 580) de- 
scribes a hermit who made “baskettis and swyllis of palme 
levis,” though he could not sell them, in order that he might 
not be idle, and likewise “for to kepe his harte fro ydull 
thoghtys & vanyties /at will com in a mans mynd and he be 
not occupied.” 
The virtue which commanded the greatest approval in a 
hermit, however,-was penance; and although his ascetic 
practices were not to be compared with those of the Eastern 
desert dwellers, the English solitary still regarded his East- 
ern brother as the ideal of hermit life. The general source 
of the five pious tales of this nature, all of which are found 
in the Alphabet of Tales,1°° is the Vitis Patrum. 
The first story relates that one Gladius remained in his 
cell twenty years without ever seeing the roof of his dwell- 
ing. The next story, on the authority of St. Jerome, de- 
scribes the ascetic practices of a man named “John.” For 
three years he stood, praying uriderneath a great stone, fast- 
ing except on Sunday, when a priest came to minister to 
him. At the end of this period his legs and feet were so 
decayed that they protruded out of his body, and angels 
came and healed them. Another story, also told by St. Je- 
rome, records that a certain solitary named “Theon” kept 
silence for thirty years except in prayer. The severities 
of the life of St. Arseneus are likewise recorded. When 
he saw the sun rise, he would turn his back, lift uv his hands 
to God, and pray, and so sit until the sun again shone on his 
face, when he would turn his back again and say his prayers 
all night. Finally, when overcome by sleep, he would 
“spar his een . . . onone he wulde wake agayn & go 
into his prayers.” Likewise it is related in the last story 
of St. Macharius, how when he cut himself with a knife and 
it bled a great deal because he broke the knife, he reproved 
himself, and as a penace went naked in the wilderness for 
six months, during which time he was grievously “tobittyn 
and skrattyd with thornys and breers.” 
From a purely religious point of view, the theme which 
far outranked all others in importance and popularity in 
the pious tales of hermits was that of temptation or deadly 
conflicts with the devil—an honor coveted even by the saints. 
Of all the ecclesiastical hierarchy, however, the hermit, by 
virtue of his habitual solitude, his uncompromising ascet- 
icism, by which he sought incessantly to overcome “the 
‘world, the flesh, and the devil,” was the ideal Christian

  The Hermit in English Literature a 
champion, and, as such, was most bitterly assailed by the 
fiend and his minions. The forms of these temptations va- 
ried from the mildest. suggestion to the most terrible phys- 
ical horrors, the theory being, as well illustrated in the 
various legends of Cuthbert and Guthlac (c. ante), that the 
nature of the trial varied in its severity according to the 
advancing piety of the hermit. The temptations in the 
pious tales vary in quality from the subtlety of personal 
vanity to the terrors of physical violence. 
Of the former nature is tale No. 763 of the Alphabet of 
Tales, entitled “A Man Afraid of Losing Meekness,” from 
Dictis Patrum. A nameless solitary, living outside Con- 
stantinople at the time of “Theodoce /e emperour,” was 
visited by that monarch, although unrecognized by the her- 
mit, and refreshed with the hermit’s simple fare of water, 
salt, and morsel of bread. After the simple meal, the em- 
peror revealed his identity and commended his humble life, 
saying: “Ye er blissid /at er so sekur & fre of your necessi- 
ties in /is werld, & ye hafe a restful & a quiett liffe forby 
pat I hafe; ffor suthelie I was blissidlie born in my realm, 
and now I liff jerin & I neuer eatt nor drynk with-outen 
besynes.” Struck with this unlooked-for declaration from 
the emperor, and believing that others would follow his 
example of visiting his cell to see him worship, he foresaw . 
a snare of the fiend to destroy the virtue of his meekness. 
Accordingly he fled precipitately that very night into the 
wilderness of Egypt and dwelt there the remainder of his 
life “with holie fadurs, oute of syght.” 
Another story from the Alphabet of Tales, entitled “The 
Devil Tempts an Anchorite,” shows that the ingenuous wiles 
were sometimes successful and capable of horrible results. 
The devil, in the likeness of a “gude angell,’’ warned a her- 
mit against the devil, “for he was besy euere day to begyle 
hym,” and prophesied that to-morrow he would come in the 
likeness of his own father to tempt him. Accordingly, the 
hermit armed himself with a sharp ax, and on the morrow 
when his father really did come he slew him and was hanged 
for the crime. 
This same story appears also in The Pilgrimage of the 
Life of Man,’ englished by John Lydgate (A.D. 1426) from 
the French of Guillaume de Guileville (A.D. 1335) ,1°7 and 
likewise, though in much briefer form, in the Ancren Riwle, 
edited from a Semi-Saxon MS. of the thirteenth century.1°° 
The version in the former, besides being in verse, differs 
also in one essential point—that the hermit killed his father

with a knife instead of an ax. In the latter no details are 
given. The fact that the author of the Ancren Riwle gives 
the story in such brief form, however, indicates that the tale 
was probably familiar to his readers, and, therefore, a story 
of great antiquity. In the version given in the Alphabet of 
Tales the reported source is Vitis Patrum. 
Again, the temptation took the form of a suggested re- 
pugnance for the severe hardship of hermit life. Such a 
temptation is implied in tale No. 431 in the Alphabet of 
Tales A man inquires of Macharius why he suffered 
such great hunger in the wilderness when he might readily 
live without hunger in an abbey. The hermit replied, “For 
here (in the hermitage) is no wittnes of /i faste /at sulde 
nurissh fe with lovyng nor at mot susteyn /e,” while in 
the abbey one might easily be guilty of vainglory. 
Fleshly lusts form the basis of seven tales of temptation, 
three being from the Alphabet of Tales!!® and four from 
Handlyng Synne.™ The first of these in the last named 
(p. 7), appearing as the exemplum for the first command- 
ment, tells of a hermit who became so enamored of a Sara- 
cen priest’s daughter that he foreswore the Christian reli- 
gion; whereupon 
“Out of hys mou /e he say flye 
A downe vn-to /e fyrmament; 
pe holy gost pan from hym went.” 
Before the contract is consummated, the hermit repents 
his action, is shriven by another hermit, and after both have 
prayed for a week, the wayward solitary is forgiven and 
the Holy Spirit returns to him. 
The next story, an exemplum for the deadly sin of lechery, 
tells (p. 238ff) how St. Benet was greatly tempted in the 
flesh, but escaped sin by rolling in the thorns and nettles. 
Another exemplum for the same deadly sin is the story of 
St. Jerome (p. 251), who went to the desert in order to fight 
against fleshly lusts. How to conquer fleshly lust is set 
forth in the tale of the Flesh-Tempted Hermit (pp. 266-7). 
Two hermits were greatly tempted. One was saved in an- 
swer to the prayer of the abbot, after disdaining the unsym- 
pathetic advice to his weaker brother. Both were led by 
the abbot to recognize the divine purpose of temptation, and, 
as a result, each returned without sin to his hermitage. 
Tale No. 636 in the Alphabet of Tales (p. 424-5) recounts 
the story of “fleshly temptacions” overcome by “Iohannes

Anachorita,” a solitary whose accumulated virtues had 
finally bestowed upon him a body “lyke unto ane aungell,” 
and who was fed miraculously by a bird with bread every 
day. Yielding first to the temptation of flattery, he found 
that his heaven-sent bread, formerly white, was now brown; 
and later, as fleshly lust occupied his thoughts, his loaf be- 
came very dark, hard, and appeared to have been gnawed 
by mice. Finally, drawn out of his cell to the city by his 
temptation, he was recalled from his intended wayward- 
ness by being reverently asked by a group of friars how to 
escape temptation. Overwhelmed with self-condemnation, 
he ran back to his hermitage, “cled his bodie in hare & putt 
askis on his head,” and prayed persistently until advised 
by an angel that his prayers were effective, but at the same 
time was strongly warned against sin of vanity in the fu- 
ture. Tale No. 648 (p. 432) is likewise a story of how a 
solitary was humbled—this time by an abbot—to the point 
of confessing the severity of his temptations. 
The last tale of fleshly temptation (Alphabet, No. 750, p. 
501-2) relates how an anchoress through prayer was deliv- 
ered from fleshly lust, but visited thereafter by the tempta- 
tion to blasphemy. In answer to prayer she was visited by 
an angel, who offered her the choice of blasphemy or lust, 
and she chose the former, saying: “I chese me vnto /e 
furste, ffor /uf all it be vnclene, yit it is kyndelie, and /e 
toder commys all of the devull.” 
The last group of tales, illustrating hermit trials, is a clear 
survival of saints’ legends,''2 being the story of personal vis- 
its by the devil in physical form, frequently by physical ter- 
ror, singly or in hideous hordes, for the purpose of destroy- 
ing the hermit’s piety and driving him back to the world of 
men. The tales, six in number, all occur in the Alphabet of 
Tales.113 
The theory upon which these personal visitations was 
based was twofold: (1) that the devils themselves wished 
to occupy the waste places alone—the general belief that 
wild places were originally occupied by evil spirits;11+ (2) 
that the devil and his minions were envious of the deeply 
pious and sought to obstruct their progress toward perfec- 
tion. The latter theory has the marks of great antiquity 
and appears well established in the popular Indian epic, 
The Ramayana.'1> It likewise appears to be the motivation 
for one of the pious tales of this group, tale No. 726 (p.

-P-A-G-E-72
  74 The Hermit in English Literature 
486), entitled “The Devil Against Solitude,” and the metri- 
cal romance called ‘Robert the Devil.” 
Tale No. 726, another Vitis Patrum story, relates how 
“a agle first led a hermit to a wilderness, whar jer was a 
palm, & a wellat /e rute eroff,’’ but later ‘‘had envy at him’’ 
and sought to lead him back to the world by announcing, in 
the guise of a messenger, that his father had just died, leav- 
ing him sole heir. Beguiled by this subtle appeal, he re- 
turned home, found his father ‘on lyfe,” but abode there 
in great trouble, and finally dying he ‘‘made a wretchid end.” 
Another story, tale No. 72 (pp. 54, 55), details how the 
fiends terrified and tormented St. Anthony, making two dis- 
tinct attacks, the second of which was made in the form of 
wild beasts. After resisting successfully the second attack, 
there appears a marvelous sight. The fiends flee, Anthony 
is miraculously healed, and he realizes that he is in the 
presence of ‘“almighti God Hym selfe.” When he inquires 
where God was during his fight with the fiends, he is told 
that the Lord was standing by and, as a result of his vic- 
tory, will make his name famous throughout the world. 
The story in general closely parallels the details of Guthlac’s 
struggle with the fiends, especially in the horrible appearance 
of the fiends and the presence of divine help and comfort.'1° 
The hermit, however, was not helpless, even without the 
presence of a divine guardian. Tale No. 469 (p. 320) tells 
how an anchoress repelled the fiend by saying an “Ave 
Maria,”’ and also how a hermit was saved in like manner. 
“$e fend flow away in liknes of a whorle-wynd & gnaystid 
his tethe & warid hym that taght hym to say it.” 
In tale No. 590 (p. 392) Hellarion, who had “‘sufferd many 
snybbis of fe fend” without any apparent effect, was finally 
set upon, while he was prostrate in worship, by the devil, 
who “dang hym in the sydes with sharpe spurus, & laid on 
his head with a swip & said: ‘Wharto syttys Jou /us scor- 
nand & nappis?? And he was als hevy on his bakk as it had 
bene a grete sekk full of barlie.” 
In similar fashion the fiends attacked “one /at hight 
John, that was ane ankyr” (tale No. 625, p. 417), first at- 
tempting to ridicule his ascetic practice because he was a 
man “fat had lede an ill lyfe,’’17 and later beating him so se- 
verely that they left him half dead. Finally, however, they 
cried with a “hedus noyce & sayd, ‘Vicisti, Vicisti,’” after 
se.f, ante, p. 42-3. In the pious tale, when the fiends come as wild beasts, they ap- 
pear “with per teethe per hornys & pai rafe his flesh,” etc. In Guthlac they appear 
with “great heads and a long neck and lean visage, . . . teeth like horses’ tusks 
and . . . throats . . . filled with flame,” etc.

which they vanished and never returned again to torment 
him. 
The final story of this class (tale No. 667, p. 445) sets 
forth how Martin, a solitary, was greatly tempted by the 
devil in the form of a serpent; but the hermit remained 
steadfast, and even presented both his naked hand and foot 
to the snake in order that it might bite him. 
Before concluding the present chapter it will be worth 
while to comment briefly upon the remarkable absence of 
hermits in Chaucer, who, perhaps more fully than any other 
writer, has portrayed the medieval life of England in his 
works. In only one of his stories does a hermit appear— 
and that, too, not in the story itself, but in the source of the 
story; this is in the Pardoner’s Tale. While the immediate 
source is not known and may have been some fabliau now 
lost, the story is one of great antiquity and widely known, 
but in the various analogs the part taken by the mysterious 
“olde man,” where not omitted, is taken in every case by a 
sacred character—sometimes by Jesus, sometimes by St. 
Anthony, and sometimes by a nameless hermit.118 
The form which appears most ancient is an old Hindoo 
collection of stories, entitled Vedabbha Jataka; but other 
versions are extant in Persian, Kashmiri, Arabic, and 
Tibetan. The story traveled from the Orient to Europe, 
and different versions appear in Latin, Italian, French, Por- 
tuguese, and German;'!® while a recent version appears in 
band story, The King’s Ankus, in the second Jungle 
ook. 
The version most resembling the Pardoner’s Tale is 
found in a collection of tales, probably antedating Boccaccio, 
but printed in 1572, entitled Cento Novelle Antiche. The 
story itself bears the title, “Here is the Story of a Hermit, 
who, as he was Walking through a Forest, found a very 
great Treasure,” and relates how the hermit turned aside 
three robbers who were lying in wait by showing them the 
gold, and continues by relating how the three later kill each 
other out of desire to have the larger share of the gold for 
themselves, in a manner closely resembling Chaucer’s ver- 
sion. In the original story the hermit tells the robbers he 
is fleeing Death, but it later turns out to be in reality a great 
treasure; whereas in Chaucer’s version the three young men 
who meet the old man “al forwrapped save his face” are 
seeking Death because he has slain one of their fellows dur- 
ing the plague.

-P-A-G-E-74
  76 The Hermit in English Literature 
“We feel that the old man is something other than the 
hermit of the Italian novella,” says Mr. Root.12° “The her- 
mit was fleeing Death; this man is seeking it. One of the 
‘riotours’ accuses him of being Death’s spy; we are tempted 
to believe he is rather Death himself. But Chaucer does 
not say so; he wraps him in a mystery as deep as the mys- 
tery of death.” 
The substitution of the old man for the hermit is not, 
however, difficult to account for. Chaucer makes Death the 
mysterious character of his story; and, therefore, the old 
man should be as anonymous in his nature as possible. 
Moreover, to Chaucer and his readers, the plague, which 
motivates the action, was a matter of personal experience; 
for four times during the reign of Edward III, in 1348-49, 
1361-68, and 1375-76, England had been swept by pesti- 
lence—the same which Boccaccio describes in the introduc- 
tion of the Decameron—during which time we are told that 
half the population perished. It is not surprising that 
Chaucer leaves the hermit out of the story, and, in fact, 
makes no mention of hermits in his works, for Chaucer 
loved crowds; and, moreover, the hermits, which Chaucer 
probably saw, were not genuine, but rather of the type gen- 
erally condemned by such writers as Geoffrey of Monmouth 
and Langland, 
The present chapter has disclosed the fact that a great 
variety of stories were written in Middle English with the 
hermit as the central figure. Most of these belong in the 
category of pious tales, and are classified under the five 
heads: (1) hermit counsel; (2) hermits and animals; (3) 
hermit doubts; (4) hermit virtues; (5) hermit trials. In 
the aggregate they formed a not inconsiderable body of the 
ecclesiastical lore of the Middle Ages and served the pur- 
pose for which they were written—that of teaching most 
concretely the medieval ideal of the church, self-renunci- 
ation.. In the following chapter we shall endeavor to trace 
the effect of this influence, as represented by the hermit, 
on that medieval institution most nearly founded upon the 
precepts of medieval Christianity—chivalry, in the ro- 
mances of chivalry.

  CHAPTER III 
THE HERMIT IN THE ROMANCES OF CHIVALRY 
Before entering upon a journey through the vast wilder- 
ness of the medieval romances of chivalry it will be neces- 
sary, for coherent progress, to provide ourselves with chart 
and compass, even though it be one of our own making. 
While it is not to be denied that sufficient guides are at hand 
for extensive study of the tales of chivalry from the ordi- 
nary historical point of view, and likewise from purely 
English sources, it will not serve the purpose of this inves- 
tigation to follow these well-trodden roads, since these high- 
ways lead generally from king’s court to some lordly adven- 
ture and seldom reach the quiet precincts of the hermit’s 
dwelling in the deep recesses of the trackless woods. More- 
over, a chronological order will not at all times prove 
serviceable, or, indeed, advisable, even were dates of compo- 
sition and authorship established beyond reasonable doubt. 
Assuming the privilege, therefore, of making our own divi- 
sions, we shall treat first the semi-religious, or those ro- 
mances which show the largest religious coloring and sug- 
gest ecclesiastical handling; and, second, the pure romances, 
or those which are, for the most part, secular, or at least 
unreligious in coloring and indicate an authorship uninflu- 
enced by monastic design. 
Before launching upon a study of the first group it is 
appropriate to show the intimate relationship which ex- 
isted between the church and the institution known as chiv- 
alry. Gautier defines chivalry as “armed force in defense 
of unarmed truth.” Thus, while by no means synonymous, 
Christianity and chivalry were necessarily inseparably con- 
nected institutions during the Middle Ages. Whatever the 
origin of chivalry, it assumed by degrees a distinctly reli- 
gious character historically, as the Crusades amply attest, 
until the knight became not only in theory, but in reality. 
the emblem of Christian militancy and the approved and 
accepted defender of the faith. 
From the simple military act of giving a sword to the 
young warrior upon attaining his majority, which consti- 
tuted the initiation into knighthood in primitive times, the 
ceremony developed a dignified complexity until it gradu- 
ally assumed under the tutelage of the church a symbolic 
and mystical character closely approximating in form and 
meaning the pontifical rite of creating a hermit or anchor-
-P-A-G-E-76
  
718 The Hermit in English Literature 
ite.1*!. The ceremony of creating a knight was distinctly 
religious, in fact, before the thirteenth century, but attained 
its symbolic character later.122. Such a rite is recorded in 
the Ordo MMS. 4748 of the Vatican, beginning, “How to 
create a knight in the holy basilica of Saint Peter,’ from 
which the charge which accompanies the bestowal of the 
sword is as follows: “Take this sword; with it exercise jus- 
tice and cut down all injustice. Defend the church of God 
and her faithful ones. With it disperse the enemies of 
Christ. Raise up what is earthly, and what you have ele- 
vated, preserve. Put down injustice and strengthen what 
is of good report. By these means, radiant and proud in 
the triumph of the virtues, you will reach the heavenly king- 
dom, where with Christ, whose type you are, you will reign 
eternally.” 
In consequence of these circumstances which tended to 
promote the influence of the church over chivalry, the 
knight, in turn, frequently developed a warm and even zeal- 
ous devotion for the church. In medieval times he assumed 
it to be his religious duty to visit holy places,!2* to deposit 
his own arms and those of his conquered enemies in monas- 
teries, to observe religiously the different festivals of the 
church, and in many cases, where his piety was remarkably 
sincere, to end his days in spiritual seclusion. Hence, in 
many of the romances of chivalry we find the knight on the 
friendliest possible terms with the hermit,!24 and vice versa; 
and in many cases the knight himself, feeling the need of 
severe penance to atone for his many deeds of violence, for- 
sakes the world and ends his days as a hermit.125 
Of the semi-religious romances of chivalry there appear to 
be but two well-defined examples, though their importance 
is not on this account to be minimized, since their influence 
is quite strong in many of the later pure romances. The 
first of these, The History of the Holy Grail, by the skinner, 
121See ante, p. 24ff. 
‘or a detailed and complete history of this serene see Leon Gautier: Chiv- 
tr. Henry Frith), London, 1891, Chapter VIII, p. 213ff. 
. Chaucer’s Knight-Prologue, Canterbury Tales, |. 10ff. 
n instance of this friendly relation, in which a knight is rewarded by, a hermit 
for protecting the honor of a hermit’s daughter against the attack of a “satyrical 
wildman,” occurs in the second part of Fhe Famous History of Tom A_ Lincolne 
(Chapter VIII, edited by William J. Thoms, London, 1889). The hero is the ‘‘Faye- 
rie Knight,” son of Tom A. Lincolne, the Red Rose Knight; and he is rewarded for 
his rescue by three magical gifts, presented him by the hermit—(1) a ring, “which 
whosoever did weare should never dye by treason;” (2) a sword, “that on what gate   
   
      soever it strucke it would presently fly open;” and (3) a vial, “of such drinke that 
whosoever tasted thereof should sodainely forget all passed sorrowes.” Another occurs 
in Malory’s Morte d’Arthur, Book VIII, Chapter 40, in which Sir Tristram slays Sir 
Naban and his son, who for twenty years had terrorized a valley in the vicinity of a 
hermitage. ‘“Thenne was the heremyte gladde, . . . for he said ther was never 
suche a tyrannt among crysten men. And therefore . . . this valey and fraucers 
we will holde of sire Tristram.”

    The Hermit in English Literature 79 
Henry Lovelich, author of the English verse Merlin, is really 
a Christian allegory in the form of a romance, showing how 
the “Holy Cup of Healing’ becomes the mysterious source 
of a supernatural power which triumphs over all that is 
false and at the same time lends a spiritual invincibility to 
its servants. In spite of the fact that the work has little 
literary value, it possesses, nevertheless, a large critical 
interest in view of the fact that it is the principal work ex- 
tant of the strange and anomalous phase in the development 
of the grail legend—namely, the introduction of the Chris- 
tian legendary element. Apart, therefore, from an interest 
in the hermit as an early literary figure in the romances of 
chivalry, it possesses genuine importance in showing how 
the Celtic popular tradition assumed some of the mystic ele- 
ments of a distinctly Christian legend—a point quite obvious 
in the later development of the Arthurian story, beginning 
with Malory.!26 
The story, as a whole, which treats of the origin and early 
history of the holy grail in Britain, does little more than 
foreshadow the story of Arthur and his “Round Table.” 
Beginning with an explanation of how the book containing 
the grail story came into his hands, which is lost in the Cor- 
pus MS. and supplied from the version of the French origi- 
nal in MS. Bibl. Reg. XIV E 3 in the British Museum, we 
find that the book, after being given by Christ to a Trinity- 
doubting monk, disappears, and is afterwards discovered 
by divine guidance on the altar of a little chapel (une moult 
biele capele petite, bien encutre demi-liue lorig), the thresh- 
old of which was guarded by a devil-possessed hermit, who 
will eat no meat.. The monk, after being shown in a vision 
where to get fruit for the hermit, procures it for him, 
and on the ninth day returns home with the book which he 
copied at the command of Christ. 
The story itself, along with the strange medley of knightly 
deeds and allegorical episodes, presents the hermit in a vari- 
ety of aspects, most of which have been met. however, either 
in the pious tales or saints’ legends already treated. One 
of the more familiar occurrences is the trial of strength 
between a hermit and the fiends,'27 found in Chapter 50.125 
Joseph and his people, in the course of one of their numer- 
ous journeys, come to a deserted castle, which seems to be on 
2°The legend of the Grail is treated in English in but two pieces before Malory— 
(1). Joseph of Arimathea (cir. 1350), and (2) Lovelich’s History of the Holy Grail. Both are poetic versions of parts of the Grand Saint Grail (cir. 1249), and deal with 
the early history of the Grail. The work by Lovelich is more extensive, but does not 
go beyond the deaths of the immediate successors of Joseph of Arimathea in Britain.

fire, from the midst of which comes a voice pleading with 
Joseph to pray for the owner, who is being tortured for his 
sins, in the fire. His presence in the fire is then explained 
by the voice as follows: ‘As the ministers of hell were car- 
rying their victim away, they were met by a holy hermit, 
who commanded the fiends to drop their prey; and when 
they promptly obeyed, he fell into his present discomfiture.” 
The hermit as a healer is likewise again encountered. In 
Chapter 15 (p. 172ff)129 the mother of Sarracynte, Evalach’s 
queen, is healed of bloody flux by a good hermit through the 
medium of prayer, after which she is baptized. The mother 
thereupon takes her daughter, Sarracynte, to the hermit, 
who very naively remarks that she cannot worship the her- 
mit on account of his beard, but will worship Christ if he 
is fairer than her brother. Christ appears to her in the 
form of a glorious man, Sarracynte is christened, and the 
hermit tells her of Christ, after which mother and daughter 
both receive the sacrament, and the mother declares the her- 
mit a true prophet. Later, when the mother dies, Sar- 
racynte again visits the hermit, whose name is ‘“‘Salustine,”’ 
where she is fully instructed in the doctrine of the Trinity. 
She leaves the hermit in feeble health, and when a short dis- 
tance from the hermitage hears a “‘swete noise,” sees three 
beings alight in the hermit’s chapel, and half a mile farther 
on meets a man in black, who informs her that Salustine is 
dead and summons her to help bury the saint. The man in 
black, whose name is “‘Ermonies,” then takes up his abode 
in Salustine’s stead. 
Later (Chapter 16, pp. 212-13), after Joseph has con- 
verted the heathen to Christianity, he, with his followers, 
goes to seek for the bodies of Salustine and Ermonies, who 
has since died. He deposits the body of the latter at Orbery 
Church and the former at Sarras Church, and thus honors 
both cities with saints’ corpses. 
In Chapter 88 (p. 451ff), Labeh, a Persian pagan king, 
after being converted by Celidoyne, the son of Nasciens, is 
commanded to go at once to a hermit in a near-by wood and 
be baptized. The heathen king is prepared for the service 
by hearing a narrative of the lives of martyrs from the her- 
mit. He decides to stay with the hermit, dies the next 
morning, and goes to the bliss of heaven. 
Afterwards, Nasciens and some of Joseph’s unfaithful 
followers land in Britain and meet Celidoyne, who had pre- 
ceded his father four months, during which time he had been 
hospitably lodged with a holy hermit.

  The Hermit in English Literature 81 
Mordreins,'!*° an Eastern king converted by Joseph of 
Arimathea to Christianity, with three hundred barons, on 
their way to Wales, encounter a great storm, and a voice 
tells that they are carrying an unpropitious passenger—a 
sort of modern Jonah—who turns out to be the devil, whom 
they dispose of by sprinkling holy water about the ship. 
During the turmoil of these events, a hermit, who is on 
board, sleeps soundly,!*1 but weeps in his sleep. Upon be- 
ing awakened, the hermit is asked to explain the strange 
occurrences which have just taken place. The hermit tells 
them that the storm was produced by the sin of the ship’s 
captain, whom the devil has now carried off, and then prays 
for the redemption of his soul. 
Later in the narrative,'2 Mordreins, after being blinded 
by approaching too near the holy grail, determines to be- 
come a hermit; and having found a satisfactory abode, he 
retires to a life of solitude, with another hermit as his com- 
panion, where he lives for the remarkable period of two 
hundred years,!33 which is the length of time intervening 
before the coming of Galahad. 
In Robert the Devil,'#4 the other romance of a distinctly 
religious character, the element of cruelty in the hero is 
exaggerated to the utmost for the purpose of insisting upon 
the higher spiritual force that alone is able to triumph over 
it, the purpose being obviously to teach that no sinner, how- 
ever great, can be beyond the reach of rescue by true re- 
pentance. It is significant that the crowning act of vio- 
lence by the hero is the crime of slaying seven pious her- 
mits, that the penace of this arch criminal is prescribed 
by a certain hermit to whom the pope sends him, and that 
the successful conclusion of his penance is announced from 
heaven through a hermit as a medium. 
The legend itself is very old, and appears to have been 
developed out of elements to be found in the early tales of 
widely separated peoples. The oldest known version is one 
in Latin prose by Etienne de Bourbon, a Dominican friar, 
who died soon after the middle of the thirteenth century—a 
part of a collection of historical anecdotes, legends, and 
apologues—and is given as a story which he had heard 
from two of his brethren and from one who said he had read 
it. The tale, therefore, must have existed before the year 
1250 in some monastic work yet undiscovered. It appears 
in Etienne de Bourbon’s work as a religious history to en-

  82 The Hermit in English Literature 
force the manifold use of penitence, with the headpiece: “De 
multiplici utilitate penitencie. Penitentia vincit et superat 
hostes, et a casu et a miseria elevat.” 
The story first appeared at Lyon as a distinct prose tale 
in 1496, entitled “The Terrible and Marvelous Life of Rob- 
ert the Devil, who was named afterwards the Man of God.” 
The accepted version in verse exists in three MSS. at Paris, 
entitled “Dit de Robert le Deable,’”’ and is evidently a re- 
casting in the fourteenth century of preceding versions. 
Between the “dit”? and the romance there appeared a dra- 
matic version—first edited at Rouen in 1836, with an intro- 
duction by C. Deville, Paulin Paris, and others—entitled 
“Miracle de Nostre Dame de Robert-le-Diable.” In 1510 
Wynkyn de Worde printed a later English prose version of 
the legend, “The Lyfe of the most Myscheuoust Robert the 
Deuyll which was afterwarde called the Seruaunt of God.” 
In the sixteenth century a metrical version of this prose 
account appeared, and a prose romance by Thomas Lodge 
was printed in 1591. 
After detailing how Robert was born to a barren mother 
after she had despaired of having a son and given to the 
devil at his conception, the story relates how Robert was the 
terror of his playmates, killed his “scole mayster,”’ and 
afterwards, though knighted by his father, “rode about the 
countree of Normandy robbynge, stelyng, morderynge and 
brennynge chyrches, abbayes and other holy places of rely- 
gyon and forsynge of women.’”’ When a price is put upon 
his head, he withdraws to the forest and continues his “mys- 
cheff without comparyson.” 
Having exhausted his lust for ordinary violence, it ‘befell 
upon a tyme that Robert, whiche euer imagyned and studyed 
in his mynde howe and by what meane he might doo moost 
myschefe and murdre, . . . rodeoutofhishous, . 
and in the myddel of the wode he saw VII hooly hermyts, 
to whome he rode as faste as he coulde with his sworde redy 
drawen, lyke a man out of his mynde, and there he slewe 
this VII heremytes, the whiche were bolde and good men, 
but they were so vertuous and holy, that they suffred mar- 
tyrdome for the love of God.” 
The account here becomes vividly dramatic, reminding 
one of similar violent attacks in the Cynewulfian life of 
Guthlac. When he has slain the holy men, he cries: “I have 
founde here a neste of a many pope holy sons whome I have 
shaven them crounes: I troue they be dronke; they were 
wonte to knele vpon theyr knees, and now they lye vpon 
theyr backes.” And after that he “hadde done this mys- 
cheuous dede he rode out of the wode, and his clothes were
-P-A-G-E-81
  The Hermit in English Literature 83 
all dyed rede with the blode of the people that he had mur- 
dred and slayne, and thus arrayed he rode over the feldes, 
and clothes, hands, face, all were rede of the blode of the 
holy hermytes, which he had so pyteously murdred in the 
wyldernesse.” 
After this appalling crime, all the people are so terror- 
ized that they flee panic-stricken wherever he appears; and 
his own mother, overwhelmed with grief, calls upon him to 
cut off her head. She then confesses that she had given 
him to the devil at the time of his conception. The effect of 
this revelation makes Robert, for the first time, conscious 
of his heinous sins, and he seriously determines to reform. 
This he seeks to do by first converting his own followers; 
but meeting only with scorn, he slays the entire company 
and sets out alone for Rome to ask forgiveness of the pope. 
The pope commands him to go three miles from the city to 
a holy hermit, who is the pope’s own “goostly fader,” and 
there confess his sins and be assoiled. 
After recounting to the hermit his crimes in detail, God 
sends an angel to the hermit to advise him what is the proper 
penance for so vicious a sinner. The penance is as follows: 
(1) he must “counterfayte and playe the fole;”’ (2) he must 
“ete no mete but that he may take from dogs when men 
fed them;” (3) he must “offende no man’ while performing 
his expiation. 
In the course of serving his heavy sentence, Robert fights 
valiantly against the Saracens as a brave soldier of the 
cross, after which God sends an angel to the hermit to an- 
nounce that his sins are now forgiven; the hero journeys 
to Rome, and at the command of God marries the emperor’s 
daughter. 
Leaving now the hermit of the semi-religious romance, 
let us turn to the hermit of the purely secular romance of 
chivalry. Certain differences at once appear. While the 
hermit’s character remains essentially the same, there is a 
changed emphasis, due largely to the fact that the writers, 
no longer of the ecclesiastical brotherhood, saw the hermit 
objectively and not as the apotheosis of saintly piety. 
Therefore, where historical accuracy is reflected, he does not 
always escape the general condemnation which the corrupt 
state of the church drew down upon itself just prior to 
the Reformation. The general moral debacle presented in 
Langland’s picture of 
“.. . eremites that inhabit them by the highways, 
‘And in buroughs among brewers, and beg in churches, 
All that holy eremites hated and despised, 
(As riches and reverences, and rich men’s alms) 
These lollers, latche drawers, lewd eremites, 
That lived wild in woods, with bears and lions,”
-P-A-G-E-82
  84 The Hermit in English Literature 
was unfortunately too true to be entirely ignored. Even 
the court records of the time tend to confirm these abuses. 
Among others, Letter Book I, Vol. CXIII (Latin), for the 
reign of Henry IV, A.D. 1412, records the punishment of 
the pillory and whetstone for pretending to be a hermit.1°5 
Usually, however, the writer recognizes the true her- 
mit tradition, though sometimes, like Malory,'** he refers 
to the contemporary abuses in passing: ‘For in those days 
it was not the guise of hermits as it is nowadays. For 
there were none hermits in those days but that they had 
been men of worship and prowess, and those hermits held 
great household, and refreshed people that were in dis- 
tress.” 
The role played by the hermit in these romances partakes 
of both the secular and religious. As a secular character, 
he is (1) the dispenser of hospitality to strangers; (2) he 
heals the wounded knight; and (3) he buries the dead. As 
a religious character, he is (1) the ideal father confessor 
for knights errant; (2) the most approved of counselors 
and interpreters of dreams and visions; (3) the most po- 
tent and revered defender of the weak; and (4) the perfect 
penitent in the eyes of all classes for every form of wicked- 
ness. The above division is made upon the principle that 
spiritual power is not a prerequisite in the former, but is in 
the latter. Incidentally it may be noticed that hermits fre- 
quently live to a very great age in many of the romances; 
the hermit Pergambu, for example, in the romance Perce- 
forest,187 a fabulous history of Britain preceding the age of 
Arthur, lives for a number of centuries. 
HERMIT HOSPITALITY 
It should be noted here that by “hospitality,” as we use 
the term above, we mean merely harborage for the night, 
and not for a protracted stay, since in the romances pro- 
tracted visits are due to severe wounds or dangerous ene- 
mies; and such incidents will, therefore, be handled under 
the heads of (1) healing or (2) defending the weak. With 
this in mind, it is quite obvious that hermit hospitality in 
the romances is largely accidental and inconspicuous. 
Strangely enough, in two of the most conspicuous illus- 
trations of hermit hospitality the host proves to be no true 
hermit, but, in the one case, a wicked necromancer, and, in 
the other—the form of which is a ballad, and not a ro- 
ate, Riley, H. T.: Memorials of London and London Life.

mance—an outlaw who entertains his king unawares. In 
the first named, the false Archimago, in the first Book, 
Canto I, stanza 29ff, of Spencer’s Faerie Queen, in the guise 
of a hermit, lodges the Red Cross Knight and Una for the 
night, and by the aid of magical charms, while they sleep, 
succeeds in separating the pair. 
The description of the hermit’s dwelling, although con- 
ventional, is quaintly picturesque: 
“A little lowly Hermitage it was 
Downe in a dale, hard by a forest’s side, 
Far from resort of people, that did pas 
In travell to and froe: a little wyde 
There was an holy chappell edifyde, 
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say 
His holy things each morne and eventyde: 
Thereby a christall streame did gently play, 
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.” 
Similar descriptions are frequently encountered. For 
example, in Malory’s Morte d’Arthur, Book 18, Chapter 
12, p. 746, Lancelot, severely wounded and accompanied by 
Lavain, comes to the hermitage of Sir Baudewyn of Bre- 
tayne, “the which was under a wood/ and a grete clyf on 
the other syde/ and a fayre water rennynge vnder it.” 
Again, in Book 21, Chapter 10, p. 856 (ibid), Lancelot, on 
his way to become a hermit himself, is “ware of an Ermy- 
tage & a chapell stode betwyte two clyffes,” etc. Likewise 
in The Foure Sonnes of Aymon (E.E.T.S., extra series 44-45, 
p. 400), Mangis, about to turn hermit, comes to a “lityll 
howse in manner of an heremytage, . . . devoute and 
playsaunte/ For a gate sprange a quycke fontaine.” 
The location of the hermitage by a crystal stream becomes 
highly conventionalized in later literature. Parnell, in his 
famous poem, The Hermit, writes: 
“The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell, 
His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well.” 
A similar detail likewise appears in the description of the 
hermitage occupied by the false Clerk of Copmanhurst in 
Scott’s Ivanhoe, Chapter XVI, as follows: “At a little dis- 
tance on the right hand, a fountain of the purest water 
trickled out of the rock, and was received in a hollow stone, 
which labor had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from 
thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a chan- 
nel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through 
the little plain to lose itself in the neighboring wood.” 
In the other story, a ballad of uncertain date, entitled 
The King and the Hermit, edited from the imperfect origi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  86 The Hermit in English Literature 
nal MS., Ashmole 6922, by Mr. Hartshorne in his Ancient 
Metrical Tales (1829) and reédited by W. Carew Hazlitt 
(London, 1864) in the first volume of Remains of the Early 
Popular Poetry of England, we have the legend of a king 
(probably Edward II, though Scott surmises it to be Ed-. 
ward IV), who, lost in the chase, is lodged royally and fed 
with the king’s own venison.and wine likewise after he com- 
plains of the simple fare of bread and cheese which the mas- 
querading hermit had set before him. After enjoying an 
evening of good fellowship, the king invites the hermit to 
visit him at court. The hermit gladly accepts; but the MS. 
ends imperfectly at this point, and the story breaks off with- 
out a recital of the hermit’s subsequent adventures at court. 
A similar incident is recounted by Scott in Ivanhoe (Chap- 
ters XVI-XVII). In both cases the false hermit shows an 
inhospitable feeling at first, but later “enjoys” an enthusi- 
astic fellowship with his unsought guest. 
In this connection we may note, in passing, another false 
hermit in the character of Barnard, the Earl of Toulouse, 
who appears in a Breton lais'®8 belonging to the first of the 
fifteenth century in the Northern East Midland dialect. 
The hero assumes the guise of a hermit in order to view at 
close range the wife of the emperor of Almayne, of whose 
great beauty he has heard. Gaining her favor, he defends 
her name by defeating her accusers, is later reconciled to 
the emperor, serves as his steward, and on his lord’s death 
succeeds to the throne and weds the empress. The story 
appears to be a modified account of a Barnard, Count of 
Toulouse, who about 830 was accused of relations with the 
Empress Judith, wife of Louis le Debonnair. 
THE HERMIT HEALER 
In the character of the hermit healer in the romances of 
chivalry, a new note, characteristic of the secular viewpoint 
of the narrator, appears. The milk of human kindness, 
formerly so much a part of the religious -hermit’s personal- 
ity, is at times strangely lacking, and in its place appears a 
conscious effort to explain the efficacy of the remedies used 
on a more or less scientific basis. 
When Arthur is wounded (Malory’s Morte d’Arthur, 
Book I, Chapter 25, p. m7, ed. Sommer, London, 1889), he 
is carried by Merlin to “an ermyte that was a good man and 
a grete leche/ Soo the heremyte serched all his woundys 
& gaf hym good salves so the kyng was there three dayes &

The Hermit in English Literature 87 
thenne were his woundes wel amendyd that he might ryde 
and goo/ and so departed/”’ 
Sometimes in these romances it appears that the hermit 
maintained a large retinue of assistants to help him in his 
work and had established reputations for healing wounded 
knights. Lancelot, victorious, but grievously wounded by 
his relatives because of his disguise in the tournament (Mal- 
ory’s Morte d’Arthur, Sommer,’ Book 18, Chapter 12, p. 
746ff), calls upon Lavayne to help him on his horse, “for 
here is fast by within this two myle a gentyl heremyte that 
sometyme was a fulle noble knyghte and a grete lord of pos- 
sessions/ . ... sire Baudewyn of Bretayn, . ..a 
full noble surgeon and a good leche.” 
Arriving at the hermitage, which was “vnder a wood 
and a grete clyf on the other syde/ and a fayre water ren- 
nynge vnder it”—the conventional description of such places 
in the romances of chivalry—they are answered by a “fair 
chyld,” who, in turn, summons the hermit. Although 
J.ancelot is unconscious from the loss of blood, “sire Bau- 
dewyn’’ first inquires who he is and then on whose side he 
fought in the tournament, before receiving him. Lancelot 
is recognized by a well-known scar on his cheek, after 
which (p. 747) “the heremyte called to hym two of his 
seruauntes/ and so he and his seruauntes bare hym in to 
the hermytage/ and lyghtly unarmed hym/ and leyd hym 
in his bedde/ and thenne anone the hermyte staunched his 
blood and made hym to drynke good wyn so that sir Launce- 
lot was well refresshed and knewe hym self/ For in these 
dayes it was not the guyse of heremytes as is now a dayes. 
For there were none heremytes in tho days, but that they 
had ben men of worshyp and of prowesse/ and tho here- 
mytes held grete housholde/ and refresshyd peple that were 
in distresse/” 
Lancelot, doubtless because of his great hardihood, 
seems to have been a very difficult patient to manage, espe- 
cially during convalescence; for on this occasion, while his 
attendants were gone. he armed himself and attempted to 
take his leave surreptitiously, with the result that ‘the but- 
tom of his wound brast bothe within and withoute” (p. 
755), and he was carried back to the hermitage in a swoon. 
The episode which followed this impetuous act on the part 
of Lancelot has a modern touch about it (p. 756). “And whan 
he (the hermit) fond syr launcelot in that plyte/ he sayd 
but lytel/ but wete ye wel he was wrothe/ and thenne he 
bad hem/ lete vs have hym sir”’/ Lancelot’s wound, how- 
ever, continued to bleed. “Thenne the knyghte heremyte 
put a thynge in his nose and a lytel dele of water in his
-P-A-G-E-86
  88 The Hermit in English Literature 
mouthe/ and thenne sir launcelot waked of his swoune’ and 
thenne the heremyte staunched his bledynge;” and after a 
strong reprimand promised him speedy recovery if he would 
follow his directions. 
All hermit healers were not so successful, however, in 
curing the impetuous Lancelot. In Book 12, Chapter 3 (pp. 
596-7), of Malory’s Morte d’Arthur, Lancelot was once pain- 
fully wounded by a wild boar, which he afterwards killed. 
When a hermit residing near by came out and invited Lance- 
lot to come into his hermitage, the latter, angry with his 
wound, “ranne vpon the heremyte to have slayne hym;” and 
when the “heremyte ranne away,” Lancelot threw his sword 
after him. Later the hermit returned and begged Lance- 
lot to go with him, but he refused. Finally, with the aid of 
another knight, he was brought to the hermitage, and “the 
heremyte haled hym of his wound. But the heremyte 
myghte not fynde syr launcelot’s sustenaunce and so he 
enpayred and waxed feble bothe of his body and of his wyt 
for the defaute of his sustenaunce he waxed more wooder 
than he was afore hand. And thenne vpon a day syr launce- 
lot ran his waye in to the forest.” Later he came to a city, 
where he was set upon by all the young men, who pelted 
him with “turuls,” later rescued by some knights, and finally 
restored to his right mind by the miraculous power of the 
holy grail. 
Once more Lancelot was wounded (Malory’s Morte d’Ar- 
thur, Book 18, Chapters 21, 22, p. 763ff), in the vicinity of 
the hermitage of “sire Brastras in the forest of Wyndsoore,” 
by the accidental shot of an arrow from the bow of a 
young huntress. In this instance Lancelot himself walked 
“weykely to the hermytage ever more bledynge as he went” 
and the hermit healed him. 
Guy of Warwick,!*° likewise when wounded seeks the aid 
of a hermit. Auchinleck MS., p. 92; 94; ll 1645-1650: 
“Now go/ Gij sore desmaid 
His woundes him iuel afreyd 
To an ermite he is y-go, 
pat he was ere aqueynted to; 
His woundes /er hele he dede 
Wipouten norse in that stede.”

To an heremyte he is goo, 
That he was acqueynted with or thoo;

Withoute noyse in that stede.” 
The frequent reiteration of acquaintanceship between 
knights and hermits indicates rather clearly that knights 
errant regarded certain hermits in the light of their special 
physicians, and in all probability had their favorite heal- 
ers. In still another metrical version of Guy of Warwick 
(fifteenth century version, edited from the paper MS. Ff. 
2, 38, in the Cambridge University Library, by Julius Zu- 
pitza, 1875-6, E.E.T.S., extra series 25-6, pp. 35-6), Guy, 
sorely wounded, leaves the abbey, where he has arranged 
for the burial of his companion in arms, Harrawde, and 
where he might have received succor for himself. 
“Gye turned fro the abbey 
And hyed faste on hys wey 
To an ermyte he can wende 
That »erebefore had be hys frende. 
There he had helyd hys wounde 
Well sone in a lytull stounde.” 
1 1245-1250. 
HERMIT SEPULTURE 
The hermit in the romances of chivalry likewise assisted 
in burying the dead, especially the bodies of strangers, and 
prayed for the spirits of the departed.4° In Malory’s 
Morte d’Arthur, Book 2, Chapter 13, pp. 90, 91, ‘““Peryn de 
mountebeliard” is killed by the invisible knight, Garlon, and 
buried by Balin and a hermit “vnder a ryche stone and a 
tombe royal.” 
A still more notable example occurs in Malory’s Morte 
d’ Arthur, Book 21, Chapter 6, p. 850, following the mystical 
passing of Arthur in the barge with the lady of the lake. 
“Than was syr Bedwere glad and thyder he wente & whan 
he came in to the chapel (of the hermitage) he sawe where 
laye an hermyte grovelyng on al foure there fast by a tombe 
was newe graven/ whan the Eremyte sawe syr Bedwere

sauntes. Alas sayd syr bedwere that was my lord kyng 
Arthur that here lyeth buryed in thys chapel.” 
Other instances of burial of the dead by hermits occur in 
the different metrical versions of Guy of Warwick, already 
quoted. Auchinleck MS., ll 1601ff; Caius MS., ll 1601ff; 
Paper MS. Ff 2, 38 (fifteenth century), ll 1201-1212. In 
substance, all the accounts are alike; in each case Guy offers 
the hermit a “horse of pryes” to bury the bodies of Toralde 
and Urry, and the hermit readily accepts the task. 
FATHER CONFESSOR 
The hermit was likewise the ideal father confessor for 
knights errant for reasons that are obvious. The hermit- 
age, situated usually in the depths of the forest and aloof 
from men, furnished both a convenient and safe place for 
confession, as well as shelter and refreshment. It is, there- 
fore, but natural that the hermit should serve as confessors 
in the romances of chivalry. These incidents and those 
which present the hermit as counselor and interpreter of 
dreams are found at their best in the Arthurian romances. 
For convenience these two categories will be treated con- 
secutively. Examples of the former occur in Malory’s 
Morte d’Arthur, Books 18, 16, and also in the story of Per- 
ceval.141 
The hermit who hears Gawain’s confession (Book 13, 
Chapter 16, pp. 635-636) shows a clear knowledge of 
knightly requirements and a high regard for the same. 
After hearing the knight’s confession, in which he told the 
hermit how a monk in an abbey had called him a “wicked 
knight,” the hermit declares “he myght wel saye hit . . ./ 
for whanne ye were fyrste made knyghte ye sholde have 
taken you to knyghtly dedes & vertuous lyvynge/ and ye 
have done the contrary/ for ye have lyved meschevously 
many wynters.” Gawain apparently has a different view; 
for when the hermit undertakes to prescribe a penance for 
him, he replies: “I may doo no penaunce/ For we knyghtes 
adventurous ofte suffren grete woo and payne. Wel sayd 
the good man/ and thenne he held his pees/ and on the

various Arthurian legends, since such a course lies clearly out of the province of this 
study.

The attitude of both knight and hermit is different, how- 
ever. in Lancelot’s confession (Book 13. Chapters 19, 20, p. 
639ff) : “Thenne sir launcelot wept with hevy chere/ 
Sire sayd the good man/ hyde none old synne from me/ 
Truly said syr Launcelot that were me ful lothe to dis- 
covere/ For this xiiiij yere I never discovered one thynge

I have done I dyd for the moost part for the quenes sake/ 
And for her sake wold I doo batail were hit ryght or wronge/ 
and never dyd I bataille alle only for goddes sake/ but to 
wynne worshyp.” The hermit then said to Lancelot: “Yf 
ye wille ensure me that ye will never come in that quenes 
felauship as moche as ye may forbere/ And thenne syre 
launcelot promysed hym he nold by the feithe of his body/ 
loke that your herte and your mouthe accorde said the good 
man/ and I shalle ensure you ye shall have more worship 
than ever ye had.” 
Page 641: “Thenne the good man loyned syr launcelot 
suche penaunce as he myghte doo and to serve knyghthode 
and so assoylled hym.” 
Book 16, Chapter 3 (p. 668ff), recounts how Gawain and 
Ector came to a hermitage for confession. When the her- 
mit (Nascien) is informed of their purpose, he said: “I am 
redy/ thenne they told hym soo moche that he wyst well 
what they were.’ When he learned that they sought to 
attain the holy grail, he replied: “Yee goo to seke that ye 
sholle never fynde. . . . For hit is the secrete thynge 
of oure lord Ihesu Cryste,” and it ‘“apperreth not to syn- 
ners.” 
Another seeker of the grail, Sir Bors, receives, however, 
a different verdict from his hermit confessor. When the 
knight “prayed hym (the hermit) that he myghte be con- 
fessed, .. . . they wente into the chappel/ and there 
he was clene confessed/ & they ete brede and drank water

In the fifteenth-century romance, Perceval (Trespleulx 
et vaillant Chevallier Perceval le galloys jadis chevallier de 
la Table ronde-anon), the hero, who has dedicated himself 
for five years (f 34) to exploits of chivalry and neglected 
all exercises of devotion, is at length ‘‘reclaimed by meeting 
in a forest a procession of ten ladies and three knights, who 
were doing penance for past transgression” by walking bare- 
footed as a form of mortification. Perceval is influenced 
by seeing this act of piety to seek absolution for himself, 
and accordingly goes to confess himself to a hermit, who is 
discovered to be his uncle, the brother of King Pecheur. 
In the romance, Valentine and Orson, the two sons of the 
emperor of Greece (the earliest known printed copy of 
which is one by Jac. Maillet, Lyons, 1489) ,142 there is a 
hermit-confessor episode which suggests that of Robert the 
Devil and a penitential retirement. Valentine, who has un- 
wittingly killed his father because he was dressed in pagan 
garments, goes to Rome, where, “comming into the pres- 
ence of a hermit, he confessed the death of his father; the 
hermit seeing him so penitent, enjoyned him pennance: 
First change thy habit and go barely cloathed, and 7 yeares 
lye under the staires of thy pallace, without speaking any 
words; thou shalt neither eat nor drinke but of the scraps 
that come from thine owne table—do thus and feare not thy 
sins.” 
The form of this penance and his subsequent death 
strongly suggest the life of an anchorite or hermit, but 
throughout the narrative at this point he is referred to as a 
“pilgrim.” In order to make his identity unknown to his 
servant he prepares for his seven-year penance by going 
“Gnto a wood, feeding upon roots; and he continued there 
so long that he was forgotten amongst men. . . . At 
the end of seaven yeares Valentine fell into a mortall dis- 
ease, whereof he dyed. Before his death an Angell ap- 
peared to him saying, Valentine, thy glasse is run, for 
within foure houres thou shalt die;!4* whereat he greatly 
12The romance, according to Ashton (Romances of Chivalry, N. Y., 1887, p. 235f€), 
is of undoubted French origin. The British Museum has a fine MS. copy of it, No. 
10 E IV Royal, a four-leaf fragment, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the binding of 
an oak-covered book in the library of the Duke of Devonshire at Bolton Abbey. It 
was also printed by Copland. Wells (Manual of the Writings of Middle English, 
1050-1400) merely mentions it as belonging after 1400.

rejoyced. . . . Shortly after he layd him down and 
dyed.” 
After reigning as emperor for seven years, Orson, his 
brother, who had been nursed as an infant by a bear, like- 
wise retired from the world, “entered a wood, lived on 
roots”—the proverbial food of a hermit; and when he died, 
he was succeeded in the government by his children. 
THE HERMIT COUNSELOR AND INTERPRETER 
Forming at times an integral part with confession epi- 
sodes, and again alone, we find the hermit acting also as 
a counselor and an interpreter of dreams. As an example 
of the former we have the confession of Gawayne and Ector 
to the hermit Nascien (Book 16, Chapter 8, p. 668ff), al- 
ready referred to. “Then began gawayne fyrst & told hym 
of his aduysyon that he had in the Chapel/ and Ector told 
hym alle as it is afore reherced.”’ The vision, which is set 
forth in detail in the preceding chapter, has to do with the 
finding of the holy grail. That hermits were the accepted 
interpreters of visions in romances of chivalry is estab- 
lished by Ector’s comment at the conclusion of the vision, 
“Now goo we sayd syre Ector vnto some heremyte that wille 
telle vs of our aduysyon;” and accordingly they visit Nas- 
cien, who shows an intimate knowledge of the “Round Table” 
and tells them in detail the meaning of what they have 
seen, the practical significance of which is that neither of 
them is worthy to see the holy grail. 
Perceval likewise (Book 14, Chapter 1, p. 642ff) receives 
friendly counsel from a recluse—who turns out to be his 
aunt—about Galahad, and also an explanation of the mean- 
ing and the finding of the holy grail. Book 15, Chapter 3 
(p. 658ff), recounts ‘‘an aduysyon that syr Launcelot had/ 
and how he tolde it to an heremyte/ and desyred counceyll 
of hym;” and the following chapter continues the narra- 
tive, showing ‘‘how the heremyte expowned to syr Launce- 
lot his advysyon & tolde hym that syr Galahad was hys 
son.” Later (Chapter 6, p. 662ff) he told a female recluse 
the “advysyon that he had had that nyghte in his slepe/ 
and prayd her to telle hym what hit myght mene/ for he 
was not wel contente with hit’’/ The ease and readiness 
with which the religious solitary is able to explain visions 
and dreams—for in no case does one fail to give a satisfac- 
tory explanation when called to do so—is truly remarkable. 
THE HERMIT PROTECTOR 
We now come to a hermit réle in which the solitary chal- 
lenges comparison with the knight—the defender of the

weak. This does not mean that, even in the romances of 
chivalry, the hermit ever so far forgot his noncombatant 
role as to match force against force in his struggle with 
evil,'44 whatever his provocation; but there were times, at 
least, when his ingenuity, his intelligence, and his great 
spiritual power won undeniable victories over the forces of 
evil, even though the devil himself took an active hand in 
the struggle. 
The earliest of these stories in which the cath most 
nearly assumes heroic proportions is the metrical romance, 
Sir Degare,4> in short couplets, preserved in MSS. Auchin- 
leck (the most perfect, consisting of 993 verses, 1330-1340, 
Cambridge University Library, Ff II 38; and the date of 
composition probably 1325 in the Southwest Midland dia- 
“lect). An infant son, the fruit of a rape by a knight upon 
a king’s daughter, lost in the forest, left in the wood, 
with thirty pounds of silver, a pair of gloves, and a let- 
ter directing the finder to bring up the boy and marry him to 
the only lady whose hands the gloves will fit, is found and 
christened by a hermit and given into his sister’s care. The 
hermit follows out the instructions contained in the letter, 
educates the boy from his tenth to his twentieth year in 
clerkly lore, and, with the money, gloves, and letter, sends 
him off to find his father and a wife, in both of which quests 
he is later successful. While the part played by the hermit 
in the narrative is relatively small in extent, his réle is by 
no means unimportant. 
In the story of Arthour and Merlin the hermit Blase 
plays a highly important part. There are several ver- 
sions,!4° both in verse and prose; but since they all have 
much in common, only two versions, one in verse and one in 
prose, will here be examined. Apparently the earliest poetic 
version survives in MS. Auchinleck (1330-1340), and was 
\44There is apparently but one exception to this statement, and that, too. of such 
a singular nature as to raise the question of its legitimacy. In the romance, Guerin de 
Montglave (Histoire dutres preux et vaillant Guerin de Montglave; . . . et aussi 
parle des terribles & merveilleux faictz de Robastre & Perdigon pour secourir le dict 
Guerin et ses enfans—earliest edition, 1518) there is a giant of horrible aspect, Robas- 
tre, a companion in arms of Guerin de Montglave, who has turned hermit as an act 
of penance. When Hunault, a usurping duke, comes to the hermitage to be con- 
fessed, the catalogue of his crimes being finished, the giant hermit immediately knocks 
out his brains on the ground. This incongruous act is explained on the basis that, 
having made a confession, he would now die penitent; but if he lived, he would cer- 
tainly relapse into iniquity—a form of reasoning used by the angel in the pious tale, 
De Angelo qui duxit Heremitam ad diversa Hospitia, No. 80 Gesta Romanorum, also 
the groundwork of Parnell’s Hermit (c. ante, p. 66-7.) With the aid of Perdigon, a 
former companion of Guerin, once tolerably versed in black art, but at this time also 
a hermit, he assists Arnaud to escape from prison, after knocking out the jailer’s brains 
with an old cuirass which was buried below his hermitage. c. Dunlop: History of 
Fiction, London, 1896, p. 312ff.

composed in four-stress couplets in the neighborhood of 
Kent not later than 1325. Fearing the growth of good in 
the world, the devils ‘in hell seek to counteract this devel- 
opment by begetting a man-child that shall do as much evil 
as Christ did good. Accordingly, the devil destroys the 
family of a girl, begets on her a boy, and makes of her a 
woman of no repute. When the unfortunate mother is 
brought to trial and about to be put to death, a champion 
appears for her in the person of Blase (Blaisi), a hermit, 
who, learning the truth from her in the capacity of father 
confessor, has. the decision postponed until the child shall 
be two and a half years old and no longer requires the moth- 
er’s care. In the meantime he christens the child, who is 
called “Merlin,” and thus foils the purpose of his father, 
the devil.147 The child is thus happily placed beyond the 
power of his progenitor, but retains at the same time all the 
diabolical power of his father. Blaise has his mother made 
a nun, and thus preserves her life. The boy grows up to be 
a wonderful magician, and engages Blase to write down in 
a book what he reveals and what he shall perform as master 
of four kings to come. The story of the hermit thus runs 
throughout the entire narrative. 
The prose, Merlin, which survives in a fifteenth-century 
MS. in the Cambridge University Library (edited by Henry 
B. Wheatley, E.E.T.S., 1899, Vol. II, No. 36, 1899). parallels 
the Arthour and Merlin in the Blase story so closely that no 
further analysis is necessary here. JLovelich’s Merlin, con- 
sisting of approximately 2.800 lines in couplets, preserved 
in MS. 80, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, belonging to 
the later fifteenth century, composed about 1450, corre- 
sponds in general likewise with the prose Merlin'‘’ in the 
first 6,200 lines. 
A hermit likewise serves as a protector, though for a 
much shorter time, in the metrical romance, Ywain and 
Gawain (MS. Galba E, IX, early fifteenth century, consist- 
ing of 2,016 short couplets, with some use of alliteration, 
and probably composed in the Northern dialect, 1300-1350) . 
The hermit episode is brief, but characteristic. The hero,   
Mief, the power of a pious act over the devil in the pious tale, entitled How an Anchoress Was Tempted by the Devil, ante, p. 65. 48Tn discussing the character of the hermit Blase in the prose version. Mr. William E. Mead writes in Volume II (E.E.T.S., No. 36), page CCVIII, the following note: “Blase may be a mere invention, but Kolbing calls attention (in Altenglishe, Bibl. IV, p. exiii) to three passages in Layamon’s Brut where a hermit is mentioned whom Merlin knows and visits. Layamon translated (c. 1200) Wace, and made some addi- tions, due in part, it may be, to oral tradition. Robert de Borron, of course, knew nothing of Layamon; but the two writers might easily have stumbled upon the same popular story, preserved as a local tradition in more detail in one district than in an- other.” Mr. Scott F, Surtees, in E.E.T.S., 1871, identifies the hermit with Lupere. In Layamon’s Brut (c. Everyman’s Library edition, p. 173ff) the hermit’s name is not given, however, and his character in general seems to have little in common with that of Blase in the Merlin stories just treated.

Ywain, deprived of a magic ring and his wife’s love, goes 
mad with grief and wanders alone in a wood. Naked and 
forlorn, he is cared for by a hermit and later restored to his 
right mind by the efficacy of an ointment bestowed by a 
lady, ete. 
In Chevalere Assigne, the only representative of the cycle 
of legends about Godfrey of Bouillon in English before the 
fifteenth century, consisting of 370 alliterative long lines 
in MS. Cotton Caligula A II (fifteenth century), an East 
Midland copy of an apparently Northern or Northwestern 
original, we have a hermit again acting as the protector of 
the weak and oppressed. Falling under her own ungener- 
ous condemnation of any woman who bore more than one 
child at a birth as an adulterer, Beatrice, the wife of King 
Oryens, becomes mother at one time to seven children, six 
sons and a daughter, each with a silver chain about its neck. 
Matabryne, the evil mother of the king, accordingly sends 
her servant, Marcus, to drown the children, commanding 
him to substitute seven newborn whelps in their stead, and 
endeavors to have the queen put to death. Touched by their 
beauty and helplessness, Marcus leaves them wrapped in a 
blanket where they are later discovered and cared for by a 
hermit. Malkedras, a forester, finding the hermit absent 
with one of the boys, cuts the chains from the throats of the 
other children; whereupon all become swans and fly away. 
An angel warns the hermit that the surviving boy will fight 
for and save his mother’s life, and he thereupon tells him 
the story of his past and that of the other children. Imme- 
diately the boy prepares to champion his mother’s cause, 
and later succeeds in saving her life by fighting a duel with 
the wicked Malkedras. When the chains are placed on the 
necks of the six swans, one becomes a girl and the other 
five boys; but the seventh, having no chain, remains there- 
after a swan, and is called accordingly “Chevalere As- 
signe.” 
The prose version of the same'*® (not mentioned by Wells 
in Manual of Middle English Writings) presents certain out- 
standing differences and gives the hermit, whose name is 
here given as “Helias,” a more prominent place in the nar- 
rative. After giving the setting as stated before, the au- 
thor states that Helias prayed that God would send the chil- 
dren sustenance; whereupon “miraculously there came into 
his house a faire white goat,!®° the wiche beningnely came 
nere to the vii little children in presenting to them her milke,

and ther she gave them sucke naturally as their nource, 
and then retourned to the wood.” This she con- 
tinued until the children “waxe somwhat stronge and fol- 
owed her in the wood and aboute the hermitage.” 
The hermit baptized the children, and “one amonge the 
other the which to him was right beauteous and agreeable” 
he called “Helias . . . after hisowne name.” The account 
likewise states that King Oriant, after learning of Helias’ 
compassion on his children, gave him ‘“‘a great some of golde 
and silver to the entente that he should founde and edifie a 
churche of religion for the honour and reverence of the glo- 
rious virgin our lady sainct Mary. And for the remuner- 
ation of his vii children the which in suche wise myraclusly 
there had be nourisshed and sustented by the divine provi- 
dence of God.” Young Helias, after saving his mother’s 
life, became a famous knight, married a duchess, did many 
valorous deeds, succeeded his father on the throne, and 
then, like Guy of Warwick, forsook all and “made him selfe 
religious” —i. e., turned hermit. His death later is, in many 
respects, like that of Guy of Warwick—in being sought by 
his wife and dying shortly after being found and recognized. 
Ysaie le Triste (Sensuit V’histoire dysaie le triste, Filz de 
leonnois chevalier de la table ronde, etc.), a continuation of 
the romance of Tristan and Yseult (cir. 1500), is another 
romance which presents the hermit as a protector. Yseult, 
having given birth to an unlawful son, asked the aid of a 
hermit who resided in the vicinity; but the good man re- 
fused to baptize the offspring until the mother had made a 
full confession of her guilt and thus “paid the tribute which 
in those days conscience owed to religion.” The child was 
christened “‘Ysaie le Trist,” a combination of the names of 
his parents, after which he became a member of the hermit’s 
household. One night the hermitage is visited by a troop 
of fairies, attended by unearthly music, who, after washing 
the child, depart to the accompaniment of the same tune to 
which they had entered. The hermit is considerably dis- 
quieted by this visit, since the fairies are not Christians, 
in spite of the fact that they generously left behind a quan- 
tity of provisions. 
Later they return, and, after introducing themselves in 
due form. explain their coming by saying that they had been 
directed by the magician Merlin to look after the child. 
Accordingly, they invest the child with the peculiar virtues 
each had the power of bestowing, one giving him strength, 
another courage, and so on. Some time later they present 
young Ysaie with an ill-favored dwarf, called “Fronc,” as 
an attendant. 
i 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  98 The Hermit in English Literature 
Ysaie is now directed by the voice of Merlin, issuing from 
the enchanter’s tomb, to proceed to the hermitage of Lance- 
lot du Lac, who, being the lone survivor of the fatal battle 
with Modred, is now the only person worthy to invest the 
young man with the order of knighthood. Arriving at the 
hermitage, they find, however, that Lancelot is now dead; 
but the hermit, not to be outdone, raises the marble over the 
body of the famous warrior and with the right arm of the 
skeleton carries out Merlin’s command, at the same time 
accompanying the ghastly act with the following harangue 
on the duties of knighthood: “Chevalier, soies cruel a tes 
ennemys, debonnaire a tes amys, humble a non puissans, et 
aidez toujours le droit a soustener, et confous celluy qui tort 
a Vefes dames poures pucelles et orphelius; et poures gens 
aymes tourjours a ton pouir, et avec airne tourjours Saintes 
Eglise.” (Chapter IX.) When Ysaie later returns to his 
former abode at the hermitage, he finds that his benefactor 
has died in the meantime, and from this point on there is no 
further mention of hermits in the narrative. 
One of the few female hermits in English literature ap- 
pears as a protectress in the romance, Jourdain de Blaves 
(Les faitz et prouesses du noble et vaillant cheualier Jour- 
dain de Blaves, etc., 1520). Driabelle, the wife of the hero, 
cast overboard in a large cask during a storm to allay the 
tempest, in order to escape the amorous solicitations of a 
miller, who gave her shelter, finds refuge with a female 
hermitess on the borders of a forest in the territory of Pisa, 
where she is later discovered by the hero. 
THE HERMIT PENITENT 
In his remarkable History of Fiction, Mr. John Colin 
Dunlop (1785-1842) gives the following as a partial for- 
mula for a romance of chivalry: “The story is never carried 
on, as in the Greek romances, in the form of an epic poem, 
commencing in the middle of the action, but truly begins 
with the egg of Leda—the adventures of the father or grand- 
sire of the hero. After being protracted through a period 
of twenty or thirty years, the romance concludes with the 
death of the principal character, or his retirement into a 
hermitage.’ The latter alternative, while not as popular 
as the former, is still quite familiar in the English ro- 
mances, the presumption being that this pious manner of 
ending one’s life formed an ideal expiation for a life spent 
in ignoble strife and unending carnage. 
In several of the romances the reasons for retiring to a 
hermitage are definitely stated. In Guy of Warwick, one 
of the most popular of the medieval romances, with English

versions extant in the Auchinleck MS. (c. 1330-1340), M.S, 
Caius College, Cambridge, 107'*! (beginning of the fifteenth 
century), and various others (c. Wells’ Manual of Writ- 
ings of Middle English, 1050-1400, New Haven, 1916, pp. 
15-19), the hero, forty days after his marriage with the beau- 
tiful countess, Felice, which he had achieved by becoming 
the most illustrious knight in Christendom, is suddenly con- 
science stricken, as he stands in a tower gazing at the starry 
firmament, because God had given him so much honor, while 
he had done nothing for Him in return. 
“Mani man he hadde s!ayn wif wrong 
‘Alas, allas!’ it was his song.” 
Feeling himself utterly lost, he determines to do penance 
to the end of his life, and accordingly sets out for the holy 
land. His subsequent life is not wholly given up to penance, 
however, for he later engages in many bloody combats, and 
finally returns incognito to save his country from the rav- 
ages of a giant, after which he goes to look for a hermit in 
a forest. Finding the hermit dead, he takes up his abode 
in the hermitage, with a priest or chaplain to read mass to 
him every day and shrive him and a page to serve him. 
Here he lives until his death nine months later. He is in- 
formed of his approaching end by the angel Michael. Just 
before his death he sends a messenger with a ring to Felice, 
who comes to visit him with many lords. Guy dies and is 
taken to heaven by St. Michael, and sweet odors arise from 
his body, by which sick persons were healed.!52 The 
fifteenth-century version (E.H.T.S. No. 25-6, pp. 307-308) 
states that thirty knights were not able to remove his body, 
which was accordingly buried in the hermitage. Felice re- 
mains in the hermitage until her death forty days later, and 
is buried by his side. 
The Romans of Partenay or of Lusignen, otherwise known 
as The Tale of Melusine (translated from the French of La

College Library, Cambridge, ed. Rev. Walter W. Skeat,

definite act as the motive for turning hermit on the part of 
the hero. Melusine, one of the daughters of Helmas, Duke 
of Albany, is condemned by her mother to become a serpent 
from her waist down on every Saturday, on which days Ray-

times, each time uttering a terrible and mournful cry. For 
this cruel lack of discretion Raymond is deeply penitent, and 
goes to make his confession to the pope, who (ll 5126-5136) 
“For his synnes gaff penaunce full sharpely 
Raymound ther it toke to right gret plesaunce, 
Promittyng he wold do it full gladly 
To hys holy fader said with all his hert, 
And that thus wold go in-to som desert, 
So in wild exile all hys lif using 
For fair Melusine his love, wife, and spouse 
In many somers and winters being, 
Which that he hath lost by dedes shamlous.” 
He has hermit robes made, goes to Arragon and takes up 
his abode as a hermit at Montserrat, with a yeoman and 
chaplain as companions (cf. Guy of Warwick), and ends 
his days devoutly. 
The prose version, which is called Melusine (compiled 
originally, 1382-1394, by Jean D’Arias and englished cir. 
1500, edited from unique MS. in-the British Museum by 
A. K. Donald, E.E.T.S., extra series No. 68), gives addi- 
tional details concerning Raymond’s hermit life (p. 334ff). 
Arriving at Montserrat, “Raymondin,” as he is here called, 
visits the hermitages, and, finding the third empty through 
the death of its previous occupant, is tendered the cell by. 
the prior and officially made a hermit. He immediately 
becomes a favorite with the neighboring hermits, supplying 
them with extra meats, for which they praise God and pray 
. for the new arrival, after which he enters his cell and begins 
to lead a holy life. The news that a great prince has turned 
hermit brings many curious people to visit Raymondin, but 
he follows the correct usage of his new role and lives silently 
a devout life.

copy now in the possession of Earl Spencer by Octavia 
Richardson, E.E.T.S., extra series Nos. 44, 45), is also a 
confessed penitent, who turns hermit. As cousin of the 
four sons of Aymon and magician, resembling somewhat 
Merlin in the Arthurian story, he plays an important role

  The Hermit in English Literature 101 
in the struggle of the four sons against Charlemagne, after 
which, like Raymond, he confesses to the pope and receives 
his benediction, and finally turns hermit to expiate his 
sins. Two statements of the motive for his act occur in 
the narrative (p. 400): . He wente . . . into 
a woode beyond the ryver of Dordonne in to an hermytage 
where he lived like an hermyte a poure liffe, for to doo 
penaunce for his synnes.” Again, on page 465 he tells his 
cousin: “I have lefte the world for to serve hym that made 
me & the blessed virgyn Mary, his moder, for to have par- 
donne of my sinnes that I have doon in my life/ For I 
have don many grete evylles agenst my creatour and by me 
are deed so many folke,!5? whereof I knowe that our lorde 
is gretly wrothe agenst me.” 
In the prose version of The Knight of the Swanne (c. 
Chevalere Assigne, ante) the young Helias, after having 
achieved great fame as a knight (p. 768), “disposed him 
selfe to go into the hermitage where he had be nourisshed 
with his godfather the good devoute hermit, Helias, the 
which was disceased in our lorde,”’ and announces the same 
to his kindred. “I wyll here in generall recommaunde you 
to God, so say farewell, for to go amende my lyfe and yelde 
me religyous. For seying the graces and devine benefyces 
that God hath pleased to show for us, it behoveth to his 
divine wyll that I take payne to save my soule and pray 
for all my freendes. . . (P. 769.) “And 
there was none that durst gayn say him for the love of God, 
. . but began all to weepe dolorusly for the departing 
of the good Helias.” 
Friar Bacon, though he does not figure in any of the ro- 
mances of chivalry, deserves mention here as the only per- 
fect example of a character in an English medieval prose 
romance who turned true anchorite as an act of penance. 
The date of composition is uncertain. The work: is not 
mentioned by Wells in his Manual of Writings in Middle 
English, 1050-1400; and Thoms is unable to fix it in his 
introduction to Karly English Prose Romances (pp. 23-27), 
in which the work appears (pp. 285-328), beyond the state- 
ment (p. 26): “The prose history of ‘Friar Bacon’ here 
given may probably have been first published before Robert 
Greene’s play of the Honorable History of Frier Bacon and 
Frier Bongay, as it was plaied by her Majesties. servants,’ 
and printed in 1594. But there were frequent slightly dif- 
ferent editions of the popular prose book upon which the 
play was founded.”

his magic glass and the subsequent death of Vandermast 
and Friar Bungay, Friar Bacon kept his room and fell into 
a deep meditation upon the vanity of his achievements in 
arts and sciences; “and that the world should know how 
truly he did repent his wicked life’ he burned all of his 
books on magic publicly, disposed of all his goods, leaving 
nothing for himself, after which he “caused . 0 
be made in the church-wall a cell, where he locked himselfe 
in, and ther remained till his death. His time hee spent 
in prayer, meditation, and such divine exercises, 
lived . . . some two yeeres space in that cell, never 
comming forth: his meat and drink he received in at a win- 
dow, and at that window he did discourse with those that 
came to him; his grave he digged with his owne nayles, and 
was laid there when he dyed.”15+ 
Both Lancelot and Sir Bedivere end their days in her- 
mitages. Following the death of King Arthur and his 
newly made grave at a hermitage (Malory, Book 21, Chap- 
ter 6, p. 850), Sir Bedivere “swowned and whan he awoke 
he prayed the heremyte he myght abyde wyth hym stylle 
there/ to lyve wyth fasting and prayers.” The motive here 
expressed is not penitence, but sorrowful loyalty: “For 
from heus wyl I never goo sayd syr bedwere by my wylle 
but al the dayes of my lyf here to praye for my lord Ar- 
thur/” The hermit, who “was tofore bysshop of Caunter- 
burye,” readily agreed, and there “syr bedwere put vpon 
him poure clothes/ and servyd the hermyte ful lowly in 
fastyng and in prayers.” (Book 21, Chapter 13, p. 860.) 
“And Syr Bedwere was there ever stylle heremyte to his 
lyves ende.”

praye whyle my lyf lasteth/ yf that I may fynde ony here-

he arrives at the same hermitage where Bedivere had taken 
up his abode with the quondam Bishop of Canterbury; and 
being well received, he puts on the habit of a hermit, and 
“there she oe god day and nyzt with prayers and fast- 
ynges.” (P. 856.) . . wythin halfe a yere there

they likewise took “suche an habyte as he had/ Thus they 
endured in grete penaunce syx yere.” 
One of the several variants of The Four Sons of Aymon 
(Quatre fils d’ Aymon, 1525; see Dunlop’s History of Fiction, 
Vol. I, pp. 341, 344) states that Renaud, like Maugis, also 
elects to end his days as a hermit, being later killed while 
working as a mason on the wall of a church by his fellow 
laborers, who hated him because of his great piety. In Cax- 
ton’s 1489 version of the same (c. ante) the last-named in- 
cident is related; but nothing is said about his having be- 
come a hermit, the marginal note (p. 571) merely stating 
that he left his kinsmen “poorly clad like a hermit,” and his 
own words (p. 572): “I goo to save my soule, yf god gyve 
me the grace to doo soo; . . ./ For thrughe my cause 
are deed many a man [cf. words of Guy of Warwick] 
whereof I fele my pour soule greved sore, and therefore 
wyll I bere peyn on my body/ for it doyng penaunce all the 
remnant of my life/ and yf I may save my soule, I aske 
none other thyng.” 
A new motive for retiring from the world besides that 
of penitence (cf. Sir Bediwere) is presented in The Squyr 
of Lowe Degre,!>> composed in short couplets (cir. 1450), 
in the disappointed lover, a theme recurring with more or 
less frequency in later literature (cf. Gascoigne’s The Tale 
of Hermites, The Hermit, and Goldsmith’s Edwin and 
Emma, etc.). The story in general, which bears a strong 
resemblance to one version of Guy of Warwick, presents 
the familiar circumstance in romances of chivalry of lovers 
of unlike rank and of the lady who remains faithful, in 
spite of discouragements, during many years. The squire 
of low degree, discouraged at the hopelessness of his suit 
with the princess and overwhelmed with a melancholy 
which he cannot shake off, decides to become a hermit. His 
mistress, however, overhearing her lover’s complaint, com- 
forts him, accepts his love, but places him on probation for 
a period of seven years, during which time he must achieve 
sufficient fame to merit her love (cf. similar circumstance 
in Guy of Warwick). 
Later in the narrative the princess, supposing her squire 
dead, but really the wicked steward clad in the squire’s 
clothes, bewails her loss, bids farewell to the world, and 
determines to inure herself in an anchorage:   
The romance is preserved in Copland’s edition (cir. 1555-1560) in 1,132 verses, 
and in two fragments (180 verses, corresponding to Copland’s lines 1-60, 301-420) of 
Wynkyn de Worde’s edition (cir. 1520), owned by Mrs. Christie-Miller, of Burnham, 
Buckinghamshire. Another shorter version of 170 lines in short couplets, styled The 
Squier, appears in the Percy Folio MS: ff 444-46. It is believed that both versions, 
which ans substantially the same, go back to a lost metrical version based on a lost 
original.

“Farewell cronne unto my head; 
Farewell hawkes and farewell hounds; 
Farewell markes and many a pounde; 
Farewell huntynge at the hare, 
Farewell harte and hynde for evermare 
Now will I take the mantell and ye rynge15¢6 
And become’ an ancresse in my lyvynge.” 
Fortunately, the deception is discovered, and at length 
the squire is united to the faithful princess. 
In the Faerie Queen (Book VI, Canto V, Verse XXXIIff) 
is presented the single instance of a hermit in the fourfold 
role of penitent, host, healer, and counselor in one contin- 
uous episode. Prince Arthur leaves Serena and his squire 
in the care of a hermit, who (Canto V, Verse IV) — 
“Whilome . . . had been a doughty knight 
As any one that had lived in his days, 
And proved oft in many per’lous fight 
And in all battles bore away the bays: 
But being now attack’d with timely age, 
And weary of this world’s unquiet waye, 
He took himself unto this hermitage, 
In which he lived alone, like careless bird in cage.” 
Perceiving the wounds with which they (Serena and the 
squire) were afflicted, he straightway began to apply the 
balm of healing; for “he right well in leech’s craft was seen,” 
and “knew the divers vent of mortal ways.” Verse V: 
“One day, as he was searching of their wounds, 
He found that they had fester’d privily; 
And rankling inward with unruly stounds, 
The inner parts now gan to putrify. 
That quite they seem’d past help of surgery; 
And rather needed to be disciplined 
With wholesome rede of sad sobriety, 
To rule the stubborn rage of passion blind: 
Gives salves to every sore, but counsel to the mind.” 
So well did the good man advise them and so carefully did 
the two patients “hearken to his grave behests” and keep 
“so well his wise commandments” that they were soon thor- 
oughly healed, 
“Their wounds recured, and forces reincreast 
Of that good hermit loth they took their leave.” 
  
1°The ring is not mentioned in the Sarum Pontifical (printed, 1506) for the in- 
closing of anchorites. See full text in Clay's Hermits and Anchorites, Appendix A, 
p. 193. It does, however, require the sprinkling and blessing of the includendus’ 
habit. The oldest liturgy for this ceremony appears to be the fragmentary twelfth- 
century Ad Recludendum Anchoritam. Others are the Clifford Pontifical (Corpus 
Christi College), Chichele Pontifical (Trinity), Russell Pontifical (University Li- 
brary), the Exeter Pontifical (belonging to Bishop Lacy, 1420-1455), the York Pon- 
tifical (belonging to Archbishop Bainbridge, 1508-1514).

  The Hermit in English Literature 105 
From the foregoing analysis of the romances of chivalry 
it is apparent that we have now. arrived at the stage of the 
purely literary hermit, with a conventional setting for his 
abode and a well-defined series of conventional réles for 
him to play in the midst of the various feats of arms which 
the knights are constantly performing in the romances of 
chivalry. Considered in the aggregate, these rdles are by 
no means unimportant. Among other things, they establish 
the fact that the hermit was an ever-present accessory to 
knightly adventure, serving in the capacity of host, healer, 
confessor, teacher, and counselor for all knights-errant, 
and, like the knight himself, giving the world a convincing 
exemplification of the most unselfish ideals in penitence, 
protecting the weak, and burying the friendless dead. 
While these virtues were adumbrated in the hermit of 
history and of the pious tale in the preceding chapters, it 
may now be observed that the character of the hermit has 
become so confirmed in the popular mind and established 
through literary usage that the hermit as a mental concept, 
with a broadly accepted connotation, has become a definite 
part of the language of literature. The incremental growth 
in meaning of the word will be made apparent in the suc- 
ceeding chapters.
-P-A-G-E-104
  CHAPTER IV 
(1500-1660) 
The secularization of the hermit, dimly apparent in the 
romances of chivalry, was consummated in the sixteenth 
century. From a purely literary point of view it was but a 
change in emphasis upon the more popular and superficial 
aspects of the hermit’s character. The purely religious 
phases of his character were now almost entirely ignored, 
for the popular reverence for that sort of thing had largely 
passed. The reasons for the change in his literary charac- 
ter are easily explained. 
To begin with, the religious hermit suffered extinction as 
an historical figure during this period—and that, too, un- 
der conditions not conducive to increasing the public reli- 
gious reverence for him. With the Dissolution of the Mon- 
asteries in 1536, the hermit’s cell, long familiar to English 
men throughout the country, was doomed as a recognized 
part of the chantry system, and the hermit himself was 
allowed but a brief respite. While a few survivors re- 
mained, they were in places not easily accessible to state 
officials; and these, too, were almost inevitably homeless 
after the Suppression of the Chantries in 1546. The true 
hermit now belonged to a bygone age; for the “ornamental 
hermits,’”’ who flourished later during the pseudo-gothic 
revival, were only sentimental imitations and belonged to an 
entirely different category. 
It was likewise a transitional period in other circumstances 
which motivate literature. ‘The regime of the Middle Ages 
was just ended; its springs were exhausted, its mysteries 
unveiled, its terrors ridiculed.” . Though not entirely aban- 
doned,1*? the usages of knighthood were gradually dying 
out. ‘Armour was beginning to be thought troublesome ;” 
the towers of the strong castles were discovered to be too 
dark and confined for a generation of pleasure lovers, who 
characterized themselves as well when they called their 
native land “Merrie England.” In similar fashion “the rea- 
sonings of the school men had grown old; blind faith was 
out of fashion; a world was ending, and all that was sink- 
ing with it” appeared in the new generation “out of season 
and ‘tedious as a twice-told tale.’ ” 
In changes so far-reaching and so noteworthy as these 
  
181§ee tilting matches in the reign of Queen Elizabeth (1590), as described in Peele’s 
Polyhymnia.
-P-A-G-E-105
    The Hermit in English Literature 107 
just indicated, the hermit, as a literary figure, lost some of 
his former characteristics and, in turn, acquired others 
equally important. These will be treated in the following 
chapter under the heads: (1) “The Hermit in Fiction,” 
including romances of chivalry and popular ballads; (2) 
“The Hermit in the Drama,” including masques; (3) “The 
Hermit in Poetry,” with especial reference to the lyric. 
The net result of these changes was that the literary field 
of the hermit was greatly narrowed. Of the many literary 
uses of the hermit exemplified in the last chapter, but two 
continued to figure prominently, and these two were suffi- 
ciently changed to constitute almost different categories. 
The hermit counselor became the hermit philosopher, but his 
philosophy smacked more of morals than of religion. Like- 
wise the hermit as a protector of the weak was secularized 
into the peacemaker, whose literary function was to resolve 
difficulties between warring factions. In addition to these 
literary uses, the hermit appears as a sort of interlocutor 
in one or two dramatic works; and finally there developed 
in lyric poetry what we may term the “hermit mood,” which 
led more or less directly to a revival of the world-old con- 
troversy about the respective merits of the active as op- 
peat to the contemplative life—i. e., the philosophy of soli- 
tude. 
THE HERMIT IN FICTION (1500-1660) 
In the last chapter we treated in detail the hermit as a 
literary character in the romances of chivalry, in which it 
was shown that the solitary developed certain conventional 
roles. Many of these stories in which the hermit played a 
picturesque part continued to have a vogue. To offset the 
changing public taste with regard to chivalry, the printers 
(or publishers) succeeded for a time in infusing a new in- 
terest in these old legendary heroes by publishing popular 
editions of the medieval classics, containing hermit epi- 
sodes in small handy volumes, attractively embellished with 
illustrations in the form of wood cuts. Among these were 
Robert the Devyl, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1510 (?), 
and The Knight of the Swanne, also printed by de Worde 
in 1512. W. Copland likewise published Syr Degore about 
1550, The Knight of the Swanne, and many others. Guy of 
Warwick was published in similar fashion about 1560. 
The illustrations proved an attractive feature. In gen- 
eral, the cuts were picturesque and well adapted to the 
character of the narrative. A picture of the hero usually 
adorned the title-page, mounted upon his charger, with 
sword drawn, his plume full spread, and wearing a defiant 
look. Sometimes he was represented as followed by a faith-
-P-A-G-E-106
  108 The Hermit in English Literature 
ful squire, sometimes only by his dog. Between the feet of 
his horse fabulous plants spread their unlikely leaves and 
gave the sole and very doubtful clue to the country in which 
the knight was traveling—certainly a very desolate and 
unpleasant one. In this fashion does Duke Robert of Nor- 
mandy travel, and so does Eglamoure and Tryamoure and 
Beirs and Isumbras. In the same series, too, is to be seen” 
“*VYe noble Helyas, Knight of the Swanne,’ drawn by the 
said swan, a somewhat wooden bird. . 
The chief defect in these artistic embellishments was a 
lack of variety. A rather fine engraving in one book is a 
lord and lady in a garden, which represents Guy of War- 
wick courting “fayre Phelis” (London, 1560), and likewise 
serves for “La bel Pucell” and the knight ‘Graund Ar- 
moure,” called the ‘“‘Pastime of Pleasure” by Stephen Hawes 
(London, 1555), and is used again by W. Copland in The 
Squyr of Lowe Degre.’ Full as these narratives are of 
extraordinary “inventions, unrestrained as their authors 
were by considerations of what was possible or real, some 
dozen well-chosen engravings seem enough to illustrate any 
number of them.” As a matter of fact, “all their heroes 
are the same hero; and whether he was following the philo- 
sophical turn of his mind or merely the thrifty orders of his 
printer, the engraver was well justified in leaving, as he 
did, an empty scroll over the heads of his knights for the 
publisher to label them at will ‘Robert the Devil’ or ‘Romu- 
dus?< 2 
Chivalry, in the medieval sense, was gone, but not for- 
gotten ; it still continued to function in a sort of sentimental 
fashion. “In the reign of Elizabeth and James I armour 
was probably very little worn; but every country knight 
and esquire possessed a suit of armour, which usually hung 
in his hall over his chair of state, surrounded by corslets 
and iron hats, pikes and halberts, crossbows and long bows, 
wherewith to arm his serving men and tenants if civil trou- 
ble or foreign invasion should call the fighting men of the 
country into the field.’’15s 
Another practice reminiscent of the days of chivalry was 
the survival of the knightly jousts in the form of tilting 
matches, a practice of which Elizabeth seems to have been 
remarkably fond, according to the accounts given by Segar 
in his Honor, Military and Civil.” In Book III, Chapter 54, 
entitled The Original Occasions of the Yeerly Triumphs in 
England, he credits the origin of the custom to “the right 
SCutts: Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages. London, p. 458-9. The prac- 
tice is likewise noted in Ben Johnson’s Epicene (1609), who makes Truewit say: 
“He is so hung around with pikes, halberds, petronels, calivers, and muskets that he 
looks like a justice of peace’s hall.”

vertuous and honourable Sir Henry Lea, Master of her high- 
nesse Armorie,” who “of his great zeale and earnest desire 
to eternize the glory of her maiestres court, in the beginning 
of her happy reign, voluntarily vowed (unless infirmity, 
age, or other accident did impeach him) during his life to 
present himself at the tilt armed, the aforesayed (Novem- 
ber 17th, the anniversary of Elizabeth’s accession to the 
throne) yeerly, there to perform in honor of her sacred 
maiestre, the promise he formerly made. Whereupon the 
lords and gentlemen of the sayed court, incited by so wor- 
thy an example, determined to continue that custome, and 
not vnlike to the antient Knighthood della Banda in Spaine, 
have ever since, yerely assembled in Armes accordingly.159 
One celebration, at least, held November 17, 1589, was the 
occasion of a poetic work by George Peele, the full title be- 
ing: ‘“Polyhymnia, Describing the honourable Triumph at 
Tylt before her Maistie on the 17 of November last, being 
the first day of the three and thirthth yeare of Her High- 
nesse raigne, with Sir Henrie Lea his resignation of honour 
at Lylt, to her Maiestie and received by the right honour- 
able Earle of Cumberland, Printed at London by Richard 
Jhones 1590.” One part of the work, referring to Sir 
Henry’s retirement, called a “sonnet,” in spite of the fact 
that it contains sixteen lines, “pronounced and sung by M. 
Hales, her maiesties servant, a gentleman in that arte excel- 
lent, and for his voice both commendable and admirable,” 
is undoubtedly a fantastic conceit, based upon the retirement 
of the knight to a hermitage as the ideal penitence—an epi- 
sode frequently met with in the tales of chivalry as recorded 
in the preceding chapter (Il 7-16) : 
“My helmet now shall make an hiue for bees 
And louers songs shall turne to holy psalms; 
A man-at-armes must now sit on his knees, 
And feed on prayers, that are old ages almes; 
And so [though?] from court to cottage I depart, 
My saint is sure of mine vnspotted hart. 
“And when I sadly sit in homely cell, 
I’l teach my swaines this carrol for a song— 
Blest be the hearts that thinke my souereigne well, 
Curse be the soules that thinke to do her wrong. 
Goddesse vouchsafe this ag’d man his sight, 
To be your beadsman now that was your knight.” 
Perhaps also for sentimental reasons some of the heroes 
of the romances of chivalry continued to have a vogue in 
the popular ballad. Throughout the greater part of Eliza- 
°How long the celebration continued does not appear in the account, though it is 
known that Sir Henry later resigned his honor to George Earl of Cumberland because 
of his advanced age.

beth’s reign (1558-1603) it was usual “in places of assem- 
bly” for the people to be “desirous to heare of old adventures 
and valiaunces of noble knights in times past, as those of 
King Arthur and his Knights of the round table, . 
Guy of Warwicke and others like, in long and short meters 
and even by breaches or divisions” (probably fits), “to be 
more commodiously sung to the harpe.’®° Besides the min- 
strels, there were also “common Rimers fond of making 
rhymes in small and popular Musickes sung by these Canta- 
banqui (common rhymes) upon benches and barrels’ heads, 
, or else by blind Harpers, . . . their matter 
being for the most part stories of old times as the tale of 
Simphopase i 2a) AGuy, 02 lca eter tel 
Most of this ephemeral poetry, because of its lowly origin, 
has doubtless perished; but we have a good example of its 
quality in the familiar Guy of Warwick story, including 
the hermit episode, entitled Guy and Phillis, entered upon 
the stationer’s book, January 5, 1591-2. The story, which 
appears in fragmentary form in oe Reliques (re- 
printed, London, 1886), Vol. III, p. 107ff, is written in 
quatrains, with a variable rhyme eae is told in the 
first person throughout, and the narrative continues, 
strangely enough, with a rather modern air beyond the 
hero’s death: 
“My body that endured this toyle, 
Though now it be consumed to mould; 
My statue faire engraven in stone 
In Warwicke still you may behold.” 
The hermit episode, quite naturally, is naively told, with 
a few original touches (ll 119ff) : 
“At length to Warwick I did come 
Like pilgrim poore and was not known; 
And there I lived a hermitt’s life 
A mile or more out of the towne, 
“Where with my hands I hewed a house 
Oute of a craggy rocke of stone; 
And lived like a palmer poore 
Within that cave myself alone.” 
The fact that the author twice compares Guy’s hermit life

venders lost caste and sunk so low in public favor that in 1597 they were proscribed 
and bracketed with “rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars ;” and the statute seems to have been so well enforced that the profession has become practically extinct.

versions of Sir Guy (cf. Liber de Hyda, Rolls, 45, 122-3; 
Dugdale’s Warwickshire 1, 273, 275; Romance of Guy of 
Warwick, E.E.T.S., 1875, 302-7) the account of his retire- 
ment is uniformly different. ‘He repaired to a heremite 
that resided amongst the shady woods hard by, desiring 
. . to receive some spiritual comfort, where he abode 
with that holy man till his death and . . . succeeded 
him in that Cell.” Three views of the hermitage are given 
by Clay (Hermits and Anchorites of England, pp. 35, 36), 
one of which shows the gigantic statue, nine feet high, re- 
ferred to in the ballad.162 
Leaving the hermit of the old romances, with his well- 
defined religious réles, inherited from the saints’ legends 
and tales, we arrive at a new literary type of the hermit in 
the Elizabethan romance, Euphues and His England (1580), 
by John Lyly. In contrast with the Christian ascetic of 
the earlier chapters, he is moral, and his chief function is 
telling tales with moral intent. His character is clearly de- 
rived from the hermit counselor of the romance of chiv- 
alry, and he developed a numerous progeny of moralizing 
offspring in later literature, including several of Samuel 
Johnson’s hermits and one of Fielding’s in Tom Jones. 
His character suggests the Roman oracle, though he is often 
too loquacious for oracular reverence, and he is too much 
interested in the affairs of the world, from which he has 
withdrawn, to be of a profoundly religious nature (cf. 
Gawain’s visit to his aunt, an anchoress). 
The unreligious character of the hermit in this new role 
appears likewise in the subject about which he moralizes. 
Instead of rebuking sin and absolving the sinner by con- 
fession and penance, as formerly, Lyly’s hermit is intro- 
duced to inveigh against the evils of foreign travel—a pr 
vincial prejudice shared by other prominent writers of theage.      
16?The story of Guy is remarkably popular in English literature. Besides those ver- 
sions already given, there is a poetical version by Lydgate (1370-1450), consisting of 
about 74 8-line stanzas on Guy’s fight with the giant and his life and death at the 
hermitage; John Lane’s poem (1621) of the whole romance, but never printed, con- 
sisting of 17,450 lines; Samuel Rogers’ famous History of Guy, Earle of Warwick. a 
poem in 12 cantos, published before 1630; Guy and Phillis, P. S. MS. II 201, 608. For 
a full discussion, see the following monographs: A Tanner, Die 
Warwick; Unter suchung uber ihre Geschicte, Heilbroun, 1887, 
Zupitza, Anglia, 192-99. An extensive and thoroughgoing study ‘of Guy of Warwick 
in English literature would prove a valuable addition to-English literary scholarship. 
Jusserand, in his English Novel in the Time of Shakespeare, London, 1903, p. 350, 
reprints an engraving from a chapbook of the eighteenth century entitled History of 
Guy, Earl of Warwick, 1750 (?.), in which Guy is represented in a cocked hat, ad- 
dressing a skull, which he carries in hand, and facetiously remarks: “We are only 
surprised that ‘Alas poor Yorick’ does not come in.”

    112 The Hermit in English Literature 
The narrative, which is told by Euphues, a young gentle- 
man of Athens, to Philautus, a young gentleman of Naples, 
while the two are on the sea en route to England, has for 
its text the following: “If Travailers of this age were as 
warye of their conditions, as they are venterous of their 
bodyes, or as willing to reape profit by their paines, as they 
are to endure perill for their pleasure, they would either 
prefer their own soyle before a straunge Land, or good coun- 
sell before their owne conceyte.” 
Callimachus, living “in the Island Scyrum, the son of 
Cassander,” so wealthy that he was thought to have almost 
all the money in that country in his own coffers, finds 
himself at his father’s death heir only to some wise counsel 
contained in a sealed letter, bearing the inscription, ‘In 
finding nothing thou shalt find all things ;” enraged, he sells 
all the tangible property remaining, and sets out to travel 
over the world in search of pleasure. In the course of his 
peregrinations he stops to rest himself “vppon the side of 
a siluer streame.’’'*! He discovers a hermitage in a cave, 
in which sits ‘‘an olde man cladde all in gray, with a head as 
white as Alablaster, his hoarie beard hanging downe well 
neere to his knees, with no earthly creature, saving onelye 
a Mouse sleeping in a Cattes eare.” Amused at the strange 
spectacle, he watches the three at their evening meal, the 
hermit partaking quite properly of “certayne rootes on the 
which he fedde hungerlye, having no other drinke then 
fayre water,”!°° the mouse and cat eating “such reliques 
as the olde manne had left, yea and that so louinglye, as 
one woulde haue thought them both married, iudging the 
Mouse to be very wilde, or the Cat very tame.’’166 
The young man becomes the hermit’s guest for the night, 
and gives him the particulars of his life, from which the 
old man, whose name is also “Cassander,” discovers that 
Callimachus is his nephew, the solitary being a twin brother 
of the young man’s father. Learning of his nephew’s in- 
tention to travel over the world, he seeks to stay him from 
his enterprise, and accordingly tells him the story of his own 
life to show him the folly of travel. A wild, incorrigible 
youth, opposite in every respect from his irreproachable 
brother, he had chosen a bag of gold at his father’s death, 
while his sober-minded brother had selected a bag “stuft 
with writings” as his legacy. Thus armed, he had become 
a true cosmopolite through endless travel, wasting his sub- 
stance, like the prodigal son that he was, in riotous living,

and finally returning home to find his brother rich as a re- 
sult of his industry and thrift, while he was nothing more 
than a beggar. Overwhelmed with the “mischiefes” of his 
wasted life, he retired to the hermitage where he now dwelt. 
Callimachus, “obstinate in his fond conceit,” was not, 
however, to be deterred by this object lesson, and imme- 
diately departed for foreign lands after receiving some ex- 
cellent moral precepts from the hermit. He returned in 
tatters and shame later to the hermit’s cell, having learned 
for himself the wisdom of the old man’s advice. The her- 
mit received him kindly, gave to him ten thousand pounds, 
which his father had bequeathed to his son “in his most 
extremity and necessity, . . . foreseeing that his young 
colt will never beare a white mouth without a hard bridle,” 
and urged him henceforth “to be a comfort to his friends, 
and a reliefe to his poore neighbours, which would be as 
the fulfilling of his Father’s last Will’”—an injunction which 
Callimachus gladly obeyed. 
The philosophizing — or, better, perhaps, moralizing — 
propensities of Lyly’s hermit appear conspicuously in Rob- 
ert Greene’s Arbasto, King of Denmark, if one can judge 
fairly from the author’s characteristic tendencies in his 
other works'* and the prolix statement of the title itself: 
“The History of Arbasto, King of Denmarke. Describing 
the loue to faire Doralicia. Wherin Gentlemen may find 
pleasant conceite to purge melancholy, and perfect counsell 
to preuent mis-fortune. By Robert Greene, Master of Art. 
Omne tubit punctum qui miscuit vtile duleci. . . .” The 
date of composition is in doubt, but the romance was ap- 
parently published in 1584.168 
In this romance the importance of the hermit as a char- 
acter is enhanced by being made the hero, for he is no less 
a personage than Arbasto himself, who is a sort of Timon of 
Athens, for he forsook the world originally for no other 
reason than that he despises it for its treachery. It is 
doubtful whether Shakespeare’s misanthrope deserves the 
name of “hermit,” but Greene’s character is called a “‘soli- 
tary” and lives in a cell—two fairly accurate marks of a 
true hermit. He lives on the island of Candia, ‘where 
Greene had the good fortune to hear from his own lips” the 
wonderful and authentic tale which the author recounts. 
The hermit, as a philosopher, appears unmistakably in   
2'The work referred to has proved inaccessible to me, but I rely for my statement upon the authority of Jusserand (The English Novel in the Time of Shakespeare, Lon- don, 1890, p. 168): “His (Greene’s) moral propensities do not lie concealed behind 
pretty descriptions or adventures; they are stamped on the very first page of his 
books, and are expressly mentioned in their titles. In this, too, like his master, Lyly, he may be considered a precursor of Richardson.” See Greene’s Funerales, 1594; also Jusserand’s statement, footnote, p. 167.

another work by Greene, also inaccessible to me; but if one 
may judge from a description of the contents again afforded 
by the title, the point of view may even have been suggested 
by the hermit or hermits who appear in the book. A por- 
tion of the title, which is even longer than usual, may prove 
sufficient: ““Greene’s Never Too Late. Or a Powder of Ex- 
perience; sent to all youthful gentlemen; to roote out the 
infectious follies, that ouer-reaching conceits foster in the 
spring time of their youth. Decyphering in a true English 
historie, those particular vanities, that with their frostie 
vapours nip the blossoms of every ripe braine, from attain- 
ing to his intended perfection, etc. .’ The work is 
divided into two parts, each with an extensive title, and was 
first printed in 1590. 
Greene’s hermit in this work is not only a philosopher, 
but he is also a poet, for he warns youth in a manner sug- 
gesting biblical proverbs against the “vainglorious shows” 
of the world in poetic philosophy,'*® entitled The Hermit’s 
Verses in Dyce’s Dramatic and Poetical Works of Robert 
Greene and George Peele (London, 1874, p. 295). A few 
quotations taken at random will show the nature of his 
philosophy : 
“T want not, for my mind affordeth wealth; 
I know not envy, for I climb not high; 
Thus do I live, and thus I mean to die. 
As man is frail and apt to follow pride; 
Then see, my son, when I have in my cell 
A dead man’s skull, which calls this straight to mind, 
That as this is, so must my ending be, 
But as the glass runs out with every hour, 
Some in their youth, some in their weakest age, 
All sure to die, but no man knows his time. 
With holy armour—here’s the martial sword, 
This book, this bible, this two-edged blade, 
Whose sweet content pierceth the gates of hell, 
Deciphering laws and discipline of war, 
To overthrow the strength of Satan’s jar.”170 
1ef. Lovelace’s “Minds innocent and quiet take 
That for a hermitage,” etc. 
1A great variety of such poetic advice was put in the mouth of the hermit in 
English magazines during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. cf. Gentle- 
men’s Magazine, December, 1756; September, 1769; April, 1775; December, 1785. 
Sometimes the lyric note far transcends the moral with excellent results. Such is 
the case in some verses written for a pseudo-hermitage, during the English landscape- 
gardening movement, by the poet laureate, Thomas Warton, in which the conventional 
relation of the hermit and the wild animals is not forgotten: 
“Within my limits, lone and still, 
The blackbird sings in artless trill; 
Fast by my couch, congenial guest, 
The wren has built her mossy nest ; 
From social scenes, by Nature wise, 
To lurk with innocence she flies ; 
Here hopes in safe repose to dwell, 
Nor aught suspects the sylvan cell.”

The Hermit in English Literature 115 
At least one other romance of this period, the Most Fa- 
mous Delectable and Pleasant History of Parismus, the Re- 
nowned Prince of Bohemia, by Emanuel Forde (1598), pre- 
sents a hermit character, though to what extent I am unable 
to say, since it has not been possible to locate it. The work 
enjoyed remarkable popularity, however, a thirteenth 
edition appearing in 1649, and still others in 1663, 1664, 
1665, 1668, 1671, 1684, 1690, 1696, and 1704.71 Among a 
great variety of incidents, “the prince is abandoned by 
pirates on a desolate Isle, where . . . there are a her- 
mit and an enchanted castle.” The episode, according to 
Dunlop (p. 547), may “just possibly have suggested Defoe’s 
Robinson Crusoe, though he offers no evidence for his be- 
lief.” The great literary success of his venture encour- 
aged Forde to write several other novels “exactly in the same 
style, containing the same improbable monsters and won- 
shar and other hermit episodes doubtless appear in these 
works. 
THE HERMIT IN THE DRAMA 
Passing now to the drama, we observe the hermit making 
his début on the stage in a masque, entitled ‘“‘The tale of 
Hermetes the heremyte by George Gascoigne.” It was 
written for the queen’s amusement—and, we may suspect, 
for the author’s advancement—and pronounced “before the 
Magesty att Woodstoe, 1575.’172 (Royal MSS. 18 A, XL, 
VIII, in the British Museum, and printed in the first volume 
of Queen Elizabeth’s Progresses, by William Nichols.) ‘He 
(Gascoigne) accompanied the Queen,” says Nichols (Pro- 
gresse, Vol. 1, p. 581, note), “in her progress to Kenilworth 
(see Scott’s Kenilworth), and wrote this masque for her 
amusement.”’ Some of the verses were not only written, 
but spoken, by him on that occasion; but the whole of the 
entertainment, owing to the unfavorable weather, was not 
performed. Continuing in attendance on the Queen, we 
find him at Woodstock amusing the royal traveler with the 
Hermit’s Tale. An address to the Queen is prefixed to this 
tale in the text, in which he complains of “his infirmities.” 
The masque itself, in the form in which it is presented 
in Gascoigne’s works, from a technical point of view, 
scarcely deserves the title, since it is entirely in prose, and, 
while having the machinery of gods, goddesses, magic, and   
17[his statement is made upon the authority of Jusserand (The English Novel, 
1890, p. 193). Dunlop, in his History of Fiction (new edition, revised by Henry Wil- 
son), Vol. 11, p. 547, says: “The fifteenth edition appeared in 1704. Admitting that 
no edition appeared between 1598 and 1649—a very unlikely case—thirteen editions 
had assuredly appeared by 1704.” 
14®The text, which appears in archaic spelling in the English version, is given also 
in “latyne, Italyan, and frenche,” and appears in Gascoigne’s works, edited by Will- 
iam Carew Hazlitt (Roxborough Library, 1870), Vol. 11, p. 141ff.

enchantment, is really nothing more than a knightly nar- 
rative, told by Hermites, the hermit. It has two prologues, 
or introductions—one addressed to the “most valyant 
Knights” and the other to the Queen, and an epilogue like- 
wise addressed to the Queen. The first address to the 
Queen sets forth somewhat indefinitely the purpose of the 
narrative: ‘Most excellent princesse: forepointed from 
above with yor presence to please and yor virtue to profitt 
more then you are aware of; how muche you are bound to 
the Immortall godds and mortall men be bownd to you, 
oure present case will partly prove/ But before you und- 
stand the worth of yor virtue, it may please you to heare 
the varyableness of yor adventures/” 
The story, which is a strange mixture of Oriental back- 
grounds, gods and goddesses, knights and ladies, begins, 
“In the country of Cambaya wich is scytuate neere the 
mouthe of the riche ryver Indus;” has for its principal 
characters three sets of lovers—Granddina, “the one onely 
daughter” of a mighty duke named ‘“‘Oceanon,” loved and 
beloved by a knight “of estate but meane but of value very 
great,” called “Cantarenus;”’ another “most noble knight, 
named ‘Loricus,’”’ who loved a “ladie that was matchles,” 
but who disdained his love; and Hermites, “formerly a 
Knighte, knowne and accepted of wth the best in the world,” 
who loved a strange lady who could “‘torune to twenty dyvers 
shapes.” At the beginning of the action the three sets of 
lovers are separated. Cantarenus, whose suite is opposed 
by Duke Oceanon, through the work of an enchantress em- 
ployed by the duke, has been “carryed in the ayre from the 
coaste of Cambaya to the very bondes of the Ocean Sea;” 
Loricus, estranged from his lady because of her disdainful 
treatment, has left his own country and “betooke hymself 
altogether to travel and to armes;” and Hermites has like- 
wise lost his lady, who disappeared after “first assuming 
the shape of a Tigress so terrible to beholde” that he feared 
to look upon her. Granddina, determined to find Cantare- 
nus, left her country and at last arrived at the “grott of 
Sibilla,” where by chance she met Loricus, from whom she 
learns of his distress and imparts to him her own and 
jointly presents their sorrow to Sibilla. They receive the 
answer that “as they were now coupled by fortune, they 
should never part fellowship til they had found owte a 
place whare men were moste strange and women most 
fayre/ the country most fertyll/ the people most welthy/ 
govnn’t most just/ and the princes most wourthy/ So 
should the lady see that would content her/ so shoulde the 
knighte here that wold comfort hym.”
-P-A-G-E-115
  The Hermit in English Literature LV 
The hermit then proceeds to recount his own cruel mis- 
fortunes at the hands of Venus. Seeking to enter her tem- 
ple doors as suppliant, he had been “‘sodenly stricken 
blynde:” and, inauiring his offense, he had been told that 
it was because of his divided worship that he had been thus 
strangelv punished. Seeking an advocate in the person of 
Apollo, he made intercession to that deity; whereupon he 
had been comforted by Mercury in these words, “The gods 
3 be iust, though women be angrye. 7 ang 
commanded to seek the remedy of his woes from the oracle 
at Delvhi. The oracle answers his entreaty mysteriously, 
“The best beside the beawty-fullest,” which failing to un- 
derstand. the priest of Apollo comes to his rescue and ex- 
plains fully all his past difficulties. 
In the midst of this strange medley of mythological fancy, 
a bit of hermit philosophy crops out, strangely enough, in 
the speech of Apollo’s priest: “Eyes shutt from delightes 
have myndes more open to understandind.” 
In recompense for his misfortunes, Apollo grants to Her- 
mytes the strange gift of being “able to decynher the des- 
tyny of evry one in love and better advyse them than the 
best of her (Venus’) dearlings.”’ He was likewise promised 
the restoration of his sight when “att one tyme and in one 
place in a country of most peas two of the most vallyant 
Knights shall fighte, two of the most constant lovers shall 
meete & the most virtuous lady in the world shall be theree 
to look on’’—all of which was a palpable effort at flattery 
for some of the most conspicuous spectators there assem- 
bled, including, of course, the Queen. 
Immediately after the prophecy is announced to Hermytes 
he is transferred at the command of Apollo to the hermitage 
wherein he now dwells; and having ‘“‘wyntered many a yere 
farre from the woes and wrongs the world besides is full 
of,’ he sees before him all the prophecies, including the 
oracular utterance of Sibilla to Granddina and Loricus, ful- 
filled before his eyes. 
Hermytes here pledges himself to pray for the Queen. 
and invites her to visit his humble abode. ‘This tale ended 
he ledde her to his hermytage. Wheare when he was come 
he used these words following and so did leave her: ‘Here, 
most noble lady, have I now brought you to this most sym- 
ple hermytage, where as you shall see, small cunning but of 
nature, and no cost but of good will/ myne hower approach- 
eth for my orisons wch according to my vowe I must never 
breake/ I must then leave yor. . . . to pray (as for 
my soule) that whosoever wishe you best, may never wish 
in vayne.’ ”

118 The Hermit in English Literature 
A hermit plays a similar réle in a royal pageant written 
by the dramatist, George Peele (1558-1597), entitled The 
Hermit’s Speech, and delivered before the Queen upon the 
occasion of her visit to Theobald’s,17? the seat of Lord 
Burghley, May 10, 1591. The piece was originally printed 
in Collier’s History of English Dramatic Poetry, and con- 
tains a sufficient number of striking similarities to sug- 
gest that there were certain conscious borrowings or that 
the hermit had become the conventional master of ceremo- 
nies for royal visits where pageantry was a part of the cere- 
monies. It was written at the instigation of Lord Burghley’s 
son, who enlisted Peele’s poetic talents for the occasion (cf. 
Milton’s Comus) . 
The speech, consisting of 114 blank-verse lines in iambic 
pentameter, was delivered in the guise of a hermit by Rob- 
ert Cecil, who was knighted just afterwards, and is referred 
to later by Sir Robert on the occasion of the Queen’s visit 
to Theobald’s again in 1794. In substance, it explained 
the absence of the host, Lord Burghley, then Lord Treas- 
urer, who was not present to welcome the Queen, by stating 
that he had taken up his abode in a near-by hermitage, in 
consequence of grief over the recent loss of his mother, 
wife, and daughter, and had selected the hermit, whose cell 
he had temporarily usurped, to do the honors of the house 
in his stead. As a matter of fact, the Lord Treasurer had 
forsaken his mansion for an obscure cottage after his series 
of bereavements and made few visits to court. The Queen 
herself was probably involved in the little conceit, for a sort 
of mock writ or summons as a bit of official playfulness was 
presented on the occasion, directing Sir Christopher Hatton 
to withdraw Lord Burghley from his seclusion, in the text 
of which he is referred to as a hermit. The dispossessed 
hermit prays the Queen to be restored to his hermitage: 
“And that (your) majesty’s Lord Chamberlain 
May from your highness have the like command 
To cause my founder, now the guardian 
Of this (fair) house, increased for your delight, 
To take the charge thereof this present night: 
Which being done I’ll to my hermitage, 
And for your highness pray continually 
That God may pour upon you all his blessings 
And that the hour glass of your happy reign 
May run at full and never be at wane.” 
While a number of isolated references occur in Shake- 
speare’s works, the character made small dramatic appeal;

The Hermit in English Literature 119 
for in but one play, As You Like It, does a bona fide hermit 
appear among his dramatis personae, and he does not ap- 
pear in person. Granted that Shakespeare’s attitude was 
representative of his age, a study of these verbal usages will 
prove helpful in showing (1) how lacking was the Eliza- 
bethan age in sympathy for the religious solitary, and (2) 
what new literary usages for the hermit were developed. 
Shakespeare uses the word “hermit” only eight times in his 
plays, “hermitage” twice, and “anchor” (anchorite) once; 
but the plays in which the word occurs cover the larger part 
of his dramatic career, beginning with Love’s Labor Lost 
(c. 1591) and extending through Macbeth (1606). The 
hermitage, as the essence of forlorn and cheerless naked- 
ness, appears in three plays (Love’s Labor Lost, V. 2, 805; 
Richard IT, iii 3, 148; Hamlet, iii 2, 229) ; the hermit, as 
a skillful religious beggar, occurs twice (7. Andron, iii 2, 
41; Henry IV, V. 1, 71); the great age of hermits is men- 
tioned twice (Love’s Labor Lost, IV. 3, 242; Henry VI, ii 5, 
117) ; his lack of wit is ridiculed in one particular instance 
(Twelfth Night, IV. 2, 15); he is referred to as a “‘beads- 
man’’—i. e., one who is hired to offer prayers for another 
(cf. Richard II, iii, 116); in one of his later tragedies 
(Macbeth, i 6, 20) “hermit pity” is used as a synonym of 
effeminacy in one play (Trotl. and Cres., V. 3, 45); and in 
but one play (Merchant of Venice. V. i, 33) is he character- 
ized as “holy.” While the preceding word analysis allows 
no hard and fast deduction, it presents another interesting 
commentary upon the changed attitude toward the hermit 
in literature and points the way to one new literary role 
which Shakespeare himself seems to have initiated—the 
use of the hermitage and the office of the hermit in affaires 
de coeur. 
In the concluding scene of Love’s Labor Lost (Act V, ii 
800ff) the Princess condemns Ferdinand to a year’s penance 
in “some forlorn and naked hermitage” to atone for his 
“dear guiltiness” and give assured prophecy of his genuine 
love (cf. Raleigh’s Shall I Like a Hermit Dwell?). Portia 
(Merchant of Venice, III, IV) explains her absence from 
home to her servants, while she hastens to save Antonio’s 
life at court, by saying that she had “breathed a secret vow 
to life in prayer and contemplation” in a monastery (? ) 
two miles distant until her husband’s return. Upon her 
return (V, i, 29ff), however, she is attended by a “holy her- 
mit,” which strongly suggests that the monastery—which, 
of course, she really never visits—was really a hermitage, 
some of which undoubtedly had guest rooms for visitors. 
The friendly office of hermits in love affairs is further

suggested in Romeo and Juliet in the very prominent réle 
played in action by Friar Lawrence. True it is that he is 
always referred to as a friar, and in Shakespeare’s source, 
Arthur Brooke’s Romeus and Juliet (1562), he is called “of 
Frauncis order, . . . a fryer as I neede.” His life 
and character in Shakespeare’s work are not inconsistent 
with that of a hermit, for he lives alone and ministers to 
those who seek him as father confessor and protector of 
the weak—two characteristic réles developed in preced- 
ing chapters. It is evident that Brooke, in his poem, does 
intend to make a real distinction; for after the tragic cli- 
max of the action, Lawrence ends his life penitentially for 
his own unhappy part in the action. 
“In . . . an Hermitage, 
TG myles from Veron towne, when he in prayers past forth his age; 
Till that from earth to heaven his heavenly spirte dyd flye: 
Fyve yeres he lived an Hermite, and an Hermite dyd he dye.” 
The hermit, as the approved counselor in love, appears 
again in As You Like It (111, ii, 360ff). When Rosalind 
attempts to “play the knave” with the melancholy lover, 
Orlando, the latter remarks upon the excellent quality of 
her speech “in so removed a dwelling.” To this suspicion 
she replies: “. . . Indeed, an old religious uncle of mine 
(i. e., a hermit) taught me to speak, who was in his youth 
an inland man (i. e., in touch with civilization, cultured), 
one that knew courtship too well, for then he fell in love.” 
The love affair ending disastrously, the uncle became a soli- 
tary, hating all women, but an expert in feminine wiles and 
the symptoms of true love. Rosalind informs him that these 
are “a lean cheek, . . . a blue eye and sunken, 
an unquestionable spirit, . . . beard neglected, 7 
hose ungartered,'74* . . . bonnet unbanded, . . . sleeve 
unbuttoned, . . . shoe untied, andeverything, . . . de- 
noting a careless desolation.” 
Not all of Shakespeare’s hermits, however, are lacking in 
high seriousness. In the same play (V, IV, 166ff) appears 
the one outstanding hermit of his plays in his true religious 
character ; for it is “an old religious man,” or hermit, who 
prevents the usurping Duke Frederick from killing the 
brother whom he had wronged, and proves the reconciling 
agency of the action as a whole by converting him, “both 
from his enterprise and from the world.” This important 
episode does not occur on the stage, and Shakespeare has 
thus suppressed in hurrying to a conclusion a dialogue be- 
tween Frederick and the hermit, and lost, according to Sam- 
‘ef, Hamlet 11 i 77ff for a parallel diagnosis for “the very ecstasy of love.”

in which he might have found matter worthy of his highest 
powers.” 
THE HERMIT IN POETRY 
The great variety of emotions which had been gradually 
gathering around the hermit during the centuries was now 
sufficiently enriched to achieve lyric utterance. The cycle 
of his historical development gave room for both objective 
and subjective treatment. Externally and superficially the 
popular mind saw in the hermit a misguided person, who 
suffered painful and unnecessary physical hardships, and 
the resultant emotion was disapproval and even rebellious 
protest. This view expresses itself characteristically in 
the lyric attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh :17> 
“Shall I like a hermit dwell 
On a rock!76 or in a cell, 
Calling home the smallest part 
That is missing of my heart, 
To bestow it when I may 
Meet a rival every day?” 
A sympathetic and subjective analysis of the hermit, on 
the other hand, produced an emotion which is best charac- 
terized as “the hermit mood.” While it is not easy to define, 
its meaning may be approximated by saying it is a longing 
for that balm which solitude alone can bring for “the thou- 
sand natural shocks that flesh is heir to”—the Psalmist’s 
“OQ-that-I-had-the-wings-of-a-dove” feeling. However one 
may attempt to express it, it is essentially lyric in tone. 
In substance, it consists of a deep disgust for the vanities of 
society and a praise of solitude. The mood, which first be- 
came well defined during the early seventeenth century, may 
be illustrated by a poem of uncertain authorship,'™* entitled 
  
1For note on authorship, see Cayley’s Life of Raleigh, Vol. 1. The burden of the 
song, “If she undervalue me, What care I how fair she be?” 
doubtless inspired the more popular poem by George Wether, Shall I Wasting in De- 
spair? cf. Walter Hamilton’s Collection of Parodies, London, 1889, Vol. IV, p. 257.

the top of a high pillar. See Kingsley’s The Hermits, p. 171ff, and Tennyson’s poem

Printed in Walton’s Complete Angler, p. 316, ed. 1861. It is attributed to Raleigh while a prisoner in the tower a short time before his execution, 1618, and also to Sir 
Henry Wotton. The last stanza, beginning, “Welcome, pure thoughts,” says a foot- note, “seems hardly consistent with the situation of Sir Walter Raleigh, though it may 
not inaptly apply to the happy retreat of Sir Henry Wotton, at Eton, after a life of great experience in court intrigue, falsehood, and disappointment.”

122, The Hermit in English Literature 
A Farewell to the Vanities of the World. A few excerpts 
will show its nature sufficiently : 
“Farewell, ye gilded follies, pleasing troubles; 
Farewell, ye honored rags, ye glorious bubbles. 
Fame, honor, beauty, state, train, blood, and birth 
Are but the fading blossoms of the earth. 
“Welcome, pure thoughts; welcome, ye silent groves. 
These guests, these courts, my soul most dearly loves: 
A pray’r book now shall be my looking-glass, 
In which I will adore sweet Virtue’s face. 
Here dwell no hateful looks, no palace cares, 
No broken-vows dwell here, nor pale-faced friars; 
Then here I’ll sit and sigh my hot love’s folly, 
And learn to affect an holy melancholy; 
And if contentment be a stranger then, 
I'll ne’er look for it, but in heaven again.” 
The hermit’s enjoyment of solitude is expressed in the 
last stanza of To Althea, From Prison, by Richard Lovelace 
(1618-1658) : 
“Stone walls do not a prison make, 
Nor iron bars a cage; 
Minds innocent and quiet take 
That for an hermitage.”178 
Milton’s expression of the mood is remindful of the hermit 
as the ideal penitent in the romances of chivalry and the 
philosopher combined in the closing lines of Jl Penseroso 
(1630), ll, 167ff: 
“And may at last my weary age 
Find out the peaceful hermitage, 
The hairy gown and mossy cell, 
When I may sit and rightly spell 
Of every star that heaven doth shew, 
And every herb that sips the dew, 
Till old experience do attain 
To something like prophetic strain.” 
  
“SA palpable imitation of this sentiment appears in a poem entitled Loyalty Con- 
fined, written, according to tradition, by Sir Roger L’Estrange (d. 1704), ll 7-12: 
“That which the world miscalls a jail 
A private closet is to me, 
Whilst a good conscience is my bail 
And innocence my liberty. 
Locks, bars, and solitude, together met, 
Make me no prisoner, but an anchoret.” 
Il 61-66: 
“Have you not seen the nightingale, 
A prisoner like, in her cage? 
How doth she chaunt her wonted tale 
In that her narrow hermitage! 
Even then her charming melody doth prove 
That all her bars are trees, her cage a grove.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
The Hermit in English Literature 123 
In Izaak Walton’s Compleat Angler the hermit mood again 
finds expression in a song inserted in the opening of the 
Fourth Day’s account in the third edition, 1664. It bears 
evidence of having been composed by Walton himself, and 
was twice set to music—once by Nicholas Laneare, an emi- 
nent musician of Walton’s time, printed with notes in a 
folio collection, entitled Select Musical Ayres and Dialogues, 
1653, and again by Sig. Alfonso Ferabosco, and likewise 
published in a collection of his airs, 1689. It consists of 
three stanzas, which are here quoted in full, with the excep- 
tion of the refrain, which is the same throughout: 
“Like hermit poor in pensive place obscure 
I mean to spend my days of endless doubt, 
To wait such woes as Time cannot recure 
When none but love shall ever find me out, 
And at my gates, and at my gates, despair shall linger still; 
To let in death, to let in death, when love and fortune will. 
“A gown of gray my body shall attire. 
My staff of broken hope whereon I’ll stay, 
Of late repentance linkt with long desire, 
The couch is fram’d whereon my limbs I lay. 
And at my gates, ete. 
“My food shall be of care and sorrow made, 
My drink nought else but tears fall’n from mine eyes, 
And for my light in this obscure shade 
The flames may serve which from my heart arise.” 
Whether it was due to its musical setting, its sentiment, 
or both, the poem became such a popular favorite that the 
first three words of the opening lines became a familiar 
phrase among writers after the Restoration. Among the 
poems of Phineas Fletcher, a note preceding a metrical par- 
aphrase of Psalm X, 11, informs the reader that it may be 
sung to the tune of Like Hermit Poor. In North’s Life of 
Lord Reeper Guilford he states that once when Sir Job 
Charlton, then Chief Justice of Chester, wished to speak 
to the King at Whitehall, finding His Majesty gone for a 
walk in St. James, he found a place where the King must 
pass and “sat him down ‘like hermit poor.’” Butler, in his 
Hudibras, quotes the whole first line in Part 1, canto ii: 
“That done they ope the trap door gate, 
And let Crowdero down thereat; 
Crowdero making doleful face, 
‘Like hermit poor in pensive place.’ ” 
One other lyric of similar nature, The Retirement, by 
Charles Cotton, though printed several years later than the 
close of this study, may be mentioned to show the growth  
-P-A-G-E-122
  124 The Hermit in English Literature 
of “the hermit mood” and the increasing popularity among 
the English writers of solitude as a poetic theme. The 
poem, which appeared in the second part of the Compleat 
Angler, written by Cotton, in the fifth edition, 1676, is writ- 
ten in irregular stanzas and is addressed to Mr. Izaak Wal- 
ton. The first and fourth stanzas are highly characteristic. 
“Farewell, thou busy world! And may 
We never meet again. 
Here I can eat and sleep and pray, 
And do more good in one. short day179 
Than he who his whole age outwears 
Upon the most conspicuous theatres, 
Where nought but vanity and vise do reign. 
“Dear Solitude, the soul’s best friend 
That man acquainted with himself doth make, 
And all his Maker’s wonders to entend, 
With thee I here converse at will, 
And would be glad to do so still, 
For it is thou alone, that keep’st the soul awake.” 
The evidence adduced in these quotations shows strik- 
ingly how strong has been the hermit’s influence in the de- 
velopment of a profound interest in solitude. In the follow- 
ing century this interest reached its culmination as one im- 
portant phase of romanticism—an unmistakable proof that 
the English people had permanently assimilated the hermit 
ideal as a part of their national character. To trace this 
effect in detail, however inviting, lies beyond the boundaries 
of the present investigation, though a few of its most prom- 
inent aspects may be broadly indicated. 
Along with a deepening interest in solitude, there devel- 
oped, as a part of the romantic revival, a remarkable inter- 
est in the Middle Ages about 1760. It is significant that 
neither the knight nor the monk was revived at the time; 
but, on the other hand, “‘the first peculiarly medieval type 
that contrived to secure a foothold in eighteenth-century 
literature was the hermit—a figure which seems to have had 
a national attraction, not only for romanticizing poets like 
Shenstone and Collins, but for the whole generation of verse 
writers, from Parnell to Goldsmith, Percy, and Beattie, each 
of whom composed a Hermit, and even for the authors of 
Rasselas and Tom Jones, in whose fictions he becomes a 
stock character, as a fountain of wisdom and of moral pre- 
cepts.18° The hermit-philosopher is revived in Beattie’s 
  
17°The same thought in almost the same language appears in Richard Rolle’s De 
Solitaria Vita (Form of Living, Cap. 2-4f 46). See Horstmann’s edition of Richard 
Rolle of Hampole and His Followers, London, 1895, Vol. 1, p. 419.

The Hermit in English Literature 125 
Minstrel, the purpose of which is to “trace the progress 
of a poetical genius born in a rude age” in the person of a 
young shepherd, named “Edwin,” who “lived in Gothic 
days.” In the course of his wanderings on mountains and 
in solitudes he is taught history, science, philosophy, and 
even Vergil, by an ancient hermit, “who sits on a mossy 
rock, with his harp beside him,” during his lectures. “The 
subject of the poem, indeed, is properly the education of na- 
ture; and in a way it anticipates Wordsworth’s Prelude, as 
this hoary sage does the Solitary of The Excursion.’”181 
This renaissance of the hermit in literature was really the 
result of two causes, the revival of Gothic architecture and 
the development of English landscape gardening, in both 
of which the hermit figured more or less prominently. In 
the general reaction against the formalism and artificiality 
of the vogue of French landscape gardening, “enthusiasm 
for Nature increased and feeling was set free from restraint 
by the growing sentimentality. Richardson’s novels fed the 
taste for weeping sensibility, and garden craft fell under its 
sway.’’1S2 
In consequence, “gardens with temples to friendship and 
love, melancholy, virtue, reunion, and death . . . were 
suitable backgrounds for the scenes described in the English 
novels and for the idyllic poets and moonshine singers of 
Germany. Hence, it was the fashion to wander tenderly 
intertwined, shedding floods of tears and exchanging kisses 
and pausing at various places to read the inscriptions which 
directed them what to feel. At one spot they were to laugh, 
at another to weep, at a third to be fired with devotion. 
3 Hermitages sprang up everywhere with hermits 
real or dummy. Any good house near a wood, or in a shady 
position, was called a ‘hermitage,’ and dedicated (with an 
inscription) to Arcadian life, free from care and ceremony.” 
The qualifications for these sentimental hermits were ‘vis- 
ual. however, rather than real. “Archibald Hamilton, after- 
wards Duke of Hamilton (ninth Duke of Hamilton), 
advertised for a ‘hermit’ as an ornament to his pleasure 
grounds; and it was stipulated that the said hermit should 
have his beard shaved but once a year, and that only par- 
tially.”183 
The straw hermit, however, seems to have met with more 
general approval. “Visiting the grounds at Hawkestone. 
two and forty years ago (i. e., 1810), the hermitage was 
shown with a stuffed figure, dressed like the hermit of pic-   
e qeebid, p. 304.

tures seen by a dim light; and the visitors were told that it 
had been inhabited in the daytime by a poor man, to whom 
the eccentric, but truly benevolent, Sir Richard Hill, gave 
a maintenance on that easy condition; but the popular voice 
against such slavery had induced the worthy baronet to 
withdraw the reality and substitute the figure.’’!+ 
An interesting contemporary statement, showing the rela- 
tion of the hermit to the Gothic revival, appears in An 
Eighteenth Century Correspondence (edited by Lilian Dick- 
ens and May Stanton, N. Y., 1910): “ . . . There was 
growing that stilted and affected romanticism which aped 
rural simplicity in its Daphnes and Chloes, and found in- 
spiration for its artificial verse in the grottoes and rustic 
seats, from which they rejoiced to gaze on artificial ruins. 
The seats, the grottoes . . . were often classical; but 
the ruins were ‘Gothic’ and esteemed suitable ‘objects’ to 
enhance and complete the beauty of a ‘fine prospect.’ 
“In 1744 Miller had built his thatched cottage on the sum- 
mit of Edgehill: This was intended as a sylvan retreat, 
and the lines inscribed to it by the Reverend James Merrick 
are characteristic of much similar sentimental verse of the 
period. The following is the last stanza: 
‘Within this solitary cell 
Calm thoughts and sweet contentment dwell, 
Parents of bliss sincere; 
Peace spreads around her balmy wings, 
And, banished from the court of kings, 
Has fixed her mansion here.’ 
The cottage . .°. is interesting as a specimen of Mil- 
ler’s first attempts in the ‘Gothic style,’ and compares very 
favorably with some of his later work.’’!8* 
This artistic fad grew by leaps and bounds until its ab- 
surdities became the proper subject for ridicule. In the 
fifteenth number of The World, April 12, 1753, a Mr. 
Coventrye writes the following amusing satire: “Squire 
Mushroon grew ambitious of introducing himself to the 
world as a man of taste and pleasure, for which purpose 
he resolved to have a villa. Full of this pleasing idea, 
he purchased an old farmhouse, . . . and fell to build-

The enthusiasm for Gothie architecture, including the 
building of hermitages, was by no means dampened by the 
satire, but, on the other hand, continued a phenomenal 
growth. In 1767, William Wright, architect, brought out 
a work entitled Grotesque Architecture, or Rural Amuse- 
ments, “giving plans and specifications for building ‘huts,’ 
retreats, summer and winter hermitages, . . . many of 
which may be executed with flints, irregular stones, rude 
branches and roots of trees. There are seven different 
plans, with illustrations showing the various styles of her- 
mitages. Plan VII is typical: “Plan and elevation of an 
hermitage in the Augustine Stile; the front is ornamented 
with a Portico of Palm Trees; in the Pediment is a Scull 
and a Tablet with an Inscription. A.A. are Passages of 
evergreens leading to the two circular Retreats, one of which 
is intended as a Library and the other a Bath; the Tops of 
them are intended to be thatched; bbb are nitches for seats 
cut in the Evergreens. The Design is calculated to be built 
on asmall verdant Amphitheatre near a murmuring Stream, 
and as a proper Retreat from the Fatigues of a Sultry Day 
(Dim. of Hermitage 25x20 ft.; distance of circular retreats 
apart 80 ft.).” 
The practice of writing appropriate inscriptions for these 
and other hermitages became enormously popular. The 
vogue likewise continued into the nineteenth century, and 
the authors include such well-known poets as Shenstone,18¢ 
Thomas Warton,!8? Mrs. Hemans,!8s and Wordsworth.

CHAPTER V 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOLITUDE, OR THE HER- 
MIT’S CONTRIBUTION TO LITERA- 
TURE AND LIFE 
The evolution of the hermit in English literature has led 
us to recognize three distinct stages of development, which 
we characterize as (1) the religious, including all saints’ 
legends and pious tales; (2) the semi-religious, or social, 
including the hermit in social-service réles in the romances 
of chivalry; and (8) the unreligious, including the hermit 
in the variable capacity of philosopher in the literature 
from 1500-1660. These three categories embrace approxi- 
mately all the various rdles that the hermit has played and 
continues to play in English literature. 
Viewed philosophically, the influence of the hermit in 
English literature has been to focus attention upon the thing 
for which he stood—solitude—for the hermit and solitude 
are inseparable entities.'°1 Our study would be incomplete, 
therefore, if it did not undertake at least a discursive analy- 
sis of the hermit mood and the place of solitude in the philos- 
ophy of life.1°2 The present discussion will only undertake 
to examine the subject briefly under the following heads: 
(1) the meaning of solitude; (2) the motives leading to soli- 
tude; and (3) the effect of solitude on the individual. . 
A definition of solitude presents certain obvious difficul- 
ties. Bacon, in his essay entitled Of Friendship, says: 
“But little do men perceive what solitude is and how far it 
extendeth. For a crowd is not company; and faces are but 
a gallery of pictures; and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where 
there is no love.” A Greek maxim declares, “The great city 
is a great desert;” and the same thought is similarly re- 
echoed in Latin: ‘Magna civitas, magna solitudo.” Vau-   
  
10 closely, indeed, was the hermit and solitude associated in the popular mind 
that even his dwelling place became synonymous with solitude, and vice versa. Fos- broke (British Monachism, p. 382, MS. Paris, 993) writes: “‘A sequestered situation 
was an essential characteristic, for we are told that Chetwood in Buckinghamshire 
was called a ‘hermitage’ purely on account of its solitude, though no hermit ever occu- pied the spot.” cf. also Andrew Jackson’s home, called “The Hermitage,” near Nash- ville, Tenn. 82The subject is, of course, entirely too broad for any thoroughgoing analysis. A comprehensive treatment is implied, at least, in a Harvard doctor’s dissertation, enti- 
tled Moral Solitude in English Literature; but all efforts to examine it have proved so 
far unavailing, The active versus the contemplative life is a world-old controversy. Aristotle, in his Ethics X, 7, 1, deglares the summum bonum—i. e., the highest. hap- piness—to consist in speculation or contemplation, and this view has been approved 
by some in every succeeding age. cf. A Moral Essay Preferring Solitude to Public Employment, by Sir George Mackenzie, 1665, and the subsequent literary controversy between Evelyn, the Bishop of Asaph, and Cowper; also Essay on an Active and a Contemplative Life, by Edward, Earl of Clarendon, London, 1727.

130 The Hermit in English Literature 
venargues avows, “La solitude est a’ l’esprit ce que la diete 
est au corps;” and Gresset (Sidnei, Act II, Scene II) writes: 
“L’homme sense’ qu’ au monde attache sa naissance, 
Sans quitter ses devairs, sans changer de se’jour, 
Peut vivre solitaire au milieu de la cour.” 
Gibbon boldly declares (Memoirs, Vol. I, p. 117): “I was 
never less alone than when by myself.” Joseph Roux 
(Meditations of a Parish Priest, The Country, No. 48) as- 
serts: “The city does not take away, neither does the coun- 
try give, solitude; solitude is within us.” 
From these various views it is quite evident that mere 
isolation does not of itself constitute solitude; nor, on the 
other hand, does a multitude of human associates necessarily 
destroy it. Solitude is nothing more nor less than a state 
of mind “in which the soul abandons itself to its own reflec- 
tions,” and “consists in the enjoyment of actual retirement 
and perfect tranquillity, or only in a banishment of the rec- 
ollection of all surrounding objects.’!93 With subjectivity 
thus established as the only sine qua non, “the hermit mood” 
treated at the close of the last chapter presents us with the 
most perfect and most universal illustration of solitude. 
The motives to solitude may be reduced to simply two, a 
negative and a positive. -Negatively, the desire for solitude 
is merely to escape, even temporarily, as usual in “the her- 
mit mood,” a present difficulty, an unpleasant psychological 
“complex” which we feel too weak, at least for the time be- 
ing, to resolve. Positively motivated, solitude becomes a 
trysting place, in which the soul may either develop strat- 
egy for future conquests or actually engage in desperate 
conflict with one’s inner foes. 
This classification of motives is not made dogmatically, 
but rather in the interest of a more scientific study on the 
part of psychologists and sociologists, who have hitherto 
ventured but little into the field. McDougall (Social Psy- 
chology, Boston, 1921) makes gregariousness an instinct, 
but adds (p. 88): “The gregarious instinct is no exception 
to the rule that human instincts are liable to a morbid hyper- 
trophy under which their emotions and impulses are re- 
vealed with exaggerated intensity. The.condition known to 
alienists as ‘agoraphobia’ seems to result from the morbidly 
intense working of this instinct—the patient will not remain 
alone, will not cross a wide, empty space, and seeks always 
to be surrounded by other human beings.” The hermit in 
his solitude seems to be neither anti-social nor unsocial'**

  The Hermit in English Literature 1381 
(cf. his benign fellowship with his animal neighbors) ; but 
having willfully chosen an environment in which objective 
human associations are almost entirely absent and the prim- 
itive forces of nature most powerfully exalted, he achieves 
an environment most consistent with his biologic and meta- 
bolic requirements. In other words, he has enlarged his 
personality in solitude to include all nature, not merely hu- 
man nature; or, to put it otherwise, he personifies the ele- 
ments of his environment, the forces of nature; and thus 
peoples his solitude with associates, including deceased 
saints and divinity, most congenial to his spiritual being. 
In this way his ideational experiences tend to assume a mys- 
tical and, from the average human point of view, an unreal 
nature. : 
Popular opinion, with its usual lack of sympathy toward 
. whatever it does not understand, has generally attributed 
to the hermit only the negative motive of recognized weak- 
ness. In this respect Samuel Johnson’s view!®> may be re- 
garded as typical, for he approved of retiring from the 
world only for ‘those who cannot resist temptations and 
find that they make themselves worse by being in the world.” 
If we may accept the evidence, however, of those who have 
studied hermit life most closely, the motives of the religious 
solitary have been grossly misrepresented. 
“The hermits have been stigmatized as weak and morbid 
persons, who sought retirement in order to avoid the strug- 
gles of life; but, in truth, the very object of the true solitary 
when he set his face toward the wilderness was to enter into 
fierce conflict with the tempter. ‘The fiend tempteth much 
those who lead a solitary life, for envy that he beareth 
them. But he is there always overcome. For our Lord 
himself standeth by them in the fight, and emboldeneth them 
to resist strongly, and giveth them of his strength.’ ” 
“The desert . . . was a place for combat and con- 
quest—not ‘a retreat for the feeble, but a training place for 
the strong.’ So terrible was the warfare, that raw recruits 
were not permitted to engage in it; they had first to prove 
themselves disciplined soldiers of Christ.” 
St. Benedict, himself an anchorite, ordains thus in his 
rule: “The second kind (of monks) are hermits—that is, 
settlers in the wilds, who, not in the first fervor of religious 
life, but after probation in the monastery, have learned by 
the help and experience of others to fight against the devil,   
1%See Boswell’s Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (ed. Percy Fitzgerald), N. Y., 
1897, p. 550. With strange inconsistency, in the same Journal he remarks, “I never 
read of a hermit, but in imagination I kiss his feet,” and even says, “I have thought 
of retiring and have talked of it to a friend, but I find my vocation is rather to active 
afer”
-P-A-G-E-130

and, going forth well armed from the ranks of their brethren 
to the single-handed combat of the wilderness, are able with- 
out the support of others to fight by the strength of their 
own arm and the help of God against the vices of the devil 
and their evil thoughts.”19° 
The effect of solitude on the individual is likewise two- 
fold—baneful and beneficial. ‘The great evil of solitude,” 
says Vicissimus Knox,!%7 “is that reason becomes weak for 
want of exercise, while the powers of the imagination are 
invigorated by indulgence.” The hermits themselves rec- 
ognized .and were warned against this error as a carefully 
laid snare of the devil. The author of the Ancren Riwle'®’ 
specifically warns against such delusions: “Account no 
vision that ye may see, waking or sleeping or in a dream, 
to be anything but an illusion; for it is only one of his strat- 
agems. He hath often thus deceived wise men of holy and , 
pious life. . . .” To prevent this insidious error on the 
part of the religious solitary, the rules governing -solitaries 
- generally encouraged companionship on the ground that 
“to live entirely apart from human converse was positively 
dangerous to the soul.’” 
On the other hand, the benefits and joys of solitude are 
praised most highly. Richard Rolle of Hampole, hermit 
and mystic (cir. 1300-1349), has written most fully on this 
subject :199 ““Wha-so forsakis /e solace & Se ioie of fis werld/ 
& takis him to solitarie life/ til suffire for goddis luf & 
noyes: i trow /at se comfort of Ihesu Crist/ & swetenes of 
his lufe/ with #e fire of /e holi gast fat purgis al syn: sal 
be ledand him & lerand how he sal thinke & praie & wirke; 
so /at in a fone zeres: he sal have more delite to be al one, 
& speke til his lord Ihesu: /en if he ware lord of a thousand 
werldis. Men wenes /at /e solitari is in grete pyne & 
penance; bot he has more ioie & mare verrai delite in a dai: 
sen men of fe werld haves al faire lif-tyme. /ai sée oure 
bodi with-oute: bot fai see noght oure hert/ whare al oure 
solace is; if Jai sagh /at: mani of /aim wold forsake al /at 
fai had & folugh vs.”’ 
A middle-view, that of occasional solitude, yet remains 
to be considered. This is the view of Milton in Paradise 
Lost, Book IX, 1 249-250: 
“For solitude is sometimes best society, 
And short retirement urges sweet return.”

The Hermit in English Literature 133 
This view finds general approval among English and also 
American writers,2°° and the arguments are, for the most 
part, identical. The ‘excessive and indiscriminate love of 
company and an abhorrence of occasional solitude” is a 
weakness?*! which renders the mind ‘‘base and mean enough 
to submit to any neglect, coolness, or contempt,” and “is 
the cause and consequence of a feverish and restless state, 
totally inconsistent with solid comfort and rational enjoy- 
ment.”202 
The same philosophy is expressed by the great English 
poet of solitude, Wordsworth: 
“The world is too much with us: late and soon, ° 
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers; 
Little we see in Nature that is ours; 
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! 
This Sea, that bares her bosom to the moon; 
The winds that will be howling at all hours, 
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; 
For this, for everything, we are out of tune; 
It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be 
A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn; 
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, 
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; 
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea 
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathéd horn.” 
The curative power of nature for all our social ills is 
clearly implied in this philosophy of solitude, which we owe, 
in part, if not originally in its entirety, to the hermit; for it 
was he who first braved the wild solitary places and taught 
uncouth, barbarous, and superstitious men the secret of a 
calm inner life in the presence of undisturbed nature. This 
view is variously expressed in the works of William Drum- 
mond of Hawthornden, Walton, Cotton, Cowley, Landor, and 
Wordsworth in English literature; and by Bryant, Emer- . 
son, and Thoreau in American literature. A simple illus- 
tration may be offered from Cotton’s Retirement (stanza 
VIII) : 
) “Oh, my beloved rocks! that rise 
To awe the earth and brave the skies: 
How oft when grief has made me fly 
To hide me from society, 
Ev’n from my dearest friends have I 
In your recesses’ friendly shade 
All my sorrows open laid, 
And my most secret woes, entrusted to your privacy.”   
2See Emerson’s Society and ‘Solitude ‘(Riverside Press), 1904, p. 3ff. In_ his 
Journal, 1835, he writes: “Society nowadays makes us low-spirited, hopeless; above 
is heaven.”

  134 The Hermit in English Literature 
In similar vein, but in more homely language, Emerson 
writes in his lecture called Country Life (1857) : “The place 
where a thoughtful man in the country feels the joy of emi- 
nent domain is his wood-lot. If he suffer from accident or 
low spirits, his spirits rise when he enters it. . . . A 
walk in the woods.is the consolation of mortal men. ‘I think 
no pursuit has more breath of immortality in it.” 
The true mystic solitude has, however, a deeper meaning, 
as shown in Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey (ll 23-49) : 
“These beauteous forms 
Through a long absence, have not been to me 
As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye: 
But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din 
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them 
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, 
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; 
And passing even into my purer mind, 
With tranquil restoration. 
“Nor less I trust 
To them I may have owed another gift 
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, 
In which the burden of the mystery, 
In which the heavy and the weary weight, 
Of all this unintelligible world, 
Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, 
In which the affections gently lead us on,— 
Until the breath of this corporeal frame, 
And even the motion of our human blood, 
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep 
In body and become a living soul: 
While with an eye made quiet by the power 
Of harmony and the deep power of joy, 
We see into the life of things.” 
This experience is somewhat paralleled in the mystical 
experiences leading to ecstasy as described by several mys- 
tic saints. One of the best accounts is given by St. Teresa 
(Vie de Sainte Therese ecute par elle-meme, tr. by Rev. 
Father Bouix, tenth edition, pp. 90, 91, 96, 138, 142, 157, 
177-180). She describes her physical state during her 
“rapture” as follows (p. 206): “Often my body became so 
light that it no longer possessed weight’; sometimes it was 
so to such a point that I no more felt my feet touching the 
ground. So long as the body is in the rapture, it remains 
as if dead, and.often is absolutely powerless to act. It pre- 
serves the attitude in which it has been surprised; thus it 
remains standing or seated, the hahds opened or closed— 
in a word, in the state in which it was overtaken by the rap- 
ture. Although’ ordinarily one does not lose feeling, it has
-P-A-G-E-133
  The Hermit in English Literature 135 
happened to me, however, to be entirely deprived of it. 
This has been rare and has lasted only a very short time. 
Most frequently’ feeling remains; but one experiences an 
indefinable tremble, and although it is impossible to perform 
any external act, one does not cease to hear; it is like a 
confused sound coming from a distance. Moreover, this 
kind of hearing ceases when the rapture is at its highest 
degree.” 
Certainly the hermit gave a new and deeper meaning to 
solitude in-literature and life, and along with it a deeper 
knowledge of our inner nature. If his ‘great experiment 
was, indeed, a failure as a philosophy of life, as many hold, 
it has, nevertheless, been productive of a deeper and subtler 
self-analysis and a more complete perspective of.the mystery 
of our human existence. Few are able to enjoy solitude to 
the fullest degree, because they lack that self-sufficiency of 
mind and character which is essential to solitary life; but 
for these, the fortunate few, it is the true swmmum bonum. 
In concluding his account of his hermit life at Walden 
Pond, a nineteenth-century lover of philosophic solitude? 
writes: “I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if 
one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and 
endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will 
meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will 
put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; 
new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to estab- 
lish themselves around and within him, or the old laws be 
expanded and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal 
sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of 
beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of 
the Universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not 
be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. 
if you have built castles in the air, your work need not be 
lost; that is where they should be. Now put the founda- 
tions under them.” ‘ 
“The groves were God’s first temples,” says Bryant. The 
hermit in the forest solitudes not only found God, but 
achieved that ideal spiritual unity for which his soul longed, 
and somehow united for the rest of mankind love of nature 
‘with love of God. Vicariously he has bequeathed to man- | 
kind his own mystic experience in “the hermit mood”—a 
legacy rich with emotional possibilities which finds peren- 
nial expression in both literature and life with fuller power 
because of his great experiment in the art of living. He

  136 The Hermit in English Literature 
has invested life with a deeper meaning, which of late years 
has not been more beautifully expressed than in Katherine 
Lee Bates’ Church of Pointed Firs: 
“Dull clang that hurts this dreamy air, 
Forgive me if I turn 
From you to little bells, of dew 
Upon the forest fern. 
“More lightly may I lift my prayer 
Beneath these pointed firs, 
Imbued with simple sanctitude 
By woodland worshipers. 
“TI love the liberty they wear, 
Those green soft-chanting spires, 
That hush to hear the hermit thrush 
Voice earth’s divine desires. 
“Broken by grief, I cannot bear 
The ministry of words; 
Content to taste the sacrament 
Of winds and leaves and birds.”
